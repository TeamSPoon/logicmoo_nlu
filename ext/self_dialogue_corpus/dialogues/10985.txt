Do you want to go to the Pens game tomorrow?
Why? Do you have tickets?
Yes, I just won them on the radio.
That's so cool. Where are they in the stands?
Directly behind the goal.
Awesome, I love sitting there and heckling the opposing goalie.
Me too. That's my favorite part of hockey games.
Who are the Penguins playing tomorrow?
The Capitols, I'm pretty sure.
That'll be fun! Who has the better record going in?
I believe the Penguins do.
Who has a better head-to-head record?
The Capitols lead by one, I think.
Oh, good. It should be a close game.
Yay, it should be exciting!
Most definitely- I'm really looking forward to it.
Me too! What time is the puck drop?
7 o'clock so we'll probably leave here at 5:30.
Ok, yay! This will be a lot of fun- I'm going to go get changed into my Crosby jersey!
Sounds good! I'll put my Pens apparel on too!
