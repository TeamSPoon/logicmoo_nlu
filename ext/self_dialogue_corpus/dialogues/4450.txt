Did you ever see The Talented Mr. Ripley?
Not sure. Who's in it?
Matt Damon is the lead.
What is it about?
It's kind of hard to explain.
Give it a try.
This kid infiltrates this group of high society types and starts manipulating them.
Oh, yeah. Very weird.
Probably some of Damon's best work.
He was a great sociopath!
