Have you seen any good comedies lately?
I did!  I just went with my friends to see Baywatch the other day.
That's the one with Zac Efron and The Rock right?
It is.  Those two are really great together on the screen.
I bet.  They're both very funny.
I also recently saw Sisters with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
I love those girls!  They were great in Mean Girls.
Tina Fey is so funny.  I love all of her movies.
I think Amy Poehler is even more funny.  Did you see her in House Bunny?
I did.  I thought she was even better in Sisters though.
