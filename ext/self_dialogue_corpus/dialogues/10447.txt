Hi, how have you been?
Fine thanks
What about you?
I´m on vacations, so I´m watching a lot of movies
Wich ones have you seen so far
The Excorcist, all Harry Potter´s movies, Lord of the rings, each and every one
wow, good taste
yeah I have been busy
well, I have been busy too
I´ve been watching all The God Father´s movies
those are quite old
I know but I really enjoy watching Marlon Brandon performance
I´ve never seen those movies
You should, now that you have the time
I´m not really into those type of movies
so what other movies are you planning to watch
well I am going to change category, I will start watchin comedy
You should watch all JIm Carrey's  movies the
I agree
