I can't stop listening to Meatloaf lately.
Like... the food?
No, Meatloaf, he is a singer from the 80's and 90's.
Oh, I have never heard of him.
You should really listen to some of his stuff, if you like classic rock or songs that tell a story, you'd probably love him.
Well that does sound good.
It is, each song of his will take you on a journey for about 5 minutes or so.
Oh, you were not kidding about it telling a story, that is pretty long for a song.
Yeah, that is actually on the shorter side for some of his things.
Oh wow.
Bonus points if you watch the videos for them. They generally add a lot to the experience.
Music videos are a bit of a lost art form.
I agree. I'd definitely recommend checking out his works like "Bat out of Hell" and "I Would Do Anything For Love"
Will do.
The song that really got me listening to him was Paradise by the Dashboard lights though.
Oh? What is it about?
It is one of those stories of young love, and then turning into spiteful love at the end in a goofy turn. I love it.
Hah... that sounds like a fun listen too.
It is, Any of his albums are a good listen too.
Thanks, I will check into him.
