One time I turned on the radio and the most awful song started playing.
Who was it? Do you know?
I think it was maybe Nickelback.
So I take it you're not a fan of them?
Not entirely, no.
So who do you really like then? What artists are your favorite?
That's such a tough question. I love literally all genres of music.
What do you listen to the most?
It varies. Sometimes I'll just have a favorite song I play over and over.
I do that on occasion.
What is your current favorite song?
I really like "Heathen" by Twenty One Pilots.
I think all of their music is awesome.
Yes it is! They have such amazing lyrics and voices.
I completely agree.
If I had to choose one artist to listen to for ages, it would be them.
Who else do you like?
Let me think. Oh I know, actually I love Fallout Boy.
Which of their songs?
I would have to say "Uma Thurman."
