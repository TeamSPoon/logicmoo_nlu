The boys and I are trying to figure out what to watch tonight. I miss the good old family movies, like you could watch on Sunday night by Disney.
Oh, forgot about that, it was called "Wonderful World of Disney" I looked forward to it all week. What was your favorite Disney movie?
One of my favorites was a really old one.. "Swiss Family Robinson"
We watched that one too! We always said we wished we would get shipwrecked so we could live like them.
And the parent trap! We loved that one. Good old fashioned stuff you didn't have to worry about watching with your kids.
Yeah, Disney has done alot of good family movies. Toy Story will always be my favorite.
Yes, I think we've watched all 3 a zillion times.
Although Inside Out comes close. It was so funny and real.
Yeah, we loved that one too.  I heard they are doing an Incredibles 2. That would be so cool.
No way! I love that one!
