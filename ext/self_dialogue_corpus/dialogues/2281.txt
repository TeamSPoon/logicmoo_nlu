How do you think the Lions are going to do this year?
I don't know... last year was so weird.
Stafford is getting older now too
And they lost Megatron...they will probably go 8-8
You think so? I have them at a perfect season again, 0-16.
oh- come on.They won't be that bad. You should at least have them at 4-12
Right. But, you know, they are totally going to lose against Green Bay.
Right, but, c'mon, they can beat the Bears.... maybe not the Vikings.
Well... alright, I'll give you the Bears. who do you think will be #1 in the nfc North?
I think it is going to be Green Bay again
Yeah.. me too. They were doing so badly last year and had to screw it up and win
I don't care if the Lions are losing, but when Green Bay is losing, it really makes my weekend.
Who is going to win it all?
I think the Patriots. I know, LOL, a boring guess.
I think it is going to be the Browns
What?no way! they can't beat an elementary school girl scout football team!
I know... I was kidding... I really hope that Green Bay doesn't get in
Who do you think will be the best quaterback
That kid from the Cowboys... I forgot his name
Me, too
