Hey man who is the best quarterback to play in the NFL
Oh that's easy, Joe Montana. No question!
Dude where have you been? Tom Brady is way better than him!
Well, he has more Superbowl wins, but is he really better?
Yeah, with winning Superbowl 51 he has the most Superbowl wins....it is the Superbowl!
Yeah, the most wins don't make you the best. He deflated his balls so....
Dude that's not cheating, he just thought of it!
Yeah, but how can you beat 40,551 career passing yards? Joe Montana is the man!
Yeah that is impressive but I still think Brady is the best.
Well, if it's not all about Superbowls, you have to count John Elway. He had 51,000 total passing yards.
Really? That many? I don't think he won any Superbowls, did he?
No, he won 2.
Hmmmm...but Brady has been in the league as a quarterback. Longer than anyone.
You have Brady bro crush!
Of course, he's a role model and has a model a model for a wife.
Yeah but there are so many other great quarterbacks. What about Dan Marino? Brett Favre? Peyton Manning?
Yeah Brett Favre was pretty good. Wasn't he the quarterback for the Packers when they were good?
Yeah, he dominated. 71,838 total yards.....even though he only had one Superbowl.
Dang! He was a beast!
Yeah, he was really good. He just didn't make to the Superbowl. The Superbowl is not the end all.
