Have you ever given much thought as to what some of The Beatles songs mean?
Oh yes.  One of my favorites is Hey Jude -- A song Paul wrote for John Lennon's young son.
How did Paul come to write this song for Julian Lennon?  What do you think it means?
When John was leaving Julian's mother for Yoko Ono, the story goes that Paul wanted Julian to take it easy and try to get along with Yoko.
I Am The Walrus is a strange song by The Beatles.  Any idea what they are referring to with this song?
John Lennon wrote that song and I think he intentionally made it strange. I know the Walrus part refers to a Lewis Carroll poem.
Helter Skelter is a favorite although I have no real idea what it means.
For me personally, I think they are referring to a confusing relationship or situation in life. Everything became so frustrating for them.
What do you think they are referring to in The Long and Winding Road?  Is it sentimental to you?
Very sentimental!  I think it refers to their longevity.  Their music will live forever and never be forgotten.
