What are you thoughts on harry potter films?
I love them like most people.
Do you have a favorite or most disliked character?
I admired Hermione Granger most.  I disliked malfoy most until he somewhat redeemed himself by the last film.
Ya then Malfoy's father was really the one to dislike. Hermione was a great character.
I guess they had a big open casting call and emma watson went and won the part.
Ya it would not have been the same without her.
Also saw an interview with Emma, they had a clip of ron, harry and hermione scene and she is mouthing the other's lines.
That is really funny. Must have been the first film.
It may have been a test schot even. But ya I guess Emma was just so excited to be in and knew all the lines for everyone!
