Last night a pregnant Beyonce was out wearing the new Gucci duster.
Yes it apart of the 2017 spring line
The duster was paisley, silk and on a green background
She paired it with jeans and a white tee
Beyonce style staple it the white tee, jeans, and heels.
Even while pregnant she does not stray away from this style statement
Her daughter Blue was also seen wearing a spring Gucci dress
It was green and matched her mothers perfectly
They have both been spotted wearing a lot of Gucci lately
They even have custom Gucci tour jackets that match
It is good to see that pregnancy has not deterred her from having great style
It hasn't deterred her from wearing her statement high heels either.
Her Ferragamo dress from her latest date was simple chic
It was the ultimate little black dress.
She paired is with thigh high boots
It really tied the outfit together
There is something so classic about the little black dress
It is a piece that will never go out of style
She paired her dress with a pair of Tom Ford glasses.
The Tom Ford were the perfect pair with little black dress
