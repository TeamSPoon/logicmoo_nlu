What is your favorite color Lightsaber?
I like the purple one Mace Windu had.
Yeah, that's a good one - I kind of liked County Dooku's curved handle.
Darth Vader's red is always classic too.
I wonder who came up with the idea for Darth Maul's double bladed lightsaber?
Yeah, that was pretty epic when he ignited it during the final Phantom Menace dual.
I wonder if Kylo will fix his red lightsaber and get rid of the crossguards?
I don't know - I think it is a nice effect and made things seem more evil in The Force Awakens.
Do you think Snoke will have or use a lightsaber?
Maybe - his should be an epic gold/yellow color.
