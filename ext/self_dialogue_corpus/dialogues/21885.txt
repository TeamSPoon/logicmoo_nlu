Did you catch  Goodfellas on TV last night?
I won't watch that on television.
Huh?
They cut too much out.
True.
I own it on DVD anyway.
Liked it did you?
Best mob movie in my opinion.
It'd be hard to beat.
Joe Pesci's best role.
By far!
"What's so friggin' funny about me!"
I died at that scene!
So funny!
So intense!
Pesci really played it to the hilt.
Everyone else was great too.
It had all the best mob guys.
Except Pacino.
Forgot about him...
