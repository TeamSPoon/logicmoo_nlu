Favorite rock musician?
Oh man! That's a tough one. There have been so many greats.
The way they keep dying. The choice will get easier and easier.
Just because they're dead, doesn't mean they weren't great: Elvis Presley and John Lennon are both dead. And they're still considered legends.
Legends is right. They're dead.
Okay fine. So who's your favorite living rock star?
I don't know. Is Alannis Morrisette considered a rock star? What about Lady Gaga?
Oh please don't tell me you listen to Gaga. Don't tell me you think she's a rock star?
Fine. So you tell me, who is a rock star? Miley Cyrus? What about Van Halen? What AC/DC?
AC/DC is rock. Van Halen... they used to know how. And Miley Cyrus is just an embarrassment.
