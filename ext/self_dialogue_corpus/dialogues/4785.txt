Are you coming over tonight to go to the game?
I don't know if I want to go.
Really?  It's the last one on the season!
Yeah, but they really haven't been doing well anyway.
I know what you mean, but it's the last game!
I'll think about it, but we're on the bad side of a losing streak and I really could care less.
Tonight might be different, we actually didn't bat bad last game.
I don't think one game of decent batting will make up for for eight games of horrible losses.
Not really, but we might see some good batting tonight and that might lead to a good game.
Who has the upper hand on pitching?
Our pitching staff is actually better by far, which is another reason you should come with me.
So they actually stand a chance to win?
Yeah, man!  Batting is up and their pitching is definately no match for ours.
What is the ERA of their starting pitcher?
Like seven point something.  He is horrible.
Wow, our guys will run all over him!
Yeah, and we have 3 guys who actually have a couple game hitting streak despite the losses.
Yeah, I guess it's not their fault we keep losing.
So you gonna come out?
Yeah, sounds  like it will be a great game!
