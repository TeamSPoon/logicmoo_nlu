Which of the original trilogy was your least favorite?
Empire Strikes Back.
WHAT???
Haha, kidding. Return of the Jedi
Why? Luke redeems Vader. That was the point of the franchise.
Teddy bears beat up trained soldiers.
So?
They were there just for marketing. A character created as a toy beat trained soldiers.
The action was fun on the speeders, though.
Yeah, but to counter that, they broke into the defense because there were no security cameras!
