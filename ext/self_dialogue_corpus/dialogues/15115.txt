I figured for our Saturday movie marathon we'd watch some Mel Brooks comedys.
Awesome, I assume Spaceballs is one of them
Of course, spaceballs the lunch box, space balls the flame thrower.
One of the best lines of the movie.  I heard they are in talks for an actual spaceballs 2.
No way.  Rick Moranis is actually coming out of retirement for it.
So I hear.  Can't have Spaceballs with out him as Lord Helmet.
No you can't.  I also picked Young Frankenstien
Another of my favorites.  Gene Wilder is the best.
I know, so sad he passed away.
Yeah, but the best way to honor him is to keep watching his movies.
