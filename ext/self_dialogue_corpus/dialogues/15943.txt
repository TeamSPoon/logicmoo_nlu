Do you know if Mylène Farmer is releasing anything new soon?
I think she's still working on her movie.
That's disappointing. I really want a new record.
I want her to go on tour again already!
I know! It's been ages since she's been out on the road.
Did you like Interstellaires?
I loved it-- I thought it was so much better than Monkey Me.
Well that's definitely her worst album.
It came out around the same time as Celine Dion's album.
I can't really get into Celine Dion.
Really, why not?
Well, I think she's a bit boring.
She doesn't write her own music, so she's at the mercy of her team.
She doesn't choose a lot of material that appeals to me.
Well Mylène is more opaque with her music.
Exactly. There's more to figure out.
With Celine, she can be very blunt and to the point.
I think she's a great vocalist, though.
She's one of the best voices of the generation.
I just wish she had better songs!
