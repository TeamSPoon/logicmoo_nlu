Baseketball was an underrated movie.
Wasn't that the one movie by those one guys?
That's informative.  Who are you are thinking of?
The South Park guys.
Oh, you mean Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
Yep, those guys.
It was kind of a dud at the box office, but had some great jokes.
Also had Jenny McCarthy.
Oh, I remember her.  She's beautiful!
Yeah, I totally fell in love with her back then.
