How have you been lately?
I've been sick. I'm starting to feel better, though.
Well, would you be up for hanging out?
Sure, as long as it's something low-key, like a movie.
I haven't been to the movies in a long time. Is there anything good out?
Well, all of the big summer movies are coming out now.
What are the big movies for the summer of 2017?
There's a bunch of them. There's superhero movies, action movies, animations and stuff like that.
I know about Wonder Woman. Is there another superhero movie this summer?
Yes. There's a Spiderman movie coming out in July.
Are there any others?
It depends what you consider to be a superhero movie, but there's Guardians of the Galaxy and The Mummy.
What animation movies are there this summer?
There's Cars 3 and Captain Underpants.
I've heard of Cars before, but what is Captain Underpants.
It's been a kids' book for quite a while. They've made it into an animated film.
It's hard to imagine it being very good. It sounds strange.
Well, apparently Dreamworks has worked on it.
Maybe it will be good. I guess we'll find out.
Yes. Dreamworks has done a lot of good movies.
