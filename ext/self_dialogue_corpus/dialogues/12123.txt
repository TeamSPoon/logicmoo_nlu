I loved Rogue One. What did you think of the ending?
The ending was sad, but it was appropriate.
At first, I couldn't believe that Jyn and Cassian had to die!
I know, right? It was hard to figure out the reasoning.
But I like the way George Lucas wove it into the original series and showed how the plans to the Death Star were acquired by the republic.
Me too. It provided a lot of backstory.
The mind-blowing part for me was when Princess Leia was featured at the end. It was so awesome.
I agree. It set the movie off perfectly.
But it was so sad to hear soon after the release of the movie that Carrie Fisher died.
I know, I was heartbroken. I heard that in future movies, Disney will not use her likeness in CGI for upcoming movies.
