You like going to concerts?
Yea.  I havent been to one in a while though.  theyre expensive.  whats the last one you went to?
I went to Cochella.  it was awesome.
Ive never been, but would love to go.  Who was playing?
So many acts.  There was Lady Gaga, Bishop Briggs, Gucci Mane, Grouplove, HANS ZIMMER!!!  There was a lot of variety.
Who was your favorite?
Im really in love with Tove Lo and The Head and The Heart were good too.  Radiohead was awesome, I love their classics.
Wow, I love Radiohead.  I would have loved to see them live.
Lorde headlined too, but I couldnt get close enough to the stage to get a good listen, but Im sure she was awesome.
It sounds like it was all mostly rock and alternative music..
There was a lot of everything.  Kendrick lamar was there too.  And Hans Zimmer, remember?
Oh yea.  Wow, thats a lot.  Was it worth it?
Completely.  A lot of money, but it was a 3 day festival and it was awesome.
Cool.  Any other concerts closer to us that are comming up?
I really want to see Rise Against in July.
Me too!  I love those guys.  You get their new album yet?
Wolves?  Yes, its badass.
Imagine Dragons has a new one comming out too, and Arcade Fire.
Nice, those should be cool.  Are they going on tour too?
Not sure.  We should check it out and see if we can get tickets.
