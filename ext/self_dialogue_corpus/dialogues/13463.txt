Chewie was a Wooki, right?
Yes he was .
The why are all the wookies on Return of the Jedi so small?
Those were ewoks, unrelated to wookies I think.
So in one of the prequel, was Chewie in one of them
Yes, I do believe he was mentioned by name, or at least refered to.
So was he on screen and did he have lines, ha,ha!
I think we was on screen.
Did have that sash around his shoulder yet?
Yes, it looked the same as always.
