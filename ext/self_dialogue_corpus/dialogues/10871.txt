I watched Fast Five for the first time last night.
What did you think of it?
I actually quite enjoyed it, I had never seen past the third one.
Did you watch the fourth as well?
No, I heard it gets better around the fifth.
Yea, the franchise turns into an action movie instead of mainly about racing.
Yea, that is exactly how I felt.
The sixth one is a lot like that too.
That was pretty smart of them to spin off the genre.
Yea, the movies have been getting pretty good compared to the originals.
