What's your favorite professional sport?
I'd have to say basketball.
Oh, of course, you're a Bay Area guy and the Warriors are doing so great.  What about the 49ers?
Well, yeah I've followed them for years and I do like the NFL.  What about you--what's your favorite?
Football definitely.
You and a lot of people, but what makes it so popular?
Tailgating, ha, ha.
I know you're just kidding, but, even so, most fans don't attend the game.
Well, they're probably tailgating at home.
The 49ers are driving me to drink, but really, what makes the game so popular?
I don't know--I suppose the physicality has something to do with it.
Physicality? Are you trying to get around saying "violence".
O.K. you got me.
But, I'm not that crazy about the violence and I enjoy the game.
Well, I think it's partly the suspense and the excitement that any moment there can be a spectacular play.
I get that--a 50 yard run by a running back breaking multiple tackles, probably outdoes a driving layup.
And the 40 yard bomb and diving catch is more exciting than a three point shot.
And there is a lot of pageantry and tradition in the NFL.
Well, we've made a couple points, but I'm not sure we've explained the popularity.  Maybe we need to be psychologists.
No, we need to be psychologists to explain the popularity of soccer.
