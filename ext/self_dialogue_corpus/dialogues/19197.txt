What do you think about Despacito, the new song with Luis Fonsi.
I like it a lot, I think it has a great rythem.
I know, it is pretty cool and with a great track.
I like the vocals the most and think it also has good instrumentals.
Yeah, I also like the vocals and the mix of voices the song has.
Have your heard the new mix with Justin Bieber?
Yes I have!
And what did you think about it.
I actually like it, but think that some parts are a bit comical.
Yeah howcome.
I think that Justin should limit himself to singing in english, hes spanish is terrible.
Yeah I know, he had a poor perfomance in the parts he sang in spanish.
What other songs have you heard lately?
Ive also heard some Wisin and Yandel songs.
It looks like your a latin music fan.
Yeah I am I really like the rythem in most of the songs.
I can see your point most of those song make you want to dance.
Are you a laitn music fan?
Well I dont really consider myself a fan, i do like them but I dont know.
Oh, thats ok.
