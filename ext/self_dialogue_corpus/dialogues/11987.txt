What did you think of the star wars story rogue one?
I loved it. Did you not?
I thought it was amazing. I loved that they did not go for a happy ending.
Ya  the film especially towards the end had such high stakes.
You knew they were going to die and they knew that too. But yet such bravery.
They were on a mission. I am glad they completed it , but wished they could have lived somehow just because I enjoyed them so much,
I enjoyed the characters and the actors playing them too. But like I said glad they ended it the way they did had so much impact.
Yes, it was certainly impactful, I cried.
It was one of my favorite films of the star wars world.
I think it was executed so well and the script was written so well too. Everything in the movie felt truly captivating.
