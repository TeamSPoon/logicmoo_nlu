Here we are at the lake again, with our leggings on.
It's a beautiful day for a run.
Yeah but I'm insecure. All the skinny young things with their ponytails bouncing, and nothing else.
Oh, nobody sees us. Let's go.
No? I feel conspicuous, running aat my age.
You're not though. Just remember the rule of 40.
What rule? Ah, I can haradly speak.
Let's slow down a little. The rule of 40 says women over 40 are invisible on the street.
Oh... See what you mean.
Right. Nobody even sees us.
You think?
Yeah. So don't worry, run your heart out.
I--I am.
The leggings help so much, too. They compress, so they feel good and look good.
Prints conceal too. I hope.
Nobody cares. I promise.
I know, but...
Who cares. Just run.
Done. Thank God.
Yeah! Good tights, good run.
