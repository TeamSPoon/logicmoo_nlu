Hey - have you been paying attention to the music charts lately? It's interesting to see how many people I've never heard of!
I know. There's always a few that I know, but lord - I must be getting old.
So what have you heard lately that you're really into?
I have to admit, the Triplicate album by Bob Dylan is pretty good
Isn't that the album that the recorded of Frank Sinatra songs?
Yeah - and surprisingly, It's really really good! What are you liking these days?
To be honest, I have not been listening to really anything that is on teh radio lately.
What have you been listening to?
Oh, mostly folk music. It's kind of strange, but it's really calming when I'm doing work around my house or reading or trying to work.
I can see that - it is calming yet doesn't take away from what you're trying to accomplish.
That's precisely it. Are you going to any concerts lately?
Rise Against is playing in Kansas City and City and Colour is playing in Omaha. I'm going to both of those.
Oh sweet. Who are you going with?
Nobody - would you like to go?
Yes! I could even pick you up on the way to them.
If you could go back in time, who would you want to see live?
I think any of the old singer-songwriters before they had gotten so old. What about you?
Ha! Yeah, I can definitely agree with you on that one. I would like to go to some of the old festival concerts.
Any in particular?
No - maybe Woodstock before people ruined it though.
