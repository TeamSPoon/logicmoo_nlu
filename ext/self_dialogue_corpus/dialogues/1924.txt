Do you like the Manning from the Colts, or Broncos better?
They are both great
But, if you had to pick one, which would you choose?
I would go with the Colts version
Me too
He had better numbers
And the Broncos had better defense
I remember those showdowns in the AFC against Brady
Those were epic for sure
Him and Brady are great rivals
Is he better than his brother?
Yes
I don't know. Eli had been more impressive
But Peyton has better numbers
They are both amazing
True
Which one had the better Super Bowl win?
I think the Giants win over the Patriots was the best
That's true. The Patriots were undefeated
And that game was one of the most exciting of all time.
