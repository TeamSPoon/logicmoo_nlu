So, two new Nine Inch Nails releases this year.
Oh, man. Yeah. I... uh, wonder if either of those will also come with a physical component.
Possibly a spiritual component. I'm sure they'll sell a box to hold all the FLAC files.
Seriously, though, when's the last time he was this productive? Like, a decade ago?
Not many choices, are there? He's always gone, like, five years between albums, except for that run from 2005.
I wonder how all of these will fit together. They're supposed to be all on a theme, right?
That's what he said. The first one was... okay, but it did feel like only a third of an album.
I mean, yeah, it was short -- but it's an EP. What gets me is that I'm not totally sure what theme even runs through that one record.
Oh, records. Speaking of -- not to change the subject -- did you ever get a physical record?
I ordered one, but I think they had some kind of a problem with manufacturing?
Oh, is that it? Because I've been waiting -- and I'm gonna move soon, so I'm not sure what to do about that.
That must be annoying, yeah. I'm sure you could write to them.
I guess I'll have to. Maybe they'll send me a physical component, too.
What are those things, anyway? I've never seen a report; everyone's all elusive.
Someone told me it's an envelope or something, that warns you of possible consequences if you open it.
That's not ominous at all.
He said, "Oh, great, Trent just sent me a package of anthrax."
Harking back to the Year Zero days with this.
So, yeah, I dunno. I'm glad he's doing something!
Me too. I'm just wondering... what?
