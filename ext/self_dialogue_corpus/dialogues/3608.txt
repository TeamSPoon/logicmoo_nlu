What is your favorite horror movie?
I like the Michael Meyer's series, Halloween.
That series is scary.
It is!  Do you like the old series or the new one?
I love the old series, the new one stinks.
I agree, the older ones were made better.
What part was your favorite?
I would say the 2nd movie because that is when you hear about his back story.
I can't believe his back story.  It was so scary.
I know,  I felt sorry for him because of the way he grew up.
