What's your favorite rapper right now?
Right now I would have to say J Cole.
Which album? His newest one?
No, I'm actually still listening to "2014 Forest Hill Drive"
That's my favorite by him, too.
What's your favorite song on that album?
It's definitely "A Tale of 2 Citiez".
The beat for that song is crazy.
I still think it should have gotten more radio play. He's too good.
As far as lyrics go, I have to agree with you.
