What is your favorite action movie?
Probably Con Air.
Really? Nicolas Cage is in that, right?
He certainly is. He kicks bad guy butt for 90 min, its great.
Nicolas Cage is such a versatile actor, he can do almost anything.
I know what you mean. He can play the hero or the villain.
I like him a tiny bit more as a villian.
What is your favorite bad guy Nicolas Cage role?
I really liked him a lot in Face Off.
Oh, me too. He was super creepy.
