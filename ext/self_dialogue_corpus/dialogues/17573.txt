Do you like U-2?
I think so. Didn't they make "With or Without You?"
Yes, that was them.
I love that song. What's the name of their lead singer?
The lead singer's name is Bono.
That's right. He wears sunglasses all the time, doesn't he?
Yes. He does. He's really famous for his charity work.
I didn't realize he was involved in charities.
Yes. He and his friend The Edge helped found the band in 1976.
They've been together a really long time.
My favorite song by U-2 is actually New Year's Day. Have you heard it?
Oh yes. I know that's song. It's really good. What album was it on?
The album called "War."
When was it released?
It was released on January 1, 1983.
That's neat how they released it on New Year's Day.
Did you know that song was partially about the Polish solidarity movement?
No. So are U-2's songs always political in nature?
No, not always. Angel of Harlem was actually about Billie Holiday.
I'll have to find that song and listen to it.
