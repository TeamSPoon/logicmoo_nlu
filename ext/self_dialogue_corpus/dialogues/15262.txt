What's your favorite Lady Gaga song?
There are so many! I love all her music.
Mine is "The Cure," her new release.
I've listened to that a bunch of times on YouTube.
What do you think?
It sounds like she's trying to sing like Adele in it at times, honestly.
I don't really hear it, sorry. But I love the unique sounds that are in it.
I know what you're talking about it. They're kind of whistle-y.
So what's your favorite?
After all these years, Bad Romance is still my favorite.
Why is that?
Not only is it a great song, but there's tons of emotional issues for me with it.
Like what?
Remember the girl I was in love with back in Cincinnati?
Yup.
We listened to that all the time in the car, and we drove a lot.
Aww, that's sweet.
It's sad really.
How so?
I loved her, and this song reminds me of her deeply every time, which depresses me. But I love the song and it plays all the time so I can't avoid it.
