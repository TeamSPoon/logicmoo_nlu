Did you hear there's going to be a Boba Fett movie?
I heard about it. Then I heard it was cancelled!
I heard it's back in on again! I'm excited about it. Boba Fett has been one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe.
He's definitely a big fan favorite, and it's funny if you think about it because he doesn't say much. If they're planning on it again that's great news!
I don't think he's ever uttered a word! His first appearance was in Return of the Jedi right?
He was in the whole original Trilogy! George Lucas later added him into Star Wars.
I didn't realize it! It must have been the new remastered digital releases.
That makes a lot of sense, since Boba Fett was really a branch or character that was connected to Han Solo's background.
Yes, originally he was in Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi but on the remastered Star Wars, Lucas brought him in.
That's so good, I'll have to watch for him when I watch the Star Wars Trilogy again this weekend!
