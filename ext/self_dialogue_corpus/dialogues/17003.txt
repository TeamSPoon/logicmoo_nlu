Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
Not bad, you?
Same.
We're supposed to chat about music?
Yeah that's right.
Who are some of your favorite bands?
I like The Who, Kiss, The Beatles.
Oh so you're a big fan of classic rock?
Yeah that's right.
Cool my parents listen to a lot of that.
I think it's classic and timeless.
I don't like it as much as stuff today.
What kind of music do you like?
I like rap and pop.
That is kind of a different combination.
You think so?
Is it mostly stuff that comes on the radio that you like?
Yeah that's right.
