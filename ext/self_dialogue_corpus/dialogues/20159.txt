Who is the better actor, Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks?
I would say Tom Hanks solely because he has made more great movies recently.
What about the recent Jack Reacher franchise?
Those movies were good, but they do not match the same level of quality as Bridge of Spies or Captain Phillips.
True, but I think that Tom Cruise's performances in Born on the Fourth of July and Magnolia were superior to Tom Hank's Oscar-winning performances in Forest Gump and Philadelphia.
I would agree that Forrest Gump was not as strong, but Philadelphia was an amazing film.
It was a great movie, but I thought that Denzel Washington had the better performance.
I'd say the two were equal. I love Denzel Washington though.
Yeah, I really enjoyed his performance in Malcolm X.
That was good, but I really like his newer stuff more.
I don't know. I found Fences sort of overrated.
Really? I thought that not only did he give a good acting performance, but his direction was very good.
Agree to disagree. However, his best performance is without a doubt Training Day.
I can definitely agree with that. Speaking of Training Day, what ever happened to Ethan Hawke?
He's done some great films since, such as the Purge and Boyhood.
I totally forgot about Boyhood. What a fascinating concept for a movie.
Yeah, to film a movie over an 11 year timespan was ambitious to say the least.
Yeah, between Boyhood and School of Rock, Richard Linklater has directed some of my favorite movies over the past 15 years.
Don't forget Dazed and Confused. He directed that too.
Also a quality movie. I really enjoyed Matthew McConaughey's performance as David Wooderson in the film.
