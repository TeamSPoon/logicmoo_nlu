What is your favorite thriller?
I think that is is Shutter Island.
The Leonardo Di Caprio movie? That one?
Yeah! It was brilliant and scary.
Is Ben Kingsley in that movie as well?
He is! He plays the lead doctor.
Why do the U.S. Marshalls get stuck on the island at the beginning of the movie?
They got stuck because of a bad storm!
What a way to start a psychological thriller. It's always scary to be stuck in an unfamiliar and odd place.
Absolutely. They really pulled me in from the start.
