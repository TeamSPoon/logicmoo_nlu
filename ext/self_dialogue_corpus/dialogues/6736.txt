I watched Lion King with my kids the other day. I think it is one of the best Disney movies ever!
Well I have to agree with you there. I love that movie, plus the music is great!
I just find the plot so interesting. It is entertaining to kids and makes adults think a little bit.
For sure. Like how Mufasa is not really gone from Simba, even if he has passed away.
I think it speaks to how we carry loved ones in our heart after they've passed on.
But really, the best part is the music!
Oh definitely, I sometimes catch myself singing Hakuna Matata.
That's a good one, plus the song that everyone loves-Can You Feel The Love Tonight.
It is a classic. Plus, my daughter loved that storyline of Simba and Nala reuniting during the song.
The love story within the plot is definitely a plus.
