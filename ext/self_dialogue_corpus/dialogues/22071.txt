I just saw the new Alien movie.
Alien Covenant? How was it?
Yeah, it was great!
What was the story line?
It was a more modern take.  The humans were basically destroying their own lives, so it was similar to the climate of society today.
Wow that sounds deep and kind of complicated.
It really wasn't that complicated.  It was actually a simple movie, but it was made well, so it made it better.
What did you mean by humans destroying their own lives?
Well the humans and aliens just want to procreate and make the world their own, so it makes a battle.
Oh, I understand.  Who is the main actor?
Michael Fassbender
Was he the actor in Assassin's Creed?
Yeah, he played Aguilar in that movie.
That was a good one too, but pretty violent.
Well Alien: Covenant is similar. Lots of violence!
Did a lot of the characters die?
Yeah most of them did, so you can't get too attached.
That's always hard for me, but I can try.
You definitely should; it's a good movie.
I'll have to check it out.
