I loved it when Yoda fought Count Dooku!
I know - the CGI was spectacular as was Yoda's green lightsaber!
They were able to match the puppet so well with the all CGI.  Do you think that Count Dooku really knew what was going on?
I think a little bit, but that he was mostly a pawn of Darth Sidious.
Do you think that Snoke is really Darth Plageius?
Unsure - it will be interesting to see who he really is, and how he tempted Kylo and what he knows about Rey.
Do you think Luke will die in The Last Jedi?
No, I think they will keep Luke around for the final movie.
Do you think Luke will fight Snoke?
I think he and Rey have to at some point...
