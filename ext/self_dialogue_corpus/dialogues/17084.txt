Did you watch the BET Awards?
No I didn't even know it was coming on, how was it?
It was okay, it was just a few performances that stood out to me.
What performances stood out to you?
I liked the bruno mars, the tribute to the people that past, and that was really about it.
Wow. it sounds like it wasn't that good, what was the best one for you?
I would have to say the bruno mars was the best, I forgot I also like the Kendrick Lamar performance although it was just a feature.
What do you mean it was just a feature?
He only performed a featured verse he had on Futures song mask off.
Oh is see, yea I liked that verse it was really good.
Yea it was, I wish J. Cole was on there then it would've been perfect.
Yea I love J.Cole. whats your favorite album of his?
My favorite is the Friday Night Lights, it was pure perfection;.
Yea, I loved that too. Did you know he graduated Magnum Cum Laude at the college he went to?
Yea , it really shows in his music to me, its so thought provoking.
Definitely, I'm going to go online and see if I can watch some performances from the Awards show though.
Yea, you should check it out its on the BET site.
Cool, I will and I will let you know which ones I like the best.
That would be awesome, will meet up tomorrow and talk about it.
Deal, I'll see you tomorrow then.
