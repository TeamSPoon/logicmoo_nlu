Can you pick a Star Wars character out by home planet?
I think a few, test me?
Okay, who is home to the planet Dagobah?
That is an easy one, Yoda!
You are right. I suppose that was easy, I just love that character so much.
Yoda is awesome. Though I think he got a little cheesy in some aspects like the fights scenes in episode 2 or 3, can't recall which one.
I do know what you are referencing,I agree somewhat. I think that wholE movie was not up to par with the others though, not Yoda's fault.
You make a good point about those films at large.Can't blame one character, although jar jar comes close.
Ha, he was annoying. But the actor playing anakin was so stiff. I did not care for his performance.
It was hayden christensen, I thought he was okay. I agree slightly stiff performance.
