Did you see the latest King Kong movie?
Sucks. What a shame..
Yeah, I don't know what happened to movies lately, especially big budget.
Samuel L. Jackson is a Capital One Dipshit.
The only good thing about that movie was that funny guy from "Step Brothers".
John C. Reilly..
That his name? Yeah he had some funny 1 liners I thought were creative.
People are being reduced to idiots with movies lately..
Or it's the producers who are being reduced to idiots.
Yeah, you know I saw a good one a few months back, "Pass.."
"Passengers"! Yes! It WAS good wasn't it.
I thought the pool anti gravity scene was creative.
Me too. I thought the whole idea was a thought provoking thing. Living a full life out in space, never reaching your destination.
Yeah, and with a bartender and catered meals for 80 years.
Super movie. Any others?
I'm still into the survival/outdoors movies, oh and the "Globalist" NWO stuff lately.
Did you see "Snowpiercer"?
Yup
"Cockroach sandwiches"
Yup
