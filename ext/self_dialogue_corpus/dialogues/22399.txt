You know what I like to do is go see classic old movies in the theater when they have revival screenings.
Oh, that's cool. I should do that more.
Yeah, it's so much fun. I saw Gone With the Wind at the Cinerama Dome several years ago, which was amazing.
That's a long movie. I think I'd get bored.
That's what I thought, too, to be honest. But I didn't get bored at all. I was totally into it.
That's great. What else have you seen that you liked?
Let's see, I saw Casablanca, which is so romantic and sad and wonderful.
Oh, that one I would like to see, for sure. I'm kind of embarrassed that I've never seen it.
It is a classic, for sure. Let's see, what else have I seen?
How about The Maltese Falcon?
Have never seen that one, but it's on my list. Anything with Humphrey Bogart.
Yeah, he's one of those perennially cool guys. Clark Gable, too.
Yes, those guys were real men. Forget the action heroes we've got today, in my opinion.
Ha, I agree with you. You know who I think is great? Gregory Peck.
Let me guess. In To Kill A Mockingbird.
Oh, he's such a hero in that movie. So noble, so much integrity.
He's like the perfect dad in that movie. Don't tell my dad I said that, okay?
Sure, I won't. I think your dad would understand though.
Maybe. We should go see something at the revival movie theater.
I'd love that. Let's go see what's playing.
