What order should I watch these movies in?
Star Wars?
Yeah, I've heard there are a few ways to do it.
Well, there are a couple ideas. I'm traditionalist though. Old then new.
Hmm. So I shouldn't start with the prequels?
I don't think you need to. Some people like watching the old one after one or two though. As a flashback.
Why would they do that?
To keep the reveal of Vader being Anakin a surprise.
Oh. I guess that would be a surprise if you hadn't seen the prequels.
Exactly. It's a little more fun that way.
