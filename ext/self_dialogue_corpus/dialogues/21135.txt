What did you think of that last Mel Gibson movie.
Which one? The Mexican?
Is that a Mel Gibson flick?
Oh, no, wait. That was Brad Pit...
Did you mean the Gringo?
Oh yeah.
No, I was talking about Hacksaw Ridge.
Was he in that?
No, he directed it.
He directs.
Yeah, quite a bit.
Like what?
Passion of the Christ?
Oh yeah forgot about that.
He also starred and directed Brave Heart?
I had no idea! That was a good flick.
He also did Apocolypto.
I hadn't heard of that one.
Definitely worth a watch.
I'll have to check it out.
