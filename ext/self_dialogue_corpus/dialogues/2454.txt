Hey what's up man? You excited for the Seahawks season?
Oh for sure dude! We're gonna be great this year.
I know - don't you think Russell Wilson is just amazing?
For sure man. Don't forget Richard Sherman.
Oh yeah, but isn't there some beef between them?
I think its probably overblown homie. You know how the media is.
Yeah ,no doubt about that. They blow everything up.
For sure bro. How about the Packers, I know you follow them too right?
Yeah...well, I did. But I don't really like Rodgers much anymore.
Why not dude? Isnt he great?
Yeah, but there's been a lot of talk about his attitude...not good
Oooh yeah, a bit of a prima donna that one.
No doubt man. Tough to have that vibe when its a team sport...
Oh yeah bro. 53 players all gotta be on the same page and buy in
Speaking of buy in, you springing for season tix this season?
I might...I still have a PSL so I'm eligible...but man, so expensive!
I know man...the owners really got us over a barrel on this one. Its nuts how pricey tix are these days!
Plus man...its so nice to watch on TV. HD, the zoom cams...just incredible
Yeah and totally relaxing
For sure...who would've thought football of all sports would be relaxing, huh?
