Hey man, the NFL preseason starts up August 3rd
That's right, Cowboys & Cardinals in the Hall of Fame game
Who you think is going to win it all this year?
Probably the Patriots again; Tom Brady just seems so talented and the offense just clicks with him at the helm
Yeah, I agree. Anybody else have an outside shot?
Well not in the AFC, but in the NFC, I'd have to say the Cowboys or the Falcons could give the Patriots a good game.
Sounds about right. The Cowboys have great balance with Dak Prescott at QB and Ezekiel Elliott in the backfield.
Very true, they can go either run or pass on any snap and move the ball downfield with ease.
And the Cowboys defense is nothing to sneeze at either
The Falcons have Matt Ryan at QB, and he's a very capable passer who doesn't throw many interceptions
Yeah, considering he got sacked 37 times last year, I'm surprised he didn't panic pass more
Outside of those two teams, I don't see anyone capable of challenging the Patriots
How about the other end of the spectrum......who's going to have the worst record?
The Browns almost went winless last year, upsetting the Chargers in game 15 and finishing the year at 1-15
They might improve by 2 wins this year. I don't see how the Rams managed 4 wins with the league's worst offense
And the 49ers with the league's worst defense managed only 2 wins.
Yeah, the Bears and the Jaguars round out the bottom 5 with 3 wins apiece
But there could be a case made for the Jets to be this years worst, even going 0-16
Why's that?
Because there ain't no quarterback & a bunch off season trades puts them in even worse position than last year.
