Have you ever listened to music from the Big Band era?
You're talking like the 1940s?
Actually, more like the 20s and 30s.
Well, I guess that kind of answers your question!
Yeah, being off by a decade or two probably means you're not a big fan.
I have heard some Big Band songs in movies and things like that, but never sought it out.
It's actually a pretty interesting genre of music, believe it or not.
How so?
It's pretty much jazz pop music.
What do you mean?
Well, jazz as a genre of music evolved in America around the turn of the century and early 1900s.
Yep, I know a little about the history of jazz.
And there were a few different styles of jazz. And Big Band gradually evolved from jazz.
So, was Big Band jazz, or was it not jazz.
It would be considered jazz at its root, but all in all it's not quite the same thing.
What makes it different?
Musically, it's a little simpler, and the improvisation factor is largely gone.
Ah, yeah, I know that jazz is famous for improvisation.
Big Band was basically jazz made more palatable for the masses.
A pattern which has played out in music over and over throughout the years.
