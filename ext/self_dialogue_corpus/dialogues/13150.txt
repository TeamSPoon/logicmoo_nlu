How can you not have seen the start wars prequels? How is that even possible?
I'm not a fan of sci fi.
But, but these are not sci fi movies. They're an integral part of the Americana.
I'm every bit American as you, and I haven't seen it
That's what I'm asking. How is that possible?
Ok, Fine I'll bite. What ar they like?
What are they like? They're only the greatest movie trilogies ever made. We didn't even have the term prequel befoer this series
prequel is so stupid. It's a made up word. Even the prequels are, in fact, sequels.
Now that's just semantics, and neoligsm is a common thing in arts.
But stupid neologism is stupid.
