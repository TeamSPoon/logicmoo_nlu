What hip-hop artist dropped classic first albums in your opinion?
I think B.I.G's Ready to Die was a game changer for sure.
Yeah that album definitely gave the NYC rap scene it's power back.
What artist would you say dropped a classic first?
I'm a have to say Nas with illmatic.
That album was way ahead of it's time for sure.
You could listen to it today and still find some hidden gems on it.
That's a fact. I think Eminem had a classic first album as well.
For sure, the entire music industry never heard anything like it before.
I bet Nas even has to admit to himself that Eminem's first album was insane.
