Have you ever seen any old recording of beatles performances?
Yes, they are all over the internet and T.V.
Well I am just wondering what those woman who are seen crying and screaming think now.
Some are probably embarrassed. Others are probably just to have screen time.
I thought more are they ashamed of making a fool of themself?
Beatles were huge and these women were girls so I think they probably would just laugh it off. Or recall happy memories.
True, it would be kind of neat to see you younger self in that scenario.
Today I feel people would be much more aware of themselves at concerts.
Girls would be too busy taking selfies to appreciate the musicians.
For a band like the beatles that would have been a  true shame. I wish I could have seen them live.
