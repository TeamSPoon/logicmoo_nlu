Do you watch Disney movies?
Sometimes, why?
I was thinking of taking someone out on a date and she likes Disney movies?
Do you know what her favorite Disney movie is?
No idea, but I think I saw here with a princess with red hair
Ah, I think that's the Little Mermaid
I've never heard of that one
What?! The Little Mermaid?!
Yeah, is it a new one?
No, it came out back in the early 90s
Really?! I guess I missed that one
My sister used to watch it all the time
I never had a sister so I was never exposed to it
It's actually not too bad. Pretty good songs
Remember any of the names of the songs?
Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl...some others I can't think of right now
Okay I'll have to check it out and see if that's one of her favorites
yeah, good idea so you can relate to her
Okay, thanks for the help
You're welcome
