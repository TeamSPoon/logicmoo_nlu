What are your thoughts on club music or music they play at dance clubs?
Some of it is okay. I tend to like the music that doesn't have any lyrics.
What do you mean by that.
Some of the trance or electronic music doesn't have any lyrics. Whenever there are voice overs in the music it seems to diminish the song.
What are a few examples of songs that would fit that criteria.
I would say, some of the more popular ones are Darude - Sandstorm, Robert Miles - Children, and DJ Mangoo - Eurodancer.
Oh, I recognize Darude and Robert Miles. Not so much DJ Mangoo.
I bet you would recognize the song if you heard it.
I'm sure I would. When did that song come out?
I believe it was either in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
Seems like club music was much better back then.
Yes, it definitely was. A lot of the club music today seems to be taking hits from pop songs and adding a club feel to the song.
I know what you mean. The songs back then were specifically written to be club hits.
I kind of have a distaste for the electronic-ization for pop songs. I tend to think that the artists that really focus on electronic and trance music have much more talent than someone who borrows something from a popular song and changes it to electronic.
I agree. This has got me thinking, what are your thoughts on Daft Punk.
Daft Punk is talented. Who could take one or two lines of lyrics and make it into a hit that many different people from all walks of life could enjoy?
Not many. Around the world would be a funny example of that. One line of lyrics and the entire song is written around that one line and it became a decent hit.
One more time, as well, although they used more than one line of lyrics. You are making me nostalgic.
Yes, Daft Punk makes me nostalgic as well.
So many good times and much freer times thinking about Daft Punk and the younger years.
