Do you like Western movies? And do you have any favorites?
I don't really like the old westerns but I like The Quick and the Dead.
Is that the newer one with Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman?
Yes and also Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. It was really suspenseful and well acted.
You're right, I loved it. I saw Tombstone just recently too.
Oh yeah I like that one. What did you think of it?
Well it was okay but it was a little long for my taste. I loved Val Kilmer's character though.
Right. I didn't care for him as Batman though.
Everyone knows Michael Keaton is Batman. I don't really like Christian Bale either.
Me neither. I love the Dark Knight movies but don't care for him as Batman.
He needs to do something about that voice. I know he meant well but it's annoying.
The directing and cinematography are what make that movie great.
Did you see Batman Vs Superman?
Yes I did and it was just ok to me. I'm more of a Marvel fan.
I like the fact that they're building up to The Justice League.
Now that I am definitely excited about. Wonder Woman was pretty good.
It was but it was a little on the boring side for a superhero movie.
You're right, they could have done more. Have you seen Deadpool?
One of my favorite movies now. I watched it like five times in a row when I bought the dvd.
Me too, almost as many times. It was hilarious, well acted, and so much action packed in.
