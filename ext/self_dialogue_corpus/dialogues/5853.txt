Did you ever see the Disney movie Mulan?
Yes I've seen it many times. It's one of my favorites.
One of the first to feature a strong female lead that stands up for herself.
I think that was part of the appeal with Frozen. That whole independence theme.
Right and it was the same way with Brave. I loved her hair in that movie.
I saw a special where they did a behind the scenes and each strand of her hair was meticulously done.
You can tell. Pocahontas was a great movie too although I disagree with the historical accuracy.
Right you just have to view it as it is, a kids movie.
I grew up on Disney though. I love looking for the little easter eggs, the references to other Disney movies.
Oh and Moana is another movie with a strong female lead. There were a few references in that movie as well.
