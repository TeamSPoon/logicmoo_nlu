So for today's lesson in NFL history we are starting out with the Chicago Bears.
I didn't know that we were going to have one but go ahead please.
The record for most team fumbles in a season belongs to the 1938 Chicago Bears. They fumbled 56 times.
Ouch that had to hurt!
The record for the fewest team fumbles in a season belongs to the 1959 Cleveland Browns. They only fumbled the ball eight times.
Don't get side tracked on the Browns.
Okay how about this one.Brian Urlacher of the Bears carries a ping pong paddle in his car.
That's pretty random and a bit boring.
Following Thanksgiving, Super Bowl Sunday is the largest food consumption day in the United States. how's that?
Much better and never would have suspected that to be true.
I like this one.Raiders running back Justin Fargas is the son of actor Antonio Fargas, famous for playing Huggy Bear on the series Starsky and Hutch.
I love it! Huggy Bears kid!
In 1948, the Rams became the first team to have a helmet insignia. The  Ram horns were hand-painted onto the helmets by the teamâ€™s halfback, Fred Gehrke.
That is some dedication. I wonder if there is a picture of one somewhere?
okay back to some more Bears facts....hah I can do it too
Give me the bear facts.ha ha ha
Out of 50 games played on Monday Night Football, the Chicago Bears have lost 34.
That's a sad Bear fact.
Defensive end Corey Sears has a tradition of eating a whole lemon before each game.
Sour puss!
