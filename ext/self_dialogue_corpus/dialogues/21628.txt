What classic movies do you like?
I'm a huge Hitchcock fan.
I've only seen Psycho, any other suggestions for me?
You have to see The Birds and Vertigo for sure
I've heard his later stuff is not as good
Yeah most would agree. I think Marnie is probably his last good movie.
Have you seen his early stuff?
Yes I've seen everything and I'd say it's for hardcore fans only but take a look at Lifeboat, that holds up.
I will. I usually go for comedy. Mike Nichols, Woody Allen that kind of movie.
I've only seen The Graduate and none of Woody's
That's a pity. Annie Hall really is a classic. Did you like The Graduate
I did but I thought Tootsie was funnier
It is. Sydney Pollack pulled a Hitchcock in that one with his cameo.
Oh yeah, he was the agent. I forgot. I will have to look out for Hitchcock's cameos.
It's my favorite thing to do. I love spotting them.
I think it's better than full on starring like Allen.
Sure that can be too much sometimes.
A little touch is better.
Yeah let the actors do their jobs.
Luckily the greats always hired really capable actors
