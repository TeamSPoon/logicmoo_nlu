So what did you feel about the remake of the Nightmare on elm Street?
I totally hated it!
Why didn't you like it?
Where do I even start?
Ha, well from the beginning.
The fact that Robert Englund wasn't playing Freddy was mistake number one.
Yes, that was a box office blunder.
Secondly, the retelling though not horrible wasn't quite correct with the movies lore.
What did you think about the movie effects?
That at least was the best thing about this movie.
