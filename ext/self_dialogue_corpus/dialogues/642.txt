What do you think of the San Francisco 49ers this season?
I think they are going to be bad.
And why do you think they will be bad?
Lots of reasons Most importantly Jed York the owner has no clue what he is doing?
Why do you think he has no clue?
Because he thinks he is Eddie DeBartolo is Uncle that led them to fame in the 1980's
Yeah, I agree. They are in a major rebuild.
What do you think is most important to do to rebuild the franchise?
Many things exclusive of him selling the team. That will not happen.
Please give me some examples.
Well first off, he should never have fired Jim Harbaugh.
Why is that?
Harbaugh is a proven winner. Sure some people are hard to get along with but that is true of any business.
So are you saying he should of sucked it up and kept Harbaugh?
Exactly. His ego got in the way of winning and screed the pooch.
What else contributed to their demise?
Well, trading Alex Smith and hanging their hat on Colin Kaepernick. Anybody with brains new Kap did not have the brains for the position.
What do you mean the brains?
I mean football I.Q. he had the arm and the speed but could not go through his progressions.
I agree. That was a poor decision not to mention York meddling when he had no experience.
