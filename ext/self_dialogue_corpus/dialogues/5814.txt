Did you see they are coming out with an Incredibles 2?
I have waited so long for it.
I know, but I am excited.
Do you think FroZone will be in it?
With his suit and his funny wife?
I loved when his wife said, "I am the best best you will ever get".
That always cracks me up.
Do you think they will show the kids as older or still young?
I hope at least the baby is able to talk and help.
Would be funny if the seamstress let the baby have a cape, since she was so against them.
