What about that Yankee/Cubs matchup the other night?
Whew, 18 innings.
There were a record 48 strikeouts in the game.
That record will stand for a while
The Cardinals are in first place now.
They've won four in a row and have overtaken the Reds and Cubs.
Can Bryce Harper carry the Nationals to the promised land?
This should be their year with all that starting pitching.
Can the iIndians get back to the World Series for the second straight year?
I think the odds are against them in the Junior Circuit.
Stan Musial doesn't seem to get the respect he deserves from the national media.
For a guy that won seven NL batting titles and was on three World Series winners, you are correct.
What is going on with the commissioner wanting to put runners on second base during extra inning games?
It's the dumbest idea ever.
Can we agree that the DH has to go?
Yes, but the players union will raise a stink about it.
The Yankees are on fire so far this year.
They're doing it without big stars.
I know.  I can't name one player off the top of my head.
Different from prior winning teams they've had.
