What's your favorite music these days?
I can't narrow it down to one top artist.
Just give me a few current faves.
Grimes and Chvrches.
I think I've heard of them, but I'm not sure.
Well, Grimes is just one person, and Chvrches is a trio.
What do they sound like?
Grimes is electronic, but a bit avant-garde.
And what about Chvrches?
Well, they're considered synth-pop.  People say they have an 80s sound.
I'll have to check them out some time.
I've seen Chvrches live once.  It was a great show.
Oh, yeah?  You must really like them.
Yeah, it's strange though, because the music is probably meant for younger people.
Why do you say that?
The lyrics have a lot about young love in them.
Maybe you're still young at heart.
Maybe.  I mainly just ignore the lyrical content and focus on the sound.
Whatever works for you.
Enough about me.  What are you listening to lately?
