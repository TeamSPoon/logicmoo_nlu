I love that wedding dress. Look at those pearl beads.
I wonder if they're real. They're so pretty.
They really are.
I'd love to have a dress like that when I get married.
I want one with a tight top and a poofy bottom. I love that shape.
Me too. It makes your waist look so small.
What color would you want? I want white.
Me too. I just feel like wedding dresses need to be white.
It seems weird to me when they're not.
Yep. My cousin had a pink one and I thought it was.
Not ugly but weird.
Right. To each his own but I'll stick with white.
Would you want beading like those pearls?
Yes, probably, or crystals maybe.
I think pearls are so classy.
They are. I love how they never go out of style.
True. They go with so much, though.
I even wear pearls with jeans.
I've done that too.
We should both wear that combo tomorrow.
