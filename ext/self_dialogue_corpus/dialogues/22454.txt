What's your favorite 'Lord of the Rings' movie?
Oh, that's a really tough question.  I love them all.
I think mine is 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'
I guess if I have to pick, I'd go with 'Two Towers.'
It's tough because they're all masterpieces.
I agree.  I think I leaned away from picking the third one because it took forever to end.
True, those 5 or 6 endings went way too long.
It really was the perfect fantasy trilogy.  They covered everything they needed it.
It really did hit all the marks.  An amazing plot, journey, characters, drama, action, tension...everything.
No other hero's journey is as epic as Frodo's.
Frodo was obviously important, but Sam was my favorite.  Frodo never would have gotten to Mordor without Sam.
Agreed, though my favorite was Gandalf.
That scene when Gandalf reappears to the Fellowship in the 2nd movie was epic.
That was such a cool scene.
Can't believe the first movie came out in 2001.
It's been that long already?
Yea, it's hard to believe.  And the effects and scale of that movie were so advanced for the time.
Yes, you really felt like you entered Middle Earth while watching.
The Hobbit trilogy was fun too but...
But it can't compare to Lord of the Rings.
