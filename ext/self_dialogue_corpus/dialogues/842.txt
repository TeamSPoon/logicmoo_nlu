I am so excited for football to start!
Oh, when does is start this year?
Week one is September 10th. I cannot wait!
Me either! Is there a special, early game before that first Sunday of games.
I think so, let me check.
Yeah, it looks like the Chiefs play the Patriots that Thursday before.
Oh, that should be a good game, I think!
Weren't the Chiefs good a few years ago?
I think they were really good in 2013.
I think that's right. They lost the wildcard game that year, but they were really good during the regular season.
How did they do last year?
They made it to the playoffs, but then the lost to the Steelers.
The Steelers always so good though.
Yeah, they are very consistent.
Who is your favorite team?
I am a big Bengals fan, actually.
Oh, that is interesting! I haven't met a lot of Bengals fans.
Yeah my whole family roots for them.
How did they do last year?
They went 6-9-1 so lots of room for improvement this year!
