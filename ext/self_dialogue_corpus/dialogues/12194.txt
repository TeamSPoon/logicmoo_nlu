Be honest, were you pulling for Anakin even though you knew how he would end up?
Oh for sure, who couldn't pull for a kid?
I know. He just becomes so evil.
Well yes, he does, but he is still important.
I know, I know, you have to evil in a movie about good and evil.
Well yes, but he is important because he Luke and Leia's dad.
Well I guess if that never happened the whole story would be very different.
True. But he comes around in the end.
I love that scene. I just wish they had more time together.
I know, I think there is a lot that he could have learned from him. At least who is mother was.
