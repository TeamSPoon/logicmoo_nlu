I watched up last night.
Dude, what did you think?
It made me cry.  I was not expecting that.
At which part?
All of them!  Especially the beginning when his wife died.
Yeah, gets me everytime.  I balled at the end too.
When the house was left there?
No, when he reads the storybook about having an adventure.
Oh yeah.  I was wiping away tears the whole time.  Such a good movie.
Maybe they'll make a sequel.
