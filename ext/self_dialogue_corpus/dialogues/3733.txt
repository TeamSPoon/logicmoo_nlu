Do you think that the movie the Dark Knight would be considered a thriller movie?
Yes I think so, haven't you seen it?
Oh I have but wasn't sure.
My husband LOVED that movie especially when it first came out.
Mine too, he's a huge Batman fan.
Not to mention, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in that movie.
He really did.
Did you know that he passed away before the movie was done filming?
Oh wow I didn't realize.
I know, so very sad.
