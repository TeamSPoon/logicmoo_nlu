What did you think of Moonlight that won the Academy Award for best picture?
I have to tell you I was surprised that it won.
Why do you say that?
Well the acting was very good and the storyline did hold my interest, it's just that there were others who should of won.
I thought Mahershala Ali did an excellent job in his role, so I agree about the acting.
Yes, he won the academy award for supporting actor.  It was definitely deserved.
The story however while compelling, did not touch my heart the way Hidden Figures did.
Yes, and Marershala Ali was in that one as well.  He did a lot of movies this year.
Janelle Mon√°e was in both of those movies as well.
She was awesome in Hidden Figures.  Just sort of ok in Moonlight.
What about the mistake when they announced the Best Picture award.
Right, that was unreal.  I must say the La La Land crew was very gracious about turning over the award.
Indeed, they had to convince the Moonlight folks that they weren't joking.
I haven't even seen La La Land yet, so I don't know what all the hype is about that flick.
Me either.  It's on my watch list.
Yeah, I watch it when it comes out on cable or Netflix.
Agree.  You know what makes a Best Picture for me.
No what?
I have to want to watch the movie again, and for Moonlight - once was enough.
That is an interesting way to look at it.  I have to think about my favorites and see if that criteria works for me.
