Have you seen a good movie lately?
I saw princess diaries
Oh that was a good one!
That was a very good movie but it is almost twenty years old.
I know! I didn't see it until yesterday!
Wow. What did you think?
It was a cute movie.
Did you see the sequel?
No I did not.
You should see it later.
Totally.
What other movies do you recommend?
I recommend watching Cinderella with brandy.
Oh that was a good one, I saw that!
Wasn't the music good in that?
Yes it was great.
I also love the acting.
Yeah the acting was good.
