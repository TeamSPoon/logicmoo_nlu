Do you like any animated movies?
Yes I do like them, which one is your favorite?
I really like Tangled, that was a really well done movie.
Oh, was it? I haven't seen it before.
It was really popular when it came out, but it doesn't seem like it anymore.
Yeah I haven't heard much about it in a long time.
It's still a good movie, it has a lot of stuff about overcoming abusive parents.
Wow, does it really?
Yeah, it's a pretty heavy theme in the movie.
That's very cool, especially for a Disney movie.
My girlfriend likes it a lot because her mother is just like that.
Oh, sorry to hear. I'm glad that the movie reaches a good audience though.
It sends a very positive message about being your own person and not your parent's pet.
That's good, what else is it about?
There's some quirky romance, which is alright.
How is it quirky?
The girl is fairly silly and clumsy, but in a likable way. The guy is the same way too.
Oh, okay. I bet kids like that a lot.
Yeah my younger sister thinks the whole movie is very funny.
Nice to hear that older and younger people like it.
