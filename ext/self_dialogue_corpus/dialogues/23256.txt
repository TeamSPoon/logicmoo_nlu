Movies these days are sort of lame
What do you mean?
I mean they are lame as i said
Well i asked because i am confused
Why are you confused?
As to why are they lame?
Well they are lame for many reasons
What are some of the reasons then man spill it
Well the plots are bad now adays
I think some of the plots are pretty decent
Even when the plot is decent the actors are bad
I can agree a little sometimes the actors are not that great
Not that great would be putting it lightly
Wow thats harsh
Like how many transformers movies are their?
Way to many
And each of them are worse than the last
I can see that
I would not watch them if i was paid to watch them
I do not enjoy the either to be frank
