Wow, you went to a kids movie alone?
Yes.  Nobody wanted to see Zootopia with me so I went by myself!
Did anyone look at you funny?
No, but I'm a girl.  I think if I were a guy it would be different.
Did you like the movie?
Yes, it was wonderful!  The lead rabbit was so cute!
I heard Jason Bateman was in the movie.
Yes, he played the other lead as a fox.
A fox and a rabbit?  He didn't try to eat her?
No.  All the animals in the movie try to live in harmony with each other.
How do they do that?
Basically like humans try to get along with each other.  They have rules and a justice system.
That's kind of funny.
It is.  The story starts with the bunny going to the big city to be a police officer among all these large animals.
And nobody steps on her?
No.  I guess they are very careful not to step on the little ones.
I'm kind of sorry I didn't see this with you.
You should go!  It's very entertaining.
I'm a guy, I can't go to a kid's movie by myself!
I'll go with you then.
