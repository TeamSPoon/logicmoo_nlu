what is your favorite band currently?
I would probably have to say Fall Out Boy.
That is a good choice, I like them a lot myself.
What is your favorite song by them?
I love that song Alone Together. That may be my favorite from them.
I like that one as well. However, Sugar We're Goin Down is my favorite song.
Yea I used to listen to that song constantly when I was in college.
I did to, especially when I would work out or something.
Yea it is a great song for motivation when you need a little extra.
Have you ever heard that song Young Volcanoes?
Yea that is on one of my CD's around here somewhere.
Who is your favorite band?
I have always been a huge fan of U2. Ever since I was little I loved their music.
I know a few of their songs, but not very many.
I feel like their best song is With Or Without You. I love it!
That is one that I know actually. I agree, it is a very good song.
Have you ever heard I Still Haven't Found What I Am Looking For?
I do not think that I have heard that one before.
It is a classic. It is one of my all time favorites as well.
I may have to check some of their music out and get more familiar with it.
