Did you ever see Basket Case?
That is a true cult horror movie.
That movie is so scary.
It's really freaky too. The monster is very scary.
Can you recommend another movie like that one?
Sure, try part 2 and 3.
I had no idea there was more than one.
There is. You should also check out Dead Alive, since that one is an oddball horror flick too.
I will. Who directed Dead Alive?
Peter Jackson
