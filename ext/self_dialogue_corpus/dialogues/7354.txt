Hey, have you heard the Japanese version of that song from Frozen?
No. No. No! Stop right there! I don't want to hear anything about any songs from Frozen!
Why not? The movie and those songs were amazing!
Do you have kids? Everywhere we go in the car, we're constantly playing that soundtrack. And we play the Blu-Ray at least once a week
Yea, that would probably wear on you after a while.
I don't think I'm ever going to want to "build a snowman" ever again.
Well, you have to admit, Disney really created an instant classic with that movie.
I don't care, in my book, that movie will never be as good as Lilo and Stitch.
Why do you say that?
There wasn't any singing in Lilo and Stitch.
