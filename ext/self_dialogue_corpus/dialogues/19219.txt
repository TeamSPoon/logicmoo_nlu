I'm not sure who he was singing about but you can feel the emotion.
That's what I like about The Beatles that their songs have some feeling.
Do you think Yoko is the reason The Beatles broke up?
I don't really know enough to be honest.
I think it would be hard being that big of a band.
At one point they were the number one celebrities on the planet.

Don't really know.  I wasn't born then.
I think The Beatles were bigger across the globe compared to Elvis.
I could see that.  Elvis being bigger in America.
