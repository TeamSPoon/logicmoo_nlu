Guess what movie is coming out in 2018!
What movie? Is it Disney?
Yes. Incredibles 2!
Wow that is so exciting!
I know. The Incredibles was one of my favorites as a kid.
Wasn't it everyones?
True. I bet the theater will be packed with adults.
I hate that we have to wait till next year.
Yeah. I think it will be worth the wait though.
I'm sure it will be.
