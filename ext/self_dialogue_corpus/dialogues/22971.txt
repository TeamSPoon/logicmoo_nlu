Did you see the trailer for 'The Foreigner?'
What is that?
It's a new movie starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan.
That's really cool.  Is it going to be a comedy?
No, it's actually going to be a thriller.  Very serious.
What's it about?
It's about a man who's daughter is killed during an terrorist attack, and he goes on a vengeance mission.
Wow, that's almost like taken.  I didn't realize Jackie did serious roles.
He actually does many serious roles in Chinese Productions.  Just not here.
Why do you think that is?
I think it has to do with a stigma against Asian male leads in more serious roles.  And typecasting.
I could see that.
It's time for a positive change.  Don't worry though, Jackie still does awesome stunts.
His stunts were already impressive on their own.  It's especially impressive at his older age.
Seriously.  He's 63 years old.
I'm also excited to see Pierce Brosnan.
Me too.  He seems to be playing the main antagonist in the film.
What was your favorite Jackie Chan movie of all-time, while we're on the subject?
'Police Story' for sure.  How about yours?
'Rush Hour!'
