Guess what I did at the game.
What?
I hit a home run. It was so awesome.
Oh, wow, that's so great!
Jason pitched and I really slammed the ball.
And it was your first game.
Yeah. I love baseball.
I am so glad. You didn't want to be on the team at first.
That's because I thought it would be boring.
It's not, though, is it?
No way. I hit a homer. It's a great game.
I am so proud of you.
Everyone was standing up and cheering.
I get to go to the next game so I hope I get to see something like that.
Me too. I want you to see me hit a home run.
Even if it doesn't happen I'll still enjoy the game.
What if I do really badly?
I will still enjoy watching you play. I like baseball.
Is that why you wanted me to be in it?
Kind of.
