Hey man have you heard the latest Panic! at the Disco song?
No, I didn't even know they were still making music.
They sure are, they just released an entire album, Death of a Bachelor.
Oh! I have heard that then. But only the title song, Death of a Bachelor.
To be honest I haven't listened to it too in depth either. I think I'm still obsessed with their old stuff.
For sure, every time I Write Sins Not Tragedies comes on my playlist I'm screaming the lyrics.
I'D CHIME IN WITH A HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF --
CLOSING A GODDAMN DOOR, NO --
Wait, it's "a" door? I thought it was "the" door.
Mandela effect dude, Brendon Urie tweeted about it himself.
There's no way! I used to sing that song everyday in eighth grade.
Maybe because you were singing so hard is why you never heard the actual lyrics.
That's crazy, hey do you know who else is even in Panic! at the Disco besides Brendon Urie?
No, but I've heard that they've all been replaced multiple times.
Hahaha really? So the band is really just Brendon Urie.
It would appear that way, yes.
Did you know some of those people you think are bands are just one person?
If you told me those girls in Haim are all the same person I'd totally believe it.
Haha no. Francis and the Lights and Marina and the Diamonds are just one person.
Haha, why can't they just be like everyone else and call themselves Francis and Marina?
