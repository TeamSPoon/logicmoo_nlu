I want to start listening to rap but I don't know what's good. Could you give me some recommendations?
Oh I'd love to. The irish underground rap scene has some solid artists like Terawrizt, Redzer, Nucentz, etc.
Good to know. Anything in particular I should listen to of their to get a feel for them?
As far as specific songs, I can't recommend enough It's Politics, Let Us Pray, Be Ok, Devilish Nightmares and Don't Forget. Start with any of those and you'll probably want to listen to more.
Okay cool! I'm really into Irish music, any others I should listen to?
Well Scary Eire is pretty popular as far as Irish rap groups. You may like their more raw and humorous sound in contrast to the artists that "Class A'z" consists of's polished and serious sound.
Nice, and if I want to discover some more local, American artists? I feel left out because I don't know any.
You can't go wrong with Naughty By Nature, Public Enemy or Tupac. They should give you a solid foundatinal idea of what good rap is supposed to sound like.
Best songs or albums of theirs?
My personal tastes are Everythings Gonna Be Alright by Naughty By Nature, Can't Truss It, Give It Up and Miuzi Weighs a Ton by Public Enemy, and Trapped, Violent and Soulja's Story by Tupac. Enjoy!
