Did you see the playoffs between the Golden State Warriors and the Spurs?
Yes. It was an amazing game.  The Warriors out played them.
I couldn't believe Steph Curry and Kevin Durant's performance. Did you see that dunk in the first period by Durant?
Yes. He just blew in and dunked the ball as if no one was there.
I can't believe how many 3 pointers Steph Curry hit.
He just amazes me how he can hit those shots as if he was a foot away from the basket.
I couldn't believe Green's performance coming off the bench.
Yeah. He is without a doubt the best sixth player they have.
Remember how they lost the series last year when Green wasn't able to play in that playoff game.  He is a clutch player.
Could you believe how the Warriors ran up the points during the game.  They really outplayed the Spurs.
I can't wait to see the series final when they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again this year.
It should be an amazing re-match in the finals. Both teams are on their game.
Lebron is such a super star. They have a great bench too for backup.
However, the Warriors have Steph, Durant and Green.  This should make this an amazing match-up.
I'm forecasting that this year the Cavs will take the series 4 games to 2.
I'm not sure.  The Warriors are so good and want revenge this year. I bet it will come down to the final game.
I agree both have strong offense and defense. However, the edge probably goes to the Cavaliers.
The defense is probably stronger for the Warriors when they are on their game.  Right now they are hot.
Well it will be interesting to watch the series and see how it plays out. How about a bet on this game. I'll take the Cavs.
You got it. I'll take the Warriors that they will win the finals.
