So have you seen the latest Disney movie?
Moana? Yeah, I watched it with my kids.
What did you think of it?
I enjoyed it! I thought the music by Lin-Manuel Miranda was great.
I love him! But I actually thought the songs were a little forgettable.
Moana was a great character, though. She was really brave.
I liked Maui. He was really funny.
Yes, the song where he first meet Moana is hilarious.
And the rooster! I'm glad he survived the movie.
If we had to have an animal sidekick, he was at least an original one.
What did you think of the plot?
It was a little thin, maybe.
It's true that it was kind of simple.
I really liked the sequence in the land of monsters, though.
Yes, the giant crab was terrific!
I think he was supposed to be a David Bowie homage.
Well, that really worked.
What did your kids think?
They had a blast. Not my favorite Disney movie, but definitely worth seeing!
I thought so, too. It was a lot of fun.
