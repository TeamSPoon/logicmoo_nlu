And how he develops the dual blade light saber.
That would've been cool to see also.
And why is the Sith saber's red?
That's a common knowledge. It's the negative energy from the Sith that turns them red.
How come Some Jedi's have blue and others green?
Green like Yoda's indicate he's a Jedi Consular who spent more time studying the mystical nature of the Force.
And if it's blue like Kenobi's?
That indicates he's a Jedi Guardian who's more in tune with the physical aspect of the Force, like fighting.
Oh... Ok. That makes sense. All this should've been explaiend in the movie.
That wiould make the movie 10 hours long. All these back stories developed over the past 3 decades.
