Have you seen all the Fast and Furious movies. I have seen them all at least once.
Yes, I have seen each of them during opening week. I love the action and the cars.
I thought it was sad that they lost Paul Walker but I think they handled it well.
Yes, I agree. They did a nice wrap up on his storyline for the fans.
Man, when Dom drove off in one direction and Brian the other at the end I was in tears.
To be frank that is not why I go to those movies. It is all about the cars and the capers they pull.
They have some of the greatest car stunts I have ever seen. I love to watch it on the big screen.
There is nothing like it. The sound of the cars racing and chasing is amazing.
The characters are all well done, but the cars are the stars as far as I am concerned.
As long as they keep topping themselves with those stunts they will have a fan in me.
