The Social Network was a great film.
That was with Andrew Garfield right?
Yeah but he wasnt the main star of the film
Who was?
Jesse Eisenberg
Who did he play?
Mark Zuckerberg.
Oh thats right! Andrew played the friend, correct?
Yes you have it right now.
I think that it was an awesome biopic.
You almost wonder if it was all real though.
I think it was, the way they come up in these films is incredible.
Yeah I agree but I am skeptical of how much the truth got twisted.
I dont think they would take those liberties
Sure they do for drama to the film
But its got to be factual
I think Eisenberg killed the role he had.
Yeah he was a captivating character
And Garfield really played a guy who came off evil
I dont know if he was evil, just scorned
