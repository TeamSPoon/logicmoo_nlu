Do you like Zack Brown Band?
I love them.  The covers they do are amazing.
Yeah, I saw a youtube video of them covering The Devil Went Down to Georgia.
Oh man I saw that too.
The speed of which they did it was nuts.
Yeah it felt like double time.
They were all over the stage too.
They must be in decent shape to do that.
I also heard them cover Bohemian Rhapsody too.
How was that?
Not quite as good but still solid.
Ever hear them with Chris Cornelle?
Yeah that was an amazing song.
Heavy is the Head of something like that.
Too bad he recently died.
I know, he was pretty damn good.
Yeah his music will be missed.
I'd like to see Zach Brown Band in concert.
I bet they would be awesome.
No kidding.  They have so much energy.
