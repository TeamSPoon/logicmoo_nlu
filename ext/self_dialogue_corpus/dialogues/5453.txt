The original Beauty and the Beast was pretty overrated.
Oh, now I know you're trying to pick a fight.
I'm ready for it.  1991 was just a weak year for movies.
That movie was a classic tale with great songs and great animation.
Was it really though?  There are tons of better Disney movies.
How can you not love Belle?
Belle is bratty and selfish.
You are completely crazy.  She's brave and strong and independent.
To you maybe.  To me, she'll always be a dumb girl who shouldn't run off to the woods.
I'm not sure we can be friends anymore.
