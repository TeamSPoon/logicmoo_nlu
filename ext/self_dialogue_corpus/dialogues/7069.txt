You know in Snow White, does she just break into a random house.
Yes.
And then doesn't she just act like its her house and sleeps in the first bed she finds despite the fact there are clearly already occupants.
Yes.
That's so rude.
Yeah but she was really tired and had a hard day running away from a homicidal witch.
True.
Something that did always bother me was how chilled the dwarves were to find a trespasser.
Didn't they just make her their maid or something.
Yeah that was really weird but it's not like she had anywhere else to go due to the aforementioned homicidal witch.
