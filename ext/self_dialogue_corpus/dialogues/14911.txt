Have you ever seen any of the Austin Powers movies?
Yeah, the one called "A Spy Who Shagged Me".
Haha, I love that one.
It's one of my favorite movies with Mike Myers.
Me too, But I did think he was a really good voice actor for Shrek.
That's a good point. Even though its a kids movie it still is really fun to watch.
Definitely. I wish Mike Myers did more voice acting for animated films.
He would have been a great addition to Toy Story.
Haha, definitely. I can only imagine how much more funny that movie would have been.
I'm sure it would be much more funny.
