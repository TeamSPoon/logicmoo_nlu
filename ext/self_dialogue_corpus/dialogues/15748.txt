How long has there been music?
That's an interesting question.
Well, what's the answer?
Animals have had music for millions of years. But, I assume you mean human music?
Yes, I'm interested in human music.
There's evidence for music dating back at least 50,000 years.
Wow, that'a amazing!
Yes, it is. It's equally amazing that music has been found in every single culture ever discovered.
Even in ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece?
Definitely. It's funny that you should mention Babylon.
Why's that?
It's where the oldest known song was discovered.
Wow, I wonder what it sounded like.
I've no idea, but there's one interesting thing. It was written using a music scale.
What does that mean?
Well, we still use scales today. The most common music scale is the chromatic scale with its majors and minors.
I understand a little bit about music theory.
But, that leads to another interesting point.
What's that?
Since it was written using a scale, there must have been a system in place. So, there's even older songs out there somewhere.
