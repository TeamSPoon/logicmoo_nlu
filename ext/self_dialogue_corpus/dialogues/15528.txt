I miss Whitney Houston.
Why you say that out the clear blue?
Because I was listening to that remix she did with George Michael last night.
She did a song with George Michael? What's the name of it?
It's called If I told You That. The song is fire and the video is even better.
They made a video together?
Yeah man. It's set in this club and they both like talking to each other through the music.
What you mean through the music?
Like each verse that each one sings is like they are talking to the other one. They friends but now they got feelings for each other.
I don't think I ever saw that.
I'm telling you dude, that thing is hot. They in the club and then they hit the dance floor.
Word?
They shut the dance floor down. Everybody in the club stops and just circled around watching them.
That thing sound like it's the truth.
It is. You can watch it on youtube.
That's whats up.
Yeah though, damn shame Whitney gone.
You talking bout Whitney? BOTH of them are gone..
Yeah, I forgot that George Michael passed as well.
Go add some of his music to your playlists. I'm definitely gone go download that video of him and Whitney you just told me about.
