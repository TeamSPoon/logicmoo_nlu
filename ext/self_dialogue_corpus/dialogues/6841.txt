Did you see Pocahontas?
I did
I wonder how accurate it was
It made it seem like the Indians worshiped nature
The colonists were just after money
The colonists were afraid of the Indians for no reason
Yeah, in the movie Pocohontas kept them from basically going to war
You would think the colonists would have been outnumbered
The Indians would have won
Yeah
