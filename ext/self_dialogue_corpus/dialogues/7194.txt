Have you heard their making a live action Lion King movie?
No way! Who's in it?
Donald Glover and Beyonce.
That's so cool, will they do the original songs.
I hope so, with Beyonce it might even be better than the original.
Nothing could be better than the original it's a classic.
Yeah you're right but it could come close.
Do you know when it comes out?
May 2019, I think.
Cool, I'll book tickets now then.
