Sid you hear the name of lady gagas newest album
No what is it
Its called joanne
Where did that come from
Its her middle name
Thats wierd that she named an album after her middle name
Her first name is stefani
Oh she probably didnt want to get the confused with gwens album
That makes sense
Yea thats what im thinking
