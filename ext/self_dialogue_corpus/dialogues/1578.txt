who do you think will win the superbowl this year
It's hard not to think the Pats are going to be there again
I guess but they didnt win in as much as the Falcons lost last year
I think you can argue that point which is couldnt they have just given up
Yes of course and I guess thats what makes them so good but again the Falcons threw the win away
Ok so thats one team do you think the Falcons are going back?
No way.
Why not?
I am not sure they were that good last year and Matty Ice had a great season
Thats true but they have a phenominal offensive array of weapons.
But what about their defense do you think they are good enough to help them get back?
Yes and no but truth is who has that great lockdown defense in the NFL now anyway?
Personally I like the Steelers I think they have all the ingredients they need to win
What about the Packers?
Great QB but not much else and even he couldnt get them to win a home game against the Giants
Oh now that you mention it the Giants! Yes they are pretty good
I dont like their running game and they are totally inconsistent but your right they are right there
They have a good not great defense
True. But what about their offense
Well they did rather well in this draft by plugging holes they had I think they have the best shot out of the NFC.
