This is a random question but did you ever listen to music from the 50's and 60's? You know, groups like The Beach Boys and The Beatles?
I listen to those artists all the time!  My favorite group was the Beatles.  Did you have a favorite song?
They had so many hits, where do I start?!  If I was forced to choose one I'd have to say 'I saw her standing there."
That's a good song! They really don't make music like that anymore do they?  The lyrics were so meaningful.
Did you have a favorite songs by them?
Yes, my all time favorite was 8 Days a Week.
That was in my Top 5!  Wouldn't it be cool if there was a group like that day?
That would be awesome!
I know a couple of them are still alive-- Isn't Paul McCartney still going on tour?
I think he is.  I wonder if he plays Beatles songs or if he mostly focuses on his newer stuff?
