So I am putting my son in music therapy.
Music therapy, I didn't know that was a thing.
Yeah, there are different kinds even, this course is just supposed to help with anxiety.
It sounds like holistic hippy stuff though.
It has science behind it and if you use a trained professional, results can be pretty amazing.
So do they just like, have him listen to music?
Well, yes, but while doing other things, and the music itself is special, they don't just turn the radio on.
Oh, interesting, honestly though, I'm not too convinced.
Well, it doesn't always work, but at this point we'll try anything to help him, and I don't see how it could hurt
I guess if you think about it, we do use music as our own therapy in a way.
Yeah, and it can make you feel great emotions, so why not try to capture and control that response?
Good point. You will have to let me know how it works.
Yeah, he starts Monday then it's twice a week, plus exercises at home too.
Cool, for how long?
As long as it's effective, they can keep changing the part of his life they are targeting.
So he could do this forever?
Well, maybe not through a paid therapist, but yeah, why not?
Oh I don't know, I just think it sounds exhausting to start something you will never get to stop.
But it's music, it's not like a rough and bad therapy.
I guess.
