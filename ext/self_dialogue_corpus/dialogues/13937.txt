Do you think Gaga will be able to continue to reinvent herself?
I don't see why not.
Yeah, I guess.
Look at how long Madonna was able to stay relevant.
Good point, or look at Cher.
Still, I don't think she'll be able to top her success from a few years ago.
She really caught the Zeitgeist with Bad Romance.
That video was terrific.
How about Telephone and the whole prison theme.
It was awesome, and Beyonce poisoned that guy! wow.
