Hi Jack!
Hi Nancy, I wanted to ask if you wanted to go to the movies?
Sorry,  I can't go tonight.  But I wanted to see a movie coming out next weekend.
Really, what was the movie?
The Mummy is the movie.
The one with Tom Cruise in it?
Yes, thats the one.
I haven't heard much about it, but I saw the previews.
Did you like it?
I did. Do you think it's a two hour movie?
Yes I believe it is.
I don't think we will be bored if we see it.
What did you want to see tonight that you were calling me about?
I wanted to see King Kong movie.
Ah I saw that one already!
Was it good?
Yes, it was a lot better than I thought it would be.
Great , well I think I will head over there tonight and watch it myself.
Have fun!
Thanks! I will see you next week!
