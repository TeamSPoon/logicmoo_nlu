Do you remember There's Something About Mary?
Wow, I haven't seen that one in years!
So you've seen it?
Sure, it was really popular when I was in high school.
What was your favorite part?
Wow, it was a lot of horrible humor.  I guess the hair gel part.
Yeah, that was horrible.
Who was the actress in it again?
I think Cameron Diaz.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was it.
