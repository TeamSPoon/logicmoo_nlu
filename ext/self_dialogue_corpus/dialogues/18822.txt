Seriously, has there been any good, major music in the last 15 years?
There always is, isn't there? It just depends on where you're looking, and what you're prepared to accept.
Seriously, don't talk about Jack White.
There's him, sure. And there are tons of older bands who have come back and reformed to do sort of interesting stuff -- Faith No More, My Bloody Valentine.
Yeah, but I mean something... new. Something that pushes the boundaries in the way that the White Stripes don't.
That's probably The Knife, then. Silent Shout is... maybe the only album you'll ever need.
I've heard some of their early stuff. It was... kind of annoying.
It can be! But there was a progression, and Silent Shout is in deep masterpiece territory.
Okay, noted. Is there anything else?
Janelle Monae is pretty interesting. Her first EP and LP are something else -- though there's a bit too much on the album.
I don't know who that is. What kind of music is this?
It's a stew of a million ingredients. Her big project is this yet-to-be-finished mega opus, based on an Afrofuturist sci-fi story.
That sounds, uh, ambitious. What do you mean it isn't finished yet?
It's this opera about an android revolt, split up into multiple acts. The first act is an EP that she recorded in her bedroom and released on Myspace; her first album makes up the second and third, and so on.
How many acts are we talking about?
I don't remember, but I think there's one more album coming. So far we've got one EP and two albums.
Is this, like, mainstream music? Or is this just some lady on the Internet?
Does it matter? I mean, it started as some girl on the Internet -- who got "discovered" and recorded a major-label album, and then started acting and all that jazz.
Acting? What's she been in?
You know Hidden Figures, about the ladies who made NASA work in the early days? That, for starters.
