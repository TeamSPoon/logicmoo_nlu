So, another horror film I've been meaning to see is The Witch.
Oh, yeah, I've seen that one!
Really?  Did you like it?
I thought it was great!  Lots of good performances, really suspenseful.  Now, I gotta warn ya though...
What's that?
Well, it's rather slow paced, and that bothered a lot of people.  It's more a psychological drama in many ways than a horror film.
Oh, well, I can still do that.  As long as the story's interesting.
Oh, it is.  It's set in the colonial times with this exiled Calvinist family.
Yeah, I gathered from the trailer is was during the time of the pilgrims.
Yeah, the director has been praised for really doing his research.
