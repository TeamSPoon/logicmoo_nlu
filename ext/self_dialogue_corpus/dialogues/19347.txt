Have you heard the new Imagine Dragons song?
No. What's it called?
Believer.
I do like their music.
Yea, I think Radioactive was good too.
It was played a lot on the radio.
Sometimes if it is played too much I get tired of it.
I know. There are so many songs that I can't stand to listen to becasue they are over played.
Well you should hear believer. The video is good too.
Did you see that on Youtube?
Yes. Thats where I see all the latest music.
I will have to check out the video.
It is a little grafic but the song is good.
I heard that Imagine Dragons was good live.
They seem like they would be.
Their style is appealing to a lot.
Its rock but not so much that those that like pop don't listen to it.
They have catchy songs.
Yep, the ones that sound good on the radio.
And get stuck in your head!
