You know what was an underrate movie?  Frailty.
Oh, the one with Bill Paxton in it from long ago.
That ending was really cool.
Total twist how he can actually see demons?
Right, and how Matthew Mcconaughey really killed his mother.
Yeah.  I totally didn't see it coming.
That was a very underappreciated movie.  Credit the screenwriter.
And the acting and directing.  It was a great film top to bottom.
It's a shame Bill Paxton didn't get to make more movies before he passed away.
Yeah, sad, he had some real talent.
