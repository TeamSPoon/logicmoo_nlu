Do you like Kate Hudson?
I like some of her movies.
Did you see her in the movie with Mark Whalberg?
The one on the oil rig?
Yes, Deep Water Horizon.
I seen it, such a drama.
It was based on a true story.
Wow, that is crazy.
I like how it showed how much they loved each other.
Hudson and Whalberg's characters?
Yes, even though they shared the screen very little.
I think it was good acting.
There is another movie like that, showing love with little shared screen time.
What is it called?
Lake House.
Who plays in it?
Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.
I do not know if I know it.
It involves time travel, kind of, romance and a bit of comedy.
Sounds a bit like Time Traveler's wife.
