It might sound weird but what is your favorite Disney Movie?
I think my favorite is Finding Nemo.
I love that movie. Did you see Finding Dory?
No my kids are older and I didn't get to watch it.
My kids are too but I had to see it.
Was it any good.
Yes, it was almost as good as the first. I like Dory's character.
Yes, Ellen is perfect for the voice.
Yes, she's good, I like her.
My second favorite would have to be Beauty and the Beast.
Yes, I like that one too. I like the Beast.
I almost forgot about Alladin.
That one was great. I watched that so many times with my kids.
Did you see the other ones they did of Alladin?
Yea, but I didn't think they were as good. Just ok.
Yea, me too.
Snow White is not a favorite, don't know why but Snow White gets on my nerves.
She's okay, but not a favorite.
I guess my next favorite would be Cinderella, but they shouldn't have done the sequels.
Yes, I like that one too, but didn't see the other ones.
