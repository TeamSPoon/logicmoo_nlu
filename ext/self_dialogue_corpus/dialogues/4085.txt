Did you ever see the thriller movie Vacancy?
Yes, I did. Not that long ago.
Now they run it on T.V. a lot.
That's where I saw it.
Makes you think when you go on vacation.
Yes, but who would just pull into a shady looking motel?
I guess now, nobody would.
Luke Wilson is a pretty good actor.
Yes, I like him.
He played a good part in that.
