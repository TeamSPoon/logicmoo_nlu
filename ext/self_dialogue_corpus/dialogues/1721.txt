I can't believe the Falcons blew such a demanding lead.
That is true, but what can you expect from some birds.
I wasn't expecting THAT, that's for sure.
Then what was it?
Something else.
In the NFL?
Isn't that what we are talking about?
I think so.
What team will you be rooting for next season?
A better question would be what team would I not be rooting for.
What team would you not be rooting for?
The Falcons!
Well, I am going to be rooting for them!
Is that so?
No, can't afford another heartbreak.
That's what you said after your second marriage...
Hey!
I'm going to be rooting for TB12.
Can't go wrong with that.
Unless, you know...
