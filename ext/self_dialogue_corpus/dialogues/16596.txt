Would you consider Hanson a one hit wonder
Absolutely i cant even recall the name of the single they had.
One of the brothers went on to form a rock band.
Still didnt have the success he had in the 90s I am sure.
No you are right they didnt.
What about other one hit wonders.
I dont know because I dont really listen to pop music like that.
Would you consider a band that had one hit but marginal hits after that a one hit wonder.
Like Smashmouth?
They had more than one hit.
It never came close to All star.
I think if we think about it we can come up with more.
Ok Fastball.
Oh yeah they had that song "the way"
And we never heard from them again.
Yeah some bands seem manufactured in that sense.
They ultimately are if you consider it.
I dont think its a bad thing if they write a good song.
No its not but the way the world is today you need an entire album.
Not necessarily, you get in and then you get out.
