What pop band is your all time favorite?
You know pop is such a loose term. There are so many genres. I would consider REM to be part of that especially in the later years.
Yeah, I agree. Their sound changed a lot over the years.
I know in the beginning there was grit and tooth to it. As the more recent albums were released it seemed more pop to me.
Loosing My Religion is such a huge song for me personally.
I know what you mean. I was going through a lot at the time and that song was mine.
It's almost this kind of struggle and angst that I just don't feel in the music of today.
No it is definitely a different vibe.
Yeah, I think it actually was the precursor to grunge which I think some songs could be pop rock.
I agree. The labels get confusing and pigeon holing bands doesn't help. I think bands cross genres with their music otherwise it would be so boring for them.
