Who's your favorite NFL team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals, but my family is full of Dallas Cowboy fans
Why do you like the Cardinals and not the Cowboys?
I think Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best receivers, if not one of the best players to ever play the game
I agree with you there, and I'd say the same about Odell Beckham Jr. on the Giants
You like the New York Giants?
They aren't my favorite team, but I do like OBJ and Eli Manning, and I'm excited about them getting Brandon Marshall
Yeah, now there's a great receiver tandem, like having Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski on the same team
Sure, but I hate the Patriots, even if they are full of talent
Me too; I'd like to see someone else winning in the AFC for once
How do you feel about the Steelers?
Same as you feel about the Patriots, I guess; I recognize the talent, but I'd like to see less of them overall
Makes sense, kind of how the Broncos faded into obscurity when Peyton Manning left
They still have a lot of great players like Von Miller and Demarius Thomas
I suppose so, but they didn't play so great last year
A lot of teams didn't play great but I think this next season is going to be a bit different with all the new acquisitions
Which team do you think is going to turn it around the most?
I think with a new coach and GM, the San Francisco 49ers have a pretty good shot
True, and there's nowhere to go but up when you have a two-win season and miss the playoffs
Man, I miss the old 49ers-Seahawks rivalry. Here's hoping the NFL is more competitive this season!
