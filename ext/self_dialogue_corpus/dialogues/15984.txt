What's your feeling on country music?
I like some of it, but I prefer the newer pop country.
Well then you don't like country! That is just a terrible version of true country.
Oh, I don't know. I think it is pretty catchy.
I'll agree that it can be catchy, but I'd take Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, George Jones, and that era over anything else.
Well, I do like Dolly Parton.
She's definitely got more traditional country and pop country too.
Yes, I have to admit though, I do think I like her older music better.
Did you know that she was the original singer of I Will Always Love You?
You mean before Whitney Houston?
Yes, it was originally Dolly's song.
I had no idea. I guess Whitney really made it famous though.
Yes, hers is more powerful ballad whereas Dolly's is just a sweet love song.
That's interesting. I really love what she does with Kenny Rogers.
Me too. I mean, it isn't Christmas without the Dolly/Kenny Christmas album.
That is so true. I grew up listening to that. Maybe that's why I'm partial to Dolly.
I just think it is really powerful that she draws on growing up very poor in many of her songs.
Yes, she's an excellent songwriter too.
I would love to see her in concert, but she's getting older so I don't know if she'll be touring much more.
Well if she does, just make sure you snag those tickets.
