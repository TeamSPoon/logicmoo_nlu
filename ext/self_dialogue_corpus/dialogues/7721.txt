So, Snap is awful. I am sorry, the Harry Potter fans are nuts, in the movies he was awful.
How do you figure that? He was a amazing!
He mentally tortured Harry and all his friends, for one.
But he was just trying to teach him a lesson.
No, he hated the kid's dad. He was an adult, jeez.
He also wanted it to look like he hated him, to Voldmort.
Sure, in the last couple movies. But, he did not have to be evil to the kid.
He loved Harry's mom.
Right, but was all mad she chose another guy. So he took it out on Harry.
But, in his dying breath he redeemed himself!
