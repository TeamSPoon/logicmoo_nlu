Do you like the Rolling Stones?
I never really followed their music, but there are a few songs I really like by them.
What are your favorites?
I like Beast of Burden and Paint it Black.  I probably like Sympathy for the Devil the best.
I always forget about Sympathy for the Devil.  It was such a good song.
Yeah, the storytelling in the lyrics are awesome.
I think the song was used in a movie I've seen.
I wouldn't doubt it.
The one I saw had the devil or a demon hopping from one person to another.
Oh, I know what you are talking about, but I don't remember the name.  The song played at the end.
