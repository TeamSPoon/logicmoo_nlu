Alright, real talk, is Lebron James the best of all time?
No, Michael Jordan. His Airness is the best.
How can you say that with how lebron is dominating the east for the past 7 seasons already and counting.
Michael Jordan was doing that in the harder east.
Are you kidding me? Jordan had to it against one hard team and that was the Knicks.
Are you kidding me? The Pacers were really good then.
You're joking me. I can make the same arguement, the Pacers were really good now.
Yes, both those two teams were very good teams that should have won a ring, but that's besides the point, Lebron plays in a weaker east.
Well, Lebron does it all. He can pass, rebound and play defense. He also scores well.
Yeah, but Jordan was clutch. He shot 50% at end game situations. What does Lebron do ?
He sets his teammates up in good situations to succeed at the end of the game.
Yeah, but Jordan grabbed the ball and did everything. Everyone in the building knew it was going to him also.
This is just proving Lebron is more unselfish, you're taking my point and helping it succeed.
You're not getting it. Lebron shies away from pressure.
Jordan is a generic gambler and a terrible human being.
So we're going to go into their personal lives? Who cares, we're talking about basketball.
Well, it's true. Lebron is a better human being than Jordan.
Oh please, I dont want to continue this awful conversation.
I won. Lebron is the best.
Whatever man, Jordan was better at basketball.
