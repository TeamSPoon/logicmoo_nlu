who do you thnk is the GOAT?
Well I know the media will tell you Tom Brady but I think thats debatable
agreed
who would you say is the best of all time
I would say top 5 would start with Brett Favre
and then?
probably Dan Marino
yeah I loved the Dolphins who else?
Payton Manning for sure would be another one
yeah he is really good in those Papa John commercials
lol yes he is, I would probably also include Big Ben
okay I can see where you are coming from but that guy is a jerk
yeah I am doing this on gameplay only not on how they are as a person
okay so include Big Ben who would be the last of the top 5
I would say Aaron Rodgers
Yeah Aaron is good but I think Eli Manning should be included
honestly?  why him he's not that good
Here is why he has 2 superbowl rings and can turn it on when he needs too
yeah he for sure has more rings than his brother
I know right
