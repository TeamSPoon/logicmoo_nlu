Hey, do you like funny movies?
Oh yea, my favorite is Bridesmaids with Melissa McCarthy. She is hilarious.
I know, she cracks me up. My favorite part of that movie was where Lillian crapped in the street.
HAHA, yes! Maya Rudolph nailed it. Did you know that was her husband in real life who plays the air marshall.
Wow that is awesome. I couldnt work with my husband.
Oh girl me either, but if he were funny like the air marshall, or if Wilson Phillips were part of it I probably could.
Right? The end there was great too, where they all did the dance.
Oh yes, and the take one with the sandwich and video camera. I really could watch this movie over and over.
Me too. And if i could go by the cops and not get pulled over, while "look no one is driving" or littering, wouldnt it be great?
Yes it would, unfortunatley we arent rich and famous!!
