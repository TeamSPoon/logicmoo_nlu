I read the other day that a lot of the structure of Star Wars was based Akira Kurosawa movies.
What are those?
Old samurai flicks. But once you see them, it totally makes sense.
How so?
Like, Luke losing his home and having to fight is a plot point in a lot of samurai movies.
Hmm. Interesting.
And they do fight with swords, despite being in space and having guns.
Well, lightsabers are basically lasers.
Yeah, but it still reminds me of a sword.
I can see that.
