Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet was it good.
I haven't seen it. We should rent it.
I wonder if they have it out on Netflix.
I am not sure it was an older one that I saw.
That is a bummer!
Who is Bella in the movie?
Emma Watson. She is a super great actress!
The beast is Dan Stevens.
I am unsure who he is. We should still watch it.
