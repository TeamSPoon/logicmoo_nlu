Did you see the new version of Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did, wasn't it amazing?!
I liked it better than the original.
Me too, what was your favorite part of the movie?
I loved the part when Belle was entertained at dinner by the household items.
Oh yes that was a beautiful scene.
I also loved the music.
The music and songs are awesome, I find myself humming them all the time.
My favorite song is Be our Guest.
I think I like the song about Gaston, it's funny!
