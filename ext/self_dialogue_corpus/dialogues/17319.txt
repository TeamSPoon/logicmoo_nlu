What is your favorite punk rock band?
You know I really like more pop punk, so I'd have to say Green Day.
Hey, they're a great band.
You like them too?
Oh yeah. How could I not?
What's your favorite album of theirs?
Hands down, Dookie. When I Come Around is an awesome song.
Dookie has some fantastic hits, so I get it.
What's your favorite Green Day album?
I like Nimrod. Hitchin' A Ride is a hilarious song.
Nimrod definitely has some good stuff to offer.
So what is your favorite punk band?
I don't know that it's still considered a punk band, but I really like Fall Out Boy.
The band has changed its musical style a bit over the years, but I think they're still a pop punk band.
Me too. I really like their older stuff, which is the more punk rock music they have.
Yeah, like I like Sugar, We're Going Down and Dance, Dance.
Those are super-catchy songs.
That's why I like them so much--they're punk but they're not hard to get into.
Yeah, plus the band's newer music isn't too bad either. Like Uma Thurman.
That's a really fun song. See, I think they're still a great band, even if the music has changed.
