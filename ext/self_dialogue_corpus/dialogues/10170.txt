What was Nicholas Cage's best movie?
He's been in some pretty good ones and some bad ones.
I would probably say The Rock.
Nah.  Face-Off.
That movie was too ridiculous.  The premise alone was dumb.
And The Rock was more believable?  He took down a team of soldiers.
I'm not saying it wasn't far-fetched, but at least it was in the realm of plausible.
Face transplants can happen.  I read an article about it.
There's a difference between some medical journals and what happens in the movies.
You're just jealous because I'm the good looking one.
