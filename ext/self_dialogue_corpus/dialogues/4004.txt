What is your favorite thriller movie?
The Bourne Identity
That entire series is great!
I agree!  Some of Matt Daemons Finest!
Do you think the movies get better or worse as the series progresses?
That's a hard one.  I'll have to say though that they only vary a little bit in how good they are
That's kinda my thoughts as well
Yea, I mean he does such a bang up job in each film
And the story doesn't get too boring or some reason
Yea, good writing!
