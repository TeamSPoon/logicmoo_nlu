Have you heard of "A Perfect Circle"?
I think so... but not sure.
Well, have you heard of Tool?
Yeah!
Well, APC is the side project of Tool's singer Maynard James Keenan.
Oh, okay! Any big hits I would have heard of.
Definitely. One that comes to mind is "Judith" from 2000.
I'll look it up.
Also "3 Libras" from 2001?
Oh, I've definitely heard that one before!
The reason why I'm asking is because they're going on tour this fall.
Oh really? Are they coming into the area?
Yeah, at the end of November.
Nice! With who?
Not sure yet, are you interested in going with me?
Maybe! Do they have any new music I should be catching up on?
Not really, I think they're working on a new disc right now that's supposed to be out next year.
Ok, well what about before that? What's their latest one?
Way back in the early 2000's, but it's called "Thirteenth Step" and worth checking it out!
Great, I will!
