Hey buddy, what's your favorite team?
The Philadelphia Eagles!
Cool man. You like Carson Wentz?
Yeah, he's young, but I like him.
Yeah. He throws a bit weird.
He misses high a lot, but I think he has great potential.
You like the free agents they signed?
Yup! Love Alshon Jeffrey!
He's good but always hurt. But I see why they signed him
Yeah, you gotta take risks though, you know?
I think the Carolina Panthers win it all this year.
They could. They have a QB & defense.
Yeah, seems like everything after that falls into place.
I usually like teams in warmer weather though to win it all.
Like Tampa or Miami?
Yes. Easier to play in that weather I think.
I don't know, man. It can be difficult playing on the cold in December.
Yeah, but how often does it snow during a game?
I see your point. Who knows who will win the Super Bowl?
Can't wait to watch and find out!
