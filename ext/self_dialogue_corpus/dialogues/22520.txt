I just wasted over an hour of my life.
What are you talking about?
Clown Town.
I'm almost afraid to ask but what is Clown Town?
A crappy movie I just rented and will be returning immediately.
I've never heard of that movie.
There is good reason why you haven't.
What was the movie about?
A group of friends get stranded in a seemingly deserted small town and find themselves stalked by a violent gang of psychopaths dressed as clowns.
That doesn't even sound interesting to me.
If you are  in need of a homicidal clown extravaganza this spooky season, then check out Clown Town.
It sounds generic and boring.
It is very boring.
Are these teenagers or twenty somethings?
Twenty somethings. They driving through Ohio on their way to a concert when one of them leaves her cellphone at a roadside diner.
What do they do? Did they turn around and go after the cellphone?
Nope.  They call the phone, and the person who answers instructs them to head to Clinton, a nearby small town where he'll meet them.
That's their first mistake.
They head to the town, which has apparently been deserted since a catastrophic train accident years earlier. Deserted, that is, except for a bunch of homicidal maniacs wearing differently styled clown costumes and makeup
I don't think I want to know anymore about this movie.
