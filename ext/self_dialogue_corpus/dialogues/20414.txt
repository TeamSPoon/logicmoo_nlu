What is your favorite movie?
Oh that's a tough one, I think The Prestige.
What's it about?
It's a really cool movie about magicians.
What makes it cool?
It's directed to be kind of like a riddle.
What do you mean?
They start off with a lot of confusing things and plot points.
Oh, that's weird. What else does it do?
Well, it has David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, so that's pretty cool.
Wow, really? That's neat.
Yeah he did a good job, you wouldn't even know it was him.
Interesting. What else did you like?
The movie was kind of dark, but I like the cat and mouse type interaction between the two main characters.
Who are they?
There's an American guy I think played by Hugh Jackman, and an English guy played by the same guy who does Batman.
Oh man, why haven't I heard of this movie before?
It's not really that popular I think, I'm not sure why.
Yeah I can't believe I've never heard of it.
Wait until you see it though, you'll want to watch it all over again once it's finished.
