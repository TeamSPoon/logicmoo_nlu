Did you hear that Olivia Newton John's cancer has come back?
Remember that I am younger than you.  Who is Olivia Newton John?
Did you ever see the movie Grease?
Oh, yes.  I've seen that.  Is she Sandy?
Yes, she played Sandy.
I didn't know she had cancer!
She had breast cancer about twenty five years ago and it went into remission, but it returned and has metastasized in her back.
Wow, that is rotten luck for her!
Yes, it is.  She was scheduled for a tour this summer and cancelled.  She was coming here to Arkansas.
Were you planning to go to the concert?
I was thinking about it.  I saw her years ago in Atlanta at Chastain Park and she was fantastic.
She still has a good voice, then?
I'll admit that she didn't seem to hit some of the high notes she used to.
Some singers lose range as they get older.
Yes.  But, she was like the first singer for me to be crazy about when I was a kid.
Did you like her because of Grease?
Partially.  But, I also loved Xanadu.
What is Xanadu?
I was another movie she was in.  She was a roller skating muse.
That sounds really weird!!
