I really miss alternative music.
Is there a particular reason why?
It the music I listened to most while I was in school.
Did you have any favorite bands?
I really liked Pearl Jam.  But at that time, anything playing on the radio was good.  Do you have a favorite era of music?
The 80s of course.
What bands did you like?
All of them, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Blondie.  I can't even name them all.
It's interesting to see a lot of those musicians now.  Who would have thought they would grow so old?
The songs from the 80s films were very iconic.
Yes, they were.  I am going to listen to an 80s cover band this weekend.
Really?  Sounds like fun.
It is.  I saw them play last year and it's always fun because everyone sings along, remembering their glory days.
Are you going to dress up in the 80s style?
No, but once we had an 80s party and I dressed like Madonna of old.
Not old Madonna.
She looks so different now.
She really does and not in an aging gracefully kind of way.
What song of hers was your favorite?
I liked Material Girl.
