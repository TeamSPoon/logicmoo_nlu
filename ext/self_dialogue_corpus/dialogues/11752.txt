Did you know that The Beatles biggest musical rival was Elvis Presley?
No I did not know that.
Yes , Elvis had 21 number one hits but the Beatles only had 17.
They are both great in their own right!
They sure are. The first Beatles song to hit number one was Love Me Do.
Oh yes. I believe that was written by Lennon and McCartney.
You are right about that.
What was the second hit?
It was She Loves You.
That was a great song too.
