You know which band I really miss?
Which one?
The Wallflowers.
They had some good diddies.
That one song they did that was pretty popular is my favorite.
One Headlight?
Yeah.
That was an awesome song.
I can't really remeber any of the others.
One hit wonders.
So many bands like that.
Like Right Said Fred.
What did he do.
I'm too sexy.
"For my shirt."
"For my car."
"Too Sexy by far"
That song was so annoying.
I remeber it was on the Encino Man sound track.
That was a cool show.
