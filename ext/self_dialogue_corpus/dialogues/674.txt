How do you think the redskins will shape up this year?
I'm not sure.
They seemed to get more athletic in the draft.
Who did they draft?
Jonathan Allen was number one.
They were lucky he was there at seventeen.
Yes,and,they addded his,Alabama teammate Ryan Anderson.
He would give them insurance on the edge.
Didn't they draft a corner too.
Yes,Fabian Moreau.
Right,from ucla.
Yes,that's right.
Do you think they can win with Kirk cousins at qb?
He can be good.
Yes,but he can be bad too.
He's got a good receiver in terrelle Pryor.
Yes he does.
Jamison crowder is growing as a target.
He's coming into his third year right?
Yes he is.
