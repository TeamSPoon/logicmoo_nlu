I heard that the original movies didn't have stunt doubles.
That's probably not correct.
They may have had some, but not many due to lack of money.
What scenes did the actors have to do?
You remember the one where Luke and Leia swing across the gap?
Sure, I remember it.
That was really the actors doing it.
But I'm sure the gap wasn't bottomless.
Of course not, was only 30 feet or so, but interesting nonetheless.
I do my own stunts in real life!
