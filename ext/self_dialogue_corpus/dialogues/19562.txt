Okay, let's talk covers.
Okay, great!
What do you think are some of the best covers ever?
Well, I really liked Zeromancer's "Send Me An Angel".
Really, don't think I've heard fo that group.
Yeah, they're a rock/metal group from Europe, their cover of that song is awesome.
Okay, what are some other ones you like?
Well, in a similar vein, I like Goldfinger's "99 Red Balloons".
Is that another European metal group?
Yes, it is.  I think they're from Germany but I'm not sure.
Interesting.
Yeah, they do a real heavy, fast rendition of the song, it's pretty cool.  Also, guss what?
What?
Well, you know how the original song was written in German right?
Yeah?
Well, at the main climax of the song they sing the original German lyrics.
Oh, that's pretty awesome!
Yeah, you should definitely look it up on Youtube or something if you get a chance.
I'll check it out.
Yes, be sure you do!
