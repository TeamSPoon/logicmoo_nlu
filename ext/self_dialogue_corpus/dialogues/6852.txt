I feel like all of Disney's direct to DVD sequels are a waste of time.
What do you mean? The company certainly profits from them.
Yeah, but it should be about more than the money; the story should mean something.
Well, there must be one good direct to DVD sequel.
Cinderella's are terrible, Bambi's aren't very good, Aladdin's are just average, Belle's was terrible and so was Ariel's, so.
Yes, but wasn't the Rescuers Down Under a sequel?
Oh, I forgot about that one! Isn't that the one where they're in Australia?
Yes, and they help the little boy and there's an eagle.
Okay, you have a point, that one is really good.
I loved Miss Bianca and Bernard, they were so cute!
