Do you think rap is better today or back in the 90's
Definitely back in the 90's
I feel the same way, Like today rappers don't really say anything that has a lot of meaning or depth.
Exactly like Soulja Boy he is retarded. I can't believe he sold even one album.
Definitely and that song Pretty Boy Swag is not exactly Nas or Tupac.
Yeah these new rappers are really lame. I wonder if someone dropped on their by accident when they were a baby.
That's too funny. So who is your favorite new rapper out right now?
that would have meek mills
I love meek mills. He's from Philly
I'm from too home of the cheese steaks.
