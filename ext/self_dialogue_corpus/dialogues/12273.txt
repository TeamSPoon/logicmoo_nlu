I'm not sure I'm down with the new Star Wars plot.
Why not?
It kinda paints Skywalker as a coward.
How so?
The galaxy's in trouble, and he just runs away?
He was being hunted by his Padawan!
True, but turn tail and run?
I see your point, but I'm not sure he had much of a choice....
Meaning?
Stick around and kill (or be killed) by his nephew, or leave.
