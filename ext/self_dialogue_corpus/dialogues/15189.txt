I wonder what Moby has been up to lately.
I saw him in a magazine a few months back.
I don't think he's making any new music lately.
No I doubt it.
I wonder how long he's been vegan.
He's very skinny and pale so I'm guessing a long time.
I wonder if his veganism had any effect on his music.
I'm sure subconsciously it did.
True, his music was always very light and peaceful.
Much like his attitude towards animals I'm guessing.
I wonder if he ever used any animals sounds in his songs.
That would have been cool.
Trance music with animals sounds would be cool.
A lot of the tones in his trance music could resemble animals sounds already though.
True, maybe that's what he was going for.
I wonder if his music was actually designed for animals.
How do you mean?
Like what if he made trance music to help animals relax.
Interesting theory.
Go get the dog, let's see if he likes Moby's music.
