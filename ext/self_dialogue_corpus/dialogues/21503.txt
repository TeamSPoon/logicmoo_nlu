What kind of movies do you like?
I like many different kinds of movies, but I hate horror movies.
So, I guess you haven't seen any horror movies, then.
No, I haven't, but I did see a funny movie with my kids.
What's that?
It was called Boss Baby,
Oh, I heard that wasn't so good, but you liked it?
Yes, I loved it; the baby was voiced by Alec Baldwin.
Oh, he must have been funny.
Yes; I hope he does a sequel.
I didn't know he was a voice actor.
I didn't either; the last movie I saw him in was Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.
That movie was depressing.
I did see that, and I agree; the main character suffered from an awful mental illness.
Most of Woody Allen's movies entertain me more than that one.
Yes,  he's always been one of my favorite directors.
I agree, but I liked his earlier work a lot more.
Which movies did you like?
I like the classics, like Hannah and her Sisters, and Manhattan.
Those are great, but my favorite was actually Radio Days.
