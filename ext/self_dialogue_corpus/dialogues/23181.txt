Where would you rank Tom Cruise in the pantheon of actors?
Geez I dont know he isnt that great of an actor.
I loved Mission Impossible.
Yeah that was a good series, Top Gun was also not that bad.
I think he was an excellent actor in Jerry Maguire.
Maybe he isnt as bad as we think.
Yeah maybe we are too rough on him.
He is no Liam Neeson.
I dont think thats true.
He is more of a thriller suspense actor.
Yeah he has played in a variety of roles though.
Did you like him in Schindler's List?
Of course, I thought Ralph Fiennes played a fine role as well.
Was that supposed to be funny?
No I am being serious.
Yeah he did do a good job to be honest with you.
So do you think that the movie was epic?
I was not a huge fan of it being black and white
How did we get from Tom Cruise to Schindler's List?
I dont know its kind of funny.
