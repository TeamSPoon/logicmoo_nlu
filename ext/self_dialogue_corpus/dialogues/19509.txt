Do you listen to much local music?
Well I grew up in a city with a long history of bands, so it would have been difficult to avoid it.
Ah see I grew up in the country where the local music scene was some guy who would sing in the village pub.
Yeah I can't imagine growing up like that.
So which city did you grow up in?
Glasgow in Scotland. There weren't many bands until punk, which seemed to have inspired a whole generation of kids.
Now you mention it I can't think of any Glasgow or even Scottish groups from the '60s.
Yeah it's a real mystery. There was one group called The Poets who had a minor hit single but that's about it.
So what about the bands when you were growing up, did you go to many gigs?
Yes I was tall for my age so I could pass for an adult when I was 15, at least enough to fool the doormen.
15! Did your parents not mind?
Oddly enough no, they were both musicians so they saw it as a good thing. And a lot of gigs at the time would go on until 2am!
That's amazing, my village would shut down at 7 o'clock!
Yes I remember sleeping on the school bus the next day a lot. It was worth it though, I got to see lots of great stuff.
Go on then, make me jealous.
Well I grew up in the '80s so I got to see bands like Primal Scream, Teenage Fanclub and Jesus and Mary Chain when they were starting up.
Oh I love Primal Scream, I had no idea they'd been around for so long.
They sounded a lot different in those days though, jangly guitars like the Byrds.
Ah so more like the C86 stuff? That fits in with the timescale I suppose.
Yes around that time, there was a lot of that stuff about! I blame The Pastels.
