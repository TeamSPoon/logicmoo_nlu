I like Clint Eastwood. Did you ever see Gran Torino?
Yes that was a great movie.
It was sad at the end though.
Yes I cried at the end.
The car was nice in the movie also.
Yes would love to have that car.
What about Million Dollar Baby?
Another sad but good one.
Yes Clint was the only one she had her family treated her really bad.
Sad she had to die over the that low blow.
