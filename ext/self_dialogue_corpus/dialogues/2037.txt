What do you think about the Steelers for this year?
Ugh, I am kind of worried.
I think they did well on the draft with Watt.
For sure. They addressed the needs there well.
I think some of the free agent stuff was dubious though.
I disagree. I think some of the new signings were solid, the released the right people
I guess we will see.
The only thing I am worried about is lack of depth
No kidding.
I am not entirely sure what to do if our starters go down.
What about Ben?
I know. They still haven't figured out the QB situation.
I think they need to draft one regardless next year
I know me too.
Take a risk/flier on someone
Getting career backups isn't going to solve the problem
I agree. And then we have the issue of the WR's
I think there is a good group they just need more time and reps
I think that could be said about the entire team
Valid point
