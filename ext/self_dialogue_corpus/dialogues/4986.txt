How was the Phillies game last night?
It was pretty cool.
How so?
They won in the bottom of the 9th.
Really?
Yes, it was amazing.
I didn't see it.
Yeah, Joe hit a grand slam in the last inning.
Wow! That's cool.
Who was pitching?
Smith was pitching.
Is he undefeated?
No, but his ERA is 1.4.
Wow! That is super.
Will you be going to any games this year?
Yes, in June I'm going to see them play the Mets.
Oh, that should be a good game.
Yeah.  I don't like the Mets so I hope the Phillies win.
Me too.  I am not a Mets fan.
I can't wait to go and have fun!
