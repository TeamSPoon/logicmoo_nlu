Can you guess how many football players have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?
I didn't know any of them did.
There's one.
I have no clue as to who it would be.
Terry Bradshaw.
Oh he played with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Not only that, but he became a game analyst for CBS after he quit playing.
I know he also appeared in different TV shows and movies.
Not that long ago I watched him in a reality series called Better Late Than Never.
Oh the show with William Shatner and Henry Winkler. I loved that show.
Me too, and he was really funny when he got drunk.
I read where the show was renewed for a second season.
I'll be sure to watch it.
Considering so many football players go broke when their careers are over, it's nice to see that he continued on to do other things after football.
Especially since having such a great career in the sport.
Sure between winning MVP and being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
And think of the energy he still has for his age.
I know.
Well I'm going to look forward to the new season of his show.
So am I and we should watch it together.
