What's your all time favorite rock band?
Guns & Roses hands down.
How come?
They had the most influence on me growing up.
Oh yeah? How so?
I think them being a part of the Terminator 2 soundtrack really got me to pay attention to their music.
That's cool, so what would you say is you all time favorite song from them?
I'd have to say it's You Could Be Mine. I mean theres a ton of songs that I like from them but that one just has a special place.
How do you feel about their current music?
Honestly it's not as good as their stuff in the 80's but thats not to say they aren't good anymore.
