do you like pop music
no not at all not new pop anyway
why not
it all sounds the same to me
what about Lady Gaga, and people like her
no not at all
really, no current music
none at all, it is all so cliche
I disagree
you must be young
well kind of
I am older and prefer older music
like what
70's 80's
wow that is old
you should try some older music and you would see the difference
who do you reccomend
that depends on what type you want to listen to
say old 80's rock
then try Whitesnake, Pink Floyd the wall just to start
