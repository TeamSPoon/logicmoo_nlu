Do you like Weezer?
Oh yeah!  Every once in a while I definately like to listen to them.
What do you think your favorite song was when they were just beginning?
I'd have to say Say it Ain't So.  That song is awesome!
I agree.  I like that one and Undone.
My Name is Jonas was good too.
Do you like any of their later stuff?
Yeah, they've always been pretty consistent.  Their album from the mid-2000s was pretty good.
The Make Believe album?
I think that was it.
