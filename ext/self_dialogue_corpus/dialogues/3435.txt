How did you feel about Signs?
It was so good.
The scene where hes  trying to beat the alien with the bat.
And Mel Gibson tells him to swing away?
Yeah that scene, it made the movie so great.
I think Gibson did a great job.
He did but so did the kids in that film.
It was pretty cool.
I just wish they didnt show the aliens, the aura of not knowing what they looked like.
Yeah I know what you mean but it made you fearful even more.
