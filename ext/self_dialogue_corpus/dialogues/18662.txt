Hey, guess what?
What?
I have tickets to see Little Mix in concert!
Little Mix?
Excuse me? You haven't heard of Little Mix?
No, I can't say that I have.
They are the best girl group in the world right now. Period.
Oh, I like Fifth Harmony.
Fifth Harmony has nothing on Little Mix. Not choreography, not vocals, not talent.
I think they're pretty good, and have some catchy songs.
They can't even get along with one another, that one girl already left the band.
They just made the band even tighter and better since she left.
I have to introduce you to Little Mix. You won't ever look back.
I'm always open to try new music, but I love Fifth Harmony.
Just try their new single "Power".
I'll try it later. I just wish you could see Fifth Harmony is doing great too.
I mean, I'm not doubting that. I'm sure they are. I just feel like Little Mix is better.
They can both exist and be good. We shouldn't pit them against one another.
You're right, I apologize.
I mean, it's fine. I just would like to not pit women against each other is all.
