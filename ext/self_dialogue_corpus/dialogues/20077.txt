Do you like foreign films?
Not really.
Why not?
I hate movies with subtitles.
Ugh, you're such a typical American.
What do you mean?
Americans are notorious for not watching foreign films for that very reason.
Oh...
So that means you've never seen Let the right one in?
Nope. What's that?
It's an amazing Swedish vampire movie.
Oh...I don't like vampires movies anyways. Too scary.
Yeah, but this one isn't even that scary, it's actually more of a love or friendship story.
Like Twilight?
Yes, but no. Not at all.
I don't like Twilight. I don't like teeny movies.
It's not a teen movie.
Then what is it?
Forget it.
Alright..
