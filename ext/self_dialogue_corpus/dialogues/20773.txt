Have you seen "Coraline"?
No, I haven't, what kind of movie is it?
It's a stop-motion picture based on a storybook.
So it's kid-friendly?
Hm, see, it's animated, but it might be a little scary for kids to see.
Are there any famous voices in it?
Yes, Teri Hatcher from "Desperate Housewives," and Dakota Fanning voice some of the characters.
That sounds great, I love both of these actresses.
It's also a great movie for those who have a big imagination. It's really seen through a child's eyes.
Where does the movie take place?
So Coraline has recently moved from Michigan to Oregon.
That's great! So it includes all of that great Pacific Northwest scenery?
Oh, absolutely, it looks dreary and rainy for some parts, but it also looks nice and snowy, with those Evergreen trees at some parts.
What's the story about?
Coraline has recently moved from Michigan to Oregon, and her parents are renting an apartment at a house full of interesting characters. Coraline stumbles upon a hidden doorway in her house, which leads her to another world. The same characters are in this other world, they're just different forms of themselves.
Wow, that sounds really cool! How is the animation?
Oh, it's beautiful. There's a lot of blue, which I know is your favorite color.
I really do love blue and stop movie films. Sounds like a must-see.
You can stream it now! I think I saw it on Netflix.
Ok, I think I'll head home and try to watch it. I can't wait!
