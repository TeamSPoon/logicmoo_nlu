What did you think of the bar scene in the original Star Wars?
The one where Luke and Ben meet Han and Chewie?
Yeah, that's the one.
I thought it was really neat when I was younger, but now not so much.
Yeah, some of the costumes haven't aged very well.
Right, some really ridiculous looking aliens
I liked when Obi Wan chopped off the guy's arm though
Oh yeah that was cool. One of the first time seeing a lightsaber in action.
Right, cool scene
Yeah, lightsabers are rad
