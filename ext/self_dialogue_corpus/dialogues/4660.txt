MLB clubs had a total revenue of over $10 billion last year.
That's a lot of omney
More money than we will ever see, dream, or do anything with .
Oh I can dream.
But more than what we know what to do with.
Maybe.
See, how much do these players make tops?
Every year? or over their careers?
I don't know. Whichever. What do they make? Who's the highest paid baseball player over his career?
Alex Rodriguez. He made over 399 million over his career. So since 1994, that's 22 years, so that's like 18 mill a year
That's gotta be nice.
To imagine. Play the game you love. get paid 18 mil a year for that
That's nice.
That's an understatement. That's fantastic. That's the dream life for many. It's the American dream. Too bad he's a an immigrant from Dominican Republic, wait. that make it even more of the American Dream
NO he was born in New York, but moved to Dominican Republic when he was young.
Is that right?
yep
But he didn't get 18 mil every year, he started with 2.3 mill at Mariners.
Back in 1994, what's that worth now?
It's about 3,85 mill. Still respectable even to this date.
