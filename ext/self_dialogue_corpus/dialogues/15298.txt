Okay, best concert ever?
This one is easy. Bruce Springsteen, 1978, Darkness on the Edge of Town tour.
I can't disagree. I hadn't been to too many concerts at that point, but I knew he was something special.
Yes, and I've never seen anything likerhim since. I haven't seen any of his concerts since that were as good, although all are incredibly good.
Watching him dance up there with so much energy, even after playing for 3 hours was incredible.
Yes, and Clarence Clemmons' solos felt like you could fly away on them.
God rest his soul.
Yeah, that was a big loss for the world.
Max Weinberg made me LOVE the drums starting at that concert.
I loved the stories he told, and the way he weaved them into the song intros.
Oh, for sure. Rosalita!
And Spirit in the Night!
You know, maybe the greatest accomplishment of Bruce Springsteen (among many accomplishments) is the way he has made so many thousands of people, more like hundreds of thousands, so intensely happy for at least a few hours in their life.
I can't argue with that. As you said, so many accomplishments, but making people happy is important. Without happiness it's hard to feel alive, and happiness is so rare for most people in this tough world.
I think it's so impressive that all his albums stand up, after all these years.
True, true. I still love Greetings from Asbury Park and I still play it.
Oh, me too, me too. And some of his albums that weren't such huge hits are still fantastic.
Right, Nebraska, Human Touch --
Lucky Town, released at the same time as Human Touch, and Tunnel of Love.
I could listen to Bruce all night. Maybe I'll turn on my all Bruce play list when I get home.
