What are your favorite trends right now?
It's so hard to say. I really like the look of the cold-shoulder top.
Really? I don't like that one as much.
Why not?
It just looks impractical, you know? Like why wear a long-sleeved top but have a bit cut out?
I guess I can see that. So what are your favorite trends?
I like the new trends in jeans.
With all the rips?
No, the shape--I like that it's more relaxed, not like skinny jeans.
Yeah, me too. Much more comfortable!
True. Anything you really don't like?
I don't really like the midi skirt--it's such an awkward length to pull off if you're not tall.
I agree. It makes my legs look really short.
What else don't you like?
Well, midi skirts, the cold-shoulder thing, and millenial pink.
I love millenial pink!
Why? It's so boring!
It's like a neutral, but more fun!
I guess so, but it's not for me.
That's fine--more millenial pink cold-shoulder tops for me!
