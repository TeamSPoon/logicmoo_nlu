Am I the only one annoyed at Emma Watson's eyebrows ever since the fourth movie?
Am I the only one annoyed at Emma Watson's HAIR ever since the THIRD movie?
No you are not. I HATE how pretty they made her.
The Yule Ball was supposed to be this huge transformation, but she was gorgeous already!
And not to mention she's supposed to be the poster child for brains over beauty, yet she almost jeopardizes the laws of time and space because she's upset about how her hair looks.
Steve Kloves does NOT know how to write his favorite character, does he.
Well he also tried to set her up with Harry.
Yeah, if you only watch the films, it looks like they're a way better couple.
Also remember when they were almost caught by the Snatchers because Hermione, HERMIONE, was wearing perfume?
I try not to.
