It's a real shame about the Blues not advancing to the finals, isn't it?
Yeah, it is. I'm bummed.
Who'd they lose to, the Predators?
Yeah, Nashville beat them 3-1.
At least they made it to game 6!
Yeah. Did you hear about Tarasenko?
He has to have surgery, right?
No, that's what the Russian news reported but it wasn't right.
Huh!
Yeah he claims he won't need surgery.
He played well this season. How do you think Mike Yeo did as head coach?
I think he did pretty well.
I'm kind of glad they let Hitchcock go.
We'll see how Yeo does.
I think it sets us up for next season.
Possibly. I'd love to see us in the Cup someday.
Me too, but you know how it goes--always in the semis, never in the finals.
Ain't that the truth!
Well maybe next year will be our year.
I hope so! Let's Go Blues!
