Do you listen to Coldplay or Dave Matthews Band?
I like them both.
They're great. Do you own any of their albums?
I have the "A Head full of dreams" album by Coldplay, and "Ghost Stories" by them as well.
Both great albums. I have "Parachutes" and every album that came after.
Oh wow- you must be a big fan of theirs.
I am. They're great.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Three times. Best concerts I've ever been to.
Do they sound as good live as they do on their albums?
Oh yeah, they are so talented.
I like, "Clocks", "Viva la Vida", "A Sky full of stars" and "Hymn for the Weekend"
"Hymn for the weekend" is one of their best songs in my opinion.
Dave Matthews is great, too.
They are. Another talented band.
I don't have any of their albums.
You should pick them up. They're great. I saw them in concert, too.
They did a song with Alanis Morisette, but I can't remember the name of it.
It's called, "Spoon". It's a great, great song. Alanis sounds awesome in it.
Yeah I'm a fan of hers, great vocals.
