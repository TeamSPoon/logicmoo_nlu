Are the righteous brothers really brothers?
No they are not.
I was never sure.
Their names were bill medley and Bobby Hatfield.
I loved unchained melody.
Very powerful song.
Some tremendous vocals.
You've lost that loving feeling is another good one.
That was in the eighties.
Rock and roll heaven has got to be my favorite.
That's was out in 1974.
Quite awhile ago.
The great pretender was good.
They've had so many.
I'm so lonely and I still love you in the sixties.
It's non stop.
Hit after hit.
There harmonies were good.
Always right on
All of the time
