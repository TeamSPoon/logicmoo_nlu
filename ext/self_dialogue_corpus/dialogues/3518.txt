Can you imagine "The Omen" was forty-one years ago? It's still on the best horror lists.
Of course it is. The music alone makes it super scary.
Gregory Peck and Lee Remick had lots of chemistry. I wonder if they acted together before.
I don't know, but that kid was so scary. He was so innocent looking, but the evil ones always do.
I wonder how they pulled off that fall scene. It looked like Hitchcock.
I know. She was all broken up. It was so good in slow motion.
Do you think they're going to do a remake? That would be awful.
They're probably considering it. They can get Bruce Willis to be the Dad.
Would you just go to a park to meet someone when they seem crazy? That priest even looks crazy.
If they mentioned my wife I would, but I would have definitely told others, or have others watching me.
