What is your all-time favorite movie?
Oh jeez, no way can I pick just one.
Okay, then one of your favorite movies
Parenthood
That's a tv show.
No, no it was a movie first.  It came out in 1989.
Who's in it?
Steve Martin, Jason Robards, Keanu Reeves
Oh I think I did see it.  Wasn't it the one where Steve Martin's kid was really nervous and there was that old grandmother?
Yes! That's it.
I think I saw it years ago.  I completely forgot about it.
I love the movie.  It's so funny and got sweet scenes.
Ron Howard directed that right?
Yep.  The only part I didn't like was all the main characters had a new baby at the end.
Maybe it flashed forward several years.
No, just about one year.  Some of the characters were already pregnant before they flash fowarded.
Oh. Even the older parents of all of them?
Well sort of.  They were raising their grandson their jerk of a son dumped on them.
Oh I see.  Maybe they just wanted to get the everyone's happy ending.
Yeah, but up until that point the movie was very believable and realistic.  I think it kind of messed it up a bit.
