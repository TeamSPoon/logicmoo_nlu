What did you think about The Lion King 2.
Ehhh, it was ok, what did you think.
I thought it was ok too, it didn't come close to capturing the magic of the first one.
I agree, do any of the Disney sequels ever though?
I thought Toy Story did really well.
yea, I guess there is that one, but even those sequels didn't capture the same magic.
Well nothing ever will, you will always like the first one you saw the most.
Now we have to consider Star Wars as well since Disney bought them.
Yea, but you can't consider the ones made before they took over.
Yea, those were way better hahaha!
