IS THE BRONCOS NEW HEAD COACH GOING TO THEM THEM BACK TO THE PLAYOFFS?
HE IS A DEFENSIVE COACH AND THE BRONCOS HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE.
I AGREE BUT IS HE A BETTER DEFENSIVE COACH THAN WADE PHILLIPS?
REMEMBER THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF TALENT ON DEFENSE.
I KNOW BUT THE OFFENSE IS STILL SHAKY.
I AGREE, I AM NOT CONVINCED THEY HAVE A QUARTERBACK TO LEAD THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS.
TREVOR SIMIAN WILL PROBABLY BE THE STARTER.
PAYTON LYNCH STILL NEEDS TO PROVE HE CAN PLAY IN THE NFL.
THEY HAVE THE WIDE RECIVERS TO STRETCH THE FIELD SO THAT SHOULD HELP.
SANDERS PLAYED WELL BUT THE FRANCHISE PLAYER WAS DISAPPOINTING.
I KNOW BUT THEY WILL HAVE BETTER RUNNING BACKS TO HELP WITH THE RUNNING GAME.
JAMAL CHARLES WAS A GOOD PICK UP IF HE STAYS HEALTHY.
AT LEAST HE WON'T BE HELPING THE CHIEFS.
ALSO ANDERSON IS COMING BACK FROM AN INJURY.
ALL IN ALL I LOOK FOR A 8 WIN SEASON.
THE OTHER TEAMS IN THEIR DIVISION ARE GOOD AND IMPROVING.
THE BRONCOS WILL ALSO MISS KUBIAK.
HE QUIT AND I AM GLAD.
HIS HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A FOOTBALL GAME.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE SEASON TO GET STARTED!
