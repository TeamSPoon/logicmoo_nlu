Hey, do you remember those Not Quite Human movies?
No. When were those from? The 1980s again?
Yeah. They were on the Disney Channel. I think, made-for-TV.
Okay. Well, what about them?
Well... I liked them. At the time, anyway. There were three of them.
What were they about?
A scientist creates an android, and tells everyone it's his son. The android tries to figure out how to act like a person.
Oh, so you identified with the android?
I... well. Maybe.
I bet his name was something clever like "Chip."
