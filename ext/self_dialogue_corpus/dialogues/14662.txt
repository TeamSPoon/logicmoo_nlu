Did you see the crazy dunk LeBron had?
Wait, what game?
Two days ago. With the Heat.
What was crazy about it?
He broke the backboard.
What?
He broke the backboard again.
Didn't they change the glass.
Yeah, but he broke the backboard.
Jesus.
I know, it's nuts.
They won, right?
Yes, they extremely won.
No overtime, right.
God no.
That's insane.
I screamed.
Seriously?
I actually screamed.
That's nuts.
