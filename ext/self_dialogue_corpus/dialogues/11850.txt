Do you like The Beatles?
Yeah, they're the only bugs that people really like!
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I like their songs "Mr. Postman" and "I wanna be your Man"
Yeah those are awesome Beatle songs.
I wish they would have stayed together a lot longer.
Yeah, they are technically the fathers of boy bands.
Yeah, their music is influenced by lot of jazz and blues.
We all need more boy bands like them.
Yeah, that is true. They just don't make music like they used to.
