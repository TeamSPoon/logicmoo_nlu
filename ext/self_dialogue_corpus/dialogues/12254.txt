I can't believe the Star Wars movies didn't follow a sequence but went backwards in time.
It is kind of weird and interesting at the same time.
I saw the last Star Wars movie and I wasn't disappointed.
Same here, is it possible that they may even gotten better?
This last Star Wars movie was much better than Revenge of the Sith.
Yeah it was.  It was also better than The Clone Wars.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie.
I'd have to say the first one, the one that surprised me so much and started it all.
Does it seem to you that Lucas seems more distant now in the production of Star Wars movies?
Not really, he's there.  He's not going to let anything happen to his crown jewel.
