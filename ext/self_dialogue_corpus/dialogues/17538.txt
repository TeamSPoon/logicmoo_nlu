Do you remember that country music duo, Joey + Rory, and the wife Joey died of cancer?
Oh yes, there were articles all the time online keeping up with her struggle.
It was really sad. I remember feeling so bad for their little daughter who was so small.
Why do you ask?
I read something today about how the husband, Rory, is going back onstage for the first time since she died.
Oh, that must be really hard for him.
He's doing it to help raise money for a charity that helped them when his wife was sick.
That's really nice! What's the charity?
It's called Music Health Alliance. He said they had a lot of bills when her cancer came back, and the charity helped them with it.
Even when people have insurance, some stuff doesn't get covered.
Plus they were a duo, and he couldn't work by himself because he had to take care of her and their little daughter.
I'm glad there was a charity to help them.
He said he really wanted to help the charity because they had helped him so much.
I bet it's going to be hard though singing by himself.
He said he should do it so he can find out what he would do alone on stage, and what the future will be for him.
I imagine he needs to get back to work and make money, and he's going to have to decide if he wants to sing solo or find a new career.
He has a three year old daughter who has Down's syndrome, so he's going to have to figure out how to support him and her.
It must be tough for the little girl, losing her mom at such a young age.
After Joey died, their hymns album won a Grammy. Maybe he could do a tribute album for her.
That would be a really nice thing to do, and it might be therapeutic for him.
