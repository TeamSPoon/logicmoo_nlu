Did you hear they're going to remake Mary Poppins?
Yes! How do you feel about that?
A little bittersweet. I mean, the original was a staple in my house growing up and I don't want to see anyone mess with that.
I feel you. But at least part of the original will make it into this one.
How do you mean?
Well Dick Van Dyke is gonna be in it.
Oh yeah. He was probably my favourite thing about the original.
He really made the movie. I'm so glad that out of all the original cast members he's gonna make an appearance.
Me too. Plus, they won't have to try to make him look old this time like they did in the last one.
He wasn't old in the last one...?
Not his main character, Burt, but remember he also played one of the old guys at the bank?
Oh yeah, I remember that! I heard that the little boy didn't know that was Dick Van Dyke until later.
Yeah, I guess they didn't want him to think of him as anything other than that character.
I wonder how else it will be like the original, if they'll make any references to it or anything.
I don't know...
I want them to honor it, without riding too much on the success of it, you know?
Yeah, that's gonna be tough.
But I can't wait to see how they pull it off.
Nothing could replace the original for me though.
That's for sure. There will never be another tea party on the ceiling, or a day at the chalk painting races.
