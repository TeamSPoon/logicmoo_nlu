What is going on with Miley Cirus?
She seems to want the same attention as Brittany Spears.
I don't know why she would want that kind of attention. Brittany's career fell off after her big change.
It did, didn't it? I think Miley was tired od being seen as that Disney channel icon she was.
At least her music is still pretty good. I like her song "Wrecking Ball".
I actually like that one too.
Her changes don't seem to effect her music, it's just the way she acts that's extreme.
I wonder what her father thinks of it. I haven't heard an opinion or comment from him on it.
She is an adult now, not much ol' Billy Ray can say.
I guess not, but what is wrong with just being a wholesome music artist?
Taylor Swift has that market locked down, but she still gets antagonized by other artist.
I remember what Kanye West said at that awards show ac oouple years back.
I don't know if that was completly directed at Taylor Swift, but I'm sure it was still awkward.
I know, I would've wanted to fade from view of anyone who was there.
I don't think I have actually listened to any of Taylor Swift's music, except what is played on the radio.
She tends to be more geared toward the heartbroken.
I'm not a fan of being heartbroken and when it does occur I have my go to music.
What type of music is that?
The oldies, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, artist like that.
The songs they created have a lot of power behind them, I can appreciate their gifts.
