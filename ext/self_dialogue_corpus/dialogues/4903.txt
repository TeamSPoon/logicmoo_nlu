What park is the best in baseball?
Oriole Park at Camden Yards
That was so old!
Yeah but its what started the way parks are built now
I love Citizens Bank Park
I think its good and has a great skyline view but theres something its missing.
Like what?
Something that sets it apart.
They tried building a wall of ivy
Yeah but thats a random wall in the outfield
How about the sight lines?
They are perfect theres not much outfield seating
Would you rank Yankee Stadium up there?
I dont know if I will ever go to a game there
Whys that
The price of tickets are absurd
Thats new york for ya
Yeah but you want simple people to be able to watch the club
How about Wrigley Field
It will always be historic but its really small inside
