Do you like the Fast & Furious movies
I did, up until number 6.  They just got too crazy.
I agree.  They are what got me into cars.
Yeah, they were so cheesy but it helped get a whole new generation into the car scene.
Yep, I was even crazy enough to get street-glow on my car
Oh, I am so sorry.  You must regret that.
I really do.  Have you seen the new one yet?
No I haven't.  I doubt I will.
It's just not the same without Paul.
I agree.  They need to stop making them.
