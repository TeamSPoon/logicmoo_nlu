I have a gripe about NCAA basketball.
Go ahead.
I hate when awesome division I powerhouses pay awful schools to play.
You mean, pay-to-lose?
Yup. It happens in football too.
Why does that bother you?
It doesn't improve the players on the team paying, and it uses up the school's money.
You really think the students are paying Alabama A&M $150,000 to lose to University of Florida--just for example?
I don't know where the money comes from, other than that it's a waste.
I LOVE when they do this, actually?
Why?
Well, let's say Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke.
Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke.
Very funny, you literalist. Anyway, I love when the lesser school that's paid to lose ... wins.
Ha, that's right. They spent the school's money to buy a win and didn't get it.
Love it.
That's not enough for me though. It happens rarely enough to be an anomaly.
You're one of those integrity guys aren't you?
Yeah, I think it ruins the game of basketball. There's no surprise, and the wrong kind of competition.
You're only saying that cause you were in the Atlantic Sun.
