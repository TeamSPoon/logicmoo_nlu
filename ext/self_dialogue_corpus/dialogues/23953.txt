What is your favorite Harry Potter film?
I love Sorceror's Stone the most.
Me too. I love when Harry finds out he is a wizard and how Hagrid  put a scare into the Dursleys.
My favorite part actually is when they go into Diagon Alley for the first time.
It was so cool how the bricks moved apart to open into Diagon Alley.
I wish I could have stepped into it.
Yes, looking at all the wizard shops was cool.
They did such a great job bringing all that to life.
Ollivander's was the coolest.
It was amazing how all the different wands respinded to Harry.
And Ollivander kept getting more and more excited as more wands were taken and then failed for Harry.
Yes, he seemed to know where everything was headed.
I was just so amazed how they brought everything to life.
I am so glad that they stuck with the book storyline for the most part.
I did get scared the first time when Harry was in the woods Draco and Voldemort passes over him when he was still like a nothing.
Yes, that was scary the first time even though I knew it was going to happen.
I loved the first time Harry met Ron.
And I loved all the candy that Harry bought off the trolley.
It was fun to see the chocolate frogs come to life.
And to see the wizards on the cards move.
