What do you think of the Lethal Weapon franchise?
The series?
No, the films.
Oh, I forgot about them. I liked them.
Did you think Danny Glover was a good fit.
I think he was, he matched well with Mel Gisbon.
I liked their chemsitry.
They always had some good jokes in the midst of the explosions and so on.
I liked that they showed Glover with a nice family.
And the other guy, Gibson, as a sort of loose cannon.
