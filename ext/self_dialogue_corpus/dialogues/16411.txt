Hi do you like music?

I love Garth Brooks.
He's pretty good, I like Taylor Swift and Miranda lambert.
I dont like Taylor Swift that much, but I love Miranda Lamberts song, Kerosene.
That's one of my favorite songs.
I like older country like Brooks and dunn, john Michael Montgomery, people like that.
I dont know much of the older stuff. Have you heard of Kane brown?
Yea I like him
He's really good, I like his thunder and rain one.
That's on of my favorite of his, I also like a song called hit the gas.
I haven't heard that one.
His sound and his look are so contradictory to me.
Yea he doesn't look like he sings country.
No he doesn't, but he's one of the best new artists.
He really is, I have his cd
I only listen too him on I heart radio, I didn't know he had a cd
