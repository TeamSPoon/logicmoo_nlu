How many Disney movies have you actually seen?
I have seen many movies. But recently, Moana is one of my favorites.
Visually, Moana is a gorgeous film.
Yes of course. Moana flat-out wowed me, from its music, to its story and characters, to its sheer visual spectacle.
The whole team did the animation work very well. Graphics are engaging and the story line is superb.
