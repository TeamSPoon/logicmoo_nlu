We went to a great concert the other night, Twenty-One Pilots.
Twenty-One Pilots? I think my daughter listens to them.
She probably does, I found them through  my daughter. But they are pretty good.
Won't I be like that annoying mom if I start listening to the same music as her?
Maybe, but I'm sure she'll forgive you if you buy her a few t-shirts and take her to concerts. Just don't buy yourselves matching shirts.
OMG that would be so funny, she would die of embarassment. But I don't really like newer music.
You just think that because you're comfortable with the old stuff. There is plenty of good stuff coming out.
You think I'm in some kind of bubble?
What are you listening to right now?
I don't want to say. Backstreet Boys.
You are so in a bubble. Try to listen to Twenty-One Pilots.
I was just in a weird mood! I usually listen to more alt rock than pop.
Then you will really enjoy Twenty-One Pilots. Heathens is a great song, but if you're in a Backstreet mood I would suggest House of Gold.
How is Backstreet related?
Because that one Backstreet Boy wrote the song for his mom and always talked about her in interviews. House of Gold is like that, but better.
Can you imagine driving down the street singing this stuff while I drive my daughter to school?
I did it this morning. You should also listen to Tear in My Heart, it might be my favourite.
You're crazy. Besides I said I don't usually listen to Backstreet. So I probably wouldn't like them anyway.
Twenty-One Pilots is nothing like Backstreet Boys.
But you said, nevermind. I'll listen to them.
