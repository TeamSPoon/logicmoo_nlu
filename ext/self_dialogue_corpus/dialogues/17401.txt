Guess what! I finally listened to the Hamilton soundtrack!
Yay! What did you think?
The hype is real. The songs are so catchy, the lyrics are well written, and the cast is incredibly talented!
I know, Lin-Manuel Miranda can do no wrong. What was your favorite song?
The one at the end of Act One, I think it's called "Non-Stop"?
Yup, that's it! I like that one too. My favorite is "The Election of 1800" in Act Two
I haven't listened to Act Two as much as Act One, though I suspect I will as I keep listening!
That was my experience too. I think people start out listening to the first act a lot because it takes a while to fully understand the plot. But once you do, Act Two becomes much more powerful and emotional
I can see that! I'm looking forward to getting there! I've been listening to it over and over
That's what I also did when I first heard it!
I wish there was something more to listen to though
You know, there is. Have you heard of the Hamilton mixtape?
No, what's that?
It's all the same Hamilton songs but sung by different artists, like real popular artists. Like The Roots, Kelly Clarkson, and such.
Wow, really? That sounds cool! Who created it?
Lin-Manual Miranda did! He sings on some of them too. Some are arranged differently than they are in the play, but you can still recognize it
That's really interesting! I will definitely have to listen to that!
Yeah, for sure! I think it also includes some songs that he had written but that weren't included in the play. Like extra Cabinet Battles
Oooh, those songs were really good! That's good to know. I'm gonna go listen to it now!
Awesome! Let me know when you have so we can discuss it some more!
