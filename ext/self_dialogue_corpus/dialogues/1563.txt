What do you think of the Panthers?
They are okay
Do you think they will get back to the finals?
Possibly
Do you like Newton?
He does not have a good attitude
I agree. He seems arrogant
he did not do good in the Super Bowl
He did terribly
I think he needs to become more mature
He will be. That always happens
Do you like their defense?
Yes
Do you like their offense?
Yes, they have a good team, but the question is can they beat the best?
I think they can
In a tough NFC, it can be overwhelming
Yeah the teams are not getting worse
That is true. There are many good teams
I personally like the Cowboys.
