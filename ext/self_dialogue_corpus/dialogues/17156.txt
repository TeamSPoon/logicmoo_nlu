Lately I've been getting into the music of an old band called The Monkees.
I know who they are. They were supposed to be America's version of the Beatles.
Really? I didn't know that.
I think they had a lot of good songs.
What are some of your favorites?
I love their theme song and Steppin Stone is one of my favorites.
That song is good, but I think A Little Bit Me A Little Bit You is better.
That's debateable. I guess it depends on who your favorite Monkee is.
Which one is your favorite?
I really like Mickey's voice. He can rock out when he wants to.
I like the softness of Davey's voice and I loved his song I Wanna Be Free.
I was sad when I found out he died.
You know, they do a tribute of him while on tour.
They're still touring?
Mickey and Peter are.
Are they still putting out albums?
They last released one in 2016.
What's it called?
Good Times!
I'll have to check it out.
