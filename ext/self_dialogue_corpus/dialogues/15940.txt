Do you like music?
Of course, I love music.  I am a musician.
What instrument do you play?
I play classical piano and I sing.
Who is your favorite composer.
That is a toss up between Mozart and Beethoven.
That is interesting, I think I like Beethoven more.
A lot of people don't realize how awesome Mozart would have been if he lived longer.
Really, when did he die?
He was only about 35 years old.
What did he die of?
We do not know for sure.
Really?  Can you tell me more?
Mozart even wrote his own funeral music.
That is very morbid so he knew he was going to die.
Yes and Mozart's Requiem is the most beautiful piece of music ever written.
I would have to listen to it sometime.
It is different than his other works obviously more dark.
How did he write if if he was dying?
He actually did not get to finish it.  His student finished the work using his notes.
