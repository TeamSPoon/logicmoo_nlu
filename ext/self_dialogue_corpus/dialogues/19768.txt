Do you listen to Djent?
I don't think so.  What's that?
Well, Djent is.. well, you know metal, right?
Oh, yeah.  I love metal.
Okay.  And there are different subgenres of metal, like death metal, symphonic metal, that sort of thing?
Yeah, I know about those.
Okay.  Djent is a subgenre of metal, with a focus on distorted sounds.
Well, that doesn't sound good.
But it is!  Do you know Meshuggah?
I've heard of them before, yeah.
Meshuggah is considered by many to be the founders of Djent; their style of sound is what makes Djent what it is.
Okay.  So it's.. what? Freeform jazz metal?
Not quite.  Djent is kind of similar to progressive metal, with an emphasis on complicated time signatures and patterns in the music.
So it's like math metal?
Yeah!  A lot of people actually call it that.  It's all about complication, with hard, heavy riffs and tones to back it up.
Okay.  That actually does sound kind of cool.
It is very, very cool.  Check out Meshuggah, or Periphery if you've never heard of them.
Why Periphery?
The guitarist, Misha Mansoor, is also very big in the Djent scene.  His work is really representative of what modern Djent sounds like, as opposed to the more classic Djent of Meshuggah.
All right; I'll give them a listen.  Thanks!
