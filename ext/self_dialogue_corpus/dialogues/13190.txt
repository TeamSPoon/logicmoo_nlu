When did you first watch star wars
I started watching them when I was really young, maybe 3 years old
wow, that's very young. Why from such a young age?
My dad was a fan, and we used to watch Return of the Jedi together
Wasn't that scary as a young kid?
Actually, I loved the story in the characters
