What about thay Javier Bardem?
He is so good. Soooo creepy.
Indeed. He's the new Pirates villian.
I know. And he looks a litte extra creepy.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I'm a huge Johnny Dep fan.
Me too. He may well be my favorite actor.
He's so good as Jack Sparrow.
I heard that Disney tried to get him to play Jack differently.
That would have been a shame.
Indeed. Bet their glad they didn't get their way.
I'm sure!
I planning on going to the theater to catch the new one.
I just migh have to join you.
That'd be great.
Any day in particular.
I don't know. The weekend is better for me.
Works for me.
Let me know when you're wanting to go.
Will do!
