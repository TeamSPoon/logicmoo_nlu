Do you want to go to a concert with me?
Sure, who are you going to see?
I was thinking of going to see Nine Inch Nails.
Aren't they like Marilyn Manson? Scary metal stuff?
No, they're industrial and they have a lot of songs that play on the radio.
Oh really. What ones?
Came Back Haunted, Hand That Feeds, Hurt.
Isn't Hurt a cover of Johnny Cash?
Actually, no. Trent Reznor wrote it and it's on the 1994 album, The Downward Spiral.
So Johnny Cash covered Nine Inch Nails?
Yes, shortly before he passed away too. It was appropriate.
That's sad. I really like that song.
Yeah, you'd like a lot of more Nine Inch Nails too. Trent Reznor does soundtracks for movies too.
Oh really? What ones?
Gone Girl, for one. It sounds very Nine Inch Nails ish.
I had no idea.
Yep. So would you go to the concert with me?
Sure, when is it?
September 10th, at the arena. Prepare to be amazed.
Oh, I am. It sounds like fun!
