What do you think of Drake?
I actually don't like his music.
Really, he is so popular right now.
I know, but I just think his voice is bac d and his raps are worse.
Man, your hard to please.
Not really, but I remember when music and hip hop were real!
You don't like any of his songs.
Not really, that song about a cell phone that was so popular is absolute garbage.
I actually like Drake music.
Everybody has different taste. But when you talk about rap I think about Dr. Dre, the Wu-Tang Clan, Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, Jay Z, Nas, etc.
I'll have to listen to those guys!
You really should. You should also listen to old DMX, Busta Rhymes, KRS one, A tribe called quest, and Mobb Dee
I haven't even heard of half those guys. With a good rappers.
Go back and listen to those artist and then tell me you think Greg's a good rap.
Do you like rock music also?
I like a little bit of everything.
Who are some rock bands that you really like?
I like a lot of the older bands like  The who, Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, and the Beatles.
Do you like any of the newer rock band?
Well I'm not sure if they're technically rock band but I really like Mumford and Sons, train, and Maroon 5.
