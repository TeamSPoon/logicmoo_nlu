Did you see Disney's Brave?
Yeah, it seems like it was very popular when it came out.
I think it did make a lot of money.
It had a nice song or two in it as well.
There was something in it that spoke to the nature of mother -daughter relationships.
Right! Didn't the mother get turned into a bear?
Sure but it was accidental.
Merida was really loved by her parents, but a lot was expected from her.
She rose to the challenge though.
In a magical way.
