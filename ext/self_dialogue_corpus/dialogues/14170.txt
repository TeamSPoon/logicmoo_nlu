Hey, did you see that GaGa did Teeth at Coachella?
No! She never does that one.
I know and it's so good!
I agree. It's got a great dance beat.
Her music is my favorite to workout to.
Me too. GaGa makes me want to move.
And it's always really empowering.
I think that's what I like the most about her music.
She writes the kind of songs that you can get lost in and feel like a fierce warrior.
I think her songs are so empowering because she's such a strong woman.
