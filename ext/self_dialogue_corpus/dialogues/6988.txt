You know, Disney was really good at making me cry growing up.
I know! They had a lot of tear jerkers.
The one that always got me was the Fox and the Hound.
In the scene where she leaves him in the forest? I cry every time.
Even the Best of Friends song will make me tear up when I hear it.
Oh, me too. I can't even play the first notes without my brother yelling at me to stop.
I always wished Todd and--what was the dog's name?
Copper,  I think.
That's right! I always wished they could have been friends in the end.
Me too; it's a shame they had to leave each other because of their positions.
