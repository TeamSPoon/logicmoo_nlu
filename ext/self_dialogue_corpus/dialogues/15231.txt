Do you think there's a definitive end to possible new music?
Of course not, what do you mean?
Well, think about it - there are essentially only 12 notes right?
Well sure, across octaves. What's your point?
Those 12 notes can't be thrown together randomly - there are certain specific scales that sound universally good to everyone.
Yeah, I suppose...
Well, you have 12 notes, you have certain scales - there's a finite number of bits to music that make it sound good.
You're saying we could hit an upper limit on song structures?
Essentially, yes. There is an upper limit to the amount of unique songs that can be written.
Assuming you're not just putting together random notes and calling it a new composition...
Yes, this assumes that the end product follows the established musical rules.
But won't those rules change over time?
Eventually they most likely will, but our sense experiences would have to change.
what do you mean by that?
the way we hear music, how our ears react to specific tones - that all would have to change
for us to break through that upper limit of innovation?
That's what I think - for music to sound good it must follow certain rules and those rules also create a finite amount of possible new music
Unless we see new genres that break those rules - like harsh noise. What if harsh noise as a protest to this became the new pop standard?
Then I suppose we'd all find the pop music of the future to be a lot worse, and a lot more interesting.
well, then may we live in interesting times...
