Do you like the Goo Goo Dolls?
Yeah, they are decent.
What song do you like of theirs?
I like Broadway the best.
Yes, Broadway is a good song.
What song do you like?
I like Iris.
I think the Goo Goo Dolls are comparable to Match Box 20.
I agree, I also think you can compare them to Third Eye Blind.
Yes, that is a good comparison.
They all have some good songs, but none of them lasted a long time.
Yea, they seem to have faded quite a bit.

That's a good one, I like if your gone.
That one is good too, what song do you like from Third Eye Blind?

I like how's it gonna be.
It is nice to remember old songs isn't it?
