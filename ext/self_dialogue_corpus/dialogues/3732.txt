What is your favorite thriller movie?
Mission Impossible
A big spy fan, eh?
Yea I love spy movies.  My favorites!
What did you think of the second one?
It was decent, except for the soundtrack
Yea the Metallica songs were not my favorites
Cool scenes though with the exploding glasses
Yea, I always wanted some of those
Me too!
