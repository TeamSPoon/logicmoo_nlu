Are there any Lady Gaga songs you totally hate?
I like some but I do not like 'Born This Way' or 'Poker Face.' I totally loathe 'Bad Romance.'
Why's that?
Her manly voice n those songs bugs me.
Oh, I see. I actually agree.
I like 'You and I' because her voice is better on that one.
It is. I agree. She is a good singer when she tries.
She is. I wonder why she doesn't always sing like that.
I'm ot sure because it's better.
Maybe she thinks that makes her sound edgy.
