Favorite rock band of all time?
Tough one. I would have to go with Nirvana.
Would you consider that rock? I was thinking that was more grunge.
I think grunge is subset of rock. Teen Spirit totally speaks to me.
Yeah, they are pretty good. I like Pearl Jam too.
I know they would be mortified but I kind of think of them as the same time period. Very similar.
They are but very different in their own right.
Yeah, same thing with Sound Garden and Radiohead.
Oh, I hadn't thought about them
Yeah too many good ones. I would be lost without my music.
