What is your favorite comedy of all time?
Ghost Busters.
The new one?!
No, that was awful.
I'll second that!
The original was awesome, though.
I agree.
The writing is just so good.
Yeah, didn't Dan Acroyd write it?
Yeah, and the other actor. What's his name...?
Bill Murray
No. The guy who played Egon.
Oh yeah. What is his name...?
I can't rember, but I'm pretty sure he had a hand in writing it.
That's pretty interesting.
I reall like Bill Murray.
That guy is so funny.
He doesn't seem to do too much comedy these days.
Yeah, a lot of weird stuff though.
Yeah, a lot of independant films.
