What do you think was Roman Pierce's best line in 2 fast 2 furious?
I'm actually torn on that one. If I had to choose then when they were walking away at the end of the movie.
After they took some of the ransom cash.
Yeah, after Brian said "Our pockets ain't empty cuz", then Roman lifts up his shirt and says "and we ain't hungry no more either", and he's got cash stuffed in his pants.
That was a great walkout line, what was your number two.
Well it's not so much what he said but what he did when he said it. It was when they were driving to the final meet.
Let me guess, it was just when he hit the ejector button.
Yes! That was hilarious, he just hit the button and shouts to the guy "ejecto seato cuz!", I was on the floor laughing after that.
Well it is hard narrowing down a Roman Pierce quote.
Well of course it is, he never stops talking or he'd die.
