Did you ever collect football cards?
Yeah, when I was younger.
Do people still do that today?
Sure.
I used to have all the teams cards organized so well.
Me too.  I wish I had some today.
Yeah, my mom got rid of mine.
They would be worth a pretty penny some of them.
I know.
What card do you think was worth the most?
I think Joe Namath would be worth a lot.
I loved him.
Who's your favorite player today?
I love Roethlisberger.
He's been around a while.
Yep, and still doing well.
He's amazing.
I know.  He's up there in age for a football player but does his share.
Sure does.
I can't wait for the season to start!
