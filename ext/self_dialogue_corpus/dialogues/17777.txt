What kind of music are you into?
I like all kinds of music, but my favorite is pop punk.
Oh really? Who's your favorite pop punk artist?
Well, I like a lot, but my favorite would have to be Alesana.
Nice! I like them too!
Oh, you've heard of them?
Absolutely! What's your favorite song?
I mostly like their older stuff. If I had to pick, my favorite song would be "Apology".
Really? That's mine too!
No way! I thought that whole album was awesome.
Yeah, that was "On Frail Wings of Vanity And Wax", right?
It sure was. The album with "Ambrosia", "Tiling The Hourglass", and a bunch of other good ones.
That was one of my favorite alternative albums of all time!
Who would you say your favorite artist is?
As far as pop punk goes, I really like A Day To Remember.
They've got some great songs too.
Yeah, "What Separates Me From You" got me through some hard times.
I can't believe our interests are so similar.
Yeah, I know! It's great to find someone who appreciates the same music as you.
We'll have to get together sometime and discuss this more.
