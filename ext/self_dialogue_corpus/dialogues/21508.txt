Did you see the trailer for Dunkirk?
I am not sure, what is it about?
It is Christopher Nolan's new movie.
Oh, the one during wartime that has been on TV ads recently?
Yea, what do you think?  Would you want to see it?
It looks really intense, it has been a while since I have seen a good war movie.
Yea, it looks really epic and tense, Nolan usually doesn't disappoint.
I agree, I would definitely want to see it.
We can go next week if you would like.
Sure, that sounds great.
When is the last time you went to the movies?
It has been a very long time, I can't even remember.
I forgot, did you come with us to see Logan?
No, I missed that one.  I was out of town.
Oh yea, that is right.
I think the last thing I saw was Get Out in theaters.
That was an amazing movie.
Yea, I have been planning to re watch it now that it is out on demand.
Wow, I did not know it was available already.
Yea, came out recently.
