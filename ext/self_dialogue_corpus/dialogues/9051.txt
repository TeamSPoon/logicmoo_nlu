Have you heard any good new rock lately?
Yes. Unleash the Archers has a newer song that I particularly like. Have you heard of them?
No. What do they sound like?
They are more of a metal band.

Cleanse the Bloodlines is a good song.
I'll definitely take a listen.
Awesome. What kind of rock bands do you normally listen to?
I generally listen to more foreign bands. Japanese Rock actually.
That's interesting. I've heard of Baby Metal.
