Do you remember watching Lilo & Stitch as a kid?
Yes! It made me want to go to Hawaii!
It made me want to have a cute pet alien.
Stitch was so destructive, though!
I know, but it would be worth it for how cute he was.
I'm not sure about that... Maybe I'd like to have him around once he's settled down a lot.
I liked how Lilo fed that fish a sandwich all the time.
And she couldn't feed him a tuna sandwich!
Of course, it did make her late to her dance class.
I think she ended up better once she got her destructive alien friend after all.
