Hey there, seen any good movies lately?
I have, and in fact, I am seeing one tomorrow that I hope will be good.
What movie are you going to see?
Wonder Woman!  I can not wait!
I have seen previews for that one!  Do you think it will be really good?
I hope so.  I really liked the character in the Batman vs Superman movie.
Me too!  She looked really tough and dangerous.
I thought so too.
I think that she can carry a movie by herself just fine, too!
Yes!  The preview really made her look scary, too.
I would not like to get on her bad side!
Do you know that the actress is from Israel?
No, I had thought she was from France.
And, she has two children!
I wonder if her kids will be seeing the movie?
Me too!  Imagine seeing your mom as Wonder Woman on the big screen.
That would have to be really different!
I bet they go to school and tell everybody that their mom is a superhero!
Ha!  Let me know if the movie is any good!
I think that it will be a great, action packed movie!
