What movie from your youth had the biggest impact?
Well, I didn't see too many movies in my youth, but Grease made a big splash and I did see that one.
Grease is a musical isn't it?
Yeah, it was the first musical I watched straight through I think, haha.
Who starred in that movie?
Well of course there was John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Also Frankie Avalon had a short appearance.
Were there other well known stars in the movie?
I'm sure there were, but I was too young to recognize them then, or I don't recall them now.
Isn't that the movie that launched John Travolta's career?
No, John made his big splash in Saturday Night Fever which came out a couple years earlier, I think.
But Grease was a big movie for him also, was it not?
Oh yes, Grease was a big hit for John and Olivia Newton John.
Why do you think the movie did so well?
Well a part of the movie's success was the soundtrack. There were some very catchy tunes in the movie that were played constantly on the radios.
Are there any famous lines or scenes that you recall?
Oh there are many of them. I can almost sing Frankie Avalon's song 'Beauty School Dropout.'
Was that the big song from the movie?
No, there was a song entitled Grease, and a ballad Hopelessly Devoted to You that both did very well.
Who sang those songs?
Grease was sung by the cast, at least in the movie, and the other song was a solo by Olivia Newton-John, who is a professional singer.
