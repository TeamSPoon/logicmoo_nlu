I understand that you're not a fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.
That is correct. I hate those films with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns.
Why, exactly? I mean, George Lucas probably thought he was creating another trilogy of masterpieces.
Hmm, why do I hate the prequel trilogy, let me count the ways. We can start with Jar Jar Binks.
I suppose you're right there. I don't know anyone who liked Jar Jar, other than the actor who voiced him.
I'm happy the dude got some work, but Jar Jar is such an embarrassment. The unmistakable resemblance to a stereotyped shuffling black servant is just deplorable.
You don't think Lucas did that on purpose, do you?
Of course not, but that summarizes what is wrong with the prequel trilogy. From the Imperial Chinese sounding bad aliens to the horribly childish and petulant characterization of Anakin, it's all about what Lucas didn't realize.
I guess this is why you should surround yourself with good people rather than yes-men.
George needed someone to hit him over the head in the story concept stage and straighten him out. Everyone would have benefited.
