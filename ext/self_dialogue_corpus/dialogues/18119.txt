Heard any good songs lately? Seems like everything is so lame..
Hmmmm. not anything I loved. I saw a facebook video about Florence and The Machine and I liked her sound.
Oh yeah? Is that the one that sings "dog days"?
Yes! I love the sound of her voice.
I think I saw that video too. Is it the one where she is singing to the sick girl.
Yep, that's it. Heartbreaking.
Yeah, she's good, folksy, reminds me of Jewel or Sarah Mclaughlin.
Absolutely. I've been listening to Bethel Music too. Rebecca Krause.
Is that Christian music?
Yes, gives me goosebumps. I love "It is Well"
I'll have to check it out. Doesn't Bethel do "Oceans"?
Yes, that's another one that gives me goosebumps.
Speaking of goosebumps.  I was listening to an oldie the other day. P-diddy and Faith Evans.."Missin you"
Oh my gosh, I used to love that one, I forgot all about it.
Yeah, seems like Faith Evans didn't do a lot but she has a pretty voice.
She does, makes no sense who makes it and who doesn't.
Yeah. Like Miley Cyrus, I mean her voice is ok. But doesnt blow me away.
And Sia..what is that all about?
I saw her on James Cardon. She has a good voice. The whole not showing her face is like a publicity thing.
It's still weird.
