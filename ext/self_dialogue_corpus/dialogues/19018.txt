Do you like Tool?
I don't think I know them, who are they?
They're a progressive band that's from the 90s and still active to this day.
Who is the singer? Sounds familiar.
The lead signer is Maynard James Keenan, he's incredible. He sounds great live.
That's cool, what's your favorite album from them?
Definitely Aenema. The lyrics from all their albums are philosophical or focused on enlightenment. All their albums are excellent though.
Philosophy huh? That's deep.
Oh yeah, it branches out to different topics as well. There's a song called Lateralus which is about the Fibonacci sequence, the lyrics and guitar intervals follow the math sequence.
Woah! That's so different from how other bands and artists do their songs.
They also have another song called Third Eye that is difficult even for them to do live because of the sudden time signatures.
Is it a long song?
Yeah it is. A lot of their songs are pretty long actually because most songs contain different pieces, sort of like a symphonic piece.
What are their concerts like?
Well the singer usually stays hidden in the back to avoid attention to him while the rest of the band are out playing. It's a different experience every concert and the songs will purposely sound different every concert.
I guess that would make it from sounding too repetitive and give it a unique experience every time.
Yes! One year, they actually did a show where it was completely different versions of their songs that they were experimenting with called Salival.
Tool doesn't seem like your average band, they definitely sound unique.
They are like no other band out there. You need to give them a try and listen to their songs.
Will do! Thanks for recommending them!
