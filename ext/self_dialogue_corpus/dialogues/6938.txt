Do you remember when you first saw The Little Mermaid?
Yeah, I love that movie so much.
I always thought Ursula was such a fantastic villain.
She was definitely one of the more memorable ones.
She was big but still beautiful and had that sinister smile.
Yes! I wonder if we'll ever get to see her in a live action remake.
I can't believe they haven't done that already.
I wonder who they would cast as Ariel.
It would have to be a very careful decision or people would be upset.
You're right. Those are some big, nostalgic shoes to fill.
