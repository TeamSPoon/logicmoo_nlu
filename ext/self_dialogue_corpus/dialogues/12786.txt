Have you ever seen the original Star Wars Movie?
The one with Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher?
Yes that one!  I think it's so much better then the new ones.
I remember the first time I saw star Wars I was so shocked to find out Luke was Darth Vadar's son.
I know!   That was a epic cliff hanger. I was like what?  But the new ones don't have that.
Exactly I remember waiting and waiting to find out if Darth Vadar  was lying or what was going on.  Then he cut his arm off!
Darth Vadar was evil and uncaring in the original movies. The new ones just don't have that element.
I have always admired the original movies and how they did the space craft using model toys.
I watched the special feature that showed that. All the space scenes were just a toy and a box with a backgroun. But somehow they look so much better then the new movies.
I think the new Star Wars movie are more CGI then anything and I can't stand Jar Jar Binks!
