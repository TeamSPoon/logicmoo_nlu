Have you heard of Julia Michaels?
Yes. She just started her career recently.
Have you heard the song called issues?
Of course! I love that song.
Me too! It's so different and interesting.
She move from Iowa to California with her family.
That's cool. I think she will do well.
Me too! She was already nominated for a Billboard music award for her first song!
That's crazy. She wrote that song.
I heard that a lot of artists wanted that song but she decided to sing it instead.
Smart choice she made.
Absolutely! It is a great song.
I downloaded it from iTunes.
Me too! She also had a song premiere on HBO.
Yeah. It's called how do we get back to love.
She has a very bright future.
That is for certain. She has been singing since she was twelve years old.
Wow! That's cool.
I can't wait to hear more from her!
Yeah, me too!
