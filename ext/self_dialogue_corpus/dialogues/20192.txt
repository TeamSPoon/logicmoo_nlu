What's your favorite movie of all time?
That would be To Kill a Mockingbird, 1962, with Gregory Peck, based on the book by Harper Lee.
I've never seen that one.
Oh, you must see it sometime. I think everyone should see it at least once.
Why do you think it's such an important film?
It addresses the complicated issues of prejudice and poverty and morality in a really meaningful and absorbing way.
What's it about?
It is set in the 30s, during the Depression, and it centers around a small town lawyer defending a black man against a charge of rape.
Wow, that's a really charged subject.
The movie, and Lee's book, tackles it by looking at the story's situations through the eyes of the lawyer's two small children.
Children are so innocent, but that gives them a kind of wisdom because they haven't yet picked up flawed perspectives about prejudice.
The lawyer, Atticus Finch, is a widower and he is this wonderful nurturing presence, teaching the kids by example how to live a good and conscientious life.
So the kids watch the trial that their father is in, defending this black man of rape?
Yes, they sit up in the cheap seats with all the blacks in town, who of course aren't allowed to sit with the white folks down on the main floor of the courtroom.
Do the kids understand what's going on?
They understand their father's job, but they are getting a big ugly look at racism and prejudice as they watch this unfold, and it makes no sense to them, the people who think blacks are a lower form of life.
Are they proud of their dad?
Mostly, the story shows how they think he's just a dad - he doesn't let them do stuff, or they're surprised to find out he's a crack shot, because he's just their boring father.
It sounds like an interesting film.
Gregory Peck is outstanding. He richly deserved the Oscar he won for this movie.
