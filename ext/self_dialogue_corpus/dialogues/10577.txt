Do you like the fast and the furious movies?
To be honest I've never seen any past the first one.
Me either! But I do like the podcast how did this get made.
Me too! I love listening to them make fun of Vin Deisel.
That is the best part.
What did you think of Paul Walker?
Paul Walker was great.
I agree. I also like the girl who is kind of butch.
Michelle Rodriguez. Is that the one?
Yes, her! She's great.
