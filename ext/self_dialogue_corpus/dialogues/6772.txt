Did you watch The Lion King when you were younger?
Of course I did. That was the first time I cried in a movie.
Let me guess. The stampede scene made you cry?
Yeah, that remains to be one of the saddest moments in movie history.
Definitely. I felt so bad for little Simba.
Timon and Pumbaa made it better though.
I totally forgot about Timon and Pumbaa. I used to love them.
Remember when they all ate bugs together?
Yeah that part grossed me out when I was younger.
It was the opposite for me. It made me want to try it!
