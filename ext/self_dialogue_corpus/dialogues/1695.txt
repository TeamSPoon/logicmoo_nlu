Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
No, he's a good sport.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
So, Smith didn't press him.
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
He started in 2011.
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
