So how did you first start listening to rap?
Well I just knew that I wanted to because my family had never exposed me to it, so I thought I'd start with Tupac as a safe bet since evryone seemed to like him.
Makes sense. So that made you want to listen to more.
Exactly.
Do you still listen to him?
Yeah, partly because of the good memories of that being my first exposure to hip hop, partly because it was a time frame where life was relatively happy.
But you like something about him specifically, otherwise you wouldn't have delved into more of it, right?
I mean his voice doesn't do anything for me...
Man, I love his distinctive voice!
Yeah, strictly sound wise his music doesn't do a whole lot for me either.. just constructually, the way his lyrics are formatted and story-wise that's what got me, being able to follow a linear story.
