Hey, who won yesterday's game?
The Lakers won the game.
Really? What was the score?
The score was 91 to 97.
Oh wow! That's a pretty close score.
Yeah. The other team had a really good defense.
Does this mean the Lakers will be at the championship this year?
I don't know. They still have one more game to decide.
Do you know who they will be playing next?
No, not yet. Are you a Lakers fan?
Not originally, but my team is out of the run for championship so I'm rooting for the Lakers.
Who's your favorite player?
Probably Lou Williams, he's pretty good.
I'm going to have to say D'Angelo Russels.
Which one has the highest points for the team?
Williams does, but I still like Russels.
Fair enough. Who is your second favorite player?
Williams is my second favorite, but I'm also a fan of Randle.
Who got the most points in yesterdays game?
Russels got the most points yesterday.
