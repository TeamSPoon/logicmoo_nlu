What do you think of Jack White music?
He's pretty good.  An all around great artist.
Yeah, no matter what name he's going by.
I kind of like how he's changed names.  It makes it so people actually lose track and like the songs for the song.
Yeah, so what's some songs you liked form him?
Well of course seven nation army is one of the best ever.
That's a great workout song too.
I like the Bond one he did with Beyonce too.
That was awesome.
Did you ever see when he was on Colbert?
Yes, and Stephen Colbert kept trying to wear his red suit.
That was hilarious.
You know what I almost forgot about?
What?
Icky Thump.
Oh man that song was cool.  I liked the heavy base to it.
The guitar solo was great too.
He's just a fantastic musician.
Yeah, they need more like him.
I'll second that.  Leave the red suit at home though.
