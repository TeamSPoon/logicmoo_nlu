Hey, have you seen the movie Hush?
No, but I saw it pass by on Netflix!  Is it good?
Yeah it was actually pretty good!  I would recommend seeing it.
What's it about?
Well, there's this girl and she is deaf but she lives alone out in the woods in an isolated location.  She is an author.
Sounds interesting...What else?
She starts being stalked by this really scary looking guy.  But she's deaf, so she can't hear anything going on.
That sounds scary!
It is!  And he traps her in the house, so there's nothing she can do.
What a horrible situation!
Yeah, so the movie is about how she's trying to escape and get away from the psychopath.
It sounds intense.
Yeah, it was very intense.  Kinda an unusual horror type suspense movie.
I will put that on my list.  I'm always looking for a good suspense movie.
Yeah, well this one was different.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.
We watched one the other night that was really good, too!
What was it?
It was called Gothika, it's really old.
Oh yeah, I saw that a long time ago!
Yeah, it's been awhile.  But it was a good movie!
