I love sports movies!
Michael...sports movies? They are always so cliche.
A lot of them are, but there are a few really good ones out there.
Name one.
Sure. How about Hoosiers? Remember Gene Hackman as the coach of that small indiana high school team?
Oh, yeah! And Dennis Hopper was that alcoholic assistant coach!
That one was a worthy example of a good sports film!
I'd have to agree with you on that one. But that may be the only one!
Well I can give you two more without breaking a sweat.
Gettting cocky now are we?
First one: "Remember the Titans".
I don't remember it. Just kidding...that was good too.
And number two, and perhaps my favorite sports movie, "We Are Marshall"!
Oh, man...you really came prepared! Ok. You were right.
And, ironically, this may be one of the few Matthew McConaughey movies that was not cliche!
Ouch!
Am I right?  Am I right?
You are indeed correct sir. I stand corrected.
That's right, and don't forget it!
Maybe I should call you, "Magic Mike"?
