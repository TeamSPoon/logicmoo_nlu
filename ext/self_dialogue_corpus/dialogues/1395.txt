What about the Giants?
Eli Manning is a has been. He's not gonna get any more Super Bowls.
Tom Brady will, though.
Sure, but I think other teams will have a chance.
Like, who?
Maybe, the Broncos. Even without Peyton, they are still strong with Damarius Thomas, and other strong players.
Maybe, the Falcons, too?
Nahh, maybe the Packers, or the Ravens. They have a better chance.
What about the Lions?
Nope
The Texans?
No chance
The Jets?
Nope. They're like the Giants, but worse.
What about the 49ers?
Ehhh, they might. But they had their good runs.
What about some of the players?
Uhhhh, like who?
Uhhhh, Jessica something?
Ohh, Jessica Namath's cute in that fur, with her father, Joe Namath. A former pro player, too!
