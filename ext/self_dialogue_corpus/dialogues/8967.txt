Would you listen to Kid Rock nowadays?
I think his time has passed
he really crossed genres
Yeah he started out in rap then went to rock now country.
Its crazy. I think Bawitdaba was a good song.
It was a toe tapper
But now the stuff he plays is way slower.
As he aged so did his music.
I remember the video was insane for that song.
Now he just talks about drinking beer and being old.
