What was the best lightsaber battle of the whole Star Wars franchise?
As much as I disliked 'Phantom Menace,' I loved the battle where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face off against Darth Maul
That was such a great sequence.  And so fast-paced too.
It was the first time any of us ever saw a lightsaber battle that intense.
It made the original trilogy's lightsaber duels seem tame in comparison.  Very high-octane.
Ray Park was so good as Darth Maul.
He almost had zero dialogue, but was still so scary.
Did you know that Ray Park did his own stunts?
I didn't.  That's very impressive.
Yea, in real life Ray is an expert martial artist.  He brought a lot to his role as Maul.
