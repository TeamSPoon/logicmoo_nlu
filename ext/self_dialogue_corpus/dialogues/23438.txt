We watched a great comedy last night.
Yeah, what movie was that?
Spy, with Melissa McCarthy.
That was funny. We watched it a little while ago.
Jason Statham was hilarious in that.
The lines he had were funny.
It's weird when you see him in a comedy.
Yeah, he is usually a tough guy in the movies.
I liked it when he kept saying all the things he did for himself and to himself.
Yeah, like he died and brought himself back to life.
He also made the suit he was wearing too.
They are both good actors. Lots of good movies by them.
i thought I heard they were going to make a Spy 2.
Well it did end with them in bed together.
Did you see the bloopers they showed at the end?
Yes I did.
I would watch a second one.
As long as the same people were in yet.
Definitely. They shouldn't change the characters.
No. Then it wouldn't be the same.
