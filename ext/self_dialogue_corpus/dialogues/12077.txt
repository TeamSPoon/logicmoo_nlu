Do you have any favorite side antagonists in the Star Wars movies?
I think that I really like the sand people.
Oh man, they were scary.
Yes they were!
Especially their yelling.
It creeps me out to hear them make that noise.
Their outfits were so cool though.
Yes I really like the things on their heads.
I am not even sure if that is there face or a mask.
Me either! I wonder if there is something under it.
