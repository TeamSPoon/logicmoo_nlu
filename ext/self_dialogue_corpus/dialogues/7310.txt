I just found out that they may not be doing songs in the Mulan remake!
I heard something like that too.  It would be a shame.
I loved Christina Agulera's version of Refection.
I loved all of the songs in the movie, they were so motivational.
There really weren't a whole lot of songs in that movie though.  At least not compared to some of the movies.
I wonder if it will be the same storyline, and if they will have Mushu.
They would have to have Mushu, he is the funniest character, along with the cricket.
I forget sometimes that Mulan is a war movie, I wonder how they would handle that as a live action movie?
It is a little darker than most Disney movies. Maybe they would change the actual war movie parts.
I don't know how they would. Fighting the Huns was a pretty big part of the movie.
