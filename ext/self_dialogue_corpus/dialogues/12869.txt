My mom's favorite character is Jar Jar binks.
...no it's not!
It is. I wouldn't lie about something like this. Guess who her second favorite character is?
I don't dare guess...
Han Solo!
What?
Yeah, her second choice is better than her first!
I'm going to have a talk with your mom.
Please, your favorite is Boba Fett. You're not much better.
Yes. Yes I am.
