Hi Sara, i saw you at the movie theater last night.
Really? i was clueless, i didn't see you there.
No problem, i was with Mark, which movie did you watch?
Cars 3, it was awesome!
Omg, i watched too!
I really wasn't expecting the end to be honest with you.
I know right? It seems that this movie is more mature than the previous ones.
I totally agree with you.
McQueen will still be my favorite character!
Mine too, i hope there will be a 4th movie, i can't wait.
