I'm listening to the Beatles!
That's cool. What song?
I Want to Hold Your Hand.
Have you seen the movie Across the Universe?
Yeah! Did you like it?
Yes. I liked the scene with I Want to Hold Your Hand.
I haven't seen the movie but I want to.
Glee also covered that song too!
I saw that one. Kurt sang it right?
Yeah. It made me cry.
