Do you like Beatles trivia?
Sure.  I've been a fan for years.
Do you know more about one member or all members of the van equally?
Probably more about John Lennon.
Me too.  He has always intrigued me.
He was the edgiest Beatle, for sure.
Do you think that was due to Yoko Ono's influence?
No, I think it was because his mom was killed when he was young.
That is a good reason for angst.
I know, right?  It permeated his music.
