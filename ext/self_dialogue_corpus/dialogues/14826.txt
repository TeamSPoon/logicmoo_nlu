My favorite comedic director is Mel Brooks.
I loved Young Frankenstein.
He was a brilliant director and he used the same actors in a lot of his movies.
Did you see Spaceballs?
Only like 1000 times!
It's a great spoof movie.
Yes there were so many great scenes in that movie.
I love that he would take classics and make fun of them.
But he didn't just remake classics either.  Remember History of the World?
Oh yes, one of my favorite dudley moore movies.
