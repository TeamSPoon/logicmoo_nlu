what do you think of christian music?
I really like christian music?
I really get into writting music.Have you ever attempted to write your own music?
No I have never thought about writting my own music.It seems like it would be a hard thing to do
It really is not a hard thing to do.You just let your mind go in that direction and the music just flows from your sould to your pen.
I think I might just go in that direction and see where it leads me.
You will not know untill you try.
I do know that I feel at home when I am performing my music.
yeah,I know right.
Best most peaceful feeling in the world.
One of my favorite christian bands are coming to town next week.
Who are they?.
A band called His Gang.
I think I may have heard of them.
Yeah,why don't you go with me to see them.
Ok,I think I will.
Their music is just wonderful.Their music always gives me inspiration to write my own songs.
I love the music that you write.I just wish I had that much talent.
I have heard you play and sing and you are bursting with musicall talent.
Music takes me to a wonderful place in my soul that I don't never want to come back from.
