Have you seen John Carter?
Yes, it was awful.
It was one of the most expensive movies ever made, and flopped hard.
I had to turn it off after a half an hour.
I never read the original novel, but Edgar Rice Borroughs must be spinning in his grave.
There's a visual for you.
Why does Hollywood make such awful blockbusters these days?
They try to go the safe route and appeal to everyone. Often they end up appealing to no one.
I agree.
Films don't take risks anymore. That's what made the original Ghostbusters so great. It was a niche movie that hit it big.
Yeah, the new one can't hold a candle to it.
They turned it from a true comedy into an extended SNL skit.
It was bad all around, and had the stink of people's political agendas surrounding it, including the director's.
It's never a good idea to divide your audience along political lines. The movie made money, but not enough to recupe it's advertising costs.
That movie deserved to die a slow death.
Agreed.
You seen any movies in the last year?
No, I've pretty much stopped going to the theater.
Me too.
I think the last one I saw was the most recent X-Men.
