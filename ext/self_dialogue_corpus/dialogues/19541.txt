What rock band has the best guitarist?
That is a hard question to answer
Okay then. Which guitarist has the best riffs?
I'd say Tony Iommi
He is awesome
I agree
Do you like Iron Man?
That is a great song
My favorite Sabbath song is actually Planet Caravan
I like that one too
They have many classic songs
Yeah they do
I remember hearing the song "Black Sabbath" for the first time
Was it amazing?
I was blown away.
Yeah, their music is very hardcore.
Ozzy has the perfect voice
I agree
I would have loved to see them live in Paris
That was a great concert
