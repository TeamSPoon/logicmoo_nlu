Who do you think will get the Heisman trophy this year?
That's a tough call.
Yeah, sure is.
I bet that Watson and Jackson are in the running.
They are two amazing players.
Yep, they are on their way to the NFL.
You're not kidding.
I'm so impressed by their talent.
Me too.
They must have been born with a football.
I know.
How do you think they got so so good?
Hard work and dedication.
Talent too.
They have to be the very best.
Years and years of practice.
Lots of mentoring as well.
It must be an interesting ride.
To be in the spotlight would be challenging and exciting.
You have to handle stress well.
