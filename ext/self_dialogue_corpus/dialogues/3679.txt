Want to watch Se7en tonight?
Did you seriously pronounce the number 7 within the word "Seven"?
Yeah, that's not what you do?
It's just stylized. It's "Seven."
Oh, sorry. Want to watch it?
Sure, I've seen it a few times. It's a good thriller.
I just want to know why I hear people say "What's in the box?" every once in a while.
Oh, you'll love it. It's a pretty gore-filled thriller, though.
Thanks for the warning.
You'll like it. I don't know anyone who doesn't.
