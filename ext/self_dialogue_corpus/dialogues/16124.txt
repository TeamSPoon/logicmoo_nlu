Do you like Battle Raps at all?
I liked the scene in 8 Mile where Eminem was battle rapping.
Yea well there are actual events that go on like that.
Really? Are they as good?
Even better. So you have never heard of King of the Dot huh?
Sure haven't. What's that?
They are  a Canadian based promotion that holds battle rap competitions.
How does it work though?
Well they start out with contestants who have to prepare a certain amount of material against their opponent.
How much time do they get.
Depends on the round they are in, but anywhere from 90 seconds to 5 minutes.
5 minutes is a lot of material!
Yea, well they know each other and let me tell you, it gets brutal sometimes.
What do you mean?
It get's really personal, it's very entertaining.
Sounds interesting. Do they have local events?
Not them personally, but check online to see if there are any battle rap venues around.
Will do! How is the atmosphere at one of these things?
Absolutely amazing. So much energy!
Thanks dude! I'm going to check it out!
