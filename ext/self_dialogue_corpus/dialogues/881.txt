I read a ranking list of the best football players ever. Guess who was number one?
Not Tom Brady?
No, he was number seven. But he's still playing, maybe he can work his way up.
Okay, how about Joe Montana?
No, close. He was number three. But he is really well known when people talk about the greatest players.
Okay, how about Peyton Manning?
Nope, he was like number ten or something. Although he WAS a great quarterback.
Brett Favre was a great quarterback.
Yes he was. But he was even further down the list than Manning.
Dan Marino was another great quarterback.
He was down on the list too. The greatest player listed was not a quarterback.
Really? What position did the greatest player play?
Wide receiver. Now that's a good hint, since there wasn't a lot of those on the top of the list.
Hmm, Calvin Johnson was a wide receiver.
He was way down on the list. You gotta think old timers.
Randy Moss was a wide receiver. Not him?
Nope. It was Jerry Rice.
Wow, Rice was considered the greatest player of all time?
Yep, and number two was Walter Payton.
I always liked Walter Payton, he was a great player to watch.
