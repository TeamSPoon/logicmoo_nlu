Have you seen Toy Story That Time Forgot?
No! I didn't realize there are more Toy Story movies than 1, 2 and 3!
Yeah! Remember Bonnie from the third Toy Story movie? It's from her perspective!
That's awesome! I'll have to watch that one!
It's so good! It's not as long as a movie so I don't think it gets the credit it deserves.
That's disappointing. I know other movies have done short spin offs but I didn't know about Toy Story!
Woody and Buzz actually have small roles in this one. Bonnie has multiple toys that were at the Daycare in the third one and one of those is the main character.
Interesting! Which toy is the main character then?
It's the dinosaur named Trixie. It mainly has dinosaurs in it! It's definitely worth watching.
I think all of the Toy Stories are definitely worth watching!
