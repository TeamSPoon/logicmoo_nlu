Have you watched the movie Lights Out?
Is that the one with Teresa Palmer, Maria Bello , and the ghost spirit that appears in the shadows?
That's the movie. Have you seen it? I thought it was pretty suspenseful.
Yes I have watched it. I thought it was pretty well done and loved the concept of how the ghost only appears in the dark and shadows.
I remember the first time it occurred at the beginning of the movie, it was pretty terrifying and I was definitely pretty spooked by it.
I thought the gimmick wore thin after awhile though although that creeping feeling we got to witness when the main characters didn't was pretty effective.
I think we all had moments of fear like that as children so they certainly played on those fears. I could really identify with Teresa Palmers fears as well as the children in the movie.
I liked how they actually had a background story on the ghost haunting them. Her background story was pretty good, about how she was a friend of the mother's and wouldn't let go of the mother played by Maria Bello.
I really liked that element of the story too, because it gave it some heart. I was shocked at the ending. You know with Maria Bello's character and all.
I kind of expected it to end the way it did which was a slight let down for me, but overall I was pretty entertained and enjoyed it a lot.
