You know when I was a kid I really hated country music?
No kidding! I've always loved it.
Yeah. It all sounded sad, and dumb to me.
You're talking like that's in the past.
Well a few years ago I started listening again and I found myself really liking it!
Oh yeah? What changed your mind?
I think it started with that band Sugarland.
They're the ones who do Stuck Like Glue, right?
Yeah! That song's really funny.
Country isn't all sad you know.
I'm learning that. After I heard that song I looked up some of their albums and listened some more.
The Incredible Machine is a great album of theirs.
That's the next one I listened to. The opening song All We Are was really powerful.
It's a great song. Cheerful and strong at the same time.
And wow what a voice she has!
That's always been one of Country's strengths.
True. I used to say I loved the singers and hated the songs.
Now you're liking some of the songs too?
Yeah, some energy and joy and fun really makes a big difference.
It absolutely does. Sad has its place too but not all the time.
