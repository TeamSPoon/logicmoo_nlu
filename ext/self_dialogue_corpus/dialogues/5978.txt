I finally saw the new version of Beauty and the Beast.
Did you like it?
I don't really think so, I have such a fond memory of the original one.
Yeah, that one rocks.  Did you like anything better in the new one?
Well, they certainly developed characters more: Gaston and Lefou were better.  Gaston was almost sympathetic!
Yeah, I agree.  And you have to love the real scenes and fantastic CGI.
That was breathtaking, you're right.  And it was nice seeing some big stars.
Who knew Emma Watson could sing?
And so well.  I don't think every Disney classic has to go live action, but this one was ok.
You just grew up with the animated one, a new generation will grow up on this one.
