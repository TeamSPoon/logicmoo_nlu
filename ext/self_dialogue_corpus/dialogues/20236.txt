Have you seen Return of the Native?
No.
I'm reading the book, and I've taken out the film from the library.
What's it about?
It's based on Thomas Hardy's eighteen-ninety-five novel about a fascinating but restless woman and the men she ruins by her coquetry.
Tell me more.
Eustacia Vye is beautiful, slightly mysterious , and unhappy about living in a rural farming community with her grandfather.
And who does she get involved with?
The man she thinks she loves is Damon Wildeve, but he's as fickle as she, and is engaged to Thomasin Yeobright.
Why does she imagine she loves him?
She wants him to rescue her from this awful backwater and take her to America or anytplace that's not here.
What happens next?
The "mNative" in the title is Clym Yeobright, who's just returned from years in Paris, and she sees him as romantic and capable of rescuing her.
Is he?
No, actually, he's  level-headed and prefers the rural community, and is  and not planning to return to Paris.
Does Eustacia know that?
No, but she becomes engaged to him, hoping.
How does it end?
You'll have to see the fil, which had an early starring role for Catherine Zeta-Jones.
I'm ordering it from my library today. Thanks.
