Have we seen the last of a dominant starting running back that can handle 30 carries a game?
No I think its cyclical and right now the league is a passing league.
And what lends itself to that belief?
The rules are set up to favor it
Why do you think that is?
The rules regarding pass interferece
OH ok i see your persepective.
They really need to adjust them
How about the catch rule
They screwed the Cowboys on that call
I think thats the first one that needs to be fixed.
I just wish you could be physical like you used to
You can thank those same guys for the reason that it isnt
Why?
They ended up suing the league
Yeah well they deserved it
The league?
Yeah they exploited these guys
They could have warned them against the perils of football? Is that your sentiment
Yes and they should have had these guys sign waivers that they wouldnt pull these stunts
