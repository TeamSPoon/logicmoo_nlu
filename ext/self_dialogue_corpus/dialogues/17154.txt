You have a favorite band of all time?
Yeah, probably U2
U2. That's a pretty good choice.
Yeah, they've had a lot of great hits.
Which album do you like best?
Probably Joshua Tree like everyone else.
Yeah, Where the Streets Have No Name
Yep, that's one of the classics
I actually really liked Pop
Which one was that?
Came out in 1997 and had a lot of techno inspired songs
Hmmm, I don't think I remember that one
Discotheque was probably the biggest one
Sounds vaguely familiar
And then I also liked Staring at the Sun
Okay, I think I remember that one.
Yeah, overall I don't think the album did that well
Probably not. I can't even remember it that well.
Yeah, All That You Can't Leave Behind was bigger
Oh yeah, with Beautiful Day
