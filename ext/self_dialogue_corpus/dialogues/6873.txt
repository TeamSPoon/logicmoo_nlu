What Disney movie would you like to see redone?
I would love to see Disney redo Snow White.
Thats a very classic movie.
The seven dwarfs are the best!
I can never name them all no matter how hard I try.
It takes some practice! I don't know how they would remake it.
I would be interested in who would play the role of Snow White.
Hopefully a new actress.
I'm not sure the story line would be a big hit with todays crowd.
True. But a love story is a love story!
