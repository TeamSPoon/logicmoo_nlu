Could Aerosmith still perform if they wanted?
Sure but I think Steven Tyler is so old now he couldnt handle it.
I still remember hearing Crazy for the first time.
I still remember seeing the video or it.
They had his daughter in a bunch of his videos.
Yeah and they had the duo with Run DMC.
That was a song meant to appeal to other fans in different genres
Did it serve its purpose?
I never heard anyone who liked rap say they started listening to Aerosmith
I guess the same could be said for the other side too
