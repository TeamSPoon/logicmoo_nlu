What's your favorite rock band?
I like older punk music , like Richard Hell and the Voidoids.
I like older punk as well but also newer stuff.
When I think "newer" I think of the 90's punk
I guess its not that new any more.
I liked a few from that era as well
Like who?
Bands like Screeching Weasel and the Queers
I really liked them too
But you cant beat the originals
