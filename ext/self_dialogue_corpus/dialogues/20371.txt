Kurt Russell? As in Snake Plisskin, Wyatt Earp Kurt Russell?
Yeah, and alongside him is Pulp Fiction, Snakes on a Plane Samuel L. Jackson.
So what is his character like?
Whose character? Jackson's or Russell's?
Russell's, I guess.
Well, in this movie, he's a bounty hunter.
Wait, wait! Tarantino made another movie about Bounty Hunting!
Yeah, but this one is a far cry from Django Unchained.
Samuel L Jackson isn't a head house slave, I take it.
No, the movie is set not long after the Civil War.
Okay, so is he hunting for a bounty in the movie?
No, this time Russell's character is taking a bounty in to be hanged.
What about Jackson? Where does he fit in?
He's also a bounty hunter, but he just kills his bounties, so he's more hauling them back.
You're not spoiling something that we're supposed to discover mid-film, are you?
No, for a Tarantino movie, this one follows a surprising chronological order.
Okay, so this is established at the beginning, I take it.
Yeah. Now, they each have sort of quirks.
Well, what's Jackson's main "quirk?"
Well, Jackson's character has this letter that he says Lincoln wrote him.
