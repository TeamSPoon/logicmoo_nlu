Have you heard the latest from Lady Gaga?
Do you mean "The Cure"?
Yes!  Her voice is so clear on this one!
Her voice has matured and become so gorgeous over the last few years.
She is so much more classy than she used to be.
I think she has grown up and into her popularity.
i don't think she does as much for shock value anymore.
No, but she still pushes the boundaries of social acceptance.
I know.  She probably always will.
I think her music is much more lyric than it used to be.
Absolutely.   She still tells it like it is.
Did you like the stuff she did with that old guy?
Do you mean Tony Bennett?
Yeah, him.  That old guy.
I like the way their voices blended.
Their songs were pretty cool, too.
You know they were what they call "old standards".
You mean they weren't new stuff?
Nope.  They were things from when "that old guy" was a lot younger.
Well, you could knock me over with a feather!  I didn't know.
