Have you heard Paparazzi?
Yes, that is from Lady Gaga.
I like that bed room she is in.
I felt sad when she was pushed over the side.
She got paralyzed.
Her crutch dance was cool.
It was crazy that she made it look cool.
Her tiny black lips were strange.
It looked kind of like MICKEY MOUSE with the sunglasses.
Then she killed the boyfriend.
