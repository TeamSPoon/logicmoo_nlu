I'm going to the Traverse Film Festival next month... I'm so excited.
I've never been to a film festival. What kind of movies will you see?
Well, it's heavy on foreign films and documentaries.
I pretty much just see big box office movies, like the Oscar nominees.
I like some of those too, as long as they have great characters and well developed narratives.
So I thought film festivals were mostly "art movies."
Well, I suppose some would be classified like that, but it offers a lot of genres, and some great classics too.
Hmmm, well maybe I should take a look at it. So like any films I would have heard of?
One of the people's choice films they will show on an outdoor screen is "What About Bob?"
Oh wow... I loved that movie. Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors.
Oh, and Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. They show several cult classics like that... really iconic films along with independent films no one has ever heard of.
So what is the weirdest film you are going to see?
Well, I might see Brigsby Bear. It has some great people in it, like Greg Kinnear and Claire Danes, but a really strange storyline.
Alrighty then. Anything more mainstream?
My number one choice is "Paris Can Wait" with Diane Lane and Alex Baldwin. I watched the trailer...looks very gorgeous and enjoyable. A good contrast to some of the more bizarre films I'll probably see.
Well, let me know how you like the festival. Maybe you can talk me into going with you next year.
Oh, I forgot: my favorite genre is "shorts." And... wait for it: Melissa Gilbert and her husband Tim Busfield made one of the shorts, and they are going to be speaking after the presentation of it... in person!
Really??? I love Melissa Gilbert. Alright, can I come with you?
Sure, I'll send you the brochure and schedule and we can pick out some ones we want to see together.
Fun. Thanks.
