do you like pretty hate machine
the album by nine inch nails?
yeah, that one
that album was good.
i really liked sin and terrible lie
sin is very intense and so danceable
the whole album was so danceable
you wont hear it in a club though
yeah, all they play is rap
i hate rap
there are some good ones though
like who?
kendrick is an important one
he isnt bad from what ive heard
he actually talks about politics, racism and things that matter
he's anti violence too, right
he is.
thats a good thing to have
so much music is bad for the youth
its good hes doing something positive
