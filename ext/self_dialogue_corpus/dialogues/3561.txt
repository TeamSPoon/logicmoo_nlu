So I heard you are a horror movie buff.
Yeah I have watched horror movies since I was a kid.
What are some of your favorites?
I like several, but probably Amityville Horror and Stephen King's It.
Is Amityville based on a true story?
Supposed to be.  THere was an actual house and people kept moving out of it.
Are you going to see the remake of IT?
Definitely.  I'm a little nervous though, I hope they don't mess it up.
What do you mean?
Well I am a big fan of the original.  TIm Curry is an excellent Pennywise and I don't really know if they are going to make the new one look different or act different.
