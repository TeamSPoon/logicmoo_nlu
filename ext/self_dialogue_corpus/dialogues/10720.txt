Have you seen the movie Fast Five?
No, I haven't. Is it in the Fast and Furious series?
Yeah, it is. It came out two years after the first one with Paul Walker.
Oh, what is this one about?
Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's characters have to team up again to escape from the authorities.
That sounds similar to the first one.
It is similar, but this time they're the bad guys instead of the good guys.
Oh, okay. Who else is in the movie?
Dwayne Johnson plays a federal agent.
That's cool, I really like him.
