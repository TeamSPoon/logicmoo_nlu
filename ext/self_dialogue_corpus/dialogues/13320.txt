So, would you prefer a blaster or a saber?
I'm a Hon Solo kind of a guy.
A blaster then?
Of course. I'll bet you're more of a Luke kinda fellow.
Guilty as charged!
What's so great about the saber>
"It's an elegant weapon, meant for a more civilized time."
Settle down Obi-Wan
Ha! Blasters are so boring.
But you can't beat the range!
