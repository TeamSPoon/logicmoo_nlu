We finally saw Moana.
Wasn't it great?
Yeah, I liked it a lot. Especially the music.
I know, my kids won't stop singing it!
It was nice to see a Disney character that looked different from the other princesses.
I agree. It was a fun story about girl power.
I thought The Rock was pretty funny in it, too.
Yeah. Doesn't it make you want to go lounge on a beach?
Yes, it was so beautiful!
You're making me want to re-watch it!
