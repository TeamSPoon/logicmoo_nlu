Which do you like better: the newer Star Trek movies or the older ones?
I really like the older ones because they have good plots and they capture the chemistry of the original cast better.
Well, what about Star Trek 1 or movie 5?
Hey, no fair, we don't talk about the odd numbered Star Trek movies!
I will say that I really do like Wrath of Kahn, Search for Spock, and Voyage Home. Those are very personable and they make a good little trilogy.
Yes, that is an awesome line-up. I like that each of these movies is somewhat independant, but also based closely on the previous ones.
What do you think about the newer ones, then?
They're OK. Of course there are better graphics and a lot of action.
True that. The action and tech is their redeeming quality.
I wasn't really happy about changing Kirk and blowing up Vulcan in the first movie. Other than that, I thought it was a clever plot.
I know what you mean. I have mixed feelings about "Into Darkness."
It was clever, but it seemed so redundant; J. J. Abrams needs to make new movies, not ones that are just rehashing old plots.
Dude, don't even get me started on "The Force Awakens."
I know! It was basically just parts of Star Wars and Return of the Jedi spliced together!
So there's a kid who grows up in the desert, and they escae and meet a smuggler, and get involved with a rebellion, and start using the force and blow up a big death star thing-a-ma-jig.
Now, which one are we talking about: Star Wars or The Force Awakens?
Both! That's what I mean; they're exactly the same movie but with different characters.
And with some of the same characters.
That's right, it was totally lame. So what are we going to do now?
Let's go watch some Firefly!
