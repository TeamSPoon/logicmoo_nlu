How about that Andy Dalton?
Andy Dalton???? He's the worst quarterback in the NFL!!
But his stats are always in the top 5% of the league!
He's never even won a playoff game!  He's 0 for 6 in the playoffs!
What about Phillip Rivers? He's great, but chokes in the playoffs, too.
Yeah, but he's never had a great team behind him.
Neither has Dalton. Paul Brown won't spend the money to surround him with quality players.
That's true. Paul Brown is the Bengals biggest problem.
If the Bengals were owned by Art Rooney, or Bob Kraft, they would have won 6 Super Bowls with Dalton.
Maybe, but they don't have Bill Belichek, or Mike Tomlin, either.
What would Belichek, and Tomlin do differently for the Bengals?
They're both great coaches that can motivate the team in crunch time.
So how could the Bengals change their future?
They could hire a better general manager, than Katy Blackburn, and get rid of family nepotism.
I think that is what is holding them back. Bill Walsh would have been a good pick. Too bad he's dead
Haha, yeah. But on another note, they could triple the scouting staff.
They are trying to operate this team on a 1980's type of staff.
I've heard their scouting staff is so small, they can't evaluate all the college prospects out there.
That's true. Their front office needs a major overhaul.
It's high time to shake up this team leadership. I would like to see them win a playoff
