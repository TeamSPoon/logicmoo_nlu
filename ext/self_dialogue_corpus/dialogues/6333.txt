Have you seen the Disney's movie The Chronicles of Narnia?
Yes I have seen that movie. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
Yes thats the first movie which has been released in the series back in 2005.
Yes i know, I saw the first part and I was hoping to see more, then came two more movies in the same series!
Yes everyone were longing to see another movie from the series, then came The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
Yeah the second movie in the series was released back in 2008, that was too a good movie to watch.
That is true, that movie was really cool, movie had a faster story telling style than first part!
Yes I did noticed that too, it was really a brilliant movie. Graphics and editing were amazing.
But the most interesting movie in the series was The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it was superb.
But what happened? They did not continue the series after they had released 3rd part back in 2010.
