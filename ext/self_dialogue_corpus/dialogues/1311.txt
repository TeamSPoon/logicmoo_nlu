Tell me what your thoughts are about the new NFL Season.
I am really excited for the regular season to get underway.
I know what you mean - it is almost painful waiting on the regular season during the summer
Exactly - the pre-season and summer camps are usually disappointing, it has no resemblance to the regular season.
If anything it always seems like the pre-season and regular season are exact opposites.
Right - what I hate is when someone from my favorite team gets injured during pre-season.
Yes! that has happened before to my teams.  Who is your favorite team.
I have a couple I watch faithfully. But living in the Washington DC area. I am a Redskins fan.
Wow lots new there this year. What do you think about the Doug Williams hire?
I like all other fans of the Redskins - love him. But I think he is in a no-win job.
Yeah if I guy like Joe Gibbs came back and couldn't fix things or get them better - not sure anyone can.
The best news we would ever get as fans is if Dan Snyder sells the team.
Thats never going to happen though.
Well one can hope - maybe he will get an offer he can't refuse one day.
Do you have any opinions on the Redkins name controversy?
Yes - I totally see both sides of it - but again it's a Dan Snyder thing I think.
Yeah - what would you like to see happen if it was your choice.
If it were up to me - I look at it and say if it is offensive - who am I to keep something so major that it offends so many people.
I feel the same... it's not like it is a cool name or the best franchise name ever.
And the fact it is our Capital city is bad too... it should be something government or US related I think.
