Do you remember seeing Finding Nemo?
I do, I loved that movie.
It is sad in the begining when his mom and all the other eggs get munched.
Yah some of those kid movies start out really harsh.
Who is your favoriye character in Nemo?
Dor, definately Dory I thought she was really funny with the short term memory issues.
I likes the Marlin too.
I loved the part where there are in that wave of migrating marine life and the turtles are there. What is that called?
I can not remember but that made me think about the chase in the trench where Nemo is being chased.
The movie was pretty exciting a few times.
What about the dentist?
Oh yah, the mean dentist who get nemo while diving.
More so remember there is a nasty girl who is not very nice to the fish.
It was exciting when they were trying t get nemo out of the filter so he can be free.
You can date the movie by the fact that the dentist still had spit bowls,now Nemo would be sucked up a tube to get out.
I always felt bad for the dad that he had lost his wife.
And now his kid, it was sad.
One of Pixars best that is for sure.
Someday we should see Finding Dory.
I am in!
