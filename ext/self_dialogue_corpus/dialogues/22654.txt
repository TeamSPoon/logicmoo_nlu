What is your opinion on the Fast and Furious movies?
I really love them.
You don't think that they've made too many?
I kind of feel that way but then I still end up enjoying the movie.
I do too.
Some people feel like they should have stopped once Paul Walker died.
I can see why they would say that but I also think they can make good movies without him.
Right, he wasn't the only main character.
He was great though. I liked him and Mia together.
I did too.
I also really like Dominick and Letty together.
They have great chemistry.
It was so sad when she didn't remember him in that one movie.
Right! And he had to help her remember their times together.
How do you feel about the newer characters in the other movies?
I liked that they used The Rock.
I like him too. Not bad on the eyes and a good actor.
Yep I agree!
Which was your favorite character?
I have to say Vin Diesel.
