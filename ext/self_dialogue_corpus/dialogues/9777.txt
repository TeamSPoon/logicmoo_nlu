Walk this Way by Run DMC was one of the greatest rap songs of all time.
What? Only you would say a rap song with rock music was the greatest.
Not because of the song. Because of what it did.
What did it do?
It crossed over into mainstream.
I ain't no sell out. I don't care about crossing over.
Come on man. In the early stages of a music genre the more listeners you can get the better.
I guess I never thought of it like that.
And, if you listen to it, it's not a bad song.
O.k., now you might be pushing it.
