Have you ever thought about taking a road trip to Texas?
I drove through Texas once on my way to the West Coast. Why, what's happening in Texas?
They're having the Austin City Limits Music Festival the first and second weekend of October.
Is there a lot of good bands playing?
There's over 100 bands with eight different stages, that's why it runs for two different weekends. And yes, there are lots of good bands.
That's kind of nice, two different weekends in case you can't make it on a certain weekend. What kind of bands would I like?
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jay Z, Chance the Rapper, The Killers, Gorillaz, Martin Garrix, Ice Cube, Ryan Adams, Live, EDM, and lots of others.
Oh, I LOVE The Red Hot Chili Peppers!
They don't have prices up for tickets for a single day yet, those are supposedly coming soon
What about the 3 day passes?
The 3 day pass for weekend one is sold out already, they still have those available for weekend two for $255.
It's kind of expensive, that works out to $85 a day with the three day pass.
It's because there are so many bands there that they have to pay.
Is there parking nearby?
No. It's in a park, and they advise you can't park in the neighborhood. The recommended route is to park in one of the downtown paid lots and ride the shuttle bus down to the festival.
What about places to stay?
There's lots of hotels with ticket packages, but there are probably plenty of smaller motelds if you want to find some place cheaper to stay. It's always best in these events to book way ahead.
What do people post about their experiences there?
It's called the live music capital of the world. I've never been, but I imagine it'slike Texas where everything is bigger- the number of bands, number of people, and amount of fun hopefully.
It does sound like an "experience
