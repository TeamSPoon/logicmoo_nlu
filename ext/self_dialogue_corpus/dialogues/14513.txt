Hey do you follow basketball at al?
Kind of, but not much recently. Why?
Just curious if you've been a fan of the celtics!
I guess I'd say I am, but i haven't been watching lately.
Why not?
I haven't been an avid fan since the 90s. I feel like they've gone downhill since then.
You haven't been watching lately then, have you!?
I haven't, why?
They've been doing awesome, they won tonight like 111 to 106 or something like that!
Wow, it's been a while since bball has been going on in the Garden still this late in the season.
Tell me about it! Why haven't you been watching since the 90s?
They were great then. When they ha Larry Bird. I've kinda lost hope since then.
They did suck for the past several years.
Yeah I'd hear scores hear and there and realized I wasn't msising out on anything.
I went to a game like 4 years ago and more than have the crowd left before the end.
Who did they play?
I don't even remember, guess that's a sign of how memorable the game was.
I'll say!
But you should really start watching again!
Maybe I will- maybe we'll see each other at the Garden!
