Hey, only a few more weeks and football season is here. Are you excited?
Yes! What team do you think will win it all this year?
I'm rooting for the Texans this year.
Yeah they have a superstar young quarterback Deshaun Watson
Yes, they also have an amazing defense.
This year, hopefully JJ Watt stays healthy.
Do you think they can beat New England?
I think the Texans have a better team.  Hopefully, the coaching is good.
Yes, there have been issues with O'Brien but he is a great guy.
O'Brien needs to be more aggressive this year.
I also love the Panthers.  What about you?
The Panthers are good.  Cam Newton didn't have a great year last year though.
I know, but this year should be better if he's healthy.
Everyone was after him last year.  He kept getting sacked.
Yes, the offensive line needs to do a better job.
I agree with that.
However, between the two, I want the Texans to win the superbowl.
I'm with you, the Texans deserve a chance to win.
Yes, they've given up a lot for Watson.
We will see as the season starts.
