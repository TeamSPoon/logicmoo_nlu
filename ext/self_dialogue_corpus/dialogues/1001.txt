What NFL team do you hate?
Ummm, the Seahawks probably.
Yep, I hate them too, also Dallas Cowboys.
Yes! America's Team? They need to upgrade that.
Yeah, haha.
I doubt they will win a Super Bowl this year.
I doubt it too but you never know.
The Minnesota Vikings need to win one.
Yeah, they do. The oldest team to not win one I think.
Yeah, oldest in all sports I think.
Poor Vikings.
Yeah, maybe they will get one someday.
Adrian Peterson is gone but I think they are better off for it.
Me too, they have a lot more cap space for sure.
Yeah, and he was getting old and not as productive.
Agreed.
The Super Bowl is in their home town this year, it would be cool for them to win it at home.
Yeah, that would be perfect.
It has never happened yet, winning at home.
Maybe this is the year.
