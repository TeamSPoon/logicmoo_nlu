I'm going to watch a rugby game on Friday. Would you like to come?
No thanks. I don't really like rugby at all.
That's surprising. I know you like football, and they're a bit similar
They are I guess. I just never really watched much rugby.
I'm from Australia, so we don't really watch NFL much. Rugby is our thing since we were kids.
I guess NFL is similar for me. Growing up I was always going to the Ravens games with my father.
Are there any NFL teams outside of the US? I know we don't have any in Australia.
No, all teams are in the USA, although occasionally they do play overseas for exhibition games / friendly games.
Do you know if they ever play in Australia? If they do I'd definitely tell my friends back home to check it out.
I don't think so. I know the Jacksonville Jaguars began play one game a year at Wembley Stadium in London.
Very cool. I wonder if it's only in London because there are a lot of Americans living there nowadays.
I'm not sure actually. I remember the Buffalo Bills used to play one game every season at Rogers Centre in Toronto for a few years, but don't think they do it anymore.
Where in the USA are most of the teams? They're spread all over right?
Yes, they're pretty all over the map. Althought there are more teams on the eastern half of the country.
You mentioned you used to go to the Ravens games. Is that in Philadelphia?
No the team in Philly is the Eagles. The Ravens are the "Baltimore Ravens"
Baltimore? I thought you grew up in DC
I grew up in Maryland, right on the border of DC.
Ah so you could have supported either the Baltimore Ravens or whatever team there is in DC
The team in DC is the Redskins. They're a good team as well
