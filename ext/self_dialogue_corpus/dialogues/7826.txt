Have you read the harry potter books?
I havent, but i've seen all the movies.
You should definitely read the books as well, highly recommend it.
What do you think the differences are between the books and movies?
I think that there are a lot of differences, they left a lot of details out of the movies that was in the books.
What book would you recommend I read first?
You should just read them in order!
I think i'll read them and then watch the movies as I finish the book.
That's a fantastic idea, you'll be able to see all the little differences i'm talking about.
exactly. Thanks for the suggestion!
