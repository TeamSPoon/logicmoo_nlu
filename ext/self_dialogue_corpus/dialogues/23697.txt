Does Ryan Gosling have any new films coming out?
I'm not sure. I bet he does.
Did you see his last movie?
Was that La La Land?
Yes, what did you think?
I loved it! I thought it was magical.
Really? What was your favorite thing about it?
I thought the music was wonderful. That was my favorite part.
I didn't like the music at all.
Why not?
It seemed too simple.
Did you like anything about it?
I liked the other actors in the film
Do you mean you liked Emma Stone?
Yes, I loved her. She was fantastic.
We must not be on the same page. I didn't like her.
Well, I suppose we will agree to disagree.
Yes, definitely. I am glad we each found something to like in the film at least
I also really enjoyed that they used Los Angeles as the setting.
Me too! It is a beautiful city.
