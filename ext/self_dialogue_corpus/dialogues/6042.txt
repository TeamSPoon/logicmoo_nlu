Darby O'Gill and the Little People is so underrated!
It was a pretty fantastic film.
Sean Connery sings!
You can't top that!
Did he do any other Disney?
Not that I am aware of.
That was really the golden age of Disney.
I agree. Grew up on all those old films.
Me too. Disney should get back to their roots.
They're making too much money now.
