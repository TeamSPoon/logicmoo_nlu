Hey, I know you know a lot about Disney movies.
Indeed.
What was the first Disney movie ever made?
Well, the first animated feature film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
And when was that one made?
1937!
Wow, that's eighty years ago.
Yes, Disney has been making movies for eighty years and they aren't showing any signs of slowing down.
Do you think they've kept the quality up.
Yes, their movies have been consistently good for the past eighty years. While I've only lived twenty-five years, I've had the good fortune of getting to watch many a Disney movie.
