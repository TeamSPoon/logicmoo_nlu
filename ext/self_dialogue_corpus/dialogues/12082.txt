So what do you think of Kylo Ren?
He's a pretty sinister character, and a look-alike of Darth Vader.
But obviously, he seems weaker right?
Yeah, in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he didn't even seem that powerful.
But he's got a bad-ass looking lightsaber, tho.
YEAHHH!!! His lightsaber was actually an idea of a close friend of mine!!
Could you spare me the details?
No can do! Don't wanna mention anymore Star Wars spoilers from here!
Come to think of it, I haven't seen the Rogue One movie yet.
It's not that great, honestly, I'll tell you that.
