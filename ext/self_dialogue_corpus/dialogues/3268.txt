Have you ever seen the Blair Witch Project 2?
No, I didn't know there was a second one.
It's actually a scary movie.
Oh, the first one really wasn't scary at all.
This one is more like a movie, not a lost and found footage deal.
What's it about?
A group of young people go into an old house and find a witch.
And they probably all die?
Pretty much, but the music and the atmosphere were dark and scary.
I might have to see it.
