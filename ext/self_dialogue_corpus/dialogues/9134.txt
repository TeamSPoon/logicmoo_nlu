Do you like older rock music?
It depends on what you mean by older. The 80's or 90's?
I guess the 80's. Do you like Guns and roses?
Sure some of their songs are great. I like Metallica though.
Oh yeah! That one song about the sandman was amazing.
Oh, you mean Enter Sandman. I think that was the name.
Yeah that's probably it. What about the 90's bands?
Sure some of it. I like Pearl Jam.
I think Pearl Jam is still around.
Really, I wonder how bands stay together so long.
