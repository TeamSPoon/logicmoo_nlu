Where do you think it ties into the Tarantino universe?
I am not sure; I don't really keep up with that.
Well it is another western film, like Django.
This one takes place after slavery though, right?
Yeah, so if anything, the people in the movie would have to be the descendants of the characters in Django.
Wouldn't that be weird if Samuel L. Jackson was playing a Django's grandson or something?
That actually would be very ironic if that were the case.
Okay, so there is only one black person in the movie, so it is pretty obvious who they would be related to.
No, that's not true. There are a couple of minor characters who are black in the movie. For all we know, they could be the the descendants.
That seems really lackluster to make them supporting characters. Do they at least do something important?
Not really. They mostly just die and serve as clues for Jackson to figure out what is really going on.
See, I can't see him just killing them off like that.
Then you cannot appreciate the brilliance of art and a Tarantino film. You know he does no do the ordinary.
I understand that,  but what would be the significance of creating a universe if you were to just kill off the links to the universe.
Well, Jackson is still linked to them through friendship, but I think Jackson dies too.
Jackson dies?
Oops, well I don't know for certain. They never really show him die on screen, and he is alive for a long while after he is shot.
He got shot? It thought he didn't take roles in which he got killed.
I guess he changed his mind when Star Wars came out. He may have been killed in a gruesome way in The Hateful Eight.
Did they lynch him?
