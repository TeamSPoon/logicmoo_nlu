What is your least liked type of movie
Well  i am not a movie person
Why are you not a movie person
Because they do not have a long lasting affect
But they are entertaining
Well i do not like comedy movies to much
Why not
The funniness usually falls flat for me and just does nothing for me
I guess that would be personal taste
I mean everything is subjective
