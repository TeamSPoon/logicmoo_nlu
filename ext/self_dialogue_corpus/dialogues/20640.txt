How come we never go to the movies anymore?
You keep saying it's a hassle.
Well I want to go now.
Fine, what did you have in mind.
One word: Deadpool.
Done. I heard it's going to be amazing.
I heard the same, but what else can you expect from Ryan Reynolds?
He does have a great track record. I know it wasn't anyone's favorite, but I liked Green Lantern.
So did I, I never understood why so man people had a problem with that movie.
Fan-nerds, that was the problem. They nit picked it into oblivion.
Well I don't care what anyone will have to say about Deadpool.
You shouldn't, I heard he breaks the fourth wall basically the whole movie.
I did too, I was told it's not a hero movie for those that want a typical hero.
Deadpool has never been a typical hero, he's Wolverine with not reservations.
I'm glad they aren't using the X-men Origin's Deadpool for the movie.
Yeah he was just creepy.
As long as he has his kitanas I'll be fine.
That's the same thing you said about Ninja Assassins.
Yeah it is, so what? That movie was awesome too.
I never said it wasn't, but I expect Deadpool to be heavily armed with something a little bigger than some swords.
