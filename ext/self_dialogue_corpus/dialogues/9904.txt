Do you ever listen to Lil Wayne?
Not really.  I know who he is though.
Do you like his music?
I mean, some of his songs are pretty catchy, but I'm not a fan.
What is your favorite song by him?
Probably Lollipop.  My mom actually loves that song.
Really?  Does she know what it's about?
Nope, but I'm not gonna tell her!
That's pretty funny.
Yeah, my mom riding around singing a Lil Wayne song.
