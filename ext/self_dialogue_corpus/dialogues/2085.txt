Which NFL teams do you think have the best logos?
I think that the Cowboys star is iconic.
It's only iconic because there's a lot of Cowboy fans that say its iconic.
I'm not a Cowboy fan, but you have to admit, the logo is iconic. I personally don't like their color scheme regardless.
I think the Browns probably have one of the worse color schemes and logos. I don't understand it.
I don't either. It's so boring.
Yeah, it's just a color. The helmet is orange.
That's what makes it even worse. It doesn't make any sense.
I do think that the Rams have a pretty cool helmet.
I guess, but it looked better when it was yellow and blue. These days, their color scheme is gold and dark blue.
Yeah, I don't like their color scheme either. I wish they would go back to their old colors.
The Cardinals also have a pretty boring logo. It's just a bird.
Yeah, I'm not a fan of it. That's another team with a logo and concept that makes no sense.
I think it's because the team moved from St. Louis where a Cardinal name and logo makes more sense.
I wish more teams would just change their names when they change cities.
Sometimes it's just too much money.
I think that's part of the reason some fanbases never get into their teams. Franchises don't take pride in relating to the city.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Personally, I think I just don't like the logo of any team that isn't mine.
At least you can be honest about it.
