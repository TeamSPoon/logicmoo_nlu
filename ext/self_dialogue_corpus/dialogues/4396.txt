Have you seen Cape Fear?
Yes, with Robert Mitchum?
Well, he is in both, but I mean the remake with Robert DeNiro.
Yes, I love that one too. They are both very thrilling.
Did you like the Gregory Peck one more?
No, I preferred the Scorsese one.
Did you find it scary?
Very, I did not know what to expect at all.
Who is your favorite character?
I liked Nick Nolte's character.
