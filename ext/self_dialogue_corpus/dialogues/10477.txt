So what did Mozart die of exactly?
No one really is sure about it.
But they have symptoms listed somewhere.
Yes. We know he suffered from fever, swelling, pain and vomiting before he was bed ridden
That sounds like a lot of bad stuff. i don't want to die like that
People have made 118 guesses so far.
As to what the illness was? That's ridiculous
yep. They have supportive arguments for their guesses, and they're pretty interesting.
Like what?
Well this one doctor said Mozart might have died from Acute Rheumatic Fever.
Who, and what's that?
It was published by the AAAS, which is the American association for the advancement of science.
So we should trust it? Just because AAAS said it?
Well it carries some weight if you ask me. Anyway, this was published by a panel of doctors.
So what's that fever?
It's called Rheumatic fever, caused by a streptococcal infection.
Sounds awful
yep. Its symptoms include painful joints, fever, rashes, vomiting, swelling, and irritation.
Did Mozart have all that?
Yep, he was so sick by the end of his life, he couldn't even sit up on his bed on his own. After a fit of delirium which can happen after heart starts to dysfunction which is also a symptom of Rheumatic fever, he fell into a coma and died. All in all, it just took 15 days for him to take ill and die. Acute rheumatic fever.
