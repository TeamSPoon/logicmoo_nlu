What are your thoughts on the San Francisco 49ers?
They have been awful since they lost that Super Bowl a few years back.
That they have, but do you think their new coach is going to do better or worse than the last one?
I don't think you can do much worse than Chip Kelly did last season.
Speaking of Chip Kelly, you remember how he made the Eagles good for two seasons then destroyed the roster.
Yeah that was brutal if you are an Eagles fan to see all those players go.
Back to the 49ers, you think Brian Hoyer has a shot at winning some games?
I doubt it, he always gets hurt no matter how productive he is for a few games.
Who would take his place if he gets hurt?
I would think CJ Bethard the rookie from Iowa would take over.
Bethard was decent in college if I remember correctly.
Yeah not too bad in the Big Ten, he did lead the Hawkeyes to an undefeated season.
Well it will be interesting to see how their QB situation plays out.
That is a definite weak point for that team, plus no one knows how Carlos Hyde the RB will be this year after injury.
I forgot he got hurt at the end of the season.
Yeah I had him in fantasy, only plus is that his injury didn't require surgery
Didn't they pick up a RB in free agency also?
They got Tim Hightower who played good for the Saints last year.
He may have a decent role in the offense then, especially if Hyde isn't fully recovered.
That is probably true but both have similar power run styles.
