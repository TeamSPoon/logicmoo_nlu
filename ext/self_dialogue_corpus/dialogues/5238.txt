So, have you heard about all the new disney sequels coming out in the next couple years?
Yes, I have! I'm so excited for the new Incredibles movie!
Me too. I really hope Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Frozone.
Yes! He's my favorite character! How did that one line go...
"Honey, where's my super suit?"
YES! That's it!
I really hope they don't do a flash forward like they do with some Disney sequels though.
Oh, totally. However, i really liked when they did that with Toy Story 3.
Oh me too. The ending made me cry for days.
When Andy when to college without Woody it nearly broke my inner child's heart.
