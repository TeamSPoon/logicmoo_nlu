So, have you watched star wars?
Yes I have
What did you think of the prequels?
I liked them but I hear they are not popular.
You must have seen them when you were yound it's mostly nostalgia
I rewatched them and while some of it is cringey I could see what they were going for.
What do you feel that they were going for?
Mostly a star wars with more action
that seems right on the money
you can see it in most of the advertising.
