Do you like Michael Jackson?
That's a dumb question. Everybody likes Michael Jackson.
Do you like his music?
Of course. Why else would I like him.
What's your favorite song of his?
I like everything on the Thriller album.
What's an album?
I forgot, you're a young buck. I mean CD.
You stupid. I was listening to Jam this morning with him and Heavy D.
Awe man. Heavy D was that dude. We Got Our Own Thing.
That was my jam. He hooked up with Teddy Riley on that one.
Teddy Riley was the first super producer.
I think Teddy may have produced some songs for Mike as well.
I think so too, I'm not sure.
Oh snap. Remember Al B Sure?
Yeah. Rescue Me was that jam.
Al B Sure did a song with Heavy D also.
You're talking about Somebody For Me.
Yeah. Did you ever see the video?
Yeah. I think I might add that jam to my music library.
