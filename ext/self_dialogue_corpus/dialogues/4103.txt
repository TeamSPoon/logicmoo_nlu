what was your favorite  recent thriller film?
Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan.
That is a goodie. Natalie portman is so believable as a ballerina.
I was very impressed with her dance skills in this film.
Me too. I think her and mila kunis trained like crazy hours for these roles.
Ya I guess portman had injured her ribs during filming even.
I liked that they showed the darker world of dance in this film.
Me too, it is not all tutu's and portman's character and performance certainly shows that.
Agreed, dance is pretty cut throat world just like hollywood.
Well I applaud this film for the portrayal. I feel portman's oscar was well deserved for this role.
