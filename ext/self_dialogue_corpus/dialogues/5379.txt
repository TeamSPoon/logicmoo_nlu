The new Beauty and the Beast movie was so good!
It really was. I love Emma Watson as Belle. And they did a good job with the other actors, too.
Did you like the music?
Yes, definitely. They did the classic songs so well but I also loved all the new songs. It added it's own flair to the classic movie.
I think my favorite part was when Beast showed Belle the library. It was such a big library, I wish I had one like that!
I wish I had his castle! And all the people who worked in the castle are so great. I would love to have Lumiere as a friend!
Lumiere is great, but I love Mrs. Potts and Chip the best. Chip is so cute.
He is cute. I'm really glad they did a live-action remake of it. It was better than I expected.
It was really good! I love the classic, but this one has it's own charms.
I agree. It was a great movie and I'm glad kids get to grow up with their own special version of the movie I loved so much as a kid.
