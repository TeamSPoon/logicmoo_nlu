Have you seen Hercules the Disney animated film version?
Yes, I love the singing women in that movie.
They were a creative choice. It almost was like a greek chorus in drama back in the day.
Yes very much so. Did you know devito was in this film.
You mean a voice in it? no had no clue.
Ya he was the voice of Phil. Or Philoctetes .
I know James wood was the voice of  Hades.
I like how the ended the credits with his character talking.
I am not sure I remember that ending during the credits.
You should rewatch it and watch the credits, pretty entertaining.
