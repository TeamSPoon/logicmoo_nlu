How do you feel about monokinis?
I like them.  You don't have to show so much skin and still be stylish
You would get weird tan lines though.
This is true.
I guess you could alternate with a regular bikini to even out the tan.
For my personally it doesn' matter.
How about swimsuits with multiple straps, do you like those?
Yeah I find them ineresting.
And I suppose you don't mind the unusual tan lines?
Not al all.
Are there colors you prefer?
I like black because it's classic.
I think I prefer bright fun colors.
