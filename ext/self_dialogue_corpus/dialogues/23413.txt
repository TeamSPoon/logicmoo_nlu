I saw Iron Man the other day.
The original?
Yes. I liked it.
Yeah but that is super old.
I know. I never saw it though.
Well it's a good one.
It kind of started off the whole superhero movie thing.
Either that or Spider-Man.
Robert Downey Jr is an amazing actor.
He is great. He fits the role well.
He is Tony Stark at this point.
He has been playing that role forever.
I liked the origins story.
Yeah. The cave thing.
It was cool watching him fight terroists.
I wish iron man really existed.
That's a cool thought but not likely.
We have the technology.
Maybe in the near future.
Possibly right now.
