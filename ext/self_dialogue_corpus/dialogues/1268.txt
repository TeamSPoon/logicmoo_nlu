Hi, NFL season is starting soon. I can't wait for the weekends during football season!
Yeah, me too. I've already got my recliner and remote ready to sit back and watch the games.
Which NFL team is your favorite this year?
I'm a true blue Dallas Cowboy fan, always have been and always will be.
Cowboys? No way man. I follow the Steelers every year!
The Steelers were a big disappointment to their fans last year.
They need a quarterback man...but this year I have the feeling it's going to be their year.
I would have thought you'd be a Redskins fan since you hate the Cowboys.
The Washington Redskins are all hype...preseason, they are great, then once the season starts, they fall apart.
Yeah, their players are either on or off. No consistency there at all.
Are you going to any of the games in person?
I plan to attend a couple Cowboy games when they play away, which puts them closer to us.
That's cool man. I would love to see Pittsburgh play but I'm definitely not going up there in that cold!
I think they may have a game in North Carolina with the Panthers, you could probably stand that one.
Good idea! I will have to check online and see the at home schedule for the Panthers.
Hey, if you find some reasonable tickets, I'd love to go if that's okay with you?
For sure! Nothing more fun that going to a NFL game with your friends!
Just let me know what the price of tickets are and I will pay for my seat.
Hey, road trip!!  Going to North Carolina to see the Panthers play!
I guess we will have to root for the Panthers as our home team!!
