What do you think of ACDC?
They rock! They're legends.
They really are an awesome band.
I haven't listened to them in a long time.
Same here. I used to love them in high school.
I wonder if they still put out music.
I have no idea.
They're getting up there though.
Yeah I think they're all in their 60's-70's.
They still seem to pull it off though.
Yeah I've always loved Big Guns.
I don't think I know that song.
Give it a listen! You'll really dig it.
Okay cool I will!
Do you know any of their latest stuff?
I don't, I'm not sure when their last album came out.
I wanna say it was within the last 5 years.
Maybe they did one recently.
Hang on I'll look it up on my phone.
Okay I'll wait.
