You know what Star Wars movie they should make next?
What?
A Darth Maul spin-off.
We already had a Darth Maul spin-off series. It was called The Clone Wars.
He was only in like, 5 episodes!
And it was more than enough.
But there's gotta be more to tell!
They should the time before Episode I when he was training under Sidious, but why bother? It's a Sidious movie at that point which Maul happens to be in.
But his character was such a waste!
No, General Grievous was a waste. Maul eventually got character development, with a beginning, middle, and end.
