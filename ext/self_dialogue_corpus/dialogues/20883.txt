Who's your favorite actor?
I like Robert Deniro.
He's one of my favorites too. My favorite is Jack Nicholson though.
He's right up there with me too.
He's just great no matter what role he plays.
Just looking at him cracks me up.
He is funny,and scary too.
The Shining is a classic horror movie.
That was a scary movie.
Redrum,redrum,was creepy.
That's was very creepy.
How about his movie,As Good As It Gets.
That was a great movie.
Yea,Helen Hunt,Cuba Gooding Jr. we're all good in it.
Yes,even Greg kinnear was good.
He played a great part.
The whole movie,acting,everything was great.
Nicholson won The Academy Award for Best Actor I think.
Yes he did.
So did Helen Hunt for best actress.
