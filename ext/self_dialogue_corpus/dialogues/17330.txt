What do you think of Mariah Carey?
Who is that? I never heard of her?
Are you kidding me? right. She is one of the best singers out here. Her best album was Emanicipation of Mimi.
What songs are on those album?
One of my favorites on that album is We belong Together.
Hmm. I might need to listen to that album.
You should it's one of her best. She produced something other classics like Hero.
Hmm. Sounds Great!
Well who do you listen to rather?
I like Beyonce! Her best songs come from that movie she did Cadallic Records. Have you seen it?
Yes I have. She played etta james in that movie.
Yep. She sung one of Etta's James classics, At last.
Hmm. Great Song. But Mariah Carey could've sung it better.
Ah no. Beyonce is a legend.
Beyonce is a great singer, but Mariah Carey is better.
We will have to agree to disagree. Lol. Anyways, is there any new talent you are aware of?
I think that band New Directions is great.
They are okay. I wonder how long they will last.
Not sure. It was great talking to you. Have a good day. And remember Mariah Carey is the greatest singer ever.
Ah no. Beyonce is the greatest singer ever. Have a good one.
