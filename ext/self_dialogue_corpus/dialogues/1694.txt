How do you feel about the Pro Bowl?
I think it's a total waste of time
I agree, I hate that game
It's just a way for the NFL to make more money
Yeah and it's dangerous for the players
If they get hurt in the pro bowl then they definitely will regret playing
That just takes money out of their pocket
Yeah it's a stupid concept
I do like the idea of having an all star team though
Yeah and most other sports teams have it
Also, if a player goes to the pro bowl, it increases their worth when it comes to signing contracts
That's true, many times teams decide how good someone is by how many pro bowls they've been to
So I can see it both ways
I still think it's heavily skewed towards the league
Without a doubt, the league always gets their money!
I usually do watch the game though because its one of the last of the year
Yeah it always signals an end to the season
It's kind of a farewell game
I suppose it's not all that bad then, I will give it another chance
I think I will too!
