Have you ever seen The Notebook
Yeah I have.
Did you like it?
It was good but sad at the end.
Oh my gosh I know. My boyfriend and I cried like babies.
Really?
Yeah we did
Why?
Because we love each other and could totally picture dying like that together.
Wow, you guys must really love each other.
We really do.
I wish I had that kind of love.
Well I hope one day you do.
How do you think you will die. Really old like in the movie?
Yeah I hope so. Hope we both have a simultaneous massive heart attack.
Wow, can you imagine.
I hope it doesn't hurt and that we both die at the same second.
Do you think that's rare?
Yeah I think it's pretty rare. Though I have heard of it before.
I've never heard of that, except in the Notebook!
