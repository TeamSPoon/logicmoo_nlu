Huh, looks like Sofia Coppola has another movie out.
Is it any good?
...I have no idea! Haven't seen it, just saw an ad for it is all.
I'm interested in watching that then.
Same. Lost in translation is one of my favorite movies.
Oh, man! Bill Murray was great in that.
So was Scarlett Johanson.
Wasn't Topher Grace in that too?
I think so, he was the lame boyfriend.
Right. The soundtrack was so good too.
Yeah, it was great. When did that come out?
2003, I think.
What? It was that long ago?
It doesn't feel that long, right? But yeah, 2003.
That's crazy.
I know. Well, what's that new movie called?
It's called The Beguiled. Looks like it has Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman.
I'm sold. Wanna see it later?
Absolutely. How about the 7PM?
Let's do it.
