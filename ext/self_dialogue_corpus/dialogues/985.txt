Are you looking forward to the upcoming season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see Pittbsurgh steelers in action.
They are a good team. I heard their owner passed away.
Yes. He died April 3rd of this year.
What was his name again?
Dan Rooney.
Pittsburgh Steelers  had a good run with him; they had a NFL record of 6 Super Bowl Championships.
Yes. Don't forget they won 15 division championships, 8 AFC Championships in his rein; also.
Boy you seem to know your stuff.
I am a loyal fan of Pittsburgh, as you can see. What team do you want to see win this year?
I would like to see Tampa Bucs take it this year.
It seems that after winning the superbowl in 2003, they have not made plays until 2007.
Don't underestimate the team though; they have a lot of new players.
Yes I see they signed a new quarterback.
Who you talking about? Sean Renfree or Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Oh, yes. Back up for Jameis Winston.
I heard he is pretty good, but I guess we will soon see for ourselves.
I hear that. good luck to you and your team.
Same to you. Thanks
