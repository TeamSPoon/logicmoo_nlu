So, who do you think will win the NBA finals this year?
Aren't I supposed to say the Warriors will win? Isn't everyone saying that?
I guess they are. Everyone does say it.
So doesn't that end the conversation?
It only ends it if you want it to. Do you think the warriors will win?
No, I don't. I'm betting on the Cavaliers.
Why the Cavaliers? They haven't been given a lot of chance by most people.
No, but look at their strengths. They have LeBron James.
LeBron James can't win it by himself, can he?
No, but he goes a long way.
That is true. He does go a long way. But can he beat an overall better team like the Warriors?
He did last year. And I don't see why he can't repeat.
Okay, that makes sense to me. What would LeBron and the Cavs need to do to win.
Well, the first order of business is obviously that they need LeBron to play an excellent series.
Okay, I've got that. But are there any other orders of business?
Yes, LeBron has to get his teammates involved.
Involved in what way? Just by getting more assists?
Yes, more assists are good. But he also can't shoot the ball so much. Wouldn't you agree?
Yes, that's how they'd win. I'm far less confident than you that it will actually happen. I'm still betting on the Warriors.
Sounds good. Let's find out.
