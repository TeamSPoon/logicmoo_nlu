What was the final score for the Cavs game?
It was like 130-86....just pitiful.
Even the Bulls would've put up more of a fight than this (with a healthy Rondo).
I'm not saying Bulls would win the series but they'd at least win ONE game.
Imagine GSW and Cavs going to the finals both having 12-0 records .
And imagine one winning 3 in a row, that 4th game would be epic.
Boston just seems like their playing with no heart.
Nope, no heart and their playing like their scared.
Who do you think is going to win rookie of the year?
I think Brogdon is going to win but Embid will make it close.
Who is your Defensive Player of the year ?
Leonard by far, I still hate to think about him and what happened with his ankle. It would be a different series.
Isaiah Thomas spoke too soon when he said The Cavs aren't the "Monstars."
Exactly, he trash talked...hurt his hip and lost by almost 50points.
The Celtics have the number one pick... lots of talented and potentially tradable pieces, decent cap space.
Your right, the Celtics will be scary in the next couple years.
The Cavs are just showing to the Warriors how to win a game, without hurting a player on the opposing team.
I hate the Warriors as much as anybody, but Zaza's play on Kawhi wasn't dirty at all.
I just can't wait for the finals. Its going to be one of the all-time great series.
I want everyone to be healthy. Both teams playing great basketball we should have no excuse.
