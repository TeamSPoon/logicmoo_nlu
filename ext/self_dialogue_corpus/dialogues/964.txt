What are your thoughts on Roger Goodell?
Don't care for him much. He has a huge ego.
He certainly has a huge ego. He really pursued that Tom Brady suspension the past few years.
He wasn't going to take no for an answer and really got the courts to finally side with him.
Crazy how the NFL and players are litigating each other these days. But, that's par for the United States these days.
It is for sure. You disagree with someone, you sue them.
What else don't you like about Goodell?
He definitely has brought the NFL to a wider audience but I'm really annoyed by the fascination with the London games.
I agree with the London stuff. I'm not sure why he's so persistent about the NFL in the UK.
Who knows. What I do know is that it takes away a home game for one team a year and puts them at a disadvantage.
Usually that is Jacksonville that gets affected.
Yes. Jacksonville seems to be there every year. Also, the start times are annoying.
9 A.M. starts are certainly annoying.
Imagine if you lived on the West Coast. Those games would be starting at 6 A.M.
That is crazy. Hope he never puts a team in London permanently.
He just might. He keeps pushing this London thing.
Is there anything else you dislike about him?
The fact that he's paid an outrageous amount of money.
He is the commissioner of the largest sports league in North America, so it's not surprising.
Not surprising, but the amount he's paid is still outrageous.
