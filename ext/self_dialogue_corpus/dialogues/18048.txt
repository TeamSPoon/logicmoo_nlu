What's your favorite music genre?
I like mainly rock and industrial.
What are your top 5 rock bands?

I like Metallica too! What is your favorite Metallica album?
The self named album by far, so many good songs.
What's your favorite song on the album?
That's hard to say. It's either Sad but True of Wherever I May Roam.
You have to choose one.
Sad but True by inches. I can listen to that song any time and get pumped.
What do you think of Metallica's newer albums.
Well I liked Death Magnetic but have been lukewarm on the rest of them.
Did you hear that album they put out with Lou Reed?
Yeah I did. I was not impressed and really had no clue what they were going for.
Same, that album got trashed online. Have you ever seen them live.
I have! I was at the infamous show where the riot happened when Axl Rose walked off stage.
What? I have never heard of that. What happened?
Metallica and Guns and Roses were touring together and at this show Axl Rose threw a tantrum and refused to perform.
People started rioting because he wouldn't perform?
People went crazy. They started destroying the building. It was really scary.
