Hey, do you ever watch horror flicks?
Yeah, I watch them here and there. They aren't really my favorite genre.
Mine either, but I do enjoy a good fright once in awhile.
I like to watch the more tamer ones like Hocus Pocus.
Oh yeah, I've seen that one. I really liked it.
Better Midler was awesome in that.
I also like Jurassic Park. That is also considered a tame horror flick.
That is for sure a classic.
Ghostbusters is also considered a tamer type of horror movie.
Bill Murray was brilliant in that.
