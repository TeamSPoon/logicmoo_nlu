I've got a question for you.  It's about Disney.
You have my undivided attention now.  What's your question?
What is the best Disney movie?
That is an extremely tough question, but I'll have to go with 'Beauty and the Beast.'
That's an excellent choice.  What aspect do you like the best?
Honestly, I like every aspect of it.  The writing was near flawless and the music is memorable.
There is something just beautiful about that whole soundtrack.  Did you watch the live-action version?
I saw it on opening night.
What was your opinion on it?
Well, I liked it a lot.  But it was pretty much, beat-for-beat, the exact same as the original.
