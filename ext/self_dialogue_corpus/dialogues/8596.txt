If you could pick one rock band to listen to, who would you pick?
I'm a huge eighties fan.  I particularly like Def Leppard.
Yes.  They are pretty good.  I like the power of their sound.
I know, and they've been around forever.  I think over 30 years.
What's your favorite song of theirs.
I've always liked "Photograph".
I know.  It was one of their first songs and probably one of their best songs.
They have been through so much, it's amazing they are still going relatively strong.
Yes.  A lot of rock bands lose members to death and just quitting, but not many can say their drummer lost his arm.
Amazing how he plays with those pedals.  You can't even tell from listening that anything is different.
