Did you end up going to see Get Out?
Yeah, it was great! Better than expected.
It really lived up to the hype.
I was worried that people were over-exaggerating.
What did you think of the plot?
It was an eye opener. I know some people thought it was racist, but I didn't think so at all.
Do you think there was any truth to it?
Oh yes. Focusing on the liberal treatment of racism isn't talked about much, but it happens.
There have been quite a few good movies this year.
I really liked Split. Did you see that?
I went opening weekend! Scarier than I expected.
James McAvoy did a great job.
Yeah, I never realized he was such a good actor.
He really made each personality seem distinct.
Did you like the ending?
I don't want to spoil it in case you don't know the tie-in.
Ha, I've seen Unbreakable! It did take me a couple minutes to get the connection though.
M. Night Shyamalan knocked this one out of the park.
It was a great departure from his usual "twist" movies.
Yeah, it reminded me of his work with the Sixth Sense.
