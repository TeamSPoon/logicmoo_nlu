If you had to choose between c3PO and R2D2, which robot would you want?
Well, I think I'd choose R2D2.
Why?
He seems more useful for me.  I mean, I don't need a robot that speak a zillion languages.
That's true.  R2d2 is pretty handy.  Except when he shuts down for extended periods of time.
Yeah, but he only did that once.  He's not my favorite robot, just my favorite between the two.
Interesting.  Who is your favorite?
BB8, of course!
I forgot about him.  Why is he your favorite.
He's so cute and clever, and loyal!  I love his shape and attitude.
