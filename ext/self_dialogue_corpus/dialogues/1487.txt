All right fans we're back live with Dave Johnson the voice of the Texans.  How's training camp going Dave?
Well, Jim the guys are having a great time getting ready for their first pre-season game.
So give us an insiders look at the team for this year.  What do Texan fans have to look forward too?
The Houston Texans are going to have a great turnout this year.  Our offense is going to go through some changes for the better.
What are you going to do to get the offense better then last year?
We are working on shoring up the tight end position.
You do have a couple of new tight ends now.  How are they going to fit into the lineup.
Well, we've got one that will take on the starting position and the other will fill in on third down situations.
Ok, what else is the offense doing.
Well, we are taking on a more pass/run philosophy instead of run first.  This will be different and fans will see us going up and down the field more I think.
But will that translate into more tuchdowns?
You know I think it will.  We've got some great receivers on the team and adding some strong blocking from the Tight End position will help give them time to get freed up.
What about the offensive line?  They were pretty good last year.
They sure were and we aren't doing a darn thing there except resigning Masey to make sure that line stays together for a long time.
Any news on the defensive end of things.
Well yeah,  we've added a few parts in the back field.
I know you've picked up a new Saftey.  How's he working out.
Jones, yeah.  He's starting to get into the motion of the game now.  It will take a little while for him to get into NFL shape but I think he'll be in the rotation from the first game.
All right folks we're going to take a break for a moment and we'll be right back with Dave Johnson and see how he thinks the division will go this year.  All right Dave, nice job.
Thanks Jim.  This is kinda fun.
