I love Johnny Cash.
Me too, the Man in Black.
Boy what a life he lived.
Yea , musician and jailed too.
I love the song I walk the line.
Yea that one is good.
How about Ring of Fire?
I loved that one too.
I really liked the one called A boy named Sue.
Oh yea that was great!
He had such an amazing history and career.
I read a book on him once, he really led an interesting life.
Did you life his cd he put out before he died?
I did, but sort of depressing.
I liked Folsom Prison Blues.
That was an early one!
1958 I think.
It was a top hit.
He was a great musician.
Sure was.
