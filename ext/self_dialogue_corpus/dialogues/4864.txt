Have you been watching the Cubs this year?
I sure have. I was so excited when they won last year.
Did you see the last game?
The one against the Cardinals? No I missed it.
I saw it, they won but I was nervous, it was so close.
Was it? I might be glad I missed it then.
Are you going to watch the game tonight?
I want to but I think it's postponed.
Who's your favorite player?
I really like Rizzo,
What do you think of Arrieta
I like him, but I miss Ross.
Who do you think will pitch tonight?
Probably Anderson if I had to guess.
Do you think they'll repeat their season?
Well, it's kind of early to tell but they look good.
What other teams do you like besides the Cubs?
I'm a pretty big Tigers fan
Do you ever go to their games when you're in Michigan?
I do! I love Comerica Park. It's pretty nice.
