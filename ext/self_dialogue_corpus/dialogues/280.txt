Have you seen Logan?
Yes I thought it was hugh jackman at his very best.
I think hugh jackman at his very best is probably les miserables, he was first a song and dance man after all.
Fine, but finest in the role of wolverine then.
On that I do agree. this was his strongest logan portrayal.
I also thought the first x men movie he was also exceptionally good.
I think he was great, but maybe had to do with the script and intro to him and all these cool characters.
You may be right. I often find myself loving the first of any series. I think it's due to the introduction and backstory coming to life.
Plus in superhero movies a lot of times you see them transform into their power which is pretty neat.
I find that less true with xmen, or the very first installment but I do enjoy seeing them get strong or powers, the transformation is always interesting.
