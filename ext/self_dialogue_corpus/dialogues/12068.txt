So what is a parsec?
Huh?
In Star Wars, Han said he did the Kestle Run in 12 parsecs?
So?
I heard that a parsec is a measure of distance not time.
Oh. Maybe since he's going the speed of light it blurs the lines of distance and time.
Interesting, but I don't think he's going light speed.
I thought that's what they "jumped" to.
I'll have to look that up.
Do.
