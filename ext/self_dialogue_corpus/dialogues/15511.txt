HI! Have you seen Taylor Swifts latest song?
No! What is it ?
Its called "I dont want to Live Forever."
Oh is it any good ?
Its amazing !
Is she singing alone?
No, she sings with Zayn Malik in it.
Who is Zayn Malik? That sounds familiar?
He is the boy from the band One Direction.
He left that band right? He is writing on his own now?
Yes, He sings this song with her from the movie fifty shades of gray.
Oh ... I have heard of that movie !
The song is really good.  It is a love song.
Taylor is known for her love songs.
This one is about a guy who misses a girl that he cant be with,
It sounds very romantic.
I think it goes really well with the whole Fifty Shades movie too.
I will have to download that.
You can watch it on you tube for free right now.
Ok thanks! I am going to do that right now.
