Did you see the new Star Wars movie?
Which one?  The Force Awakens or Rouge One?
Either...?
I saw both of them.
Which one did you like more?
Well the Force Awakens was awesome and it continued the story form the original trilogy but Rouge One was an amazing back story.
Interesting.  Which would you recommend I see first?
Well, you should watch 1-6 first, then Force Awakens, then Rouge One
I have to watch ALL OF THEM over again?
Yep. Its the only way to catch everything thats going on.
