I can't believe the Wizards lost in the playoffs against the Celtics.
I can believe it.
Why do you say that?
Any team with Isaiah Thomas is a threat.  He is amazing
He is definitely a good player.  A very hardworker.
If you combine his talent with the talent that the Celtics have on the bench, you get a great team.
Agreed.  I just thought John Wall would be able to do enough to take out the Celtics.
The Wizards problem is that they don't have the deep bench that the Celtics have.
You don't think the Wizards have a deep bench?
No, I don't.  The Celtics bench outscored the Wizards bench throughout their playoffs.
Hopefully, the Wizards can pick up a few guys in the offseason to help John Wall.
Yep.  Isaiah Thomas has plenty of help on the court.
It is too bad Isaiah Thomas got injured.
He got injured??? What happened?
He has a hip injury.
Will he play against the Cavaliers?
No.  He may be done for the season.
Well, that is disappointing for him.  It is also disappointing for me as a fan.
Yes.  We will see have to see how they perform against the Cavaliers without Isaiah.
Maybe they have enough talented to get them past the Cavaliers.  It will be a challenge.
