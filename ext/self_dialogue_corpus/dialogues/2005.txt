My favorite player.Charles Stillman was too good.
He was the absolute best at the punch or stripping of the football.
Every time he got near the ball carrier I'd be yelling "Hang on to the BALL!!!!"
He really was one of the all time greats in the league on and off the field too.
I have the same admiration for him as I do Fitz. Seemingly a stand up guy on and off the field.
Not too flashy but steady and dangerous. Never heard a bad word about him and definitely a guy I would've wanted on my team.
The bears teams of 200-2010 always seemed to do a lot for the city of Chicago and the state honestly.
Peanut also won the Walter Payton Man of the Year as well didn't he?
Yes he did, so well deserved.
Kansas City went 12-4 last year and won the AFC West. Why aren't they being viewed as a more serious threat in the AFC?
Obviously the Patriots are the heavy favorites to represent the AFC,
The Chiefs have the formula to beat Brady, with a strong defensive line and an offense that can keep Brady off the field.
consensus seems to be that the Raiders, Steelers, and even Ravens are bigger threats to New England.
the Chiefs gave Brady his worst loss in almost a decade in a 41-14 blowout.
Why aren't the Chiefs viewed as a bigger threat in the AFC?
They managed to lose a home playoff game where the opposing team didn't score a TD.
which teams do you expect your teams record to be at the end of this upcoming season?
We have a tough schedule, especially the first four
Can't wait for the super bowl.
Watch out 2018! Here we come!!
