My boyfriend and I watched Pride and Prejudice last night.
Oh cool, that's such a good book.
Jane Austen right? I really liked it.
Yeah it was Jane Austen. Which film adaptation was it?
I'm not sure. It looked recent.
Do you know which actors or actresses were in it?
Yeah that girl from Pirates of the Caribbean, and that guy who plays the monk in Pillars of the Earth.
That's Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. I know which film that was.
Oh right, I remember her now. So you've seen it?
Yes, it's probably the best one. Did you like it?
I loved it! It had the most wonderful soundtrack.
It really did. I think that was Dario Marianelli. He works with that director a lot.
What other films has the director done.
Have you seen the Awakening? It's also Keira Knightley, and the same creative team.
No, but now I want to see it!
What I really liked was the cinematography in those films.
Oh definitely, I noticed all the detailed shots. They were so immersive in the time period.
Very much, plus the use of sunlight was just beyond gorgeous throughout the film.
It really was a masterpiece.
We're going to have to watch the Awakening tonight now.
