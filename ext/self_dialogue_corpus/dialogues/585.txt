I've been thinking about NFL referees.
Having a pretty exciting day, are you?  I can't even name one.
Nobody can, except for the logo guy.
Jim Tunney?
Yeah, but I think he's retired, but what I wanted to say is they are part time workers--work on Sunday and go back to teaching high school math.
So,there's only one game a week--you want them to to work college, high school, and occasional Pop Warner games?
Very funny, but they could do film study and even promotional events.  As much as the NFL makes, they can afford to pay them for full-time.
O.K. I agree and you probably would get better officiating.
Yes, and the officiating is so crucial--a holding or pass interference call can determine the game.
You're right and speaking of pass interference, the pro rule should be changed.
How so?
Make it like college--a fifteen yard penalty, not spot foul.
Yeah, now there can be a 50 yard penalty on a long pass.  But how do you prevent a defender from tackling a receiver breaking free?
You don't; if it occasionally happens, it's a 15 yard penalty--no one can predict it would have been a touchdown.
You're right, maybe the quarterback doesn't see that receiver.
Or he overthrows him.
O.K--got any other rule changes?
Well, the illegal contact rule is tricky.
Yeah, no touching the receiver after the first five yards--I wish they'd call it consistently.
There you go--that's why you want full-time referees.
