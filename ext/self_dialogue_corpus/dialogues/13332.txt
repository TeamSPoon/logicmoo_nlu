Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
It is definitely Yoda.
Yeah, he's great. Do you think they will do an origins movie that shows him when he was young?
They announced a Han Solo spinoff story already, but it would be great to see a young Yoda.
I wonder what he was like when he was younger and if he was always a Jedi.
Well in The Empire Strikes Back, he does mention that he's been training Jedi for 800 years.
Oh that's right. And he told Luke Skywalker that he was 900 years old in that movie.
We might not see an origins movie about Yoda, but maybe we will see him in the upcoming sequels.
True, he is a Force Ghost now.
Right, and you can bet that Luke Skywalker has been speaking him during his exile since after the fall of his new Jedi academy.
