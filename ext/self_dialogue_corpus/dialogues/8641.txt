What do you consider "rock" music?
Well, for me, it's bands like AC/DC, Green Day, Nirvana
I would say that's more grunge
would you?  how do you define rock music?
i think it began in the 60s.  60s music up to that point was more bubblegum type music
what's bubblegum music?
it's the sweet, "how much is that doggie in the window" type stuff
I guess then that my favorite early rock and roll music would be Elvis Presley
He was basically one of the "fathers" of rock music
I guess that's probably true.
