Hey are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
Yes, miss watching some football.
Who you rooting for this year?
The Philedelphia Eagles, the represent my hometown.
I hear you, I guess that is why I want Tampa Bucs to go all the wat this year.
Have you made it to any games last season?
Yes and I want to make it to a few this season.
How much do tickets usually go for?
I don't know if they are different for every team, but I usually pay about $280 and under.
That is not bad. I guess it depends on where you sit.
Right, and I want to sit up close, so I can check out this knew quarterback Tampa has.
And who might that be?
His name is Ryan Fitzpatrick and he is to be Jameis Winston back up.
Yeah, I know of him. He was playing with the New York Jets.
Yes. He was with them for I believe 2 years. He comes with rave reviews.
That is great. The Eagles added Matt McGloin to their QB roster.
Oh yeah. He played with the Raiders, right?
Yeah, for the seasons in 2015-2016.
Well alls I can say is good luck and hope your team does well.
Thanks and same to you.
