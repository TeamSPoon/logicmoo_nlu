I just saw Star Wars "Revenge of the Sith" it is still a great movie to watch.
I saw it on TV the other day.
I like all the special effects in all the Star Wars movies.
Yeah,  me too.Have you played any" Star Wars" video games?
No! but I heard they are a lot of fun.
I just love Luke Skywalker.
Yeah, I heard he is suppose to be in" Star Wars 8".
I wonder is Yoda is going to be in episode 8?
That would be cool if he is.
Yeah, we have not seen him lately.
