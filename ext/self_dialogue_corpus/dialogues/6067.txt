What is your favorite disney movie?
Cinderella.
Oh that movie is beautiful. Which is your favorite?
I love the one with Brandy and Whitney Houston.
Me too! Isn't the music to it just great?
Oh yeah totally!
I haven't seen the cartoon one in a very long time.
Me neither. I need to make a point to do so.
We should watch it together.
Yes definitely!
