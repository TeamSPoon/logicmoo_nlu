IT WAS A SHAME THAT BIGGIE WAS SHOT.
TUPAC WAS KILLED TOO.
THEY WERE MURDERED AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR CAREER
THAT EAST SIDE WEST SIDE NONSENSE WAS BOGUS
I WONDER WHAT TUPAC AND BIGGIE WOULD BE DOING TODAY IF THEY  WERE ALIVE
I LIKED "CALIFORNIA LOVE"
I LIKED " HYPNOTIZE"
THEY DIED ABOUT 21 YEARS AGO
THEY WERE PART OF MY CHILDHOOD
WHAT I LIKED IS MY DAD HATED THEIR MUSIC
