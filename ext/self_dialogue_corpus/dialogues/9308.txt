Rap music these days just isn't the same as it used to be.
I think it's still doing pretty good.
Maybe, but there's just no good rappers anymore.
Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole are the two best right now. Their music is both thoughtful and catchy.
Well, that's only two. I imagine it stops there.
You're wrong. Guys like Chance the Rapper, Tyler the Creator, and so much others are really good.
Okay, then. Go on.
Not to mention that legends like Nas, Eminem, and Ice Cube are still making music.
I didn't know they were still around.
You see? Don't get so stuck in the past, or you'll miss out on what's happening right now.
