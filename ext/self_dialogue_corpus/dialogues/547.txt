So what NFL players do you think are going to have big years?
Tom Brady of course, and AJ Green.
Are there any others you can think of?
I think that Matt Ryan will continue to dominate. What about you?
I think Aaron Rogers will have another big year.
He is getting older, but he will have a great year I expect.
Yes, health seems to be the biggest key for him.
He has been putting up MVP numbers when healthy.
I expect more of the same type of dominance.
As do I.
Are there any other players you think will continue to flourish?
Gronkowski seems like a good choice, but he is injury prone.
Yes, he does have quite the history, but he always bounces back strong.
Yes he does, he is like a tank engine.
I think the Patriots, in general, will continue to the flourish.
I know! I can't believe they won the Super Bowl in such fashion.
We will see how they do this year in the NFL.
I think that it is inevitable that they will have a great year.
Ultimately, time will tell.
Yes I agree. Go Pats!
