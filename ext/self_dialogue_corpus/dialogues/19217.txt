I forgot how amazing music was in 2007.
Haha, what are you listening to.
Absolutely. By ninedays.
I don't think I know that one.
I'm sure you do, everyone used to call it story of a girl.
Oh she cried a river and drowned the whole world?
Yes, that one.
That was like every girl's myspace song back in the day.
I remember that. I think it was mine for a while.
You know what other song I heard the other day from the myspace era?
What?
Crazy, by Gnarles Barkley.
You mean by Celo Green? I love that song.
No it's Gnarles Barkley.
I was kidding they're the same person.
Are the really? The guy who did forget you?
Yep, they're the same person.
I had no idea!
Yeah, I didn't either for the longest time.
Well I really like his music regardless of what name he uses!
