Do you like The Rolling Stones music?
I don't really listen to it anymore but I did at one point so yes.
Do you remember what year Satisfaction came out?
That's tough maybe in 1965.
That sounds about right.
Why do you ask?
I was just trying to figure it out.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
Paint it black.
I like that one too.
How about you?
Actually Satisfaction is my favorite.
Yeah, it's a good one.
I wonder if there music will last another fifty years?
I think so that kind of music doesn't ever go out of style.
Not with everyone at least.
Did you like Honky Tonk Women?
I did but I can't remember the words very well.
I liked it too and I have the same problem.
Glad i'm not alone.
