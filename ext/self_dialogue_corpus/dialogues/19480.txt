What album have you been listening to lately?
Bruno Mars's "24 Karat" album.
Oh, is that new?
Yeah, it was released a couple of months ago.
I haven't heard it!
You've probably heard the singles, they're super popular and he has a lot.
Okay, name a few.
Obviously, 24 Karat?
How does it go?
Put your pinky rings up to the moon....
Oh, yeah! Okay, I know that one.
He also has Versace, which I really like.
Is that like a fast paced song?
Nah, more like a sexy song.
Oh, okay! Sing a little!
Take it off for me, for me, for me...Versace on the floor....
Hmm, I'll have to listen to that one.
Listen to the album! It's amazing.
What do you like about it?
His voice, the lyrics, the music itself....perfection.
