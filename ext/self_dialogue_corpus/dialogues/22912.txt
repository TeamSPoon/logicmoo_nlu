You know what was a good movie?
What's that?
Straight Outta Compton.
I know right.
You saw it?
Saw it? Man I virtually lived it.
What you mean?
NWA was from my era. I grew up listening to their music.
Do you think the movie did a good job portraying their story?
I do.
Did Eazy E really die from AIDS?
Yeah. That was messed up man.
I like how Ice Cube's son played Cube in the movie.
I mean he does look just like him.
I know right.
That movie was something that I think the younger generation needed to see.
It did numbers at the box office but it got the cold-shoulder come award time.
True that.
It don't matter. Cube and them got something on screen that will last a lifetime.
Just like their music.
