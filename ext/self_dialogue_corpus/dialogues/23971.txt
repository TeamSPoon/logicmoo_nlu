Hey, did you see the Wonder Woman movie in theaters right now?
No, I haven't actually, have you?
Yeah, I watched it the night it was released because I was super excited about it!
Oh, that sounds very nice! How did you like it?
I really enjoyed it actually, I thought the casting was perfect.
Right, didn't the female lead get some criticism when people first found out she was casted?
Yes, but I think Gal Gadot actually did an amazing job as Diana.
That's great to hear! A female superhero movie doing well is really exciting to hear about.
Yes, I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't.
I think I might, but I don't have any background knowledge on DC Comics or anything of the sort.
That's completely fine, I didn't have any knowledge either.
Really? And you still enjoyed it?
Yes, I think it's fantastic, especially because it's a movie about where Wonder Woman came from.
Alright, that sounds great! I'll be buying tickets on Fandango.
Oh yeah. I definitely did that for opening night because I thought the seats would be sold out.
That's what I'm thinking. It usually takes away the rush and worry about not getting a seat after you drive to the theater.
Yeah, and don't forget your popcorn and ICEE at the theater!
I will most definitely get some to enjoy during the movie!
Great, let me know what you think of it after you watch it. You won't be disappointed.
Okay, I will definitely let you know!
