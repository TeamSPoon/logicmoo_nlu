What was the worst movie for you of last year?
I am not entirely sure because i have not watched to many movies last year.
I saw many movies in the theater last year and a few were quite bad.
I can tell by trailers a lot would turn out awful
My worst movie of last year was suicide squad
That movie looked horrible
It was horrible not pleasant at all felt like a huge waste of my time
The premise was good to
The idea is good and i love the comic
the comic is one of my favorite
But the movie just let me down and i felt insulted a little
I am glad i  had not wasted my  time with it
You made the correct choice
Luckily this year seems to be better for the movie industry
Oh yea the movies i have seen this year are perfect
What movie are you looking forward to?
I am looking forward to spiderman Homecoming
I am too but that art though!
I know it looks horrible but the trailer was awesome
The trailer was so much better than the art work they showed for the poster.
