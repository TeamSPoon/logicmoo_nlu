I need a duet to sing for an upcoming karaoke night.
Hmm, let me think for a minute. What type of music do you like to sing?
Basically anything without a super crazy vocal range.
What about "No Air" by Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown?
Maybe. I'm not really a huge Chris Brown after the huge Rihanna incident.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. That really made me lose a lot of respect for him.
Me too. I just can't listen to his music the same anymore.
I feel that.
Do you know of any other duets that might work>
Possibly "A Whole New World" from Aladdin.
Wow! That's actually perfect!
Yay, I'm glad I could help.
It's a bit pitchy but I'll deal with it because I just love that song so much.
It is a great song.
Yes, I can't believe I didn't think of it. It's one of my all time favorite songs.
Same here! I used to be absolutely obsessed with it when the movie first came out.
Me too. I was a little kid and would just sing it all the time.
You'll have a lot of fun doing karaoke to it.
I definitely will. It will take me right back to being a little kid again.
I'm glad I thought of it. Good luck!
