What is a good comedy movie to watch?
I just watched Stripes the other day. I love that movie.
Who is in that? I've never seen it.
It stars Bill Murray and John Candy, and they join the army together.
I love Bill Murray! He's hilarious.
Me too. I think you'd really like Stripes, its one of his earlier movies.
I just watched him in Dumb and Dumber To.
I wasn't really a fan of that one at all. I feel like they should have left it at the one.
What about The Grand Budapest Hotel? Did you like that?
That I did like a lot.
