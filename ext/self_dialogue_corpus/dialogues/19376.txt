Have I told you recently how much I love Michael Jackson?
Only once a week, haha
Well I love him, I can't believe he's dead
It's been like 6 years or something.
I don't care he was the king!
I do like a few of his songs.
I thought you hated MJ which ones do you like?
Oh you know the popular ones.
He was the king of pop, all his songs were popular!
Haha, I guess you're right.
So which one's did you like?
I guess I liked Thriller, and Man in the Mirror, and Bad.
All good! Then again, I love all his music.
Do you like bruno mars? He reminds me a lot of MJ.
Yeah he's pretty good. I like his early stuff a lot.
Like what?
Remember I wanna be a billionaire? And the Lazy song?
Oh yeah those were pretty good. I really liked Liquor Store blues too.
Oh, that one was the one with Bob Marley's kid right?
Yep, that's the one!
