Have you seen across the universe?
Do you mean heard the song? Then yes I have.
No there was a movie made called across the universe.
Never heard of it.
That is a shame. It is done to all beatles songs. I highly recommend it.
Who is in it? any actual beatles?
No, it is with actors and they sing the songs too.  Jim sturgess and Evan rachel wood  are the main two. But big ensemble cast.
Anyone else I may know?
Well selma hayeck does make an appearance as a sexy nurse.
I like her a lot. Now I really have to check it out .
