Have you ever heard of Metallica?
No.
Do you like hard rock?
Yes, I do.
You should give Metallica a try then.
I will do that.  Why do you like them so much?
The music is very heavy and they just rock hard.
That is the kind of band I am into.
If you are going to try them I suggest listening to "Master of Puppets".
I will keep that in mind.  Do they have other good songs?
I personally like the entire album titled "Load".
"Load", I will keep that in mind as well.
I have the disc if you would like to borrow it sometime.
I would love to.
The lead singer is James Hetfield and he is great.
What kind of voice does he have?
He has a raspy and gruff voice but it is not the normal screaming in some of the other hard rock bands.
That is good, I like to understand the lyrics.
Then these guys are for you.
Thanks for the recommendation.
