Do you enjoy listening to reggae music at all?
Sometimes I listen to it.
Have you heard of the artist Shaggy?
I believe so but what is a name of one of his songs?
The fist song of his I remember hearing was "Boombastic."
Oh yes I remember hearing that!
Has a good feel to it. I love that song.
You know Shaggy wasn't his real name right?
No I didn't know that, what was his real name?
His real name was Orville Burrell.
Wow, how interesting I never knew that!
Another of his favorite hits was "Angel."
That song I remember well, it was on the radio a lot.
Yes it was pretty popular.
Oh hey, did you know where he got his stage name "Shaggy"?
No I really don't.
Apparently he got it from the show Scooby Doo.
That's too funny!
I know,  I found it interesting.
I'm going to go look up more of Shaggy's music.
