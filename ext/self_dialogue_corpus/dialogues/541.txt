Oh, i can't wait. You still rootin for the Bucs?
Well, Bucs, Miami and Jacksonville.
You know first game will be the Bucs Vs Miami.
I do. My father and i will be glued to that first game.
Really? Why is that?
He is a Dolphins fan. Has been for years.
Wow, i didn't know that.
Yeah, he was into them back in the Marino days.
That was like the ninties, right?
Somewhere around that time.
How long have you been a Buc fan?
Since i moved down from North Carolina, back in '99.
You were a Panthers fan prior to that?
Yes, even tho they sucked. Soon as i moved they got good.
Figures, that's always the case it seems.
Only three pre-season games this year.
Who are they playing?
Well, the Dolphins, then the Bears and then the Vikings.
Then the season starts. I so cannot wait.
