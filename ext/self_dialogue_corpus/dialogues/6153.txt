Did you know they're making the Incredibles 2?! It comes out in 2018.
Really? No way! They waited 14 years, and just now they're making a sequel?
Yep. How do you think it'll turn out?
Hmm, I'm not sure. Hopefully better than the first.
What do you mean? The first one was pretty good!
Yeah, but there were a lot of hidden mature jokes.
Humph. Typical Disney.
Yeah. Well, I hope it'll have good ratings.
I can't wait to watch it!
Me either!
