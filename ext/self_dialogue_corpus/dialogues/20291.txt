Hey dude, have you seen any of the Avengers movies that have come out?
I only saw the first one.
Did you like it at all?
I thought it was fairly good, but it felt a little cliche.
What? I don't think it was cliche at all.
You don't think it was just another superhero movie?
Well, it was but it had all of the big superheros.
That part was cool, but other than that I think the movie felt a little stale.
Nah I think the action was awesome. I love Iron Man.
His character was funny at least, and I like the actor that plays him.
Me too, I think he fit's the character pretty well.
Something I didn't like was how heavily they relied on animation.
Animation is the future though, it looks so good.
I think when they do a lot of animation like they did in this movie, the quality of it starts to slip.
Nah, I don't think so at all. There were a lot of very pretty animated scenes.
Some of them were definitely enjoyable to watch.
I like the big fight scene they had at the end.
That was fun, but that's probably the best part of the whole movie.
You can say what you want, but that movie was great and it had all my favorite characters.
I just think it could have been better directed and had a better story.
