PUP has been one of the most surprising new bands for me.
Yeah they're really explosive.
I saw them live in New York City last week and holy cow they rock.
Did they play their song DVP?
You bet they did, being part of the crowd for DVP was legendary.
I'll have to get out to one of their shows.
You absolutely must, I will even grab a ticket for you if they play nearby.
Thanks a lot man I really appreciate it.
I love the brand of rock that SideOneDummy continues to sign onto their label.
Truly one of the most consistent labels around.
