Have you ever really listened to a compared songs from the Beatles first few years until there last?
Not really, why?
Well they change so much from their first songs that were fairly innocent and light.
I mean, I guess that is true. I Want To Hold Your Hand is very different from Let It Be.
Oh they are worlds apart.
They definitely get deeper as they go.
And sometimes a little weirder. Like I Am The Walrus.
Well yeah, maybe that speaks to some of their substance abuse issues.
Maybe, but no matter what they are still one of the best bands of all time in my books.
I think anyone who really knows music would agree.
