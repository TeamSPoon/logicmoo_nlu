Has Eminem put anything new out lately?
Musically?
Yeah, what else would I be talking about?
Well, earlier this year he announced he was going to put out documentary, plus he gives interviews.
I didn't know he's doing a documentary.
Yeah, its about Infinite, he released a short trailer.
What's it called? I'd like to look it up.
Its called,  Partners in Rhyme: The True Story of Infinite.
Do you know when he's going to release the whole thing?
No, I don't. I know its a really short documentary.
What like an hour?
No, its 10 minutes long.
10 minutes?!?!
Yeah, haha, a 10 minute documentary.
How can he possibly cover anything in 10 minutes?
I honestly don't know,but its Eminem, so if anyone can do it, its him.
This is very true.
I hope he releases it soon, I'd still like to watch it.
Yeah, me too.
Well, let me know if you hear anything!
