You listen to Top 40 songs right?
Yes, there is a pop radio station that I keep on during my drive to work every day.
Any favorites?
I mean, none really come to mind right away since pop music sort of blurs together.  How about you?
I don't actually like this one, but the song "Issues" is stuck in my head and I can't get it out.
Who is that song by?  I heard it the other day.
It's by Julia Michaels.
I've never heard of her.
She is a relatively new face to the public.  But she's actually been around the music industry for years.
I didn't know what.  What has she done?
She's written for so many famous artists.  And she started writing those hits since she was 14.
Wow, that's so young.  Can you give me examples of songs I might know?
She wrote 'Sorry' by Justin Bieber.  Also John Legend's “What You Do to Me.”
I'm very impressed.  Those don't really sound like the song "Issues," at least stylistically.
Julia also wrote Ed Sheeran's "Dive," Gwen Stefani's “Used to Love You,” and Selena Gomez's "Good For You."
That is quite the resumé.  "Good For You" actually makes sense, because stylistically they are sort of similar.
Yea, I noticed that too.
I'm not a fan of her Indie-girl type singing technique, though in general it is not my favorite sound.
I think it's alright but I can see why you'd think that.  So many artists sound like that these days.
I'll have to follow her career more closely and see what else she does.
