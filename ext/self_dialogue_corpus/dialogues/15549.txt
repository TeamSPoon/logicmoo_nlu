Do you like any of this down-south rap music?
Not really. I like east-coast rappers.
Do you like Future?
Some of his songs are okay. I like old school rap, like Nas and Jay z.
You like Ether? When Nas dissed Jay?
Of course. Jay had no choice but to join forces with Nas after that one.
But Jay got way more music than Nas. I like that whole Reasonable Doubt album.
I like the album with Can't Knock The Hustle on it.
I forgot which album that was.
Me too.
Do you like west coast? Do you like Too Short?
The only Too Short I like is Pimps and Hoes, the song he did with Biggie and Jay Z.
That was from Life After Death. Those whole two cd's were bumpin'.
I like Nasty and Story to Tell. Biggie was absolutely a story teller.
Yeah he was nice with his. I like his first cd though.
The one with Warning on there?
Yeah. I like Warning, Respect, and I like Gimme The Loot.
Gimme The Loot was off the chain. He had dudes going out doing stickups behind that song.
Fool you crazy. Ain't no music have nobody out doing stickups.
You're crazy. Remember Onyx with Throw Your Gunz? Plenty of young bulls would listen to that before they went out on route.
