I was wondering who had the biggest stadium in the NFL. Do you know?
That would be a good trivia question. Let's see yes it 's Metlife that holds 82,570 in New York for the Giants and the Jets
What about the smallest?
Lambeau Field for the Packers.
The Packers are owned by the city of Green Bay and is non-profit since 1923.
I had no idea. Are they the only ones?
I don't know but probably so.
I wonder who's stadium cost the most?
That would be MetLife Stadium 1.74 billion
holy sweet Jesus that better have come with heated seats and your own private toilet!!
Your funny! The Giants and The Jets own it together.
Kind of weird since they are rival teams.
How many stadiums have roofs?
Eight have roofs either retractable  or fixed
What fields are real grass?
Seventeen have fake grass and 14 play on real grass.
Interesting I wouldn't have thought it was that close.
I guess it has to do with the climate they are in as to which they prefer.
Well I am sure there is a cost factor in there as well.
I would want to have to be that person who decide on that expense.
