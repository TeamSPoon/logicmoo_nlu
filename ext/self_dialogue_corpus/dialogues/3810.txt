I really love thriller movies. It's my favorite genre.
What would you say is your favorite thriller movie then?
Silence of the Lambs is definitely on the top of my list.
That movie is great. It is so suspenseful.
It is. Jody Foster is also one of my favorite actresses because of this film.
Oh I know! Her performance was great.
Anthony Hopkin's too. He is just so creepy in this film.
Imagine meeting Hannibal in real life?
I still get chills just thinking about the basement scene.
Me too! Remember the bathtub part? Gross!
