i think AFI's top comedy list is rigged
How do you figure that?
I don't like most of the films that's in the top ten.
That doesn't make IT rigged. Just makes you a bad movie fan
i don't think so. I am a very average movie fan. if I like a movie, it's likely others will too
Then why don't you like most the films in the top ten out of the 100 picked by the AFI?
I think of all the top 10 comedy picked by the AFI, the airplane is the best one. And they ranked it at 10th place
You're choosing the airplane over Dr Strangelove? That's just wrong man.
Dr. Strangelove sucked.
That's it. I'm out. I'm not talking to you anymore. I'm going to unfriend on facebook and ignore you for the rest of your life.
