I hope Alien Covenant is as good as the original.
Me too, the orginal scared me half to death.
Yeah, when the alien starts popping out of the guys chest as they are eating, I definetly went and hid under a blanket.
Ridley Scott knows how to craft a scary movie.
It was all that fog and those close up shots, you never knew what was around the corner.
Yes, and in the end when you think yoru safe and Sigourney Weaver is getting undressed and she spots the alien in the escape pod.
I know i went and hid.
Yeah, but then she blasts that thing into space and its all better.
I hope Scott Ridley did as a good a job on the new Alien movie
I am sure he did at its as scay as the original.
