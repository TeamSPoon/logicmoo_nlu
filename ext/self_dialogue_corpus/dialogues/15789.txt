So, how do you feel about punk rock?
I love it! But the earliest stuff is the best, versus today's punk.
Punk is still going strong today?
Yes, but a lot of people kind of call those musicians something like Civil War re-enactors.
What do you mean by that?
The idea that they perfectly embody the fashion and music of the late '70s, but aren't really doing anything new on their own.
Oh, I see. Well, what are some of your favorite punk bands?
I tend to like the ones from the '70s first wave of punk in the US, like Iggy and the Stooges, the Ramones, and Pere Ubu.
I've heard of the first two but not the last one. Who are Pere Ubu?
They were from Cleveland and made really weird music that was aggressive and had strange singing, almost like Devo would a few years later.
Sounds kind of weird!
Yeah, well the cool thing about Pere Ubu was that their music really embodies a sense of place, a kind of urban industrial despair.
Do you like '80s punk at all?
Not really. It started to turn into what they call "Hardcore," with bands like Black Flag and Minor Threat, but I can't listen to them much anymore.
Why don't you like hardcore punk?
The music just started to get kind of louder and faster but didn't really go anywhere after that, stylistically, which is also true of '90s hardcore.
Ah, I see. So do you like British punk?
Yes, definitely -- bands like the Clash are excellent and hold up well today.
What is the most essential component of punk, to you?
The music has to be high-energy and intense, and express working-class values or concerns, like what it's like to be poor and hopeless.
