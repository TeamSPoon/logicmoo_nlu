I think the Cardinals are the best NFL team.
Really? Why is that?
Blaine Gabbert is a great Quarterback.
Really? I think  Carson Palmer is better.
Their coach is also Bruce Arians, and hes amazing.
Yeah, I think Bruce is really cool.
So you agree with me?
No, I wouldn't say having a cool coach makes them the best team.
Well, they have a lot of other good players as well.
Yeah maybe. I just think they were a better team when they had Kurt Warner.
I can't hang in the past crying about the loss of great players like Kurt Warner or Emmitt Smith.
Yeah, I can understand that.
They really are a great team.
Do you think they will make the playoffs this year?
I really hope they do.
With a coach like Bruce I think it's very possible.
I want them to at least make a good run for it.
What would you be satisfied with?
Hmm.. At least a conference championship appearance.
I think that's a good goal for this year.
