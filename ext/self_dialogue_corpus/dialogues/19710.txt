What's the best DVD on music that you have seen?
I don't know. I liked a live concert I saw by Alicia Keys. It reminded me I should get it into it and watch more.
Live music is better.
Whatever
Let's watch a show.
What is there?
This site is cool. Nirvana 'MTV Unplugged In New York' is rated #1 of 20.
Yow.
I was thinking the Doors or classic motown.
Right. Oh I was wrong. The screen scrolled. Number 1 is REM
Word. Where are they?
I don't know.
Let me guess. Radiohead. Live. Cause that's good.
I can't say anything about that.
Yay. The Rolling Stone. Gimme Shelter.
Have you seen it?
Yeah. Let me guess the next is dark and Freddy Krueger like.
