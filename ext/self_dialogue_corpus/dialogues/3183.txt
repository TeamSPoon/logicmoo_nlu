Which NFL team do you think is going to turn it around this season?
I think the Baltimore Ravens had a bad season, so they're going to make it back to the playoffs this year
Too bad Steve Smith won't be with them this time around
He retired at a good point in his career, and I agree that he deserves to have gotten a Superbowl ring
A lot of great players go without rings, like Larry Fitzgerald if the Cardinals don't win in the next season or two
They did pretty well a couple of seasons back, so what happened last season?
The Seahawks ruined their chances at the post season, only to lose to the Falcons in the playoffs
And the Cardinals lost to the Panthers the season before, didn't they?
Yep, there's something about NFC West teams losing to eventual Superbowl teams
But how awful was the Superbowl this year?
It was terrible, probably the worst Superbowl I've seen, if not the worst game overall
It would have been amazing if the Falcons had just stuck it through until the end
I'm not even a Falcons fan and I'm still reeling from that game
That's why I try not to get too invested in teams I don't follow regularly
What other teams do you think will turn it around?
The Browns picked up a lot of great players, so I think they're going to be set for the next few years
I'm always rooting for the Browns to turn it around, but I don't know if getting Myles Garrett will be enough right now
Maybe not, but they've built up a ton of draft picks for the next few years, so we could be looking at a resurgence
How great would it be to finally see the Browns in the playoffs?
It sure beats seeing the same two or three teams winning the AFC championship every year
