After watching last year's Super Bowl, it got me thinking. What is the biggest choke job in NFL history?
There were plenty of them. I do think that the Super Bowl last year was definitely the biggest choke job ever.
I would agree even though it's the most recent in memory.
For sure. How are you up 28-3 in the 3rd quarter and lose?
Not very easily. The odds of that happening were so astronomical that it's insane that it did happen.
The Patriots had to play perfect ball in the last quarter and a half and they did. Atlanta certainly helped them out a lot.
Atlanta's defense was so tired by the fourth quarter that you could just see it coming.
Surprising they were that exhausted with all of the training players do these days.
Doesn't help that New England continually runs the hurry up offense.
It certainly doesn't. Still can't believe the Falcons blew that game.
Me either. What other choke jobs come to mind?
Certainly the Bills coming back from 35-3 down in the 3rd quarter in 1993.
That is the ultimate deficit overcome and probably the biggest choke job until last year's Super Bowl, considering the stage.
Certainly. There were other large deficits overcome. I could think of the 49ers and Giants playoff game in 2002.
The Jeff Garcia comeback. I remember that game.
Remember when the field goal was botched and they pulled that guy down and nothing was called.
That was the holder that got pulled down, right?
I'm not sure. Either the holder or an offensive lineman.
That should have been pass interference, right?
I believe so. Who knows what the exact rule is when the offensive lineman is an eligible or ineligible receiver. I would think it should have been.
