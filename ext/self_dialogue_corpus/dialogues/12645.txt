I think the problem with Star Wars now is its getting too expansive
No way, people see those and remember every detail
I think Rey will not be able to hold up as a main character
And she might not be around for well long.
I think they need to develop and protagonist and antagonist.
And thats what she offers at the time
Is having a female lead good?
I think its progressive
So it would fit Disneys liberal agenda?
Lets not bring politics in to this.
