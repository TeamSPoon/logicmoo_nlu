Do you like movies?
Of course.  Why what's up?
Did you see Logan?
No, I didn't but I heard it was good.
Yeah, it was definitely a great movie.  Surprisingly a real tearjerker too.
No way, really?
Yeah, but I don't want to spoil it for you so I won't say anymore.  But you should see it.
Okay, I plan to.  Hugh Jackman is such a great actor.
I know.  You'd never think that Wolverine is the same person as the guy in Les Mis.
Right?  He's so versatile.  I love Patrick Stewart too.
Yeah, he plays an awesome Professor X.  Very believable.  Personally, my favorite character is Famke Janssen's Jean Grey.
She did an incredible job.  I loved her as the witch in Hansel and Gretel: Witchhunters too.
Yeah!  That movie got such bad reviews, but I thought it was awesome.
It was.  It was totally underrated.  She and Jeremy Renner were fantastic.
Yeah, I really enjoyed that movie.  I thought it was a lot of fun to watch and an interesting twist on the original.
It was.  i really don't know why the reviews were so poor.  It's not like it was as bad as Suicide Squad.
UGH!  What a terrible movie.  Totally overhyped.
Yeah, the plot was awful, there was no character development, and the story moved way too fast.
Yeah, they need to stop messing up Batman movies.
I know, right?!
