The new season is right around the corner.  Who's going to take it all this year?
I'm going to go with the Patriots or Oakland
Oakland really?
Yeah, they got the raw deal last year with their QB.  I wouldn't mind seeing them win
I can see your point.  Who is your favorite team.
I am an Oakland fan.  Raider Nation!
I am a Chiefs fan.  I don't think we can be friends.
Oh, come on now!  Nothing like a friendly rivalry!
Yeah, you're right I suppose.
Who do you think will win it all?
I agree with the Patriots.  Brady just gets better with age.
I know! I think that guy is immortal.
He very well may be.  But time catches up with everyone eventually.
That's true.  His time is limited.
Who is your favorite all time player?
I would have to go with Jerry Rice.  I loved watching him play.
Good choice.  He was a great receiver.
What about you?
I would say Joe Montana.
Seems we are both closet 49ers fan.
