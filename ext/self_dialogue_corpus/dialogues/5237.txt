Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite recent Disney movies. Did you know part 2 is coming out next year?
Really? I didn't know but im glad you told me. I love that little girl character. she is voiced by Sarah Silverman
Who? Vanellope von Schweetz. She has spunk.
Yes, that is what I love about her.
I also heard James Corden from the Late Late Show will be voicing one of the characters. He is really funny, don't you think so?
Yes he is. Jane Lynch is hillarious and she will voice Sergeant Calhoun
Yes I heard. If the movie is just like the first one, it will be a blast.
I'm so excited to see it.
I can't wait to go with my kids to see this movie. November 21st of 2018 can't come soon enough.
We should plan on going together. It will be fun!
