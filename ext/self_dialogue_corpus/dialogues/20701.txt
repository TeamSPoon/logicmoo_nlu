My Mom wants to go watch a movie. Have you got any suggetsions?
I am not sure on that one.  What kind does she like?
old classics Mr Bean, things about ancient cultures
There is a theater on the other side of town that has matinees of old classics
Let me pull that up on the computer and see what is playing.
Good idea I haven't been there in the afternoon so I am not sure what is playing
Sweet ! Cary Grant in Arsenic and Old Lace.
That is a great movie and funny!
She also probably would like the Librarian with Noah Wyle.
Those are so much fun to watch!
Well I could take her out to see Arsenic and Old Lace.
By the time you get out of there it will be dinner.
You just gave me a great idea. I will go by this restaurant she loves  and pick up her favorite food.
That would be nice. She likes those braided bread sticks with the meat inside doesn't she?
You remembered! Then we can go home and have a movie night and watch The Librarian Movies.
Will she binge watch?
Of course. I am not sure we will get to them all while she is here.
She does like to talk and visit a lot.
She has been sick for several months and I don't want to push her too hard.
I am just glad she is here visiting with you
