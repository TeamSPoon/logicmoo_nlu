What are your thoughts on alternative folk?
Oh, I love it!
Can you recommend me some artists?
Sure, yeah, I'm really partial to Fleet Foxes.
Who are they?
They're an alternative folk band, their first album was self titled and it was really stellar.
Oh, neat! Any songs of note?
"Blue Ridge Mountains" is really sad, it's about the front man's brother and his issues.
Oh, cool.
Their lyrics are very metaphorical, they like to tell stories.
I love really complex lyrics, do you know Devendra Banhart.
Yes, I love him!
His lyrics are also really metaphorical.
He's also hilarious.
Yeah, he plays the guitar brilliantly and also makes incredible puns.
"Shabop Shalom" always brings a smile to my face.
Oh, I don't think I've heard that, which album is that on?
It's on "Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon," which came out in 2007.
Ah, that's the album with "Carmensita"!
Yes, Natalie Portman was in the music video for that song!
