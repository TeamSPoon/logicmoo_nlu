Do you prefer the first Catwoman or the second Catwoman?
You mean Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry?
Yes which one do you prefer the most?
Oh definitely Michelle Pfeiffer. You would think Halle Berry couldn't act watching that movie.
That's true and Sharon Stone did a terrible job too compared to how she usually does.
Right, and they really veered from the storyline in the Halle Berry Catwoman movie.
Yes a lot of it didn't make sense. So she was basically battling an evil face cream.
Yes they could have done better than that. They were really reaching.
I agree. But at least they had a Black woman in a standalone superhero movie.
Right that is a good point. And she did good as Storm so that redeemed her.
