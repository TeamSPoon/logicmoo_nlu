They are doing another werewolf movie.
Oh really? What is this one called?
Lycan.
I hope the movie is better than that plain title.
I just saw the trailer and I don't think it will be.
Why can't they create a seriously good werewolf movie?
I think because it is expensive.
How?
CG.
I guess. What is the story behind Lycan?
Six college kids in a sleepy Southern town are assigned a group project to rediscover a moment in history.
Let me guess. One of them starts all of this?
One of them sets in motion a horrific fate when he proposes they head into the Georgia backwoods to tackle the legend of Emily Burt.
Who was Emily Burt?
The Talbot County werewolf.
They can do better than this.
True, true but I'm a sucker for anything werewolf-related, so I'll watch it.ï»¿
So am I but from what you just told me, this one is bad.
Yeah I'm all about a good horror movie.  This isn't it.
Agree.
