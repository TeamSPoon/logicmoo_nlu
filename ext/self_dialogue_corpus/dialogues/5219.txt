Have you heard about the most recent Cars movie?
Yes, I can't wait to see it.
I know, I think the story is going to be even better than before.
I love the historical perspective and stuff it seems to have.
I wonder what new characters there will be?
I don't know. Hopefully more Doc. He was great!
I agree. I also love the racing scenes.
Good point. I think those are actually well done.
Do you think they still live in Radiator Springs?
I doubt it by now.
