Were you a big fan of the Lion King?
Not really.  My mom was all into it though.
Your mom?
Yeah, she took us to go see it in the theatre.  I was almost in high school.
Yikes.  That must have been embarrassing.
Yeah, and then we were on vacation and she made my dad buy the soundtrack.
Wow.  Did you guys listen to it nonstop?
Yes.  I hated it.
Well, there are some good songs.
I tell you, I love Elton John, but I don't ever want to hear Can You Feel the Love Tonight again.
