What kind of music are you listening to now a days?
I've been back to listen to 90's music.  For some reason I just can't stop listening to it.
I know what you mean that was some of the best music that there has ever been,
Yep, they was some many different kinds to listen to.  It takes me back to my days in high school/college.
I use to love Nirvana, Pearl Jam and some of the alternative/rock type bands.
But then you could easily here some hip/hop and Pop and not have to change the station.
I need to look into that Satellite radio so I can just listen to 90's or 2000's tunes.
It's kind of expensive but well worth it.
I try to get my kids to listen to the older music but they want nothing to do with it.  It's all Nicki M and Nick Jonas, etc.
Today's music isn't bad, just different.
I wish we had a station that combined all the different type of music onto 1 channel.  That would be much more enjoyable to listen to.
Have you gone to any concerts lately?  Live music is also very good.
Yeah, I went see Maroon 5.  They have a lot of hits and I thought it would be a good show.
Was it a good show?  They sounds like they'd be good in person.
They were awesome, a lot better than I expected.  You could tell Adam Levine was getting older since he couldn't hit the high notes.
That's cool, did they have anyone cool opening for them?
It was suppose to be Tove Lo but since the concert was delayed a few months it was a couple of nobodys.
That's too bad, Tove Lo would of made for a better show.
Yeah, my wife was disappointed but Maroon 5 made up for it with their performance.
I bet.  I'll have to check them out if they come somewhere near by.
