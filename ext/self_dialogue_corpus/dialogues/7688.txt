You don't like Hedwig? Are you serious?
Well she's kind of useless.
She's literally the cutest animal in the entire show.
Cute doesn't equal useful though.
True, but she delivers his letters and brings presents from his friends...
And other things, yes. But still she's useless.
You are really going to need to explain yourself better.
She just doesn't do much, I mean Hermione's cat does more than Hedwig.
Crookshanks? If you mean being an overall menace, then sure you're right.
Hedwig just didn't do much for me, I was sad she died in the last movie though.
