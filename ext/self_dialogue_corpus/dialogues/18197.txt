What's your favorite movie soundtrack?
Definitely The Lion King.
That's a great answer!
I literally listen to it all the time.
I don't but I should.
It's such feel-good music, you know?
Yeah, I know. It's like impossible to be in a bad mood while you listen to it.
Exactly! Like "Hakuna Matata" really makes me forget about all of my worries.
Same! I love it as much now as I did at ten years old.
Oh and I love "Circle of Life."
It's just such a truly beautiful song.
It almost has the power to bring actual tears to my eyes.
Whoever wrote all of those songs is truly a musical genius.
Most definitely! All of those songs are timeless.
That and they have the ability to be appreciated by people young and old.
True, I didn't even think of that. I heard my dad singing "I Just Can't Wait to be King" just the other day.
That's funny! My mom sings the songs to the "The Little Mermaid" all the time!
No way! What songs?
Mainly just "Part of Your World."
What a great song!
