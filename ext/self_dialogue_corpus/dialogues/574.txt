So, who's your favorite football team?
Oh, I'm a huge fan of the Patriots.
Are you one of those recent Patriot fans or a life-long fan?
I've been a fan since I was a kid through the ups and downs of the 90's and all the Super Bowls.
I generally don't like patriots fans, especially the ones that have only been fans since they because a dynasty.
Yeah, I agree.  Bandwagon fans in any sport drive me nuts.
How are you still a fan even though you live in Texas?
I have the NFL package so I can see all the games and I read everything about the team online.
But why didn't you become a fan of one of the Texas teams?
How can I give up a life-long allegiance to my team just because I moved somewhere else.  That would be stupid!
Well, I think you should be a fan of the team local to where you live.
How can you be a true fan if you switch your allegiance just because you move somewhere else?
If you live in a particular place, you should support the local teams and organizations.
So, by that logic.  I loved the local seafood when I lived in New England but now I should just stop liking it and make BBQ my favorite food because I live in Texas.
I guess I get that.  I would be hard to just abandon all your heroes from growing up.
Yeah, I couldn't just decide that Brady, Grogan and John Hannah aren't my favorite players anymore.
Well as long as you have Brady, you'll probably still have the best team in the NFL.
Brady is the GOAT!!
Well, Montana might have something to say about that but you're probably right, I guess.
Go Pats!!!
