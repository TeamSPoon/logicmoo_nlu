Do you think Star Wars was ahead of it's time for having such a strong Female protagonist?
I think Leia was strong and independent at first, but they kind of ruined it by having her fall in love.
But that makes it stronger. She is a strong woman, but still a woman with a heart and emotions.
She kissed her brother.
She didn't know he was her brother and she only did it to make Han jealous.
That's gotta be awkward though, every fight has to end with 'at least I didn't kiss my brother'.
It does beg the question of why they split up.
There's obviously still feelings there.
She was royalty and he was a criminal, it was never going to work.
Can you still be royalty if you got your own planet blown up?
