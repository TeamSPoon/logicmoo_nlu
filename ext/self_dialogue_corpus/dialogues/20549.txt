Hey, do you want to go watch a movie tonight?
Is there anything good out?
There's the new King Arthur movie and Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
I've seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2, it was a great movie.
Really better than the first one?
No, you can't beat the original origin story but this one was a different kind of movie. Both were great though.
Different? How so?
It was very personal movie especially for Peter Quill.
Yea I heard you find out who his father is.
Yeah it's crazy but I don't want to spoil anything for you. But I will say that it was an emotional ending for him.
Ok stop it don't spoil me. Is the movie funny though?
Of course, rocket, baby groot and Drax are all very funny. Especially Drax which is surprising.
Nice, I'll be sure to check that out soon. Should I stay for the extra credit scene?
Yes, there's like 5 of them.
Ok. So do you think King Arthur is any good?
I don't know. The seems like some lame Hollywood remake but I'm a fan of Guy Ritchie.
Guy Ritchie does know how to tell a great story and Jude Law is a great actor.
I didn't like the trailer though. It made it seem like a bad fantasy movie.
The review online seems to say it's good though.
True, ok let's go watch it. It's worth a shot.
