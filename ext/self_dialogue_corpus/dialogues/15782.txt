Hey did you ever listen to Eminem's music?
Oh my gosh, yes.  Back in the late nineties I did.
I love him!  He still has great music too.
Are you serious?  I despised him!
Oh wow, how could you? From the very get go his music has been unique and novel, and so amusing.
I think it's always been disgusting and offensive.
Why?
He glorifies all sorts of heinous things!  Plus he's a complete moron.
I don't think so, I think he's brilliant.  He has catchy lyrics that rhyme and make you laugh.
Not hardly!  I can't believe he's still popular.
That's because he's great!  You're wrong about him.
Well, the first album had potential, but after that he completely went downhill.
No, he just got better and better!  Dr. Dre wouldn't have teamed up with him if he didn't have potential.
That's not true.  It's all about the money for those people.
Exactly, and if he didn't think he had money-making potential he wouldn't have worked with him.
Well, regardless I still think his music is a travesty.
Well we will have to agree to disagree.
If you can even call it music!
I think it's great.  I will keep listening to him.
You do that.  He's totally off my list.
