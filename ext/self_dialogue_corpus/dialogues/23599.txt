There is a new Jurassic move coming out.  Are you going to see it?
What is it called?
Jurassic World 2.
When does it come out?
June 12th.
Does it have any of the actors or characters from the earlier ones?
Jeff Goldblum is playing Ian Malcolm again, but he is usually a nerdy scientist, no matter what movie he is in.
Any other people from the other ones in the series?
B.D. Wong, the geeky scientist who shows them the eggs in the first one is also in it.  The actor is on Law & Order SVU sometimes.
I remember him.  Any others?
I didn’t recognize anyone else, but there might be.  The T-Rex is back.
Are they having it be the same one?
Supposedly it is the same one.  They are giving her scars and stuff.
Who are the more famous actors joining the cast?
Chris Pratt, from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” is in it too.
So how or why do the people get to the island?
I watched the trailer, it seems to take place in a city not as much island though.
Can you tell what city?
The word, “Hollywood” is seen on some of the clips, and there are palm trees.
Does it look like the critters somehow got to the mainland on their own, or were they brought there?
