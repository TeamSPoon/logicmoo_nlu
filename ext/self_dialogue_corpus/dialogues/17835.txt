Who do you think are some of the greatest Classic Rock Bands of All time?
Geeze, there are a ton of them I think.
I think that the Beatles and the Stones have to lead the way.
Yea they were pretty much the groundbreakers in the sixties for rock and roll music.
But there are also a lot of later bands that started in the late sixties and early seveties.
Yea how about Aerosmith?
Definitely, Walk this Way is a great song.
They are still playing today. Steven Tyler has to be about 70 , right?
I think so and still singing!
How about Crosby Stills Nash and Young?
Awesome Band! Remember Wooden Ships?
Yes I believe they played that at Woodstock.
Yea and Neil Young on his own is superb.
Yup, Old Man, Needle and the Damage Done, Heart of Gold, great songs.
I wish I had seen more concerts back then.
Me too, I did see quite a few though.
I did too, the first I saw was the Grateful Dead in Princeton NJ, Jadwyn Gym.
That's amazing!
Yes, no real security back then either. You could walk right up to the stage.
That must have been amazing.
