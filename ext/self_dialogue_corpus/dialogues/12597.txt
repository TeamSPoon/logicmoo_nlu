Which was the the superior set of Star Wars movies, the original or the requel trilogies?
That's a hard question to answer.
What do you mean?
On one hand, the original movies are groundbreaking and innovative, while the prequels were fairly strong, but not too suprising.
I don't follow you.
I mean, when the original trilogy movies came out, each was fresh and you didn't know what was going next.
Okay, but not the same with the prequels?
Yes, because we knew where everything was going, how we got was put for grabs, but the destination "Darth Vader, the Empire, Death Star" was known.
okay, I see where you're coming from.
Plus, the Phantom, Mence was a little underwhelming.
