Have you seen the new Transformers movie? It's called the last knight.
Yes. I saw it on the night before it hit theaters.
Me too! I want on the sneak preview night.
The director is so awesome. You know, Michael Bay.
Yes! I love the movies he directs.
Transformers first started back in 1984.
Wow! I remember watching it as a kid!
Me too! My brother had Optimus Prime.
I love Optimus Prime! He is my favorite character.
The first Transformers in 2007 had Shia LaBeouf in it.
Yeah, he did pretty good acting in the movie.
Yeah, it was hilarious when the transformers were trying to hide in his parents yard.
I loved that part. I was laughing so hard.
Me too! Man does Megatron look scary or what?
Yes, but much more interesting than he was in the cartoon!
The details of the robots in the movie are so realistic. Technology has come a long way.
The characters look a little different but so much better than they use to.
That is for sure! The part of cybertron colliding with earth was overwhelming!
Yes, it looked so real when cybertron was coming into earth's atmosphere!
What an interesting story. I love these movies!
