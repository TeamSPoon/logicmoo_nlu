I love '80s music, New Wave stuff especially.
Like A Flock of Seagulls?
Yeah, or like Talk Talk.
What do you like about New Wave?
The sound; the feel of it. That sort of synthesizer based music we don't get anymore.
Synthesizers never completely went out of style, they're just much more advanced now.
Which is sort of the problem, they sound completely different than they did 30-some years ago. It's not the same.
A lot of dance music uses obvious synthesizers.
Dance music, and club music, and house music are their own things though. They're often faster, with a different tone.
There's always Synthwave then. It's a genre stylized after the old New Wave songs of the '80s.
That's a little different. It tries to emulate the sound, but a lot of those songs have more of a cyberpunk or horror feel to them.
It Follows had a soundtrack like that. Very '80s sort of synth sounding, but with a definite leaning towards unsettling. It was a horror movie after all.
Come to think of it, another horror movie comes to mind with a soundtrack like that. Southbound, it came out in 2015.
Yeah, that one definitely fits. The band The Gifted used real, actual analog synthesizers to create the music for the film.
Again, that's all horror though. What I like is more traditional New Wave stuff.
Shiny Toy Guns sort of has that sound in some of their songs.
Sort of, but they're not completely a true New Wave group. Though, I suppose they couldn't be since to be a New Wave group you kind of had to be there at the time.
You're probably right, I guess they're more of an electric-rock group or something along those lines anyhow.
At least a few artists from the time like Duran Duran continue to make new albums. It's not exactly the same, but it's as close as we'll probably ever get.
Yes, I suppose there is at least that. Maybe you'll get lucky and someday using old synths will be the hot, trendy thing to do in music again.
