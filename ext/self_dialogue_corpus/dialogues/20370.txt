Have you seen the movie Long Survivor?
Yes I have, at least twice I think.
What did you think?
I thought it was a really good movie. It was cool that they had real Navy Seals consulting very closely on the movie in order to make it very realistic.
Were main actors real Navy Seals?
No, the four primary roles were played by actors, but the real 'Lone Survivor' played a support role in the movie, and you can imagine that he spoke up if something wasn't realistic.
What role did the real 'Lone Survivor' play?
He (I forget his name) played a Seal that was part of the 4-person squad's larger unit, but was not deployed on the mission.
What was the mission?
Four Navy Seals were sent up into the Afghan mountains, or Afghan 'Kush,' and tasked with asassinating a Taliban leader.
Why the title 'Lone Survivor'?
Well, the four-man unit of Seals came under attack, and ultimately only one survived. He later wrote a book about the experience entitled 'Lone Survivor.'
So the movie was based on the book? Were there any hollywood-type liberties taken with the actualy story?
Well yes. In interviews that you can watch on Youtube, the Lone Survivor said the battle was altered in order to fit it into a reasonable length film.
Was that the only difference between the movie and the actual mission?
No, the Long Survivor also said that the injuries suffered by the deceased Seals were more gory than depicted in the movie.
Who played the staring role in the movie?
It was some famous actor - I forget his name but early in his career he was a white rapper who went by 'Marky Mark.' Mark Whalberg is his name.
Would you say that is your favorite war movie?
Well, there are several war movies that I like, so it would be difficult to pick a favorite. But Lone Survivor would definitely be among the best.
