Who is your favorite musical artist of all time?
It's tough to choose just one, but my top three would be David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince.
Those are great choices. Speaking of Prince, have you checked out the new Purple Rain reissue?
Not yet, but I really want to!
I heard there are new tracks included.
Yeah, there are eleven new songs on it that were never previously released.
That's very bittersweet to be getting new Prince music after his passing.
From what I've heard, it sounds like we could still be getting new Prince releases for years and years to come.
It's amazing he could have so much music locked away that was never released.
He was such an amazingly prolific songwriter.
Yeah, it's amazing how many songs he managed to write over what ended up being a relatively short lifetime.
It's also amazing how large his influence has been across all genres of music.
Yeah he definitely left his imprint on our culture.
Did you watch his Super Bowl halftime performance a few years ago?
Yeah! That was amazing
Billboard.com ranked it as the best super bowl performance ever, and I totally agree.
I also loved when he performed at the Grammy's with Beyonce.
That was another iconic moment for sure.
I think I'm going to have to go listen to a few Prince songs now.
Same here!
