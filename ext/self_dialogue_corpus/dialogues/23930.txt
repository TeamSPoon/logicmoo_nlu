Have you seen that one villain movie Suicide Squad?
The one with Will Smith as Dead Shot?
Yeah that's the one.
Yeah I saw it. I liked it a lot.
I really liked Jared Leto as The Joker.
Me too even though some people didn't.
I think he was perfect and Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn too.
I was really excited to see a live action Harley Quinn.
I wasn't too sure about the Enchantress though.
Me either. She was too powerful of a villain I feel for them.
Cara Delevingne played her but I didn't like the performance of her much.
Me either. Now I did like the performance of Diablo by Jay Hernandez.
Jay Hernandez is a really good actor. He was a perfect choice.
I am excited though for the new Batman movie that will be coming out.
Jared Leto is supposed to be the Joker again for that film huh?
Yeah he is. I am so excited to see more of him.
I hope they get Margot Robbie to play Harley Quinn in it again.
Yeah that would be really cool.
Ben Affleck wasn't a bad choice either to be Batman.
Yeah I was pleasantly surprised by his performance.
