Who are some of your favorite underrated bands?
Oh man, King's X without a doubt. They are criminally underrated.
King's X? What do they sound like?
Their sound varies. Their early stuff from the '80s is melodic but influenced by heavy metal and blues. My favorite song from this era is "Over My Head." Such a great song.
Hmm, not really into that sound.
Well, throughout the '90s, they were heavily influenced by grunge. Pearl Jam were a big fan of them during this era. But they still kept their flair for melody, harmony, and groove, which can be heard throughout all of their albums.
Melody and harmony?
Yeah, all of the members of the band sing, and they create complex vocal harmonies. They were very influenced by the Beatles in this regard.
Whoa, now that sounds intriguing. I'll have to look into them.
Their most recent stuff has become very progressive and heavier. I like each era, but they've never quite achieved mainstream success, but they have a very loyal fanbase.
