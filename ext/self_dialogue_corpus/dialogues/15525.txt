Whats your favorite Pearl Jam song?
I would say Black
Mine is Yellow Ledbetter.
They have so many tracks that are phenomenal
Have you ever seen them live?
No I dont think I have
They put out an electric performance.
I would love to but I dont know if they tour anymore.
Occasionally they do
I would definitely be into something like that.
Yeah they are one of those bands that stands the test of time.
Where do they usually perform?
Arenas and stadiums usually.
I miss the days when they were grunge
Yeah they got old somewhat quickly.
Ten was a classic album
I think its better than Nirvana.
I think Nirvana was overrated.
I couldnt say that.
Yeah you could, they sounded bland
