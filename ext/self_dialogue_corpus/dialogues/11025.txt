Do you think the Ottawa Senators will beat the Pittsburgh Penguins this year?
I hope so, I feel like the Senators are due for a big win.
Did you watch the Stanley Cup finals last year?
I watched the first two games of the series last year, very exciting.
Were you surprised that the Penguins won the Stanley Cup last year?
I wasn't really surprised, hockey is really popular in Pittsburgh, and the team has great support.
The stars of hockey today are a lot different from Gretzky and Lemieux.
Don't forget about Howe, he was an amazing ice hockey star.
How do you think the Rangers will do next year?
I don't know, but I love seeing them play at Madison Square Garden.
It's amazing how some arenas can put ice down for a hockey game and then hold a concert the next day.
I wonder if that affects the ice quality, maybe that's why the Rangers haven't won the cup in a while.
Believe it or not, Atlanta had a hockey team for a while.
I remember, I think they reached the playoffs one year while the team was still based in Atlanta.
I was sad that the team left town, the Thrashers were rather popular.
That sounds like Montreal in reverse, they kept their hockey team but lost their baseball team.
There don't seem to be as many fights on the ice as there used to be.
Everything is changing in sports, I think the owners want it to be more family friendly.
One of the best things to happen to ice hockey in the States was the Mighty Ducks.
Yes, I agree, the crowd in Anaheim is great and the movie was really fun.
