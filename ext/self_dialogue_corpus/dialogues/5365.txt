Have you seen all the Toy Story movies?
I have, but I don't remember the most recent ones as well.
I've been rewatching them with my neices and nephews. They're entranced.
I remember being like that when it first came out. I used to love Jessie, but what was Woody's horse named?
Bullseye. I remember being like that too! And being afraid of Sid. I don't remember the more recent ones as well.
Maybe we've just gotten too old.
I don't think so, Andy's grown up with us, and I love that it's something I can share with the younger generations.
I do still love the first few movies. Maybe I'll give the more recent one's another shot.
Let's watch them together! Have a marathon.
I'm in.
