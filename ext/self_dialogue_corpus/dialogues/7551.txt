The Harry Potter movies have a lot of dark scenes.
They do, but also happy ones too.
Which was your favorite happy moment, in the movies?
I would say when Harry first see Diagon Alley.
In Harry Potter and The Philospher's stone?
Yes. He does not yet know of his sad past, nor the dark future ahead of him.
That is even before he meets Draco Malfoy.
Yes. All he knows is he is in a magical place.
Sort of the start of his sad journey .
The magical part at least, his whole life had been sad.
