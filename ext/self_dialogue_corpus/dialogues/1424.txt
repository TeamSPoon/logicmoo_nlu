are you ready for some football?
oh I'm ready for some football alright!
it seems like even though the season starts a little bit earlier every year, the off season seems long an unbearable
I know, right. I always get a little bit depressed after the super bowl, as I know i will be without football for over 6 months
hey, do you know where the super bowl is this year?
this upcoming year its going to be in Minneapolis Minnesota
I guess that means there is no way the vikings are going to be in the super bowl this time then
why do you say that?
well the team of the super bowl host city almost never makes it to the super bowl
how many times has that even happened?
its only happened twice
that's it it? who were the teams that went
The san francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX. but they played in Stanford Stadium and not Candlestick. The other team to play the super bowl in their home market was the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV.
The rams played that one in the Rose Bowl, and not the Memorial Coliseum
they lost that game too, to the steelers. can you imagine that, losing the big game while in your own back yard?
did the 49ers win super bowl XIX
they did indeed
go 9ers!
I wonder who the next team will be to play the super bowl in their home market
who knows, it may never happen in our lifetime
