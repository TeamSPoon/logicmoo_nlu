Hey what movies have you seen recently?
I have seen Superbad.
Oh with Michael cera?
Yeah.
Oh I want to see that. It seems funny.
Yeah it was funny, it is more for guys though.
Then maybe I should not watch it.
No you still should, you could get some enjoyment out of it for sure.
Okay I will take a look at it,
Fantastic.
Anyways what else have you seen recently?
I saw the Hangover.
How was that?
Not that good.
Yeah it looked kind of bad.
It was kind of boring in my opinion too.
That is too bad.
Yeah I do not recommend it.
