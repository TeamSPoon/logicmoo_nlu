Do you like to talk about music?
Sometimes.  Lately, when I work out, I listen to ABBA.
Really?  I would not have thought that that would be a good band to listen to while working out.
I don't know.  Something about the pop-nature of it and the beats makes it good.
I think ABBA is from Sweden.
When I went to Sweden my friends told me that there was an ABBA museum.
Did you go to the museum?
No, I'm not that big of a fan of ABBA.
But I thought you said that you liked listening to their music.
I do, but I don't really want to know all about their lives.
I agree.  I like listening to songs but I don't need to know everything about their personal life.  The fan culture these days is really excessive.
Yes, there are a lot of crazy fans.
I agree.  Some artists have been stalked or even killed by their so-called fans.
That's terrible.  There is a lot of mental health problems these days.
I think sometimes, some people are so disconnected from reality, they think that they know the singers.
Yes.  And it seems that artists have to give more and more of their personal life to fans to satisfy their desire to feel close to them.
Some people don't seem to mind, but others seem very private.
You could wear a wig like Sia.
I like Sia.  I think she is very talented.
She is, both as a singer and songwriter.
