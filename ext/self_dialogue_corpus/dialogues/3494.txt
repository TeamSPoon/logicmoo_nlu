Had you ever seen the Shining?
I'm not sure.  What is it about?
A writer and his family stays in a mountain resort alone and it's haunted.
Oh, is that the one by Stephen King?
Yeah, it was based on his novel.
Who was in it again?
Jack Nickelson.
I've never seen it, but I know the "Here's Johnny!" part.
Oh, everyone knows that.
I might need to eventually watch it.
