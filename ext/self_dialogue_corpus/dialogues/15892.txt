I listen to Taylor Swift. Is that embarrassing?
Well, its not something I would brag about.
Be honest, do you ever listen to her?
Yes. Don't tell people that.
I have like 12 of her songs on my phone.
I have about 4.
Which one is your favorite?
'Mine'
That is in my top 3.
What's your favorite one?
I like You belong with me.
What about her newer ones?
Not too big a fa, to be honest.
Not even the one with Kendrick?
Especially not that one. Now that I think of it, all the ones I listen to are from years ago.
Her newer ones are so much more popular.
I do like shake it off, but that's about it from the ones less than 5 years old.
Everyone likes Shake it off.
Yeah, its just catchy.
It was on the radio nonstop for months
