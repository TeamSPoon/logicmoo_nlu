I am so excited for the third installment of Pitch Perfect to come out!
Really? I have never seen any of the Pitch Perfect movies.
Oh you should, they are so funny!
To be honest, I don't think they look that funny from commercials I have seen.
Trust me, they are hilarious!
Which one do you like better?
I like the first one more than the second one but I still think they are both so good.
It has Anna Kendrick in it right?
Yeah, she is so funny in the movie.
I don't find her funny at all. She bothers me as an actress.
Really? She is so funny!
I do like Rebel Wilson, she is in that movie too right?
She is! She plays Fat Amy.
Fat Amy? Is that really her character's name in the movie?
It is! She even calls herself Fat Amy. It is so funny!
That doesn't sound funny at all, that sounds really mean.
No, it is very lighthearted! She is a great character in the movie.
Interesting. Well I think I will skip those.
Suit yourself. I still can't wait for the third one to come out!
Good for you.
