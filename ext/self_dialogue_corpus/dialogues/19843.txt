What do you think about Schenkerian Analysis?
I have a love-hate relationship with it.
What do you like?
Well, it's very musical in how it interprets pieces. It shows a clear forward momentum to big moments.
It works really well with phrase rhythm, too.
But, I hate it at the same time.
Why?
It's so limited in its use: German pieces, 1650-1850, and that's about it.
Why not other musics?
Well, Schenker himself refused as he is racist.
Really?
Yeah, he wouldn't touch French music.
Huh, That's not cool.
Yeah, also German music is pretty simple from the background while being super complicated up front.
So?
Well, Russian, French, American, South American, Asian, African musics...none of this applies unless they directly studied with a long chain of Germans.
So, it's useful but only sometimes?
Yeah, it shouldn't be the main focus. It should show voice-leading patterns but not be the center point.
I was thinking of using it on Shostakovich.
Dude...no.
