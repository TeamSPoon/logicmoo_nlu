Okay, something is bothering me about Neville, maybe you can help.
Sure, what's up?
So, if Harry died or wasn't around, Neville would be the one to fight the Dark Lord, correct?
Well, it seems to be so in the books, yes.
So, is Neville being weak in the first few books a sign that Voldemort chose incorrectly?
What do you mean chose?
Well, Voldemort chose Harry the moment he killed his parents and left him with a scar.
Right, but that didn't really affect Neville did it?
It did actually. If that hadn't happened, if Harry didn't match the criteria, he would have chosen Neville.
So, would Neville be as powerful as Harry if he'd been selected? I honestly have no idea
