What did you think about Beyonce's halftime show?
Look, I like Beyonce, but I hated the halftime show.
Why?
It was like she was trying to be edgy and political, an intellectual.
And that's bad?
No! It's not bad. I just really like the Single Ladies version of Beyonce.
That song is just fun.
I know! It became a Saturday Night Live skit!
And everybody had a video on YouTube of their adorable daughter or niece singing and dancing to it.
Right! It was fun!
I guess I haven't seen any videos of anybody's daughter or niece recreating Beyonce's halftime show.
I do not want to see that.
Yeah, but you know somebody has done it and put it on YouTube.
True. Everything's on YouTube.
Gangam Style was another fun song that everybody made a YouTube video of.
I remember that! There were some great videos. And it's not that I have anything against political statements, I just really enjoy the bouncy fun songs.
The stupid songs.
You call them stupid but you know you loved them. They were stupid fun songs.
I'm not admitting that I ever liked Gangam Style.
Fine, but I bet there's a YouTube video of you out there somewhere, dancing right along with it.
