I just saw the new Jennifer Aniston rom-com. Have you seen it?
I haven't seen it, but I heard it wasn't that great.
Really? I really enjoyed it! I thought it was so funny and relatable!
Hmm maybe I'll give it a try. Who else was in it?
That one guy from How I Met Your Mother. What's his name?
Jason Segel?
Yeah, him! He's the funniest.
Ugh I don't really think he's that funny.
Are you kidding? You have to see him in this movie!
What is the movie about again?
It's a typical rom-com but a lot funnier and raunchier. I think you'll like it.
Alright, fine. What theatres are showing it?
The theatre on Route 1 and the one downtown. I went to the one downtown.
Okay cool. How much are tickets?
Matinee is $5 and regular tickets are $8 I think.
That's not too bad. Maybe I'll take my boyfriend tomorrow night.
That's a great idea! I bet you'll both enjoy it. Especially because Russell Brand is in it.
Oh I do like Russell Brand!
See! You're going to love it.
We'll see...
