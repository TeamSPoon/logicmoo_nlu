do you know elliott smith
of course i do
he is my favorite songwriter ever
its so sad he had to pass so soon
2003 feels like just yesterday
even though its more than 10 years
he was just a fragile soul
but such a beautiful songwriter and singer
his guitar was just as fragile and beautiful
i agree. either/or wasmy favorite album.
i liked xo better.
xo was more melodic and graceful but either/or was more emotive
either/or was sadder and more sparse.
i liked the sparcity
i liked it too.
xo is my second favorite.
self titled is my second because of biggest lie.
that song is my favorite closer
its a great song about separation
it really is
