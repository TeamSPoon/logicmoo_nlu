Hey so what kinds of movies are you into?
I like kids movies.
Oh really, what ones?
I just saw Brave.
Was it good?
It was decent.
Was that Disney?
I think so.
Have you seen the movie Frozen?
Yeah I saw that.
How was it. I have not seen it yet.
What? How could that happen?
I don't know actually.
I understand.
Well it was good!
Good, I will make a plan to see it tomorrow or something.
Yeah you can rent it in iTunes or something.
Sounds like a plan.
It was great talking to you!
Same, have a good weekend!
