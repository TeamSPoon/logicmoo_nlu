Did you hear Rage Against the Machine is touruing?
i did! Are you going to go?
Most likely! I just need to see how expensive tickets are.
I'm surprised everyone got back together.
Yeah I think they just wanted to do another tour.
That's awesome. I'm so pumped for this.
Me too. I hope they play Bulls on Parade.
That's definitely a good one.
Has Tom been doing his own thing lately?
I'm honestly not sure.
He's in like 12 bands.
Ha! It does seem like it.
I forget that he was in AudioSlave.
Yeah everyone from Rage was except the singer.
Wow that's crazy.
Yeah not sure why they did this.
Maybe just wanted to change things up a bit.
Yeah I could see that.
Well I guess I'll see you at the show then!
You definitely will!
