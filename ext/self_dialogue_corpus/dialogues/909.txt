How long do you think Tom Brady will keep playing?
Isn't he like 40 now? Probably only another year or two
Some people think he'll play for way longer than that
Wasn't Peyton Manning only about a year or two older than Brady when he retired?
Yeah and he wasn't playing all that well in his last season, despite winning the Super Bowl
I'd really like to see someone else in the Super Bowl than the same three AFC teams the past fifteen years
So do I, aside from the Patriots, Steelers, and whoever Peyton Manning was playing for
Do you think Peyton Manning was a better quarterback than Tom Brady?
Brady had the better numbers, but I think Peyton Manning was smarter overall
So what even makes someone the best to play the quarterback position?
I don't know, but I doubt everyone will ever come to an agreement one way or the other
Why do you think people don't like Tom Brady? Aside from all the Patriots fans, that is
Probably a mix of his ungodly talent versus low expectations, and all the cheating accusations over the years
I don't think he really cheated after all
He may not have, but he destroyed his cell phone when he was under suspicion and likely to be called in for an investigation
Who destroys a cell phone anyway? Maybe it isn't against NFL rules, but it seems fishy to me
Anyway, once Brady retires, we might actually get some parity in the AFC
And before then, we can always count on Eli Manning coming out of nowhere to lead the Giants to a victory over the Patriots
As a non-Patriots fan, I'll forever be grateful to Eli for ruining their perfect season run
That's pretty cold, but at least Eli will have a legacy when all is said and done
