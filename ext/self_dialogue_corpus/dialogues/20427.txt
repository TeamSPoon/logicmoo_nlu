Man i think that one king kong movie is awful
What one
I think it came out like ten years ago
The one directed by Jackson
Yeah that one
It felt off the mark
Why did you think that
Well i dont know it just felt cookie cutter
Cookie Cutter?
Like it had no soul no passion
I guess i can see that
Like its not bad by itself
But?
The lack of soul makes it awful
I mean if you want something dumb its fun but yeah it is awful
But it should have been so much more than that
I tend to agree
Such a waste
The potential was all a let down
Pretty much
