Man this new track is tight
Tight?
Yeah it is awesom
What song
I am listening to the new Metallica album
How do you like it
I love it
I thought it was decent
I mean it is much better than their old ones
Their old ones arent all bad
Some of them are
Which ones
Load and Reload are awful
No way
How
They are good rock albums
But they are nothing compared to kill em all
Its not the same music type though
Precisely
So whats the issue
