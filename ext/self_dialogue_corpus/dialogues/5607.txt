Does Princess Elena of Avalor have her own movie?
I don't think so. I think her and Sofia the First were the first two to be introduced on a television show instead.
Elena wasn't even introduced on her own show though!
Really?
Yeah! At least I think so. She was introduced on a tv movie with Sofia the First.
Oh, right. Sofia visits Avalor on vacation.
And releases her from her amulet!
I hope she gets her own movie. My daughter loves Elena of Avalor.
Mine too. The characters are great and I love all the music in the episodes.
Me too!
