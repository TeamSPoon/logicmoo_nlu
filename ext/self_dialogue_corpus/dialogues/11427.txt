Are the Beatles even still alive today?
Yes, in fact 3 of the 4 original members are alive and thriving.
Wow, do they still perform?
They do perform, but not all together.
That's a shame.  Who is the best?
Paul McCartney has had the most illustrious solo career.
Have you ever seen him live?
Yes, it's actually incredible.  He's got a ton of energy for his age.
I heard that he's a vegetarian?
That must be where he gets all of his energy from.
