Do you want to go see the Rush concert later?
I would but I can't afford the tickets.
That's a shame, this is my first time seeing them.
I hope they put on a good show!
I'm sure they will. Rush always sounds amazing.
I can't believe Giddy can still sing like that.
Me too! How does his voice not crack constantly?
The man is a wizard I tell you.
Neil Pert also sounds amazing.
The guy is a drumming prodigy.
I wonder if they'll play Freewill.
I'm sure they will.
I bet they'll play Fly By Night.
Well it is one of their bigger songs.
Yeah, same with Tom Sawyer.
Ugh I've heard that song so much.
Me too, but I wont care hearing it live.
Yeah I'm sure it'll sound great.
Well i'll let you know how the concert goes.
Will do thanks!
