Hey, do you think the New York Giants will be good this year?
Well, their first game of the season is against the Dallas Cowboys.
Oh, will the game be in New York or Dallas?
The game will be played in Dallas.
What is the date of that first game of the season?
The game will be played on Sunday, September 10th.
What time are they playing?
The game starts at 8:30pm in Dallas.
The Giants' offensive power might be too much for the Cowboys to handle.
That may be true, but Dak Prescot will make it a great game.
Eli Manning has a lot of targets to throw the ball to.
You make a good point there.
Who are the Giants playing after that game?
The Giants are playing the Detroit Lions.
My money is on the Giants in that game.
I will have to agree with you, but then they play the Eagles.
The Giants have my vote in that game too.
Yeah, the toughest game out of those three for the Giants will be Dallas.
Yes, I can't wait for pro football to start!
Me either, preseason starts in a few weeks!
