Do you think that we could put on some music?
Sure, what do you want to listen to?
I'm actually in the mood to hear some of the Beatles, if that's okay.
Eh, any song in particular?
Hey Jude is always a classic!
I know everyone loves that song, but I really can't stand it.
Seriously? Well, which of their songs do you like, then?
I Want To Hold Your Hand is a nice one.
I thought you were going to say Yellow Submarine.
That one's fine, too.
