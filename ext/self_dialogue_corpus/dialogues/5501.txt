I liked how the Princess and the Frog was drawn like most of the other Disney princess movies.
I agree. I am not a big fan of computer animated movies.
I am a fan of both, but I just appreciated how authentic the design felt.
Totally, and it had been so long since a Disney movie was animated like that.
I think it had been since Home on the Range came out.
Wow. That movie came out so long ago.
I know. It is such an underrated Disney film, too.
I agree. I loved the voicework by Roseanne Barr.
I did as well. She has such an expressive voice.
Disney movies always have the best voice acting.
