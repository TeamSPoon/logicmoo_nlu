There's a great young jazz pianist playing next weekend.
Who is it?
Christian Sands. He's local, from New Haven.
Have you seen him before?
Yeah, I saw him two years ago in Christian McBride's trio.
Where did you see him?
At the Side Door Jazz Club.
How much are tickets?
About $40. Well worth it.
How old is he?
He's really young. 27 or 28.
Sure, I'll go. I like piano jazz.
You'll love him. When I saw him last year in the trio, I thought, "I must see him perform solo."
So, he grew up here. Where did he study?
I think he studied at Manhattan College of Music.
Does he have any albums?
I know this show is part of an album launch. I don't know if he's done any solo albums before this.
I'd love to go.
You'll love him. It's so cute that his parents show up at his local shows.
I'm there!
