Is Lady Gaga coming out with a new album?
I think she is because she sang a new song at her Coachella performance.
Cool, I can't wait to hear more. Did you see how many people were at her show at Coachella?
Yes there was a huge crowd.
What's your favorite video by Lady Gaga?
If I have to choose one it would be Bad Romance. How about you?
I would have to say it would be Telephone.
I like that one too. It was like over 9 minutes long.
It was almost like a mini television show.
Her hair in those pop cans was so cool.
