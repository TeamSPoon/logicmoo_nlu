Do you like Latino pop music?
I do!
Have you heard the Bailando song by Enrique Iglesias?
Oh my god I love that song!
Who else sings with Enrique?
I think it's Gente de Zona and Descemer Bueno.
Yeah that sounds about right.
Isn't there one more?
You're right...but I can't think who it is.
It's Sean Paul! That's who it is.
