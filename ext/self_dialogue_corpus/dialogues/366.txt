What did you think of Hancock?
Very well done and not what you expect of your typical superhero movie.
I know right, they did a great job.
Especially the parts where he is just a bum who drinks and doesn't care at all.
Then he meets his soulmate and she tries to push him away but she ultimately turns his life around.
Wasn't it crazy how they have been alive and together for so long just to be separated by the mob eventually.
Yes, that's sad but also makes for a great storyline.
I agree totally.
Want to watch it again tomorrow?
Sure thing.
