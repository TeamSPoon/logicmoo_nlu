Who do you think will win the NFC North this year?
I'd have to go with Green Bay again.
With Aaron rogers on the roster they are always contenders.
And the receivers are solid.
My concern is with the defense, though.
They had the worst defensive secondary in the league last year I think.
I think Minnesota might take it.
Do you think Sam Bradford has what it takes.
he has been stuck in mediocrity but I think he has had little help.
He tends to do a lot of safe passes.
I think if you build a team around him he can be effective.
I think the Vikings will have the best defense in the league.
That and getting the offense on board could make them contenders this year.
You think Chicago has any chance?
Probably not, they have no quarterback.
I think they've lost even more talent compared to last year.
Think the Lions will do anything.
Matthew Stafford is a good quarterback but I don't think they have the team.
You don't think they will make the playoffs.
The receivers are getting older and they have weakness on defense.
