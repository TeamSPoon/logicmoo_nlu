I am always fascinated to tune into a basketball when they are in the play offs, do you?
I too am fascinated by the play offs, though I also watch extensively lots of games leading up to the play offs.
Yeah I get that, I wish that I could watch more often, though time and circumstance may not always afford me that opportunity.
Who are you hoping will make their way to the play offs this season?
I'm a huge fan of the Chicago Bulls.
They are one of my favorite teams as well.
Oh really? Great! Great minds think alike.
Oh yeah we do! I even got season tickets for them as well.
Season Tickets! My how I envy you.
Yeah, well I know someone, who knows someone, and they make sure I can purchase at a very reasonable price.
There's is something that I'd love to have, but to purchase a season pass, I'm hesitant and unsure how many games I'd actually be able to attend.
I hear ya, if you know that more than likely you will not be able to attend over half the games, then it wouldn't be feasible to have season tickets.
You are so correct on that call.
I'm such a huge fan, I make sure that my seating is as close as I can get, third row.
Wow, that's spectacular.
Yeah, any closer like the first or second row when mean forking over a lot more cash.
I hear ya, I feel ya, I know exactly what you mean.
Though the third row gives me ample opportunity to get a close up view of all the best plays.
That is so true, my friend.
Indeed, and I am so stoked about it.
