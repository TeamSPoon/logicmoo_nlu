Have you seen Moana yet?
I did! I really liked it, what did you think?
I thought it was really good. I like that Disney is moving away from dainty princesses a little bit.
I completely agree, I feel like the change really started when Brave came out.
Yes, between Brave, Frozen, and Moana. I like the direction Disney is going.
Don't forget the older movies! Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and Pocahontas.
True. That's a good point.
Disney has really made an effort to make women appear strong over the past few decade,.
I think so too.
There's still work to be done, but its a good start.
