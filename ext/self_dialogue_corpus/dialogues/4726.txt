What did you think of that bat flip?
Totally bush league.
Why do you think that?
It is one thing to get overly expressive when you are in a back and forth championship series and the tensions are high and you hit a dinger that sails; quite another when you are up 5 in the early part of the season.
I agree, he should act like he has been there before.
Did you see what the pitcher said?
No what did he say?
He said he was pimping it and that we have seen it from him enough.
How much you want to bet he gets hit by pitch in next three or four games?
He deserves it.  Most hated man in baseball.
Pitchers stick up for each other.  I bet he gets hit.
I believe it could happen, but it could cause problems.
Yeah, his team sticks up for him.
So maybe we will see some bench clearing in the next couple of weeks.
Maybe.  Or it could just die down.
Until he does it again.
He wouldn't!
I would not bet against it.  He's pretty unsportsman like.
Eventually some one will hit him in the mouth again.
Yeah, because he just won't stop.  He thinks it is part of the game even though no one else does.
