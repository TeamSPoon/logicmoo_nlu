Who are you going to be rooting for this NFL season?
You know I love my Cowboy.
But they have had a lot of problems lately.
I know. I wish they didn't have so many off the field problems.
Jerry Jones really needs to do something to keep his players out of trouble.
True, but if they had a coach that demanded respect like Jimmy Johnson or Tom Landry it would make a difference.
At least they seem to have their quarterback situation worked out.
Yes. I really like Prescott. He had a great season last year.
I know. I can't wait to see him now that he has some experience.
I agree. I predict this will be a break out season for him.
I am going to miss Romo, but it was time for him to retire.
He had too many injuries to be successful.
I agree. He was never going to get Dallas to a Super Bowl.
That's true. They probably should have let him go before now.
I know. Dallas is always a contender at the beginning of the season, but never seem to manage the hype.
Hopefully this year they will be more motivated.
So are you saying you think they are heading back to the Super Bowl?
I wouldn't go that far. They still need to stay injury free and keep their players out of trouble.
Anything is possible.
Yes. It would be good to see them holding up the Lombardi trophy at the end of the season.
