You know there is yet another Toy Story in the works.
After how the last one ended?
Yep, even though the toys were given away.
And Andy went off to college.
I wonder if it will be set up, with the little girl he gave them too?
I imagine. I hope not back in that play school.
That was so scary!
I do not know how, but they managed to make me fear pre-school. At least for the toys.
I was so stressed at the end when they toys almost got crushed at the dump.
I liked that the bad guy bear ended up as a hood ornament.
