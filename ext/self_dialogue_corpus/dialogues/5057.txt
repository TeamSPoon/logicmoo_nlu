What do you think is an appropriate salary for baseball players?
They are role models playing a childhood game, professionally. They should be thrilled to make more than $100,000.
I'm fine with them making a ton of money as long as they keep a small amount, like $500,000 a year, and give the rest to charity.
I'm the kind of person who would make that a law. You want a mansion on your $20 million/year salary, but won't give up a small amount of that to house the homeless?
Yeah, players who don't do that are selfish.
What do you think about pay-for-performance?
What's that?
Well, instead of giving a 30-yr-old a salary that INCREASES every year, they should be paid based on their performance.
I'm not sure...
So, someone who bats .225, hits 15 homeruns, and strikes out 200 times shouldn't make $10 million, right?
Right, that makes sense.
So why should that be the case, but then a new player gets paid the league minimum but wins the batting title?
Yeah, that's super unfair.
I love performance-based pay (even a game-by-game method).
But, that may have the manager NOT play certain people in order to make sure they don't get money. That's very unfair.
Right, so league minimums can remain. $250,000 to sit on your butt? Anyone will take that.
The other issue I see is attendance. How can they pay their players when they average 10,000 fans per game?
There needs to be more oversight so the Marlins owner doesn't keep pulling the same crap on taxpayers and fans.
Either way, everyone makes far too much money for what they're doing.
Agreed.
