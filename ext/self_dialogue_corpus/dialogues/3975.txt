I finally watched it! That M. Night Shymalan thriller!
The new one? You saw Split!
Yes, that's it! Super freaky! James McAvoy really showed his talent in that film!
No kidding! It was amazing how he portrayed all of those different personalities and really seemed like different people!
Especially the woman, Patricia! At first I thought it was a lady!
True, me too! He was incredible as Hedwig "etc.".
Good one! That line cracked me up! I think he was my favorite.
I liked the designer, Barry? Was that his name?
I think so! Did you get the twist at the end?
As soon as I saw Bruce Willis!
