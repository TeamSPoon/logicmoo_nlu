If you could see anyone in concert who would it be?
Anyone at all?
Yes anyone.
That's a hard choice because I like a lot of artists. Maybe the Backstreet Boys.
I heard that they've been playing a lot in Las Vegas lately.
Yes I think you're right I saw that on Facebook.
Another artist I always wanted to see in concert was Boyz 2 Men. But they're old school.
I loved their music back in the 90s.
Yes their music made me cry on a few occasions.
Which song of theirs was your favorite?
I loved "One Sweet Day."
Yes that one made me cry the most! So sweet though.
If you were looking for music to make love to I also love the "I'll Make Love to You."
Oh my goodness yes. That song was especially special to me.
I would play it when my boyfriend would come over.
Yes that is mood setting music.
I wish they still made music like that these days.
Me too but that's what you call classic music.
I completely agree.
I'll just have to enjoy the songs that they did make back then.
