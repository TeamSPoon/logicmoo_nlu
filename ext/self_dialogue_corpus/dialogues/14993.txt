Have you ever seen Bridesmaids?
Oh, I watch it everytime it plays!
What's your favorite part?
Honestly, I think my favorite parts are anything with Melissa McCarthy.
She's really hilarious.
I think so too.  I think she made the movie.
I don't know if I would like it as much if she weren't in it.
The scene where she's driving away with the dogs is epic.
The part where they are trying on the dresses is good too.
Melissa was in both of those though.
