So who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
I have to say its Brett Favre.
Why is that?
Because he didnt quit until he was old, the dude is an inspiration.
My favorite player of all time is Peyton Manning.
He's a solid choice.
It was so awesome to see him win a Super Bowl on the way out.
Yeah that was a fairytale ending for him, I have to admit.
I'm also glad he retired when he did though, I dont think he would have survived another season.
I think that is how Tom Brady will go out.
Winning a Super Bowl?
No, playing one season too many and getting some horrific injury.
Oh yeah I can see that, him at age 45 getting flattened by some linebacker and breaking everything.
Well, that would be fine, I really dislike Tom Brady.
I think nearly everyone does, except for people in Boston.
Who do you think will be the best quarterback this year?
I dont know, there are a lot of great quarterbacks in the league, I think Marcus Mariota could have a great year if he says healthy.
What about Dak Prescott?
That guy is a flash in the pan, he's going to end up like Colin Kapernick who was worthless once defenses figured him out.
Yeah good point, he's had some good games but I think you might be right about that.
