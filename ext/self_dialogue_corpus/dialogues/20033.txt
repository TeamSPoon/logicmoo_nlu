Have you been watching the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition?
Of course. Wouldn't miss it. I've been waiting for 4 years.
Did you see all of the quarter finals?
I did and a few of my picks made it through to today's semi finals.
8 of my picks got through. I really like the Canadian kid who goes to Harvard and the New England Conservatory. He's only 18
Doesn't your friend teach him?
Yes, but she can't take all the credit for Tony Yike Yang. He has such innate passion when he plays.
Only 1 woman made it to the semi finals. Rachel Cheung.
Rachel already has  made a name for herself in the world of piano. She studies with Peter at Yale and her teacher back in Hong Kong.
What do you think of Daniel Hsu?
Daniel Hsu of the "Hsu Musical Dynasty"? He's been at Curtis Institute since he was 10 or 11 hasn't he?
How does one family get 3 musical geniuses?
I don't know, bug he's only 19 and I think he's a contender for the finals/
What do you think of Leonardo Pierdomenico?
Rock star! I really liked his Rachmaninov.
Know who I enjoyed? Han Chen. Studied at Juilliard but from Taiwan.
He takes some risks, which is good in my opinion.
His Shostakovich was outstanding and I thought his Liszt B minor was the best of all of them.
The semi finals begin tonight. Do you know which 2 drew first to play?
Daniel Tsu and Dasol Kim, I would hate to play on the first night, but then again they could leave a big impression.
