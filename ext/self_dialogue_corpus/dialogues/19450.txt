I heard a song on the radio today, but I don't know who sings it.
What was the name of the song?
Hey Pretty Girl.
I like that song, Kip Moore sings it.
Is he a new artist?
Not really, maybe you have heard some of his other songs.
What else does he sing?
He sings something bout a truck, have you heard it?
I have heard that song, I just never knew who sang it.
He is a good artist I think.
I agree, I will have to look for his album.
You should I am sure you will like it.
Do you know the name of the album?
The album Up All Night has Hey Pretty Girl on it.
That is the one I will be buying then.
That album also has Somethin' Bout A Truck on it too.
Good, because I also like that song.
Yes, he has quite a few good songs.
Thank you for suggesting the album.
Your welcome.
