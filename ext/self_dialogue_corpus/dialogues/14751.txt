Have you seen 'Shaun of the Dead'?
The English comedy horror movie? Yeah, that film is so great.
Such a weird genre but that movie really pulled it off.
So funny and the special effects on the zombies are actually really good!
Yeah. I love Edgar Wright's movies.
What else has he done?
'Hot Fuzz' which has the same actors and is possible even funnier than 'Shaun of the Dead'.
I've never heard of that one, sounds good though.
He directed 'Scott Pilgrim', too. That's a hilarious movie.
Oh, I love that movie. I watch it every couple of months.
