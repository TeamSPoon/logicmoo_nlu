What is your thriller?
The Silence of the Lambs. It never gets old.
I love anthony hopkins performance.
Well Hannibal is such a great character to get to portray.
True, but his acting is superb.
I think jodie foster did a great job. Not as exciting or interesting a role though.
The buffalo Bill guy still freaks me out.
Itis just such a disturbing scenario.
That line, "It puts the lotion in the bucket" gives me shivers.
That is such a great creepy scene.
