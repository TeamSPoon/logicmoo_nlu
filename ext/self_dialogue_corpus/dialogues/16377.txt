What is your favorite and least favorite genres of music?
Ooh, that's easy. Top-40 pop and country, in that order.
I LOVE country. How dare you.
Go ahead, defend it.
It's simple music for simple people.
Simple doesn't mean good.
Why do you hate it?
I can't stand the country twang, the whiney steel guitar, and just how depressing the lyrics are.
What's wrong with trucks and bad relationships?
Well, everyone sings about the latter. But you don't need songs about cars in any genre.
What's wrong with the twang and guitar? Are their timbres not to your liking?
WOW, you used "timbres" correctly! And yes, that's basically it.
I know what that means! I like them.
The voices are just depressing. I can't take country accents seriously.
Yeah, I can see that in life.
Why do you hate classical so much?
It's snobby, and new music just sounds awful.
Have you HEARD new music? What's the most recent piece you've heard?
They made us listen to Stravinsky's ballets.
Those are from the 1910s. They're over 100 years old...
