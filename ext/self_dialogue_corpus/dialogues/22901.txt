Did you like Jurassic Park?
I loved it! The special effects that movie were amazing.
Yes, the dinosaurs looked very real. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job with that movie.
What's amazing to be is that movie came out over two decades ago but the effects still look good.
I agree, if that movie came out today it would look just like a modern movie.
Which character was your favorite in that movie?
I liked Malcom. Jeff Goldblum really made that character memorable.
I can't imagine anyone else playing that part but Jeff Goldblum.
The child actors were great too. They weren't annoying like a lot of children's part seem to be in big movies.
That's because Steven Spielberg really knows how to direct children. You see that in lots of his movies with young characters.
Jurassic Park was made right before CGI became common in movies so it was one of the last great practical effects mvoies.
There was some CGI in it but the dinosaurs were mostly animatronics.  CGI was still pretty new at the time so Spielberg knew it had limitations.
I really liked the Tyrannosaurus Rex scene. It was a genuinely terrifying scene.
I saw it in the theaters and the roaring felt so real. The sound effects from that movie were really good.
One interesting thing I read is how Spielberg had that scene take place in the rain at night to mask a lot of imperfections in the T-Rex design.
Little details like that are what makes him such a good director. Less talented directors might ignore little things like that.
It has all the elements of a great, exciting movie.
It does. It has comedy, drama, horror, great effects, excitement, good characters.
Samuel L. Jackson had a smaller role in Jurassic Park but I also liked his character too.
He's great, pretty much any movie with Samuel L. Jackson in it is going to be good.
