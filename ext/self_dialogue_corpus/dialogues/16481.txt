Have you gotten into the Lumineers?
I heard them on the radio a few times, but I haven't listened to a whole album. What do you recommend?
Their latest album, Cleopatra, from 2016, is really solid.
What do you like about their music?
It's upbeat and catchy, yet their stories are very well thought out.
I think I did see a music video from them! "Sleep on the Floor"?
Ah yes! That's the one where the girl goes on an imaginary road trip with a boy after a funeral?
That's the one. A very cool concept.
Did you know that they feature the same woman in two other videos? At different ages.
No way! That's creating a world outside of the music, almost.
That's what I thought. I think about the songs differently now.
I'll have to watch the others, then!
They had another album out a few years ago, right?
Yes, they did! It was just called "The Lumineers."
How did they get started?
They are from Denver, and I think they started after one of the members lost his brother.
That's a sad start. But some good music came out of it.
I agree. Music always helps to get through a hard time.
And now people are using the Lumineers for their own hard times.
And that's the beauty of music.
