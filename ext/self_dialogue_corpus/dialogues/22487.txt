What is your favorite Rocky movie?
Rocky V
Seriously?
No, I'm just kidding. My favorite was the first one.
Yeah, that one was definitely the best one
It was like a really good indie movie
Yeah, there actually wasn't that much boxing in that one
Correct, much more dialogue and background story
Things ramped up quite a bit with Rocky III
Yes, that was the shift to steroids era one.
Oh yeah, definitely some transformation of Stallone by then
Did that one have Mr T as well?
Yes, and I think Hulk Hogan as well
Oh yeah, the crazy match with Hogan and Stallone
It was sad to see Mickey die
Yeah, someone always has to go at some point
Like Apollo in Rocky IV
Yes, like Apollo after he fought Drago
At least Rocky ended the Cold War at the end of Rocky IV
Ummm...right
