Is there any genre of music you simply don't understand?
Yes, actually. Postmodern music.
I'm not familiar with the genre.
It's stuff like John Cage.
I've heard of him, but I'm not familiar with his work.
It's like music, but also not like music.
That statement doesn't really make sense!
Much like the music!
Can you explain further?
OK, let me explain one of his compositions.
Sure, that works.
Musicians are present, but don't play any music. That's it!
Huh?
That's right. Four minutes and 33 seconds of silence.
I... don't quite get it.
The idea is supposed to be that the audience hears all the other noises in the room.
That happens all the time. That's not music.
That's what I say. But some people think Post Modern Music is brilliant.
I think I'm with you. Seems like the Emperor has no clothes.
Yeah, that's the one style of music I am baffled by.
