Do you like "The Killers"?
Yes, they're one of my favorite bands.
Me too! I just heard them for the first time about six months ago and haven't stopped listening since.
I've been listening to them for years. My brother introduced them to me some time in high school.
What's your favorite song by them?
Probably "Change your Mind."
I really like that one. I feel like most people don't appreciate it.
Is that your favorite song too?
No my favorite song by The Killers is "Dustland Fairytale."
Oh, I really like that one.
Have you ever heard them live?
No, I haven't gotten the chance yet. Have you?
Yes, they're so incredibly good live!
Really? It's so important for a band to sound just as good live as they do on the album.
They're almost better live than they are on their albums. It's crazy!
I really need to get to their concert the next time they're in the area.
You definitely should. I can promise you won't regret it!
I need to remember to look up their tour dates in advance so I don't accidentally make plans.
I'll let you know the next time they release tour dates.
That would be great! Thanks!
