I can't believe I watched that stupid movie Passengers.
Ha! I told you not to waste your time!
I still wanted to see it cause I LOVE Chris Pratt! Andy Dwyer really let me down this time.
Yeah, he let both you and Johnny Karate down.
And Laurence Fishburne was in this movie! What a waste of talent!!
He was severely underutilized.
And was that captain at the end Andy Garcia?
Yes it was. Another waste.
I felt like this movie was re-edited and cut out all the best parts.
Horrible, just horrible. I was actually nauseated when Jim woke Aurora up.
It was Disgusting! It was such a violation to wake her up knowing you doom her to a life on that ship.
It was made worse by the fact she intended to return to earth.
Did that actually make sense? It's 120 years each way, so when she gets back everyone she knows is already dead.
That was a weak plot point.
Well she stayed awake and wrote her story.
Yeah, and it only cost her life.
I know. I thought this movie was going to be more action packed.
Nothing was action oriented for the first hour or so.
I kept waiting for the movie I was promised.
Too bad for you that promise was broken.
