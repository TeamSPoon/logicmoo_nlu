Do you like the Boston Red Sox?
Absolutely not!  I'm a Yankees fan!
Hey, calm down there chief.
I can't help it.  I like my Yankees.
Were you sad when Jeter retired?
Of course.  He was the best
He was alright.  I was a Nomar fan myself.
Agree to disagree chief.
Come on!  You have to give Nomar his due.
You Red Sox fans are all the same.
What do you mean?
Everyone thinks Nomar is the best thing since sliced bread.
Hey sliced bread is good, and so is Nomar.
Haha.  Alright, he was decent.
Just decent?!
Yeah, don't push it buddy.  I'm trying here.
Ok.  Well, are you excited for the upcoming season.
Yeah.  We're going to win the series this year!
Not if the Sox can help it!
Oh, it's on!!!
