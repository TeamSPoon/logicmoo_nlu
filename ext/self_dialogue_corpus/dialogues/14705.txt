Did you see the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Yeah, what a game.  Cant believe that the Wizards one.
I know, That was a hell of a shot by John Wall
He has had an awesome season.
Do you think the Wizards can beat the Celtics at home in game six.
They have a chance, but it's going to be hard.
I know, the Celtics are strong at home
The Wizards are going to have to play great defense to have a chance.
Do you think however wins has a chance against Cleveland
To be honest, not really.  Cleveland is just to good
As long as they have Lebron, I don't think anyone in the east can beat them.
I know, Lebron is just to damn good.  He is amazing.
He should be slowing down in the next 2-3 year.
Yeah, then maybe the other teams will have a chance.
Do you think that Cleveland can beat Golden State
I do, but it's going to be hard.
I know, it should be a hell of a series.
With Durant, Curry, Thompson, and Green, i'm not sure anyone can beat them in a 7 game series.
I know, it's like they have their own all star team.
Yep, it should be fun to watch no matter who wins.
