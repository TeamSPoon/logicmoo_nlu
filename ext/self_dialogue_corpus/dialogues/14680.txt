Who do you think's going to win the NBA finals this year?
It has to be the Warriors right, they are too strong. Who do you got?
I like the Cavs, they still have LeBron, the best player in the world.
Yeah, but the his team gas looked good in the playoffs but they been some bad teams.
Indiana and Toronto are not bad teams!
Yes they are, they wouldn't even sniff the playoffs if they were in the Western Conference.
Yes they would. Who has the Warriors played anyways?
The Blazers and Utah. Utah is a great young team and the Blazers have Lillard.
True but you can't seriously tell me that either team is better than Toronto.
Toronto has no heart, they choke in the playoffs.
Just like the Warriors last year.
No you didn't! Ok last year was bad but this year they have Kevin Durant.
It won't make a difference because LeBron has owned him in the playoffs.
Yes, but he was on a different team and a different system. The warriors are too efficient with too many weapons right now.
Why don't you talk to me if you get past the Spurs, because it's not given that they can even beat them.
Oh please. The old and slow Spurs without Tony Parker and a hurt Kawai.
Hey they beat them 2 out of 3 this year and the Spurs are 8-1 without Kawai.
The first loss was the first game of the season when they were still figuring it out and the last one they didn't even play their starter. They have too much talent and look better than the Spurs all around.
Ok let's make a bet, $20 says the Spurs or Cavs  beat them this year.
Make it $100 and it's a bet. Unless you are too scared.
