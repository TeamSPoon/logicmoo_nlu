I want to learn to play something
What sort of music do you want to play
I am not sure exactly
Is their a type you like
Well i like Black metal but it seems hard to play
it can be hard but you can practice
Well if it is my favorite i should play that but what instrument should i play
Is their an instrument you seem to like
Well i like rhythm and stuff.
Well you could like to play drums
Drums seem hard though and require multi tasking
Multi tasking is not thard to do it just gotta use your whole body
I am not good at multitasking though it is really hard
Remember the old saying practice makes perfect
That is true is their any other you would advise me to try
Well if drums are to hard for you their is another you could try.
What would that be?
You could try Bass.
Is that the same as guitar?
No it is more rhythm focused and is played with your fingers with less strings.
