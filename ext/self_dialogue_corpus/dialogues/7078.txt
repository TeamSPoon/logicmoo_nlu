Did you like the LIon King?
It has great pictures and visuals
What do you think about Simba as a tragic hero?
He was the hero, his tragic flaw would have been running away
He might have been murdered if he had stayed
Yes, but his thinking hurt him, believing that he caused Mufassa's death
Scar was very manipulative, but Simba looked up to him
Simba still could have been murdered when he finally returned and almost was
So some of Simba's tragedy was not his fault
Simba didn't have the emotional maturity to be king for a while
