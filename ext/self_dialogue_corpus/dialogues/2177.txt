Okay this is really weird to me. I was reading some facts about the NFL and this caught my eye.
What could be so weird?
The Pittsburgh Steelers' first-ever draft pick was William Shakespeare.
Yes that is strange. Maybe there is a conspiracy with the Ravens since they were named for Edgar Allen Poe.
You mean with famous writers of yore as inspiration.
This is something i bet most people don't know about the Cowboys. Cowboys.com became a male dating website after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones balked at paying $275,000 for the domain in 2007.
There are couple of interesting things to do with music and the NFL.
What are they?
"The Super Bowl Shuffle" was nominated for a Grammy in 1987. Whitney Houston's rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" from Super Bowl XXV is the only version of the national anthem to reach the Top 20 on the U.S. charts.
Whitney I can understand but the Super Bowl Shuffle song! Come on!
Oh it get's better. Detroit Lions' second-year kicker Havard Rugland, a native of Norway, credits Wu-Tang Clan for his mastery of the English language.
Unbelievable! But hilarious!
Here are some crazy Super Bowl stuff. he first famous Super Bowl commercial was in 1974. It was an ad for Noxzema, featuring quarterback Joe Namath. The commercial in question included former Miss Sweden.
Oh yes I remember  that on too!
This one is just too hard to believe. No network footage exists of Super Bowl I. It was reportedly taped over (for a soap opera, according to some rumors).
Oh man do you know what that would be worth if it actually existed?
Oh here's another music related fact for NFL fans.All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night by Hank Williams Jr. debuted as the Monday Night Football theme in 1989.
Yes that was a catchy tune.
Terry Bradshaw is the first and only NFL player to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He is one zany guy! I like him.
