Do you remember the movie Old Yeller?
Yeah, I saw it a few times when I was a kid.
Wasn't it a Disney movie?
I think so.
They did a lot of those old live actions, didn't they?
Yeah, I think they shifted more toward cartoons in the 80s.
Well, they still do live action films.
Sure, but they have tons of cartoons.
You are right.  Back then, they'd release animated films like once a year.
Yeah, if that often.
Now they have at least one animated project per year.
And less of the live action films.
You can't really say that Disney is failing in either area though.
Not at all.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I like some of the cartoons from the seventies and eighties.
Oh, like stuff you grew up watching?
Yeah, I like their version of Robin Hood.
They had an animated version of that?
Yeah, it was great.
