Hey, did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?
Are you serious?
Completely, isn't that wild?
That is really interesting news.
It has to be the biggest story of the year so far.
I agree, when are they moving? This fall?
No, they said it will be a couple of years yet.
So what's the hold up you think?
They are building a new domed stadium for them and the UNLV team.
I see, so they will play there in 3 years. That gives us time to plan our vacation.
Right, I think a lot more people will want to travel to Vegas to see them than Oakland.
Yeah, I have no desire to go to Oakland at all but I will definitely go to Vegas to see a good game and gamble.
Yes, I think that will attract as many people as the football itself.
I wonder how the NFL will handle their athletes gambling while they're in Vegas to work?
That is what I've wondered about as well. It's legal, but doesn't seem like something an NFL player should be doing.
Well I see people like Gronk out there all the time partying though.
Yes but that's in the off season when they aren't working you know?
That is true, I never thought about it like that. And they will be the first pro sport franchise to be there, so there's no history.
It will be very interesting to see what the NFL rules about it.
Well I can't wait, I think the Raiders in Vegas is going to be pretty freaking awesome.
