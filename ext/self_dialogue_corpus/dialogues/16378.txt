What's your favorite music genre?
Probably country and western.
I like classic rock.
oh yea, like the 80s
I was a big fan of AC/DC as a kid
Isn't Axy their lead now?
I hate almost all music from the 90s.
Lost decade I'd say.
What do you think of rap.
Don't care for most of it but Eminimem does have some clever lyrics
Been to any concerts lately
No, have you seen ticket prices. Wow!
I was going to spend $400 to see a concert last year, but I couldn't get the time off work.
Yeah, decent tickets can easily run $200 each
I like to support local artists.
That's great.
Yes, I buy their music online.
Some of them will become major artists.
I attended a Def Lepard concert when they were a warm up band.
Wow! you are really old!
