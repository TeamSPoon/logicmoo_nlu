Do you like rap?
Yes I do.
Who's your favorite rapper?
2Pac.
I like him too, why is he your favorite?
Good songs, strong message.
Makes sense, I've always been a Biggie guy myself
East-West, it's on now!
Uh, oh, we started another battle
Duck and cover!
I wonder why rappers take their drama so seriously?
Sells records, that's why.
That makes sense.
No, it makes dollars.
Ha, nice one
Thought you'd like that.
We have to put some old school rap on.
Agreed, lets start East and work West
Sounds perfect!
Great!
