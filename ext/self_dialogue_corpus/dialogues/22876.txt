You ever seen the movie Terminator 2?
Yeah, that movie is awesome!
What is your favorite part?
I love when they are on the motorcycle being chased by the semi truck.
Did you know James Cameron directed that movie.
No, but I've heard that name before..
James Cameron also directed Avatar and Titanic.
Wow, he's done some big movies.
Want to hear some Terminator 2 facts?
Yeah, sure, lay them on me.
Terminator 2 visuals involved the first version of Photoshop.
Really, I figured they would have used that for a while.
Billy Idol was the original choice for the T-1000.
The rock star?  That's an odd choice.
OJ Simpson was originally cast in Arnolds role.
What, why didn't they use him?
They didn't think OJ was mean enough to play the role.
That's actually kind of funny.
Terminator 2, also, had a budget of $102 million.  Making it the most expensive film at that time.
Well they put all that money to good use.  It is a great movie.
