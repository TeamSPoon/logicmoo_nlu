I wonder what happened to Hallie Mills.
Who is that?
She was a child star for some Disney movies. She was in Parent Trap and Pollyanna in the 1960's.
I thought Lindsay Lohan was in that movie.
She was in the remake in 1998 but I don't think she was as good as Hallie Mills was.
I didn't see the first one but I thought Lindsay was pretty good.
Yeah, she was good but Hallie made me want to have a twin sister.
If I had a twin sister I would have blamed everything I broke on her when I was growing up.
Hallie had a younger sister named Juliet Mills she was an actress also she was in The Nanny and the Professor.
Well, I think you may be telling your age right now.
