Did you see that they are coming out with another Cars movie?
Yes, isn't it the third one.
Yeah, I don't know how I feel about it.
Me either.  Do you know what the story line is?
I think Lightning McQueen has to prove that he isn't too old to race.
Oh, that doesn't sound bad. I hope this is the last one they make, though.
Yeah, me too.  I don't like when franchises make too many movies.
Is it supposed to be a good movie?
Yeah it actually is. I heard the animation for it is beautiful.
Oh, I'm sure it is. Pixar always does a wonderful job.
I'm trying to remember who does the voices for the main characters.
Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen and Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater.
Oh yeah that's right. Those two are always funny together.
Yes they are. I love Mater as a character, he's so cute.
He is very sweet.
It's not a good time for the movie to come out though.  There are so many other great movies out right now.
Yeah like Wonder Woman.
I want to see that so badly!
You need to it's amazing.
I might go this weekend.
