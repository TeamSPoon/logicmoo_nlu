I like Samuel L. Jackson
I like him too.  I think he is a good actor.
He can play the bad guy or the good guy real well.
Is he the bad guy or the good guy in this movie.
Well, he is a bounty hunter in the movie.
I will see the movie when I have a chance.
It was released on December 25, 2015
I do not think it plays in any movie theater at this time.
I think it was already released on DVD.
In that case, I will rent it this weekend.
You will enjoy the movie.
Quentin Tarantino is a good director.
I know.
You said that The Hateful Eight was his best movie.
I think so.  You would enjoy this movie.
I like good action movies.
Me too.  It is hard to find good action movies lately.
I know.  I cannot wait to see The Hateful Eight.  I trust your judgement.
Samuel Jackson only plays in good movies.  He is picky.
He should be.  He is a good actor.  Thanks for the information.  Bye.
