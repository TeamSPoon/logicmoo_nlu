I love how the Beatles always wrote their own material. They were the ultimate songwriters.
No, not in the early part of their career.
What?!
In the early days of their career, the Beatles played a lot of cover versions, not originals.
Really? Who would they typically cover?
Actually, a lot of African American girl groups, for one thing. Think Motown, but a little earlier.
Wow, that's surprising.
Yeah, you know that song "Please Mr. Postman?" It's by the Marvelettes, but the Beatles made a cover version of it.
Did they change much?
No, not really. They even do the hand claps that the Marvelettes did, too.
