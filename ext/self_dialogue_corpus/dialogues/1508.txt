Have you heard any new NFL news lately?
I have! Did you hear about Colin Kaepernick remaining a free agent?
That is crazy! I wonder what Joe Montana is going to do about it.
He doesn't seem very thrilled and optimistic that Joe will find a new home in the NFL.
Why would he say that?
He thinks that they are just not getting along very well and Joe had plenty of issues for being a minority.
That's too bad.
I know, he visited the Seattle Seahawks last May but I heard they signed someone else.
Oh I heard about that. The Seahawks signed Austin Davis instead.
That's so unfortunate for him.
Have you heard of the latest news with Sam Darnold?
Oh no I didn't, what's up?
He thinks that the NFL teams shouldn't sacrifice an entire campaign because of him.
That's right because as a redshirt sophomore, he can apply for entry to the 2018 NFL Draft after this upcoming season.
Good point. He really isn't allowing anyone to change his point of view.
True, he said that his play, along with conversations with his family and coaches as the main factors for whether he decides to go pro as a redshirt sophomore.
He seems like a very reasonable player.
I agree, he has a good head on his shoulders.
He isn't letting the spotlight affect his persona at all.
I think we need more players like him in the NFL.
