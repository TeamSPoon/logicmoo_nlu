Can you recommend me a good Beatles song?
It depends, what kind of music do you like?
Isn't it all rock?
Well there is the 50's rock beatles, but there is also a more mellow sound they started making in the 60s
I guess I would consider myself a fan of 50s rock
Well then I would recommend the sock Help
I've heard that song and its good! Any other recommendations?
I want to hold your hand is also a classic
Cool I'll have a listen
You should broaden your horizons and listen to their 60s stuff
