Are you familiar with how the NFL draft works?
I've followed it some, sure. Why?
Its something I've always been interested in. I don't always follow it.
Yeah sometimes I'm too busy to take much notice either.
But you have an understanding of how it works?
I guess so, its not too difficult.
Every spring the NFL drafts college football players.
What's the process used?
There are 7 rounds. Each club in each round takes their pick.
That's the easy part! Who picks first?
Playoff teams are ranked on the furthest round of playoff levels reached, plus their season record.
See I didn't know that. What then?
The order for non-playoff teams is driven by the season record.
Okay, I've got it.  You would think the Super Bowl winners had earned first draft.
No they actually pick last in each round.
Not much of a payoff.
Yeah, right after the worst performing team has their pick.
The draftees, they can be pretty young then?
At least three years out of high school!
Not a bad career for kids with the right skills.
