Which movie reinforces gender stereotypes? I'm thinking of holding a discussion about patriarchal themes in films with my literature group.
At the top of my head, I'm going with Cinderella. It's a classic example of societal norms and expectations for women in the '50s.
Hm, female politics in Disney movies? That sounds super exciting.
Yeah, you can talk about beauty standards and the need to fit those standards in order to find a man.
How so?
Well, how about the fact that all the women in the kingdom got all dolled up for the prince?
I forget how the story goes. Wasn't there some sort of ball?
Yes. They were all invited to be eligible to be the prince's bride.
Ah, right. And the prince had to choose his future queen based on looks.
That sends a negative message to viewers, which was basically that women had to rely on her looks to get married.
