I love movies about outer space, but I feel like I'm so behind on new movies!
You have a ton of movie watching to do then.
What movie should I start with?
You should definitely start with Interstellar.
Why should I start with that one?
It's a movie that just wows you at the end.
Okay, I'll have to take your word for it. What else?
You might like Gravity. I didn't like it that much, but if you like space, you'll like it.
Why didn't you like it?
There just wasn't much dialogue. The visuals were really great though.
I see. Any other good movies?
The Martian was great. I'm a big Matt Damon fan too and he's in that.
What's that one about?
It's about an astronaut who is basically stranded on Mars.
Is it a thriller then?
I'd say it's a mix between a thriller and a comedy.
That sounds unique.
It really is a great movie. Trust me on this one.
Oh I will. When can we get together for movie night?
Let's do it next weekend!
