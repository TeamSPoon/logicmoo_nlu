Hey.
Hi.
How are you today?
Not bad at all.
Good to hear.
Yep.
Who was the last band that you saw live?
Hmmm.  Let me think.
Okay.
It was Lady Gaga if you want to call her a band.
Yeah sure, she's really talented.
I was on the fence at first.
Oh really?
Yeah not a big fan of a lot of music on the radio.
I understand that.
The concert changed my mind though.
Did you go with friends?
Yeah they were big fans.
Oh that makes sense.
Yeah.
