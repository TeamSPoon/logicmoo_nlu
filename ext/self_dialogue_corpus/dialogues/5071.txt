Wow the Yankees are off to a great start.
Yeah but how long can it last?
What are you kidding they could win the world series.
Oh come on ,  there pitching will never hold up.
I disagree and with that lineup the pitching doesnâ€™t have to be great.
Now you know pitching is what wins championships.
Well pitching helps but they a great lineup, Arron Judge is turing out to be a superstar.
I know the lineup is awesome, Judge is being compared to Jeter.
He is going to be even beter than Derek Jeter.
Ha ha, he has a long way to go. He's only played less than a year so far.
It's everything about him, his attitude, his work ethic.
He is showing signs of greatness, but you can't even compare what he's done to Jeter.
It's  not just him this team has so many good upcoming kids.
Now they have Gary Sanchez coming back ,what a great 1-2 punch.
I know , Sanchez is also going to be superstar.
I still think it'll take a year or two to win the Series. Who going pitch?
It doesn't matter they have the best bullpen in baseball.
But someone has to get them into the 6th.
The  starting picthing is good enough to get into the 5th or 6th, then the bullpen takes over.
I'm still not sold, champman showing signs of slowing down. It's a long season , we'll see.
