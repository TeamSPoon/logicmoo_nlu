Do you know which 2 players have caught, rushed, and thrown a touchdown against the same team in the same game?
Walter Payton in 1979 and David Patton in 2001. It's pretty incredible! Only 2!
Yep! It's weird to think that football games usually last around 3 hours, the ball is typically in play for only 11 minutes.
Wow. That means the game on TV is devoted mostly to replays.
An NFL game is about 75 minutes, but about 60% of total TV air time, is spent on shots of players standing on the line of scrimmage, huddling, or just walking around between snaps.
I did not even notice that.
Yeah, during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds. Coaches and referees receive around 7% of the face time in a game.
That's crazy.
In the 1930s, NFL game telecasts were just a constant feed of the field. Instant replay became commonplace in the mid-1960s, which helped fill the idle moments of the game.
I guess with the new tech of TV things began to change.
Yeah, the perspective for fans could be altered.
It's great I love getting those detailed plays.
By the 1990s, some football broadcasts showed about 100 replays per game.
That's a lot.
Yeah, I'm more aware when I watch that that is the case.
I like the replays for me it enhances the experience.
Yeah, that and high def TVs. Oh and surround sound! It's like being on the field!
Still there is nothing like actually being at the game.
Yeah, I love being in the crowd and all that excitement.
The stadiums are so high tech. There really aren't any bad seats to catch all those great plays!
