Did you see Werth from the Washington Nationals?
Which game?
Last night when he had four hits.
Yeah, but he strikes out a lot.
But he wins as many games as Babe Ruth.
What are you? His agent.
No, just a big fan.
I bet you have a Werth jersey.
Yeah, actually you're right but it's from Philly.
Big deal. Why don't you get one from Washington?
I can only afford one jersey at a time.
Then you're not that great of a fan.
My salary isn't anywhere near Werth's.
Whose is? He's not worth a fraction of his salary.
Maybe I should get an agent.
For what? You don't have any talent.
Let's get back to the game.
Okay, what was the score?
I forgot. I'll check my ESPN app right now.
Okay, please let me know.
