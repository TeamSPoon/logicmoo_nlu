i don't cry much watching a movie, you know.
No, no you don't.
I have no idea what's come over me.
Oh, I think I have a few ideas. And i know you just said you don't know, but I've noticed a pattern
What pattern?
You cry when you watch a movie that has a male father figure die and go away.
...
Because your father has passed away.
Yeah.
Mr. Morgan's last love has a male father figure that dies and goes away.
Yes.
And you cried after watching the scene where Pauline sits on the bench where Matthew is sitting and says "I miss you Matthew"
And Michael Caine, or Matthew says "I miss you too." Look, I'm crying again. Look. Why am I crying?
We tend to transfer our emotions to the characters in the story. It's what people do. We can't help it. It's what makes movies, stories so magical. You're transferring your emotions from having to lose your father and not being able to be there in his last conscious moments to the character.
I wanted to be there. That's all I wanted. I was just too late. And I didn't need to say I loved him. I knew he loved me. I just wanted to say I;m sorry for the one last time.
And you didn't get to. Understandable. And ALL of us lose our parents. Not all of us are given the chances to be with them in their last conscious moments. That's a gift reserved for very few of us, I'm afraid.
You know what I was thinking when I saw that scene? Where she was saying "I miss you" and he was like, "I miss you too?"
No, what?
I want my dad's ghost, or his soul looking down on me from Heaven, and tell me he misses me too. And I miss my dad so much. And I just want to say I'm sorry just one more time.
I think that's beautiful. I have no doubt he hears you. I have no doubt.
