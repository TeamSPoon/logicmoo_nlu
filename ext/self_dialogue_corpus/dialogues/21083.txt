Are there any movies that you would like to see this summer?
I'm really looking forward to the Mummy!
Oh really? Who is that by?
It's with Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe.
Do you think it'll be like the previous mummy movies?
I don't think so, it seems like it will be packed with more action!
What about Baywatch?
Baywatch seems like it could be funny!
I don't know about that, remakes are always sketchy.
Yea so true! Originals are better.
I want to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2!
I've seen that!
Did you go to the first screenings?
I did! I was one of the first.
What did you think?? Better than the first one?
Definitely, I always love Chris Pratt.
What about the new Pirates of the Caribbean?
That looks so good!
I can't believe they're making more.
I know! I can't wait to see it.
