Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I think Mulan would take the cake.
Ewww, why?
I just think they did a great job showing gender inequality in the army.
Yea, the Chinese army back in the day!
Yea, but then they showed how no matter what gender you are, you can contribute and make a difference.
Hmmm, I never thought of it like that.
I think Mulan had more guts than any of the men out there.
How can you possibly say that?
She was willing to sacrifice everything to take her fathers place in the army, that is called fortitude.
