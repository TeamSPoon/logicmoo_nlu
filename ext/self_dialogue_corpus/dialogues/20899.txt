You know what movie I never saw, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
I've never seen it either.
Isn't it a musical?
I think so.
Do people get dressed up to go see it?
I think that's what happens. And people act out the movie as it's playing.
That sounds a little strange to me, but it might be fun to see once.
I'd see it, but I don't want to act it out.
I wonder if they make you act it out if you go.
I hope not, but I guess we'd have to see.
Maybe we shouldn't see it then. We'll settle for whatever movie we don't have to dress up for.
What movie should we see for your birthday next week?
I'm not sure, but maybe Wonder Woman.
I heard that was good.
I saw the preview and it seemed decent.
I would be willing to see that with you.
We could also consider seeing Cars 3.
If we bring the kids, I bet they would love it.
Yeah, both my kids loved the other two Cars movies.
I like the Cars movies even without my kids.
