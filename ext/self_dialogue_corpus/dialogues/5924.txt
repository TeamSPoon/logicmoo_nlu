Have you seen Cars?
Yes, that movie was so cute!
I liked it too. Did you see Cars 2?
No, was that as good?
I don't think sequels are ever as good.
What did you like most about the first movie?
I loved the characters and how they fit their "car" personas so well.
Who was your favorite character?
Tow Mater, for sure! Who do you like?
Have to say the star of the show: Lighting McQueen!
