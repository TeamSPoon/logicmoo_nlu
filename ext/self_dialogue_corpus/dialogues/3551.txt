I just saw John Carpenter's Vampires.
Wow.  Who is in it?
James Woods, Maximilian Schell.
What happens in the movie?
James Woods' team of vampire killers gets wiped out by a group of vampires.
Wow.  Does he survive?
Yes.  He and his only surviving partner go after Valek, a master vampire.
Neat.  What happens in the end?
They get to kill Valek.  His partner turns into a vampire.  Woods lets him go.
Sounds pretty interesting.
