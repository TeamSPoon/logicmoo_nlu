I just saw the movie the Awakening.
I've seen that. Would did you think of it?
I loved it, I thought it had a lot of good plot twists.
Really? I was totally confused.
What confused you?
The guy said the headmistress sent him to hire her, but then it turns out she was dead...
No, he said the headmaster sent him. And the headmistress wasn't dead, why did you think that?
Well when she says she thinks she killed the guy and mentions the boy, he says there is no boy and only 3 of them there.
Yes, so how was that confusing?
Well he said there were only 3. That would be him, her and the guy who attacked her.
No, no, no. He didn't count the guy who attacked her.
Why wouldn't he?
He was either referring to 3 of them being in the house, or he didn't count the guy because he assumed she had killed him.
I'm still confused.
He introduces her to the headmistress as soon as they arrive: she's totally alive.
Oh. Well I was confused in the end, I didn't know who was alive and who was dead.
They made that a little mysterious, but if you're paying attention you realize she is alive because she's leaving and says she'll see him in a week, and can no longer see the ghosts.
But the headmaster didn't see her.
She even makes a joke about him not noticing her, either because he was sort of permanently distracted, or because she was a woman. But it wasn't because she was dead.
I really should re-watch this.
