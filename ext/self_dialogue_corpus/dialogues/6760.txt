I know my kids watched the movies a lot so I wonn't forget.
Ya so did my kids, remember the birthday party we had for Amy?
Ya I loved that you had the Frozen soundtrack playing in the background.
Ya her favorite song is still Let it Go.
Ya I've heard her sing the whole song.
Ya I'm sure we all have it memorized.
I think my favorite part of the movie is when we meet Olaf.
Ya I love Olaf he is probably my favorite character
Same here he was really funny.
Ya I love his song.
