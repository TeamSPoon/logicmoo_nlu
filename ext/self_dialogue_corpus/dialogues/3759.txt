So I finally saw Psycho the other day.
Took you long enough!  What'd you think?
Really creepy.  Norman Bates was a great character.
Hitchcock was a true genius.
I personally think the shower scene was a game-changer.
Not just that it's iconic, but how the main character dies midway through.
It's a very interesting choice and something you don't see coming.
Or dressing up in women's clothes for that matter.
Like I said, Norman was a total creep.
But one of film history's best characters.
