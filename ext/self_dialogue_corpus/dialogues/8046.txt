What's your preferred genre of music?
I guess I'm into pop music, above all other types.
Yeah, me too. I've been on a Taylor Swift kick lately.
Really? I've been on an Adele kick.
They should do a duet sometime.
That duet would make people's heads explode.
Totally. What's your favorite song by T-Swift?
I like "Blank Space" and "Style".
I think I'd choose "Love Story" and "22". What about Adele?
My favorite Adele song is "Hello"... so amazing. Makes me cry.
