You seem to only like scary movies, do you have a favorite comedy?
That's a hard one. Does it have to be strictly a comedy, or can it be a funny horror movie?
I'm going to make this a tough one for you, so strictly comedy!
Ummmm, oh, I got one! Office Space!
Really? you can't think of anything more recent?
I know it's from the late 90's but it's a classic!
So what makes you like that one out of all the great comedies that have come along since?
I think the only reason I watched it was that it reminded me of where I worked at the time.
Oh, the old office building by Michigan Ave?
That's the one!
Was it really that bad where you worked?
Not really, but there were a lot of similarities!
Wasn't Jennifer Aniston in that movie?
Yes, she was, opposite Ron Livingston.
Oh yeah, that guy from Sex and the City.
Surpisingly, I like Aniston in that movie.
Me too. I thought that she would be annoying, but she wasn't.
Now I really want to watch that movie again!
Want to have a movie night?
Sure, your place or mine?
