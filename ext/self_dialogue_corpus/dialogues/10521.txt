Did you see any movies over Memorial Day weekend?
I did catch up with that animated movie called Big Hero 6.
I never saw that. Was it any good?
I have to say the world building was impressive. They created this entire futuristic city called San Fransokyo.
Where would you rank it with other similar films?
I would say it was similar to the second How to Train Your Dragon movie. Good visuals but not that great of a plot.
That's interesting. I saw a pretty good movie recently called Logan.
I heard about that. That is the new X-Men movie, right?
That's right. I have to say it's definitely one of the better superhero movies I've seen.
I always have trouble keeping the timelines straight with all those movies.
Luckily with this one it is set in the future and most of the mutants are dead, so you don't have to worry about timelines.
Wow, I'm surprised. It kind of sounds like a downer though.
It definitely was a bit of a downer. Especially seeing the characters get old and sick.
But you still liked it?
Definitely, it was much better than the usual CGI superhero movie where you see a city get destroyed each time.
Cool, I will have to check that out. Is there any new movies you want to see?
I have been hearing lots of good things about the new Wonder Woman movie.
Oh yeah, that looks pretty good. I do like that actor with the square jaw.
You mean Chris Pine? He was good as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek movies.
Yeah, that's the one. We should go see that together.
