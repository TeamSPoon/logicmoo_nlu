what is your favorite kind of music?
I like a lot of different kinds but country is my favorite.
Seriously?  Who is you favorite artist?
I really like country music from the 80's.
Me too!  Do you remember Kenny Rogers?
Yes! How about Islands in the Stream with Dolly Pardon?
One of my favorites.  "Islands in the stream, that is what we are..."
Nice. Do you remember the Gambler?
Yup.  How about Dolly's song 9 to 5?
Oh yeah.  That was a good one too.  The movie wasn't that good, though.
Who else do you like?
I really enjoyed Alabama, too.
That was my mom's favorite group.  I use to love Sweet Potato Pie.
Was that the name of that song?
I think so.  At least that's what I always called it.
Did you ever listed to Barbara Mandrell?
"I was country when country wasn't cool"
I know that one too!
She is still one of my favorites.
I like her a lot, too!
