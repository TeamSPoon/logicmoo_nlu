Oh my god, I just saw a horror movie and it freaked me out.
That's their purpose.
Worse than usual.
Which one is it?
Insidious, the original one.
Why did it freak you out?
I have those same experiences.
The out-of-body while dreaming?
More than that, it's the wandering and going places. It's a real thing.
Dang, that seems freaky.
