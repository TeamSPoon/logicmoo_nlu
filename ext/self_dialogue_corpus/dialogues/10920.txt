Did you see the Wild game last night?
Yea, season over.
Yes, they can't score goals when they need to.
The Wild came back but overtime was killer in that series.
Yea, and Dubnyk didn't play well either. How do you give up 4 goals a game in the playoffs?
We should have put Kuemper in instead.
Do you think we will have Suter and Parise again next year?
I hope so. Both can score goals.
They sure can, hopefully they can so do in the playoffs again next year.
Yea, getting tired of saying next year though.
Ironic how our season was ended by our former head coach too, right? Yeo!
Yea, I bet that revenge felt sweet.
Yep, his team is built to be bigger and beat ours.
Do you think the Blues will go far?
If their goalie stays hot, sure.
Well, I want them to win since they beat us.
Sounds good. Should be an interesting series.
Yup. Next year though for the Wild.
As always!
Get better goalkeeping!
