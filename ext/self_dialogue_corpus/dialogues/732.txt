Man this game is a blowout
Is it?
Yeah Seattle is getting destroyed
Oh no
Huh
I said oh no
But why you say that
Because I like Seattle
Why bro
They are my home team
Ah
Yeah I grew up with them
Sorry to be a fan then
Where you watching the game at
I am in first row at the game
Man you are lucky
I know just saw three touchdowns up close
Living the dream
I sure am
Jealous
