My Chemical Romance had some pretty good songs back in the day.
I know. I'm so upset they're not together anymore.
Yeah, I was shocked when I found that out.
It's been a few years now, hasn't it?
Yeah, it's been four years I think.
I loved their song I'm Not Okay.
Me too, and I liked Helena.
I really liked Green Day back in the day, too.
I never liked any of their music.
Are you serious?
Dead serious.
You don't even like Wake Me Up When September Ends?
No. It's too melodramatic.
Hm. I guess you could say that.
Do you like anything by Sum 41?
Yeah, I really like their album Chuck.
Did you hear they named that album after the man that saved their lives when they were in the Congo?
What? No way!
Yeah, isn't that amazing?
Definitely. I can't even imagine how thankful they were when he helped them.
