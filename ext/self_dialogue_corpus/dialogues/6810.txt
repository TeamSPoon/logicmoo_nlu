Do you like Dumbo?
Yes, but it is sad.
Yeah, there are many sad moments in that movie.
My favorite is Alice in Wonderland when it comes to Disney.
That is a good one.
It takes you away into another world and I love that idea.
That is quite an old cartoon.
Yeah, the old ones are the best.
Who is your favorite character in Alice in Wonderland?
Alice of course.
