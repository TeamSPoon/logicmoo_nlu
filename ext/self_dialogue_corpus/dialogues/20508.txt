What are some of your favorite funny movies?
I have so many, Blazing Saddles was hilarious.
Blazing Saddles, wasn't that kind of controversial?
Not back then, movie makers seem to be able to get away with more than they do now.
Wasn't that a Mel Brooks movie?
Yes it was Mel Brooks, the same guy who made Space Balls.
Who was the short guy in Space Balls?
I believe you're thinking of Rick Moranis.
Rick Moranis was also in Honey I Shrunk the Kids. I think he played the father.
I remember Honey I Shrunk The Kids, it was pretty good. I know there was a sequel, but I never watched it.
I don't think I ever saw the sequel either.
Movie sequels are never as good as the originals.
Usually they aren't, but there are some that are just as good or better.
Can you name some that you think are better?
The second Terminator movie was better than the first one.
You're right, it was quite a bit better. The Godfather part 2 was also better than the first.
Agreed, even as good as the first one was, the Godfather part 2 was better.
I don't think I ever saw the third one, I wonder how good it was.
Can you think of any other sequels that surpassed the original?
I think just about everyone agrees that Empire Strikes Back was better than Star Wars, even as great as Star Wars was.
