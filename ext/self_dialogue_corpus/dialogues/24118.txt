Hey what is your opinion on the surge of feminist movies?
I'm pretty sure my feelings are not the norm.
Well what do you feel about them?
I hate them to be honest with you.
How come? What's wrong with a littl bit of girl power?
Nothing actually, but unfortunately it's a lot of girl power and man bashing.
What film have you seen that bashes men?
The new Ghost Busters films bashes men left and right,
How so?
Every guy in the film is portrayed as a complete incompetent, it's actually pretty insulting.
Alright aside from Ghost Busters what other movies have you seen that deliberately bash men?
How about that movie by Tyler Perry? It was called "For Colored Girls".
I've never heard of it, I'm not a fan of him or his movies in all honesty.
Well this movie specifically paints men out to be a bunch of wife beating rapists.
Really? What is the plot?
The plot is a group of women ovrcome their hardships that are ironically caused by the men in their lives.
That's it?
Yes sir.  That is all there is to the movie.
That sounds horrible. How did the movie do?
Luckily it didn't do so well in the theaters, but it still made a profit.
