Think the Bills will be any good this year?
Not good enough to beat Miami and New England. They won in spite of themselves
What about 12 gauge?
Not good...
What happened?
Looks like he is on his way out.
He is not looking good, huh?
New coaches don't like him
Shame...was hoping he was gonna make it
I did too. Watch, he goes somewhere else and becomes a star
HAHAHAHAHA...yup, got that feeling too
They have nobody to throw it to.
All they have is McCoy.
And Sammy Watkins, right?
Whatever. Dude's always hurt
Think he's fool's gold?
Looking like it. Wasn't the best receiver on his team
Who was?
Robert Woods...51 receptions, 1 touchdown
Wow...holy cow
