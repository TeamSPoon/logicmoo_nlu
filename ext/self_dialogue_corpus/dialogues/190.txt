Do you think Robert Downey Jr can keep doing Ironman movies?
Well Marvel has a specific contract with them.
So who moves on first?
I think Robert will because hes getting older.
But those movies make bank.
They do but they require alot of time as well.
So he would die?
They could have him retire so that he could reprise the role.
I think he stays until they end the universe.
You may be right but probably not.
