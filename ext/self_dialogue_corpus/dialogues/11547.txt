Do you have a favorite Beatles album?
I like them all. How can you have a favorite?
Each album is a different period of artistic expression. Sargent Peppers is different than Let it Be or the White Album.
Those are good. I guess I always liked Abbey Road. I like the cover.
"Come Together," "Octopus' Garden," "Here Comes the Sun" -- all excellent!
John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, what's your favorite song by Paul McCartney on Abbey Road?
That's easy. "Maxwell's Silver Hammer," totally.
There was a lot of activity in the band at that time.
Yeah, John Lennon had already left the band and Paul McCartney followed about a year later.
Well, to get back to your question, I guess that Abbey Road is my favorite Beatles album.
