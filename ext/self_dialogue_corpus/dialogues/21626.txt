What good movies have you seen lately?
The other night I saw this new movie: "Doctor Strange". I totally recommend it.
Does it have famous actors? I haven't heard about it.
The actors are recognizable but I do not know the names.
What is the movie about?
It is "Marvel" movie. A superhero movie.
I don't like those kinds of movies that much.
But this one has like a different approach. It is very well thought of, and not just packed with non-sense action.
Oh, ok. Tell me a bit more.
Well, the movie is about this doctor who get's his hands messed up and wnats to find a way to heal them.
Ok. So, what is so special about that?
He goes to a monk temple in Asia and he starts learning magic tricks.
Now I'm more interested.
So, because he is an extremely intelligent guy, he becomes like super gifted in all the magic community.
And what are his super powers?
He can teleport and he change the physical properties of the places he is in. He can also play with time.
I bet the specail effects are amazing to show all of those things happening.
The special effects are out of this world. The movie is a whole experience.
Okay, you convinced me. I'll watch it.
You wont regret it.
