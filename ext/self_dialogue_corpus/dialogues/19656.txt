Have you heard of The Outer Vibe?
No, as I am not a hipster. What is The Outer Vibe?
They're a small rock band that tours and does a lot of small shows.
Like I said, I'm not a hipster.
But, they're different.
How so?
Well, they put all of their money back into the band, and are pretty well-off.
Are their shows sell-outs?
Yep, even though they're small venues. They performed during finals week here last year, remember?
Oh, yeah, those guys.
The thing I like about them most is their musicality.
They better have musicality if they're a music group.
Duh. Well, the reason why is because one of the song writers has a Masters degree in Music Theory.
How is that a good thing?
She is able to make the song a lot more harmonically adventurous, setting it apart from other groups.
So more than just the power chords of VII-III-VI-V?
Oh yeah, lots of secondary dominants and augmented chords.
Any hits that I'd know?
No, they just have a really good following. Nothing has been on the radio.
So, hipsters? Told you.
