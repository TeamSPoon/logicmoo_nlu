Do you ever consider that nature has i t's own music?
Excuse me? nature has it's own music? I don't follow.
Sure think about it. Birdsong for instance. That 's an easy one.
The nightingale is best known for its powerful and beautiful song.
Carole King had a song called Nightingale.
There is another song that I can only remember a few words to ...sing sweet nightingale.. sing sweet nightingale highhhhahh above
Okay if you say so I believe you.
Hah I just looked it up it came from Cinderella!
Also think about frogs  they have high pitched voices where bullfrogs sound like the base part in a song.
i see where you are going with this.
They insects all have varying voices as well.
You make a good point.
My favorite time of the day is dusk because that's when the daytime animals are going to sleep and the animals of the evening are just waking up
I really never thought of it like that.
It's like an orchestra.
How cool....you are right it really is music!
Frogs can be the bass or a triangle depending on the pitch and all the other critters chime in like an owl.
How fun I think I am goin to record that tonight.
Let's do that and see what we can come up with.
Next big smash hit!!
