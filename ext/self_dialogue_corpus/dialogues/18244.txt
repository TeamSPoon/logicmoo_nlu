Out of 80s Metal Bands, who would be your favorite?
Oh it would be Metallica for sure.
Really why is that?
They were one of the first trued metal bands. They started in 1981. I was in diapers!
Oh wow. I prefer AC/DC and of course we know they were first. 1973 is when they started.
Yeah, I guess they were around longer, but I like the softer tones of Metallica.
I find that AC/DC has a more edgy sound. Wouldn't you agree?
I guess. I found that Metallica changed a bit in the 90s and became more alternative.
Yes, they really did. AC/DC kept true to their edge.
I know but "Enter Sandman" has to be one of the best songs ever.
Okay, I can agree with that, but have you ever heard "Back in Black" or "Hells Bells?"
Oh yes, those are both really good songs. How many people are in AC/DC?
They have seven all together.
Wow. That is incredible. How many of them are singers?
Only 2 are vocals. Three are guitars, then one bass and one drums.
Wow. Still a lot of members. Metallica only has four.
Really just four? I guess that is about average for a band. Who is your favorite member?
Lars. He is the drummer. What about you. Who is your favorite in AC/DC?
Oh that is easy. It would be Brian Johnson. He is vocalist.
Oh yeah man. He sounds great.
