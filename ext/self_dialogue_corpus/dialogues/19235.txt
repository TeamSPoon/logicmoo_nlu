What type of music do you like to listen to?
I like all kinds, even country how about you?
Same! I really like Sam Hunt.
Me too. His new song Body like a Back Road is so catchy.
I also really liked Taylor Swift when she sang country.
Our Song will always be one of my favorites!
I'm so glad her music is on Spotify now so I can listen to it all the time.
What other artists do you like?
I really like Kygo.
No way I went to one of his concerts last year.
What is your favorite song of his?
I like Firestone and Younger.
Younger was the first song I had ever heard of his.
His new song with Selena Gomez is also really good.
What's that one called again?
It Ain't Me.
Oh yeah! Selena Gomez has been coming out with a lot of new music lately.
Yes! I also still like her old songs such as Like a Love Song.
I will always love music made by my childhood favorites!
Same! I have been listening to Malibu by Miley Cyrus a lot lately.
