Did you see that there's a new "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie out?
I heard that, but I don't know much about it.
Yes, they're bringing back Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow!
What about the other two, um, I can't think of their names . . . ?
It was Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann.
Oh, yes!!  They had a great romance.
Unfortunately, I don't think they have a big part in the new movie.
Oh, that's too bad, I really like their characters.
I believe Orlando Bloom is in the movie, but not Keira Knightly.
They're not giving him a new love interest, are they?
No, I don't think so.
Because that would be a terrible thing to do after all they went through to be together!
And if you remember, they didn't get much time together in the last one.
Yes, their story was really tragic.
I hope they are planning to somehow get Will back from the "Underworld" or whereever he's supposed to be now.
Maybe that's part of the premise of this new movie.
I guess we should go see it and find out.
That's a great idea.
Let's see if we can get matinee tickets.
I agree--the price of movie tickets is astronomical these days!!
