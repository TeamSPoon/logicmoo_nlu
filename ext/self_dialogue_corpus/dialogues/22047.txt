I just saw No Country for Old Men again last night. It's so good!
Didn't that movie come out, like, 10 years ago?
Yes, but it's a classic. So dark and scary and good!
Who's in it again?
Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson... just to name a few.
It's kind of a Western, right?
No, it's crime drama. It takes place in Texas in 1980.
What's it about again? I don't think I've seen it all the way through.
Well, I don't want to give the plot away and spoil it for you.
Just tell me some basics.
OK. Tommy Lee Jones plays a sheriff out in west Texas. He sort of narrates at the beginning and the end.
I love him. He's a great actor.
Yeah, absolutely. Josh Brolin's character is the one who's on the run during the whole movie, but he's not the bad guy.
Who plays the bad guy then?
Javier Bardem.
Oh, right! With the weird wig?
It might have been his real hair, but yeah.
Didn't he win an Oscar for that role?
Yeah, I think he did. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones deserved Oscars too, but I think only Bardem was nominated and won.
Wow. I need to see this movie again. The whole thing this time.
