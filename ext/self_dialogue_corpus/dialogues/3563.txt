Did you watch the Jason movies growing up.
I did, those Friday the 13th movies scared me to death.
Yeah, I had nightmares about Jason all the time growing up.
I don't think our parents knew what we were watching during all those sleep overs.
I think if they had they wouldn't have let us watch them.
Which one was your favorite out of them all?
Friday the 13th, the final chapter.  It was the first one I saw.
Did you see the other ones?
Yeah, I think I have seen them all, but that 3rd movie is still my favorite.
I like the orginal, its still the best of all the 80's slasher films.
