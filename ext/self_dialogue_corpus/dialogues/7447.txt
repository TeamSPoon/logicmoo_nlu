What do you think of Frozen?
I really like the movie in general but I saw a lot of behind the scenes clips that would have made the movie so good!
I saw them too, but they changed a lot last minute.
I enjoyed it overall though. I'm glad we have another princess that is reasonable in her thinking about love.
Like Merida!
Yes!
Plus I mean she was only what, 14?
I believe so. You don't have to fall in love at first sight.
Absolutely not.
Love is there all along!
