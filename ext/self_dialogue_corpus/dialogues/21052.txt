Did you see the new Fast and Furious movie
Oh my God! Yes, I loved it!
There was so much action in this movie
Absolutely! and I loved all of the characters in it.
I'm so glad they added the Rock to this franchise. He makes it that much better!
He really does! It is really enhanced with his character
But I really do miss Paul Walker in this movie
Yeah me too. It is always bittersweet to watch these movies without Paul
I think the writer's did a good job of protecting his legacy though
I do too
I really loved the plot in this movie also
Yeah. Finding out that Dom has a baby boy was surprising.
It was a great plot twist that I didn't see coming.
I like Charlize Theron as a villian. She is really sexy
Yeah I like her too as the bad character
She really goes after Dom and his crew
I also like the fact that she got away. Live to fight another day
Yeah she will definitely be in the next installment
I can't wait for part 9. These guys are awesome!
Yeah I second that emotion!
