So do you think that Adrian Peterson will come back strong this year?
I just don't have faith in him.
Really, you've given up on his career?
No, not given up, but I just am not sure if he can recover his greatness.
Oh I see, and I actually agree with you on this one.
I had Peterson on my fantasy football team last year, and he did horribly.
Yes, I drafted him as my first pick in fantasy too.
Well he got hurt the first or second game, and that was pretty much the end of his season.
Yes, it was a crushing blow for Minnesota.
Yeah, he carried so much of that team.
I do remember a couple years back that he recovered from another injury quite well.
Yes, he was a monster in rushing yards the next season.
Everyone, including analysts and experts, were saying that his career was over before he came back.
Yeah, and Peterson proved them all wrong immediately.
That's when he was getting a lot of praise, and people were calling him a freak of nature.
I couldn't believe that he healed that fast, and was better than ever after that injury.
So you don't think that Peterson will do the same thing again?
I guess now that I am reminded of that other injury a few years ago, I might still believe in him.
Does that mean that you will draft him in fantasy football this year?
I probably will, but I definitely won't draft him in the first couple rounds.
