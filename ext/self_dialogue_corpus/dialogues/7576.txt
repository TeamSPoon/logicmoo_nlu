The happiest part of the movies for me is the epilogue, seeing everyone send their kids off on the train and everything is calm.
That's my favorite part too. I love when Harry reassures Albus Severus.
I think that Albus Severus and James are both happier versions of the people they are named after.
Yes, exactly. Albus is so reassured by his dad that he's not afraid of being in Slytherin.
It's like Harry gets to be the dad he always wished he had.
It's cool to see how Ron and Hermione are so proud of their kids. Ron is finally confident and Hermione is probably famous and still hardworking.
Their kids seem like they are all best friends on the train.
What about Scorpius Malfoy?
His parents seem like they are very loving too. They hug him.
Yes, the vibes in the epilogue do seem like Draco Malfoy would be a better parent.
