Have you seen the Shining?
Which one, the movie or mini-series?
Oh, I didn't realize there was more than the movie. That's all I've seen.
Yeah, the movie came first and Stephen King really wasn't happy with how it turned out.
That's why there was a mini series made?
Exactly, so you see the plot taking different turns in each one but they each have their merits.
Well even if I didn't have the same vision for the story Stephen King had, I still appreciated the movie a lot.
Absolutely, and to answer your question, I have seen it several times and it's one of my favourites.
How come?
Oh, it's kind of a classic within my family, it scared me to death as a kid and I'm just a big fan of the stories King comes up with in general.
Nice, nice.
Oh! Plus I liked Jack Nicholson's acting in it.
Me too.
I know he wasn't who King liked for the role because he seemed like he was already on the way to crazy from the start, but I can't help it.
Well I'm learning all kinds of new things.
Yeah, similarly he thought Shelley DuVall seemed too emotionally weary from the start unlike the privileged cheerleader type he envisioned for the role.
You know, I kind of thought that myself and I had no idea he felt the same!
Well you know what they say, great minds think alike.
I guess so. I could never have come up with a story like that though, with the hotel itself being an entity trying to take advantage of his boy's powers!
It really is a tremendous story the more you get into it and read about and learn about it. Not just a shallow horror like some.
