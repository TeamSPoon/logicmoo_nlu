What's your favorite Disney movie of all time?
I really like The Lion King. How about you?
I'm a Little Mermaid fan myself.
I like that one too. I think those two Disney movies have some of the best music!
I love the song "Under the Sea."
Doesn't that one crab sing that song? What's his name?
Sebastian is the crab's name.
Oh, that's right! What's the name of Ariel's fish in that movie if the crab is Sebastian?
The fish's name is Flounder.
I remember now! I need to watch that movie again soon!
