Who do you think the 76ers will draft in the upcoming NBA Draft?
They have the toughest pick at #3. There's no clear-cut choice with that pick.
Yeah, it's not like the first and second pick.
This is a two-player draft. Then after that, it's up in the air with 6 really good players.
They have to address their needs rather than taking the best player available, which I think is Tatum.
I agree. They have too many big men as it is. Taking another forward or center is redundant.
So who should they take? A point guard?
They need shooting. They should take the best shooter available, which is Malik Monk.
Even if there are 5 players that are better than him.
Yes, because the five players better than him aren't strong shooters or play positions they don't need.
It's a shame they didn't get one of the top two picks. Those guys would be perfect for their team.
What's ironic is the teams that did get the top two picks don't really need those players on their roster.
The Celtics and Lakers both need big men in a draft that's top heavy with point guards.
Fultz and Ball are both upgrades over who they have now, but I don't see either team being better the next year.
They'll both be better in the long run, which is what the draft is really about.
I wish there was a way the Celtics could find a player that makes them both better next year AND better in the long run.
They would have to pass up on Fultz and take someone like Tatum, but that's a poor choice in the long run.
Do you think they would trade the pick for the chance to get a lot better next season?
They would need to get a very young player in return who is on a long contract to ensure he stays with the Celtics for at least 3 years.
Even then, I don't think it's a good move. Fultz is the best prospect to come around in the last five years.
