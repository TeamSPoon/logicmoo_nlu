Do you have a favorite Beatles album?
Probably 'Abbey Road'. You?
Mine would be 'The White Album'. It's a tough choice, though.
Oh I forgot about 'The White Album'! I love that one!
It's so great isn't it? It's the only 2 disc album, too.
Was that towards the end of their career?
Kind of yes. 'Abbey Road' was the last album.
With the iconic cover! I would love to go to that street one day.
Wouldn't we all? And recreate that album cover?
Exactly. Everyone knows it.
