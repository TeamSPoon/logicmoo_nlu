What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
That's such a hard question!
I know right? Mine would have to be a tie between The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.
Both good options. But what about Mulan?
Oh I forgot about Mulan. I didn't own it growing up.
I did. It was one of my favorites. We had so many great movies growing up.
We got the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Mulan, The Lion King.
Emperor's New Groove - and of course, Toy Story.
Toy Story! Oh I forgot about that one.
Yeah, we sure were spoiled with Disney movies.
