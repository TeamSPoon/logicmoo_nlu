Have you seen a good horror movie lately?
Yes, I sure did Friday night.
What did you see?
I seen The Conjuring 2, it was better than part 1.
What were the best parts?
There is a spooky demon that takes form of an evil nun.
Wow, what else was it about?
A hauting in England of a family of 4 and a girl gets possessed, by an old spirit that was really the nun demon.
Sounds like a cool twist, anyone familiar?
Lorraine and her husband Ed who were involved with the Amityville story were there to see if the claims were fake.
