So, Marshawn Lynch is coming back.
Really, I thought he was done for good.
Yeah, I thought he was done too.
He is over 30 years old.
Usually, running backs decline by that age.
What team is he on?
He plays for the Raiders now.
That should be fun to watch.
Yeah, he's from there.
The Raiders made the playoffs last year.
They lost in the first game though.
Their QB Carr got hurt before the game.
Yeah, that was a tough break.
Lynch should take some pressure of Carr.
A good running game is essential.
It keeps the defense guessing.
A running and good passing game should help the raiders.
They also have a good defense.
Khalil Mack was an All-Pro last year.
He's a great player.
