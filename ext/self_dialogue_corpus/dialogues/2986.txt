I think the Bears are going to be bad this year.
Yeah, they have no quarterback.
I like the running backs that were drafted.
Yeah, I can't wait to see them play this year.
I think the Giants have a good chance at winning the superbowl this year.
It looks like they have the best team out there.
The patriots are getting pretty old but still could have a chance.
They are coached pretty well so they do have a chance.
The raiders put a lot of money into their quarterback.
Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the right decision.  They should have got a better running back.
The bears defense looks strong.
I think that is the only thing that will keep them in the games this years.
I don't know if the the dophins should stay with Tanehill.
I don't think so either, he is not that good of a quarterback.
Rogers will be strong for the packers this year.
He will come out throwing for sure.
The Steelers have a pretty good squad if everyone can stay healthy.
They look like they have a few all pro players.
I dont think the bears are going to win more than 5 games this year.
If they do its because their defense won it for them.
