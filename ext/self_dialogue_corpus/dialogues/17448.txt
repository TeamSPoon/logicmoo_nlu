What is your favorite Nirvana album?
I dont even have one
You like them that much?
No I think they are overrated.
Thats different!
Yeah I liked Nevermind a little bit.
I didnt really find that to be a great album
There were better grunge bands around
Like who?
Sublime.
I dont think they were grunge
OK how about blind melon?
they had one big hit
yeah but the music was better
for a mass appeal you would be wrong.
But back to nirvana.
yeah i think they were alright but i loved nevermind
it wasnt as landmark as you think it was
i dont buy that
many bands dont cite it anymore
