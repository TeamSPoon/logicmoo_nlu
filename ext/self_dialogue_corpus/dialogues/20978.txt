Do you watch a lot of movies?
A good bit.  I usually watch on Netflix over the weekends.
I love netflix.  They have so many good movies.
I recently watched Finding Dory.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it!
That's funny because I don't mind watching those movies that my kids like either.
Although, I do like the Thriller section on Netflix.
We watch thriller movies all the time.
I like thrillers and comedies.  What a combination!
Do you ever watch the classic horror/thriller movies?
Yes.  I just love old zombie movies.
Dawn of the Dead is still such a great movie!
Do you ever watch romance movies?
Not really, unless I find one that interests me..
I'm not really into the sappy movies either.  They just don't keep my attention.
I like movies that keep me on the edge of my seat and make me guess.
My favorite is when the end is completely different than what I suspect.
Do you watch movies on Netflix as well?
I do, but we also watch movies on hulu.
Hulu has some good movies too.  I think it is good to have a large selection.
Especially when you watch a lot of movies.
