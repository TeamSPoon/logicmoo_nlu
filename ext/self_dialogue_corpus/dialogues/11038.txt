Hey, are you at all interested in ice hockey?
Well, I've never actually seen a match, but I like ice skating.
If you're into ice skating, you should definitely look into ice hockey! We're currently recruiting new members for our team.
Huh. You don't require people with more experience?
We encourage everybody to try out. Even if you don't make the main team, you can still join us in some of our practices.
Really? That sounds interesting.
Great! Tryouts are tomorrow at 8. Let me know if you want to practice before then.
That's so nice of you! I definitely wouldn't mind an overview of the rules.
Hahaha, it would be my pleasure. What do you know?
Well, I know you have a stick. And hit the ball.
You mean the puck.
Yeah, the puck.
Anything else?
There are goals you shoot off?
Well, that's enough to get started with, I think. Want to go practice puck handling techniques?
Definitely! Do you have an extra stick I could borrow?
Yup! Do you have ice skates already.
Yes, I have my own pair.
Great. Have you been to the rink before?
No, so I'll just follow you.
