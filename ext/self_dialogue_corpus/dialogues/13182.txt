The final Death Star scene in Return of the Jedi was intense
Yes, I agree. A lot of action and fighters flying around
There were some pretty cool new fighters in that scene.
Oh right, like the A-wing fighter.
Yes, and then the B-Wings.
I don't remember those
yeah, they weren't very prevalent.
I do remember Lando was piloting the Millennium Falcon in that one.
Yes I remember. Pretty good ship for a hunk of junk.
Ha, ha. That's right. It always seemed to perform well under pressure.
