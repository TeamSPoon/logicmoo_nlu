Hey what do you think about the Saints signing Peterson?
I am skeptical about Adrian Peterson myself. How about you?
I agree with you because everyone is doubtful.
I was also wondering how much longer that Tom Brady will play.
Yes a lot of doubt s surrounding that subject too actually.
Yes, I don't know how old Brady is now? Do you?
I think he about 41 years old now.
Oh okay, that is old for a quarterback.
How old was Kurt Warner?
I believe he was about the same age as Brady, actaully.
The Packers have Aaron Rogers and he is awesome! How old is he now a days?
Rogers is 33 years old this year and at his peak, I believe.
Rogers did not get very good blocking last year and I hope they beef up the line up this season.
Yeah seriously!
Have you heard any new linebackers being recruited?
I don't really keep up with the Packers as much as I should.
I understand that time flies during off season.
Right, I like the Red Zone because I get the highlights and stay informed.
Yes, The Red Zone is always on at my house!
My tv is set to record that every single week!
