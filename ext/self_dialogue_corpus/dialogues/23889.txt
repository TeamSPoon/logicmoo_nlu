What is with all these remakes? Doesn't Hollywood have any original ideas anymore?
Apparently not. Now what are they remaking?
Flatliners.
You mean like that one from decades ago with Julia Roberts?
Yep. I always thought it was pretty creepy.
Yeah, so who's in this one?
Ellen Page and some others I don't really know.
Remember when they remade Point Break?
Yes! Why, why would you mess with perfection?
Ha! I'm not sure I'd call it perfection.
Keanu Reeves was perfection in that movie and you can't convince me otherwise.
I'm actually not going to argue with that.
Because obviously you'd lose. Seriously though, they had to know they wouldn't be able to make the movie better.
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Definitely. Although I might rather have a remake than an awful sequel.
It's like they don't know when to stop.
I swear they're on like the 58th Fast and Furious right now.
Well somebody must be watching them. They must be making money, right?
I guess so. I just don't get it.
Well, I don't think you've the audience they're going for.
