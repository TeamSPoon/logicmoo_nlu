I just watched the movie Up again.
Oh I remember that movie making me cry.
Ya I still cried at the end when he reads the book his wife left about her favorite memories.
Ya that part always gets me.
There are some really funny parts like with the dogs.
I liked Russell too and how much he helped bring out joy in Mr. Fredricksen.
Ya it had some really good messages about living life to the fullest.
i really like that about Pixar films they seem almost more for adults with the message.
Ya but they are still great for kids because of all the colors and funny characters.
I will have to watch UP again now!
