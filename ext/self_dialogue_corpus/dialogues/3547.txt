Have you seen thirteen ghosts?
Its been a while
Same here
I think i liked it though
From what i remember it ised to be one of my favorites
All i remember is the lawyer getting sliced in half by thkse doors that was one of my favorite parts
Doesnt his eyebals move after his body slides down?
I believe so
It was a little creepy and funny
Yes it was
