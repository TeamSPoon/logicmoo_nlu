Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
Of course I have, who has´t?
Which is your favorite?
I would have to say Star Wars: Episode IV -A New Hope
Really? I thought you liked the new ones better. Why is this?
I think the original 3 are better: Plus I really liked Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher young.
So about the new movies? What do you think of Rey, who is she related to?
I have my theories, some may assume is Han and Leia´s daughter. But I´m thinking more of Luke´s daughter or Obi-Wan Kenobi´s granddaughter.
Do you think she will turn to the Dark Force?
No, I think she will become the best Jedi that ever existed.
