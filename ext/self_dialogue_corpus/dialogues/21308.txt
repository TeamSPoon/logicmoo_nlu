What is your favorite Marvel Universe movie?
I like Captain America: Civil War the best, what's your favorite?
I like the Avengers.
That is my second favorite because it was so cool seeing all those movies lead up to that one.
All of their movies are good.
Marvel Studios never fails.
Except The Incredible Hulk
That's not as bad as people make it out to be.
Why do you say that?
It had some really good action sequences.
My only problem was the plot.
Yeah it was pretty plain bit still a great movie.
It's the one movie Marvel wants to forget.
I'm more excited for the future movies.
Me too I'm really looking forward to Blank Panther.
I can't wait to see Infinity War.
I would hate if any of them died.
When they face someone like Thanos everyone won't come out alive.
But they always make great movies.
Yeah Marvel is the best.
