Hey have you seen the Resident Evil Final Chapter?
Not yet.
The main character is going back to the hive.
Why?
It turns out that there is a cure there and she has to get it out before time runs out.
Does everyone get cured?
Well no, it kills the T-virus and leaves healthy tissue.
What does that mean?
It means that all the zombies and animals will die but the rest of the people not affected will be saved.
OK, what happens when she gets there?
Well she is captured and drug behind a vehicle like a tank, attracting zombies on the way bringing thousands.
She escapes right?
Oh yeah and she leads a team of people to the hive to get the cure.
Many people get killed?
Most of them die but the hero gets the bad guys, it turns out she is a clone of the daughter, of the scientist that invented the T-cell.
So she was engineered?
Oh yeah. The Umbrella Corp. was really nasty and had thousands of top execs and wealthy people frozen, They were going to take over when everyone was dead.
Did she stop them?
She stopped them and eliminated the frozen ones too.
Wow, I gotta see that.
