Hi
Hello.
What's going on?
Not much, you?
Same.  You like music?
Sure who doesn't.
I guess you're right, hard not to like music.
Yeah.
What kind of music is your favorite?
I would have to say rock.
Oh okay, what kind of rock?
I like metal bands a lot.
Like Hair bands?
No, like modern day heavy metal.
Oh okay, I don't know too much about that.
It's great.
Who is your favorite band?
Mastadon.
I haven't heard of them.
Great band.
