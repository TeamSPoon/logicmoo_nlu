Have you seen the last Star Trek movie?
Into Darkness?
Umm....I think there was another one, but I did see Into Darkness the other night
What did you think?
I liked it. I thought Chris Pine did a really good job again as Capt Kirk
Yeah, I like Chris Pine's performance. What did you think of Benedict Cumberbatch?
He played Khan, right?
Yes, that's the one
Yeah, I thought he was really good, but it's hard to beat Ricardo Montalban's potrayal
Oh yeah, that guy was great. Wasn't he on Fantasy Island as well?
Yeah, that's the one. Man that was a crazy show
Yeah, anyway...do you still like the Star Trek franchise?
Yeah I guess you could say so, but part me wonders if it's getting overused
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
There are good actors in it, but sometimes the actors don't like sticking around for too long
True. Kind of like all the super hero series
Yes, exactly
Do you think you'll still watch the new Star Trek movies in the theater
Yes, what about you?
For sure.
