What do you think of the Die Hard franchise.
The Christmas movies?
What? No, the action films.
Yes, but they are Chritmas movies as well.
No, they are action. Police and guns and terror.
All set at Christmas time. An action Christmas movie.
The first one did happen during an office Christmas party.
Yes, and the second one, Christmas time as well.
Well, did you like them.
All I can say is, they are my favorite Christmas action films.
