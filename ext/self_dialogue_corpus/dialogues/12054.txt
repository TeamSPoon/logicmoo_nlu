We gotta talk favorite villains.
Well, mine was definitely Boba Fett.  I mean, despite his silly name.
I don't really get the hype behind that guy.. he had like.. what, three lines?
Dude, he had a FREAKING JET PACK!  As they say on the internet, you're argument is invalid!
Ahhh.. I think Darth Vader is cooler.  Boba can't block laser blasts with his fist.
Yeah, but he also has all that cool gadgetry. Wrist mounted rope for the win!
Ahhh.. he's alright.  Still going with Vader
All right?  He's got Wookie scalps for trophies!
Wookie scalps?  Where did you see that?
Well, they don't explicitly show it in the film, but they detail it on the toy and stuff.
