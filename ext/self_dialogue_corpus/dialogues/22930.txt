What are the best super hero movies?
It would have to be something from DC or Marvel.
Beside those ones I mean.
Well, maybe the Rocketeer.
That was one of the best movies of its decade.
It was directed by Joe Johnson.
Who is that?
He also directed the first Captain America movie.
Well, that might be why it feels like a superhero movie.
I thought Sky High felt the same.
That one was actually a lot better than it gets credit for.
Kurt Russel plays a really good super dad.
He was super, but not so good in the Guardian's of The Galaxy Two.
I loved how evil he ended up being.
It was such a plot twist.
I liked when he showed him self to look like David Hasslehoff.
That was the best part of the movies.
The whole Guardian's franchise really plays on retro stuff.
I think that is part of its draw.
A regular kid making his way in a super world.
