who was your favorite child star?
Macaulay Culkin.
He was great in Home alone.
As a young girl I had a big crush on him.
That's funny. I am sure many did.
Did you know he and mila kunis dated?
No! Really?
Yes, for like ten years too.
Wow I can't envision them together.
Well they were.
I suppose I just see him as A boy like home alone and ritchie rich days.
I really liked that ritchie rich movie.
It was fun but corny.
I remember a feisty girl character in it.
Stephi Lineburg was the actress. She was good but has not gone on to do much.
So true for many child actors.
Hard to break the child image.
Also sometimes they don't age so well.
True Macaulay Culkin did not age so well.
That is true.
