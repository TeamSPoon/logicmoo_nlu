Who would you take if you could decide again: Rivers, Eli or Big Ben.
I think Rivers. But it's close between him and Eli.
No love for Ben?
He's great but gets hurt too much.
Injury prone, yeah.
Not prone just a factor of his play.
Eli hasn't missed a start though.
True.
And has two rings.
Also true, but I think Rivers is just the best of the three.
Shame he doesn't have a ring.
Yeah, I guess he just hasn't had the team around him.
I mean, he had LT and Gates for years.
That's true.
And he's had pretty good defenses.
Also true.
And a favorable division.
Yeah but you know who screwed it all up?
Who?
Norv Turner.
