do you know eh, eh by gaga?
what album is that from?
fame monster. the other name is nothing else i can say.
dude, her " cherry cherry boom boom" beginning is so cute
she chose a more cutesy vocal style in that song.
it's one of my favorites,
it has this synth thing going on and the chorus is nice.
doesn't have the best lyrics though.
it doesnt matter.
melodies over lyrics
