I need a good movie to watch Saturday night. Any suggestions?
Well what genre are you looking for?
I would really enjoy a comedy, I think.
Well I have the perfect comedy for you. It's a little crude, but it is so funny!
Well, what is it?
The Heat. It has Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock in it.
I have never seen that. I have heard good things though.
I don't think it will let you down. But, if you want another suggestion I would look for the older movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.
Now I have seen that one. I love Steve Martin!
Me too, he is so great in any movie that he is in.
