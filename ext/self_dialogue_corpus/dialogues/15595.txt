My friend invited me to a Florida Georgia Line Concert.
They are country right?
Yeah, I'm not really into country but she really wants me to go with her for her birthday. And I do like some country stuff.
What do they sing?
They sing that song H.O.L.Y, which I kinda like.
Do they sing "Pontoon'?
Oh I love that one, but I don't think that's them. I think that's Little Big Town.
Gotcha. They sing "better man" too right.
I think so. I'm more of a classic rock girl myself. I could listen to Led Zeppelin all day.
Yasss and the Eagles!
I saw the Eagles in Concert in Clevleland back in the 90's. It was awesome.
What's your favorite Eagles song?
That's hard. I love Hotel California, Take it Easy and Desporado.
Yeah, they have a lot of good ones.
Some of their stuff has a country sound to it I guess, so maybe I do like more Country than I think.
Yeah, I think it depends.
I just don't like sad mopey country songs.
Lol, like "There's a tear in my beer"?
Haha, exactly. I want more upbeat stuff.
Me too. But I still don't like a alot of country.
