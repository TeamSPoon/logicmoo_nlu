What is the most exciting play in basketball?
College or NBA?
It doesn't matter.
The tip-off.
...seriously?
No, silly, they don't even try. I like the game-ending three-quarter-court shot.
Okay, let me specify. What's the most exciting regularly-occurring play in basketball?
For me, that would have to be the posterization.
Really? I don't like that at all.
Why not? One guy jumps up and dunks on top of another. It's humiliating.
It's too much showmanship, and it's unnecessary. There are other ways to get two points that don't involve putting someone's head between your legs.
So, what's yours?
I like the three-pointer that absolutely kills a rally.
How's that work?
Say a team is down by 10 with two minutes to go but have been making a comeback. They get it to within two points.
Okay...
Then, as they're about to take the lead, the other team takes control on a fast break and scores a three-pointer.
Why's that your favorite?
It's completely demoralizing. It crushes the other team, the fans, and the hopes.
True...but cruel, man.
