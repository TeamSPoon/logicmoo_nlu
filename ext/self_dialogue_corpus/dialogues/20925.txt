hey I'm in the mood to watch a horror film
ok, but I don't know any good recent ones
We can watch an old one.  How about "rosemary's baby?"
I've never seen that.  But I've seen "The Exorcist"
That movie scared me so much when i was a kid, but now I think it's kind of funny.
Maybe we can see something a little more recent.  How about Blair Witch?
ugh, that's so boring.  I had those found footage movies.
Chronicle was good though, and it was found footage.
Ok, I'll give you that.  How about Babadook?
Ok, I can go for that.  That's Australian right?
yes. I've seen it, but that's ok with me.  I like that kind of horror.'
Psychological thrillers? they're pretty good.
I also liked "The Conjuring."
I don't know, that felt kind of run of the mill to me.  I've seen those jump scares before.
True. but there's no real scary films anymore. How about a monster movie.
Great idea. How about Godzilla?
The original, Gojira?  That would be good.
I was thinking the new one.
No way, he sounds weird in that.  Godzilla vs. Mothra?
i love that one.  Sounds great.
