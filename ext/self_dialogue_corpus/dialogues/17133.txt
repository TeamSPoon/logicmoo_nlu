What do you think of Katy Perry's new album?
It's okay, but not really my thing.
Why?
I don't know, I just like her old stuff more.
This is different from her old stuff? I haven't listened to it yet.
Yeah, it just seems darker somehow.
Huh, I guess I'll give it a pass then.
It's fine if you like more heavily-produced stuff, but it just wasn't for me.
That's fair. Maybe I'll look up some of her singles on youtube.
That's a good idea. Swish Swish is the latest one, I think.
Thanks, that helps.
So what music have you been listening to recently?
I listened to Lorde's new album the other day.
What did you think?
I thought it was good, but again not really like her old stuff.
Yeah, that's what I heard. I haven't listened to it yet.
It was fine, though. A little more poppy than her old stuff, but her voice is the same.
That's good to hear. I was on the fence about it.
I would definitely listen to it.
Thanks for the recommendation.
