Race to Witch Mountain was a great movie.
Who produced it?
I dont remember the specific name of the producer but I know Disney films backed it.
Yeah I do remember that, wasnt the Rock in it?
Yeah its part of a larger film series
So it was a sequel?
Sort of, the larger series is called Escape to Witch Mountain
Did it do good on the reviews?
No half the people who saw it thought it was terrible
So not one of the Rock's finest works
