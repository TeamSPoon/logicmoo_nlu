Who's a better droid, BB8 or R2D2?
I think I prefer R2D2
Really? I prefer BB8
Why?
Because he has more personality and can do more things.
Personality? Droids don't have personality
What are you talking about, just think of C-3PO
Yeah, I guess you're right
In the end they were both great characters
Agree.
