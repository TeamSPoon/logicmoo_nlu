Can you name any jazz musicians?
Why do you ask?
I am doing some research for school.
Do you not know any jazz musicians?
Not really.
Duke Ellington and John Coltrane are both good examples.
I have heard the names but don't really know their music.
Duke Ellington's known for Take The 'A' Train.
Okay.  What about John Coltrane?
I like a couple of his songs.
What would you suggest I listen to?
Try the song In A Sentimental Mood.
Got it.
Another good song to try would be Equinox.
I will do that.
Do you need any other names of artists?
Maybe just one more.
There is always Louis Armstrong.
I do know some of his music.
That is good to hear as he was quite famous.
