How many games do they play in an NFL season?
They play 16 games each season.
Has it always been that many? Seems like it was less than that.
It was less than that a long time ago. I think it's be 16 since the 80's.
How many games does a team need to win to get to the Superbowl?
Wow! A team probably needs around 12 wins to make it to the Superbowl.
Are you including all the post season games?
Yeah. I think there's three round you got to win to get to the Superbowl.
What about regular season game? How many do you think they need to make it into the post season?
They probably need to at leas win 8. Around fifty percent of their games.
What teams do you think stand a chance this year?
The Patriots, The Panthers, and maybe The Falcons.
I was hoping the Browns were going to get there this year.
It would be nice, but that would be an extreme long shot.
What makes you think they don't have a chance?
You have to have a team of good players not just one or two.
I think they have a few good players. What about Joe Thomas?
He's probably their best offensive lineman. Still he's going to need more help.
Well they also have Joe Haden. He can help.
That's still only two. Everybody else still needs to prove themselves.
