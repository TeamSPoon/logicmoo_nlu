Can't wait for the NFL season.
How do you think the Lions will do?
Same old Lions. All hype.
I just hope Stafford doesn't do like Barry and Calvin
Oh God, don't say that.
I don't see them making the playoffs this year.
We can hope.
Green Bay is still the team to beat I think.
Minnesota is better too.
Chicago should still suck.
Detroit has a brutal schedule.
Too bad they can't schedule Utah St.
They don't want any of that.
You ain't right.
Neither is Jim Caldwell
I like Jim.
He's a likeable guy, but not the answer.
Who is?
I don't ,know
How about Wayne Fontes again?
