Do you think Disney will ever stop making Pirates movies?
If people keep spending money, they will keep making them.
What is it about pirates that people are so attracted to?
I think part of it is the romantic lifestyle of always moving. And the gold helps.
People do love money they don't have to work for.
I would say Johnny Depp has worked pretty hard for the money he made on these movies.
He has done a lot of them. His character is so flashy and yet somehow vulnerable.
I think the outlandishness is there to cover up the vulnerablities.
That makes sense. I wish we could get a bit more of his back story, how he came to end up a pirate without remorse.
I think he has a good deal of remorse.
