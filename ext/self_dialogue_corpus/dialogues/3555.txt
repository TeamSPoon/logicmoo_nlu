Have you watched any good horror movies?
I saw the Witch.
Oh, I heard good things about that one.
It was really good. I have no idea how the writer got them to sound like they're from the early colonial era, including even the accents.
Will I have to watch it with subtitles?
I think you might. It could be hard to understand without.
Was it very depressing?
It was, but that was necessary. There are tons of touching moments too.
I might check it out.
You should. The Witch was about fate and the slope of corruption.
