Have you heard on the artist Lady Gaga?
Yes, she is very eccentric and a good singer.
I think so too.  One of my favorite songs is Bad Romance.
I've heard about that song.  It's very risque.
Yes, it is.  She gets kidnapped and sold in that song.
That song actually went eleven-times platinum.
I like her song Born this way.
That song sounds interesting. What was it about.
She said it was her freedom song.  A lot of people criticized it.
Now I know. It was similar to Madonna's song Express Yourself.
