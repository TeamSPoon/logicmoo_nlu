Can't wait 'til Hamilton comes to town. Do you like musical theatre?
Yes, some. I know Hamilton is popular these days.
And expensive. I like Phantom of the Opera too!
I do too. Sarah Brightman is wonderful.
I really like her singing.
All her solos in Phantom are so beautiful!
She really breathed life into that musical.
She's good at the dramatic singing.
That's funny too because sometimes her voice sounds extremely young.
Even so, she has a mastery over her craft.
You can tell she enjoys singing.
It helps the listener to like it as well.
Which Phantom songs do you like?
I think Past the Point of No Return?
That one's so dramatic.
True. And then Music of the Night.
Andrew Lloyd Weber could be a musical genius.
He's extraordinarily creative and productive!
Cats, Evita, and Jesus Christ Superstar and tons more.
Its fun to see a Broadway musical now and then.
