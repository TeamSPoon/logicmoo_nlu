Have you ever seen Chocolate?
The candy?
No. The movie.
Oh! Yeah that was pretty good.
I really liked Johnny Depps character.
He was in it?
Yeah. He was kind of the love interest.
Oh, yeah. The river rat?
Yeah, the guy with the boat.
He wasn't in it very much.
No, but still a pithy role.
True. I really liked Alfred Molina.
He was pretty exceptional.
I love when he climbs into the show window and gorges himself!
That was so funny.
He is a really good actor.
Yeah, he doesn't work much though.
Yeah, that is strange.
Anyhow, I just bought the DVD if you'd like to see it again.
Please!
