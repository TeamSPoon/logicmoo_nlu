What did you think of Arrival?
It was a very cool film.  I actually thought it was the best movie last year.
The alien language part was well done and a slow burn.
It was always building to something which I appreciated.
Especially the end.  Who would have thought that it was a different character for the divorce?
It was a great exercise in movie making.
It was nice to see a twist ending that didn't feel cheap.
Credit the screenwriter for that.
Hopefully they make more enjoyable movies like that where the ending is in doubt.
Hopefully, but who knows with Hollywood.
