Did you see Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet?
Yeah I saw it with my wife last night!
What did you think?
I really enjoyed it.
What did your wife think?
She liked it too.  She loves Chris Pratt.
Wasn't baby Groot adorable?
Yup.  Definitely a highlight of the movie.
I thought the CGI animations were all excellent.
Yeah.  Marvel always does a great job with those.
Did you see all the after credit scenes?
Yeah.  We stayed all the way until the end.
These days you kind of have to stay.
"laughs"  If it's a Marvel movie you know you have to stay!
What is up with the space dog?
Oh, space dog is in the comics.  He is actually really powerful.
I didn't know that.  That's cool.
Space dog is awesome!
Well, now I can't wait until Thor Ragnarok!
I know!!!  Me too!!
