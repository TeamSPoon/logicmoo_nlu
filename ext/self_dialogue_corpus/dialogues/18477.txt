How do you like Pixies?
Who are they?
They are a fantastic alternative band from the eighties or nineties.
DO they have song that is really popular ?
Most of their music is kind of underground.
How do you know about them?
I play a lot of RockSmith 2014.
I play that all the time too!
Right on, do you have the microphone too?
No, I just have the bass and guitar.
Can you play a lot of songs?
I can play about 25 songs, give and take.
Sweet, I can play about the same. I like playing the Queen songs the most.
Wow, those songs are some of the most difficult ones.
For sure, I am trying to learn the song Bohemian Rhapsody now.
That is a super long song, how many minutes is it?
The version that I am learning is 8 minutes long.
Thats crazy long, good thing it is a fun song.
Exactly, I have learned about half of it to this point.
I think I will add it and start learning it this week too.
