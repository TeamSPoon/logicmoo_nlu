Do you think Puff Daddy was a good rapper?
I think he was a terrible rapper.
Why do you say that?
I think he was a guy who was clinging onto Notorious BIG's coat tails
That's a bit harsh don't you think?
No he didn't do much.
He had a lot of collaborations.
That was his only way to a hit
So how did he stay relevant for so long?
Easy! He was a great entertainer.
I don't recall seeing him host things.
He had a show on MTV.
Oh yeah Making the Band
And he was a great producer as well
Does he even do that anymore?
I'm sure his name goes on stuff and he shows up one day to say if a track sounds good
Man you are harsh on this guy
I just don't think he had a great career.
His rapping abilities were not that bad
I think you are way off in your analysis.
