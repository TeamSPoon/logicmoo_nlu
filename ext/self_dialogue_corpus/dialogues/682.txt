Man I am pumped for this upcoming season.
Me too! who do you like to win it all?
I think the Seahawks will do it.
I think they really miss Lynch, this last season was mediocre
Yeah, but Wilson is a great game manager. And, I love Pete Carrol
I like the Packers
Because of Aaron Rogers?
Yup, best QB in the league
I can't argue with that, but he is all they got!!!
They added a nice receiver in the Draft, Malachi Dupre, from LSU
I like that pick too. That division is weak
Yes sir. After Teddy went down, the vikings were finished, and there isnt another decent team
I wish Detroit would get it together, they have a decent QB
Lions always seem on the verge of being good, but just stay mediocre.
Agreed. Any other predictions for this year?
I think Zeke Elliot will win MVP.
I love Zeke, plus that Cowboy's offensive line is beast
Plus their tackle Collins will be back from injury
I cant wait for the season now haha. It will be fun watching Dak and Zeke.
Yup, they are a dynamic duo
