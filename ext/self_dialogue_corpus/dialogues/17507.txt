Do you like Static X much?
I haven't really listened to them.
They're pretty heavy, but instrumental metal.
Do they sound like Slipknot?
Eh, a little heavier than that.
Hm that sounds pretty decent.
Yeah it's very upbeat and heavy.
What songs do you like by them?
I'm With Stupid is one of my favorites.
That sounds interesting.
Yeah it's really not a bad song.
What else do you like by them.
Brainfog is another good one.
Do they still tour?
Unforuntately not. The lead singer died a few years back.
How did he die?
It was a drug overdose.
That's truly a shame.
It really is. He was a talented musician.
Too many go that way unfortunately.
