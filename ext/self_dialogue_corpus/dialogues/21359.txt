You seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No, I haven't thinking of waiting for it to come out on DVD.
Oh, man, it was AWESOME!  It's the best one yet.
Which one is it anyway?  How many of those are they up to?
This is the eight one, that's why it's "fate of the furious" as in f plus "eight" you know?
Ahh.. clever.  So, tell me, does this one feature a big car chase?
(....) Dude, they ALL feature a big car chase.
Hehe... someone missed the joke there, I guess.
So, anyway, they got this awesome scene where they're out on the ice and there's a freaking submarine after them.
Uh.. what a submarine?
Yeah!  It is SO cool!
Sounds interesting.  Like I said, I'll probably check it out, but I think I'll wait to get it on DVD or something.
Yeah, but then you'll miss the FULL experience!  You're speakers can't match the awesome theater sound system!
Actually, last theater I went too I think they had the sound jacked up a bit too high.
Really?
Yeah, hurt my freaking ears.
What was the last movie you've seen in the theater, anyway?
Uh... let me think... it's been a while
Take your time, I know you're getting old and all...
Ahh, shut up!  Actually, I think it was Guardians of the Galaxy.
