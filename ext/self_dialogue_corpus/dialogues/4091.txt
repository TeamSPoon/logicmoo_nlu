Do you have a favorite thriller-type movie?
Tough to pick, but probably 'The Usual Suspects'.
With Kevin Spacey? That movie is so amazing.
I paid such close attention the whole movie and I STILL didn't see the twist coming!
That's the mark of a great thriller, though. I didn't see the twist coming in 'The Prestige'.
Is that the magic one with Christian Bale?
Yep, that's right.
I've only seen that once but I remember it really blew me away.
The same director did 'Inception' too.
I saw that in the cinema and it was so gripping.
