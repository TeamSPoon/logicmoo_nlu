Do you remember that old movie about the fish that got lost?
Oh, do you mean finding nemo?
Yes! That was a really good movie.
Oh, I agree. Ellen Degeneres is so funny.
Did you go and see the seqeul?
Oh, do you mean Finding Dory?
Yes, that's what it's called. That was the one when Dory had to go and find her own family.
Yes, I did see that one. It was even better than the original.
Really? I would have said Finding Nemo was better.
Well, it's just a matter of opinion.
