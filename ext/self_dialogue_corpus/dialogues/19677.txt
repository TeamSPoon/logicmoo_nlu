Well this is awesome I am listening to 311. I love them1
They are ok I suppose.
My  husband used to be in a 311 Tribute band so he is playing live in the living room right now while he's listening to a video playlist on t.v.
How cool that would make it a gazilion times better to hear it live.
He toured around with this band in the southeast for about a year and I went to quite a few out of town gigs and the ones in town as well.
How fun! Did you like it?
Yes it was a blast! 311 fans are fun energy.
Have you been to 311 concerts?
Oh yes several in Atlanta. The I took my son and my boy friend/future husband to Memphis for 311 day. Their birthdays are son 3/8 and husband 3/10.
How nice of you1
Oh it was so much fun! The concert was over 5 hrs long and we stood and danced at our seats for just about the whole time.
I like them and Sublime. They are very similar.
Good vibes from 311 music. The words as well as the instrumental part.
The last time I went to 311 I took my son's girlfriend/future wife with us to the concert. She enjoyed it after Snoop Dog got off stage.
What was Snoop Dog doing there?
He was opening for them. I was excited to get to see him but it was really crappy.
Wow what did he do that left such a bad feeling?
It was just to crass of a show to go with 311's laid back vibe. It was very abrasive.
Can't win them all
True so true. See you later at the party!
