Do you have any Star Wars memorabilia?
I got the "Art of" books of the first trilogy, because they had the screenplays as well as wonderful artwork.
I wasn't into action figures, but I like movie posters, so I got the posters.
Have you ever been to movie poster sites? The original posters are worth a mint now, if kept in pristine condition.
I do have a few rare ones, as it happens.They aren't quite in pristine condition, but they're worth a nice little amount.
I have several other books, and there was a collection of pre-viz sketches done by Ralph McQuarrie that were fantastic, so I got that.
I guess there are geeks out there with basement shelves full of action figures still in their original packaging, so they'll be worth more.
Yeah, I was never that kind of collector. I didn't collect to sell later.
I agree. Somehow it takes the fun out of being a fan when you can't play with the action figures.
Or hang up the posters, right?
