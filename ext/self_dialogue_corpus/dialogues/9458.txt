If you had to listen to music for hours straight what kind would you listen to?
I think I would choose hip hop music.
Why is that?
I like a lot of the artists.
You mean from recent years or back in the 80s and 90s?
Probably a little of both.
Tell me who you liked the most.
I like a variety but I'd have to say that Dr Dre and Eminem are among my faves.
They're pretty good. They collaborate a lot together.
Yes and I can't emphasize enough how amazing they are together.
