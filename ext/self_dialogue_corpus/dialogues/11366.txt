Today I listened to the White Album by the Beatles.
The Beatles are great I enjoy their music.
Do you listen to them often?
Not really but when I hear their music I really like it.
I listened to the whole album start to finish.
What was your favorite song
I really like the song Blackbird.
I like that one too it's really different.
I'm going to search for some more classic Beatles music.
Now I"m going to listen to the White Album!
