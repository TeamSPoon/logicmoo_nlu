Did you see Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Championships tonight?
You mean the Ottawa Senators versus Pittsburgh Penguins match up?
That's the one! Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it went into Overtime.
There have been so many Overtimes with the Senators games in the playoffs thus far!
I know, right? Bobby Ryan scored the game winner.
Looks like Pittsburgh should have picked Ryan over Sidney Crosby back when they were drafted 1st and 2nd overall.
I don't know about that. The Penguins have won a Stanley cup in the last 2 years while Ottawa hasn't won the cup in forever.
What do you think will happen this series?
I think the Penguins will give the Senators a tough time.
Tougher than the New York Rangers gave them?
Yeah, definitely. Pittsburgh is a tough team to beat.
Ottawa is proving to be a top contender, though. It's about time a Canadian team won the Eastern Conference Championship.
Who knows what will happen. The Rangers did give Ottawa quite a run.
It's not like that series went to Game 7. Ottawa won the series 4-2 in Game 6.
Very true. Do you think the Senators and the Penguins will go to Game 7?
I think they very well could. It's a really intense match up.
You have to remember the Penguins are coming off a 7-game run against the Washington Capitals.
You're right. They could lose steam during this series against the Senators.
I really thought the Capitals were going to make a comeback and advance, but yet again, they're out of the playoffs.
