What is the last good movie you watched?
Hell or High Water, no doubt.
Oh yea!  I watched that in a theater.
Yes, I waited until it came out as a rental and watched it.  Amazing movie.
What did you like about it?
Well first of all it's a nice change from all the big budget blockbusters we get so often.
True.  Did you like the acting?
Oh yea!  Ben Foster, Chris Pine, and Jeff Bridges.  They were all really good.
I thought the plot was really good.
Yes, it was kind of like a modern day western.  A very uniquely American type of movie.
Yes.  The kind of romanticism over bank robbery, the guns, the shooting.
I agree.  And the economic desperation.
So who do you think had the best acting performance in the movie?
That's a tough question.  I'd go with Jeff Bridges.
Oh really.  Not the two brothers?
No.  They were great, but I think Bridges kind of anchors the movie.
Jeff Bridges is terrific.  I feel like he's been acting forever.
Yea, I agree.  He's known for Big Lebowski, but I mean he's good in basically anything he does.
Yes, he is an Oscar winning actor.
Very much deserving of it as well.
