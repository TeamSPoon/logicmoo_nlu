Have you heard the new Rise Against album?
Yeah! I thought it was pretty good, stuck to the roots of their previous music, what did you think?
About the same. It's definitely got some catchy tunes on it.
They are coming in concert soon, are you going.
No, I think I'll be out of town. Are you?
No, but I'm planning on going to the City and Colour show the week before that.
Oh yeah? I didn't know you liked him
Yes - he is the best! I can't wait for him to put out a new album.
Do you think that's going to happen soon?
It seems like he has been playing some new songs at shows, but I'm not sure if there is a new album in the works.
It seems like since he has quit Alexisonfire, he seems to put out a new album every two years or so.
Yeah, and it's been two years - it's time!
What band are you most excited about that has a new album coming out?
I dont know any in the future, but the new Ryan Adams album is good, but not my favorite.
The porches album was really good, did you hear that?
Yeah, and I heard Radiohead too
That's a band that I just can't get behind - them and Coldplay, it all sounds the same.
I can understand that.
There's just a lot of really bad music on the radio now, I don't even know where people find new music.
I definitely agree - pop music has mostly forgotten about actually singing or any sort of harmonies.
