Did you see The Princess and the Frog?
Yeah, a few years ago when I was babysitting my little cousin.
What'd you think?
Oh, I loved it.
Me too. Probably the best songs of any Disney movie.
And it's cool that there's a black princess for little girls to look up to.
The set of New Orleans was kind of perfect, right?
So right. The jazz, the Cajun culture...all so cool.
And I definitely cried when the firefly's light went out.
Me too. At least he's with Evangeline now.
