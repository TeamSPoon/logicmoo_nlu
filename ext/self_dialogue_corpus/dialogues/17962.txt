Do you ever listen to Ben Folds?
No, who is he?
He is this piano player, but has this pop rock style.
No, I don't think I ever heard of him.
Anyway, someone showed me a video of him.
Like a concert video?
Not quite.  See, the guy is actually really super talented and a great composer.
So what's the video about?
Well, he's doing a concert or something and composes a song on the spot.
How does he do that?
The audience gives him a key, a subject and he just rolls with it.
He just puts together a song right there on his piano?
No, that's the crazy part!  He does this several part piece with violins, cellos, trumpets, and everything.
Are you serious?  How long did it take him?
Only a few minutes!
A few minutes?  That's the crazy part!
Yeah, I guess it is.  You really need to see the video.
I kind of want to now!
I'll send you the link.
Please, because I have to see this!
