Stop press! What's that honking sound?
I think it's called a crumhorn. Haven't you heard it before?
I don't think so. I love progressive rock but don't remember any sound like that.
Maybe it's because it comes from the Middle Ages.
So, are there any of those preserved from that time?
Not sure; it seems, though there's a lot of books describing them.
I'll check one book out and build one for my own. Love that sound!
And I think it brings included some music sheet to try it out
Wonder if anyone bothers to play that now.
Well, look at the media player credits. Do you see something in there?
It says "Artist: Musica Reservata - John Beckett"
"Musica Reservata", might they be from Italy?
Looking at the web it says they were from London.
That John Beckett, isn't he related with Samuel, you know, the writer?
I found out in Wikipedia they were cousins. Art was running in the family!
The crumhorn in that track was played by David Munrow
Do you mean the one from the Early Music Consort of London?
Sure it is. Anyway, I love better the sound of the recorder.
It reminds me of my childhood. What is your favorite recorder part?
The one by Florian Schneider, with Kraftwerk, in "Morgenspaziergang"
