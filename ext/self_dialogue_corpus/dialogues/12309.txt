Remember in the star wars movies when luke gets his hand chopped off?
Yeah that was crazy
Or when Luke finds out Darth is his dad
I mean, everyone knows about that
Did you see the han solo got fired
I saw that. from the new movies
yes the new ones.
I like leia organa in those
IT's a pretty great character
Her being a general is the best.
