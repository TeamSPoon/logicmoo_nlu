I'm going out on a date tonight, what movie would you recommend?
I would take a girl to see A Dog's Purpose if I was you.
I heard that movie is really sad though.
It is kind of sad, but it has a really happy ending.
Well that sounds really nice.
Dennis Quaid is in the movie.
Isn't this the movie that had a lot of controversy?
Yes it did have some controversy, but it turned out to not be true.
Is this a movie with Josh Gad?
Yes, he plays the voice of all the dogs.
Oh wow. I didn't expect him to be a voice actor.
He is actually a voice actor in frozen as well.
Oh really? Who does he play?
He is the voice Olaf.
Oh wow you must be kidding. I loved him in that.
Yes I know. You used to sing that song all the time.
What are you talking about? I still sing that song all the time.
I know, I like singing the Kristen Bell parts.
We should watch that movie together.
You always have the best ideas when it comes to watching movies
