Have you seen any good German films? We're doing a German movie night for the cultural club.
Hmm. I might have seen a few. Not lately though.
Were there any you liked? I don't think they need to be recent.
I remember really liking The White Ribbon.
What's that about?
It's set in a German village in 1913. It's a little dark though.
Too much for a cultural club?
Maybe.
Well, there was one option that was funny. Maybe you could watch it and tell me if you think it's appropriate.
Sure, what is it?
It's a movie called "He's Back."
What's the premise?
Hitler magically returns to Germany in 2010. But everyone thinks he's a method actor doing an impersonation.
That sounds like it could be really funny, but maybe a little off for a cultural movie night.
Well. I had one other idea.
What is it?
It's a movie called "The Lives of Others." It's not funny, but it's not inappropriate either.
Is it a good film?
I found it very moving.
Then I think you should go with that!
