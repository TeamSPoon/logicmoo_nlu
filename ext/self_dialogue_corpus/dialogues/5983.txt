Did you see the Tron sequel.
Unfortunately!
Didn't quite have the same charm.
You can say that again.
I miss the Master Control Program.
Of all the things to get nastalgic about!
Ha! I just thought the young Jeff Bridges made for a weak villian.
Tron was the first movie I ever saw him in.
Incredible actor.
How did they make him look so young?
