Alright, who is your favorite artist or band of all time?
that's easy. Radiohead
oh, I've heard of them but i don't really know much about them
Let me guess, you know the song "Creep"
yeah, that's about it
well, let me tell you, there is SO MUCH MORE to Radiohead than Creep. Most fans agree that song is actually a part of their weakest album.
wow really? what is their other music like?
their other albums are much less pop-rock-ish and are more alternative. they have a wide variety of sounds: experimental, ambient, electronic, orchestral...and more
hmm I'm pretty interested in that actually, I think I'd like to check them out a bit more! Where do you suggest I start?
well, how turned away would you be from experimental music that's not like anything you've probably heard before?
I'm into it. I listen to some weird stuff and I'm sick of the same old pop crap all the time
Great. I'd start with the album OK Computer. It's widely regarded as one of their best. Then, my favorite, Kid A
Why's that album your favorite?
It is just so different from anything else. It moves me like few other albums do, and got me through some tough times growing up. Some people find it strange though
I will definitely check it out! Sounds amazing
I hope you like it! I know Radiohead is not for everyone, but they hold a very special place in my heart.
That's awesome. Wait so how many albums do they have in total?
Nine LPs; their most recent one (another amazing record) just came out in 2016
wow I've got a lot of music to check out! I'm so excited. Can you rank the albums in your favorite to least favorite order? That's how I'll listen to them
Of course - though that's a tough question!. Kid A, OK Computer, In Rainbows, A Moon Shaped Pool, Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief, The Bends, The King of Limbs, Pablo Honey. Enjoy!
