Man movies are weird
Why weird
Because they just are out there
Out There?
Yeah
What does that even mean
It means they are whack
Whack what the heck is that
Come on
I am just teasing you
Well stop it is not funny
I think it is
Meh
Well how are they like that
Because the plots are weird
But those are the good ones
I just feel weirded out
You shouldnt
Why
because it is art
