What's your favorite Disney movie.
I think I like the ones from when I was a kid the best.
Oh the older ones, like Snow White and Cinderella?
No, I'm not that old!  I'm talking about Finding Nemo and The Little Mermaid.
Oh yeah, from that time frame I think I like Beauty and the Beast the best.
My favorite was probably Aladdin, although I liked a bunch of them.
What makes Aladdin your favorite?
I really liked the music a lot, and thought it would be fun to fly on a magic carpet.
I liked the Genie the best, his scenes were hilarious.
Yeah, Robin Williams did a really great job playing that character.
