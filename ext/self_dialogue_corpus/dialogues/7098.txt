Did you know that the new movie Finest Hour is a Disney movie?
Yeah I watched it and saw their logo.
Was it any good I was thinking about watching it?
I found it to be pretty good it was very interesting.
Who plays in it and how long is the movie?
It's about 2 hours Chis Pine, Ben Foster, and Casey Affleck play the lead roles.
Those are all great actors what is it about?
It's set in the early 50's when a storm hits and the Coast Guard goes to rescue some people.
That sounds real interesting I may check it out.
You should I think you will enjoy it, it's on Netflix if you have it.
