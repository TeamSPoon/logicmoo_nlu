Did you ever see the American Pie movies?
I saw the first two.
Did you like them?
I liked the first one.  The second was okay.
I loved all of them.
I don't know, the humor got old after a while.
How could it get old?
I mean, it was funny when it came out because I was a teenager.  After a while, it was lame.
I guess I never grew up.
And some of us do.
