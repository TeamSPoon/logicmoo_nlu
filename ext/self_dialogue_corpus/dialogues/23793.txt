If a book has been made into a movie, which do you prefer to do first, see the movie or read the book?
It depends if the movie will not be out for a while. I have done both and preffered reading the book before seeing the movie.
Which book did you read first before the movie?
Mostly all of the Harry Potter books I read before seeing the movie.
Oh I loved Harry Potter movies, which was your favorite one?
The most recent one The Deathly Hallows was my favorite movie of them all..
What do you think of people who talk during movies at a movie theater?
I think that it is rude to others to talk during a movie.
What is the best movie you have ever seen?
Bieng a huge Harry Potter fan I would say the Deathly Hallows movie.
Who directed that one, was it the same as the other movies?
I am not sure, but I do know that all of the books were written by J.K Rowling.
Wow, what is her net worth?
From what I read she is worth around 1 billion.
That is a lot of money from the Harry Potter books.
Yeah, overall the brand is worth around 15 billion including theme parks and licensing deals.
What is the scariest movie you have ever seen?
The exorcist was one of the most frightening and treacherous movies that I have seen.
What is the funniest movie you have ever seen?
There are so many good ones but I would have to say Hot Tub Time Machine is my favorite.
