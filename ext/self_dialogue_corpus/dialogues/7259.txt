I am thinking about going for a movie tonight. You want to join?
Which movie are you going to watch?
Not yet decided.
Oh! We can go for 'Beauty and the Beast'. Did you watch the trailer?
Yes, I was wonderstruck by the background. Reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.
Yes! Emma Watson looks gorgeous as ever.
Yes, she does. I heard Ian Mckellen also has a cameo.
That sounds so cool. Which show would work?
A show is available at 9 PM. Okay?
Yes, sure. Excited to watch the surreal world with full of breathtaking CGI effects.
