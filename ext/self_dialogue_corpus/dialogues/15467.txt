So did you hear that U2 has been touring their Joshua Tree album?
Yea, a friend told me about it.
So would you go?
No, I hate U2.
Why do you say that?
I just hate Bono.  He's such a egomaniacal blowhard.
I can see why you say that but his activism does a lot of good in the world.
Maybe.  I see him as a shill.
Why would you say that?
I don't know.  I heard U2 has a tax haven in the Netherlands.
Do you like their music at least?
Not really.  It all sounds the same to me.  I did like that Without You song.
Do you mean With or Without You?
Yes.
Sounds like you haven't heard too much of their music.
No, I haven't really.
Then how can you say that you hate it?
I don't know.  I just don't like Bono, I guess.
So you don't know much about their music.  Maybe you should just say you dislike Bono since you're speaking from a place of ignorance.
Whatever.  I guess.
