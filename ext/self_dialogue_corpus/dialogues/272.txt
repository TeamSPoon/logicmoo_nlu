Are you a Marvel or DC fan?
Marvel all the way. DC just doesn't get how to make epic movies.
Yes, they have good villians but can't seem to deliver on movies.
True. Suicide Squad looked promising in the trailers but was very disappointing.
I totally agree. It was a butcher job. Did you like Wonder Woman?
It was one of the better DC films I would say.
I thought it was worth the watch but still pretty formulaic.
I liked the world that they came from and knowing Diana's origin story.
I thought the villain was a good surprise too.
Yes, I agree.
