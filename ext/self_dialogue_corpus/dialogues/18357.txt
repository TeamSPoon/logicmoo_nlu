Have you heard of Run The Jewels?
No, is that a band?
It's two rappers, and they make pretty cool music.
I've never heard of them. What are their best songs?
I'd recommend "Legend Has It".
Hey! This is really catchy!
Right? Did you watch the music video?
Yes, I did. What are those hand gestures they kept doing?
It's their trademark, I think. They have it on their album covers.
How many albums do they have?
I think they've been making music since 2013 and they're on their third album.
I wonder how I've never heard of them.
Do you know El-P or Killer Mike?
I think I've heard of Killer Mike.
Those two came together to make Run The Jewels.
I'm surprised they're not more famous.
Me too. I only heard of them recently because my friend sent me songs from their first album.
What song was your favorite?
"36 Inch Chain" is on their first self-titled album and it's one of their best ones.
I'll check it out!
