You a big comedy movie fan?
Sure,who isn't.
I know,my favorites.
Yea,there are some classics.
I can as far back as The Graduate.
That's awhile ago for sure.
Big one for Dustin Hoffman.
It definitely put him on the map.
How about Austin Powers movies.
Yea,they were good too.
Bad Santa with Billy Bob Thornton was a riot.
That was too funny.
Can't forget Blazing Saddles. One of my favorites.
Mel Brooks was a genius.
He still is.
How about all the Steve Martin movies?
The Jerk is a classic.
He's another genius.
Incredible how talented he is.
He's a great banjo player too.
