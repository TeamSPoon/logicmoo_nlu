Hey
Hey can i ask something
Sure
Have you ever seen a movie called Brains
I do not think so
I am wanting to rent it but not sure if it is good
What is the plot
It says its about a family turned to zombies and has a kung fu priest
It sounds like a fun time
The problem is if it is serious it might be bad
Why would that be bad
Come on
No really
Something like that as serious sounds bad
I mean funny would be better but it could be so bad its fun
Maybe
gotta always think positive
I guess
I can watch it with you
Okay thats better
