I've never seen a thriller movie before!
How is that even possible?
Can you help me pick a classic one that I should watch this week?
Well there's a good classic called Rear Window
How old is that movie?
It's from 1954, is that too old?
No that's fine
Well if you want a newer one that is a little scarier then watch Disturbia
Okay, that sounds interesting! What's it about?
A teenage guy is stuck at home and starts to suspect his neighbor is a murderer!
