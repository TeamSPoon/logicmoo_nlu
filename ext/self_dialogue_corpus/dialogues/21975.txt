Did you get a chance to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2, yet?
I haven't--I've been really wrapped up in work lately.
I think you had said you liked the original, if I'm right I think you'd probably enjoy this one as well.
I really liked the original Guardians of the Galaxy, it's my favorite Marvel movie.
Well, this one isn't quite as good as the first one, but it sticks to the formula.
I really liked the music the first time around, how did they do this time?
Awesome Mix vol. 2 is definitely worth it--it tells a different story this time.
Awesome!  I love some seventies rock.  Do they have some new characters?
I'm not getting too into it, but Kurt Russell is there and his character is kind of crazy.
Ooooh!  Snake Plisskin vs. Peter Quill!
Haha!  It's not quite as good as that.  We also have Sylvester Stallone doing more than a cameo, and less than a supporting role.
Is he like some sort of time travelling cop?
No, he's a pirate--and speaking of pirates, we get to see a lot more of the Reavers this time around.
Arrrggh!  I liked the blue guy, he was fun
You'll get a lot more blue guy--Yondu is his name. He also has the stabby stylus in this movie.
I remember that there was a weird girl with antennae in the trailers, what was going on there?
You basically hit it on the head--the character is named Mantis is played by Pom Klementieff, a Canadian actress.
The first movie really delivered on the special effects, how'd this one do?
It's absolutely gorgeous, and they send us to a bunch of different environments.  I think you'll like it.
I do to, I've got a few days off coming up, I think I'll go see it at a matinee!
