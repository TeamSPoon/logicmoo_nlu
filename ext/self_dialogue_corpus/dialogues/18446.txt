What are your thoughts on rap music?
I like some of it, but I have a hard time understanding the words at times.
Me too. What is your favorite rap artist?
I tend to go more old school rap personally like, "Hail Mary."
Oh that is a good one. What about "Gangster's Paradise?" Cannot remember who sings it though?
Oh that was Coolio not Tupac.
Oh okay. Man, that was one of my favorite songs.
Mine too. Coolie was a good artist. Haha did you ever hear the Weird Al Remix of it?
Oh yeah, it was "Amish Paradise."
Yes that's it. What do you think of Weird Al?
He is great he will make a spin off of any popular song.
Like "Yoda."
Yes, or "Like A Surgeon."
Yes that was a remake of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" Right?
Yeah it sure was. Did you know Weird Al is still making parrodies?
No is he really? What is one of the new ones he has done?
In 2011 he did "Party in the CIA"
What was that a parody of?
Of the song, "Party in the USA".
Oh I will have to check that out.
