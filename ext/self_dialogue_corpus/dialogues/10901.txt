How many of The Fast and the Furious movies have you seen?
All of them.
What do you think of The Rock's character.
i really like him, I think he brought a much needed outside element to the movie.
How so?
Well they already had big name stars, but they didnt really have that cop presence since Brian became part of the team.
I see, so you think he legitimized it a little?
I do. I think he added credibility to a franchise quickly losing it.
I think you'e right, he fights well too.
Yea, i liked how they incorporated some of his WWE stuff in there too.
