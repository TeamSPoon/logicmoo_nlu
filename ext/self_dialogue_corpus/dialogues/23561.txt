What is your favorite Ron Howard film?
That is a hard one.
He has made a lot of movies.
Lets break it down. So comedy first, I would say, "How the Grinch Stole Chritsmas".
That one is a real new classic. I like his sort of kid films.
They are always enjoyable for adults as well. What is your favorite Ron Howard film?
I would have to break it up too, for comedy I would pick...Ed TV. Very funny.
Was that not just like the Truman Show?
Kinda. It was more like reality shows now, but a movie. Really funny.
I will have to watch it. What about Drama?
The Changeling, hands down. It is a great film and based on a true story.
I did not know that film was like a real story.
It is, he does a lot of sort of real story films.
Wow, did not know that. I am guessing Willow is not one.
I would say not, that was his best Sci-fi film by far.
I think that is more of a Fantasy film, not Sci-Fi.
Well, his best fantasy Sci-fi.
Better than Osmosis Jones?
That is a kids show, but really a good one too.
His films are always top tier to me.
