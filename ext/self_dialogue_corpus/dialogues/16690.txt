What do you prefer: brass quintet, woodwind quintet, vocal quartet, or string quartet?
Well, definitely not the woodwinds, as I hate the squeaking.
Hey, I used to play clarinet.
And... you all squeak a lot.
True. So which do you like?
I don't like vocal quartets because they put me to sleep, sadly. Either brass or strings.
I like strings the best.
Why is that?
Because they can play two or more notes at once and are able to use a massive amount of range, there's so much more you can do.
It's also a lot harder to write for them. Lots of young composers write literally impossible things.
Really, like what?
Like moves that require you to move between the strings in very odd, uncomfortable ways. Or doing trills between two strings.
What about brass?
I love them, but I'm biased.
What do you love about them so much?
Big, rich, bold, full. Massive dynamics. Strength.
Also known as "loud."
Ha, it can be. One trumpet can be louder than an entire string orchestra.
really?
Yeah, but that's just how physics works. I like them too because of their timbres.
