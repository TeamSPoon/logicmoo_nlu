Have you noticed how much Disney movies have changed over the last several years like Frozen, Brave Etc?
What do you mean?
It is no longer about the princess being saved by a prince, but now they are showing strong independent women.
This is true, I never thought about it.
What do you think about the change?
I think it was a great idea.
Why?
Because society has changed so much since Disney first started making movies.
What do you mean?
Women are more independent, and while we all love a good love story we don't need to always see the man being the savior like in Brave
