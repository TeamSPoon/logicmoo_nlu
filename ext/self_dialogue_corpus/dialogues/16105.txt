Do you have any good music recommendations?
What are you looking for?
Nothing in particular, just feeling like I'm in a music clump lately.
How about Sufjan Stevens?
I listened to him in high school but...
but what?
I feel like I overplayed all his album's and am sick of them!
Have you heard his newest release?
No, what state is it named after?
I think he dropped that schtick! It's called Carrie & Lowell.
Awesome, I've definitely never heard of it. What's it like?
It's a little more mature than his past albums I think, and a little more melodic.
Nice. Do you have any songs on your phone?
I don't, but let me show you a youtube video.
That's really beautiful.
Yeah, it's definitely my favorite off the album.
What's the song called again? I wanna write it down so I can download it later.
It's called "The Only Thing"
Great, thanks! I'm gonna look up and listen to the whole album later!
Great, happy to help!
