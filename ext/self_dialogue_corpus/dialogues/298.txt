Hey did you see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2?
I seen it the first day it came out.
Did you catch Howard the Duck lurking in the back round in one scene?
Yeah i almost missed it though since it was so brief?
Do you think they will ever make a new Howard the Duck film that's incorporated in the Marvel universe?
I don't think so considering the first film was horrible.
Yeah but keep in mind that it was 1986 when Howard the Duck came out.
Well if Marvel can make Rocket Raccoon one of the best characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, i guess anything is possible.
Oh what a match up that would be!
When you put it in that perspective, i guess i would actually pay to see a Howard the Duck meets the Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
