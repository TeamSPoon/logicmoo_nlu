what kind of music do u listen to?
I listen to a little bit of everything...R&B, Country, Classical, Hip Hop, Jazz......I like it all.
I'm a big jazz person myself. Jazz is my favorite genre of music.
Really?  Because I like listening to jazz when I;m in chill mode.
In fact, I played in the jazz band in high school and college.
What instrument did you play?
I played trumpet.  I was in other bands as well, but jazz was my favorite band to play in
Every once in awhile, I make to a jazz concert of attend a music festival
When I was in college, my jazz band went to the Montreaux Jazz festival in Switzerland.
I bet that was an awesome experience!
It really was.  Being around all those jazz greats and heavyweights was so exciting.
Who all did you get to see and meet?
There were so many people there.  My favorite person was Wynton Marsalis.
I have a CD of his music. He truly is a great musician.
He's a cool guy too.  He even took time to give some of the trumpet players some pointers and techniques.
Man that must have been a great experience.
He took a picture with me and some other musicians and even autographed my trumpet. Still have that trumpet to this day.
That's a once in a lifetime experience.  So envious of you.
Yeah, I will never forget that day.
That's a great story
