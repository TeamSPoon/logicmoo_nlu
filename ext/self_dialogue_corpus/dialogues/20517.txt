I just watched a interesting new Documentary.
Oh yeah, what's it called?
Room 237.
That sounds familiar..
Yeah, it's the room from The Shining.
Oh yeah! So what was it about then?
There's a lot of controversy around what the interpretation of the movie really is.
Really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, there's some people that believe lots of crazy stuff about it.
So did this documentary go in depth about that?
Yeah, it explained all of these theories with people who have been analyzing it for years.
What kind of theories did people suggest?
One about how Stanley Kubrick faked the moon landing, and another was about unfair persecution of Indians.
Wow that's pretty crazy. Do you believe any of them?
I'm not sure, I mean I figure they can't all be wrong.
I agree. I'll have to watch it.
The Shining is one of my favorites, so I wanted to hear what people had to say.
Yeah that's crazy, I really want to see it now.
You should if you get the chance.
Okay!
