I saw Kaleo live the other day and they were amazing.
Oh is that the rock band from Iceland?
Yup, you probably heard their single Way Down on TV.
Yeah I remember hearing it in an episode of Lucifer, how was it live?
That song was great but their whole set was spectacular.
Oh wow that's great to hear.
They played Thursday night at Firefly Music Festival and they were the best set of the day.
I can imagine hearing their blues-rock style live in a festival setting would be cool.
Oh it was, their solos and riffs were giving off great vibes.
If they come around locally I'd be down to check them out with you.
