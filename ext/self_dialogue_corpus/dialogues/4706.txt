Hey Steve, you seem to know a lot about baseball. Care to see how much you know?
What do you have in mind, Carl?
I want to test your knowledge of baseball.
Fine. Go ahead.
In the National League in the 1890s many seasons had 12 teams. Which team was boycotted by the other 11 teams, who refused to play games in that team's home ballpark?
The Cleveland Spiders. They were a pretty good team, too.
How did you know that?
Lucky guess. Next question.
Which National League manager was the first to win four World Series?
Walter Alston
That one was too easy.
Give me another one.
Okay.  Which National League umpire died of a heart attack on Opening Day in 1997?
I think that was John McSherry. He was the home plate umpire on Opening Day on April 1st in a game with the Reds hosting the Expos.
Who was the first player in baseball history to hit more than 25 home runs in a season?
That would be Ned Williamson, who played for the Chicago White Stockings in 1884. His 27 home runs, along with his team's 142 total home runs was a fluke.
Man. How do you know all of this?
My dad gave me a book on baseball trivia when I was ten. I have been studying it for nearly 10 years now.
You cheater! No wonder you know so much about baseball.
I didn't cheat.
