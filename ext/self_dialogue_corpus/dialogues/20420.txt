Did you see the Penguins of Madagascar?
I don't think I have yet.
It was released Nov 2014, and it has done very well.
What is the story line?
The Penguins  join forces with a chic undercover organization known as the Northern Wind against a villain.
The villain was some kind of sea creature, right?
Yes, Dr. Octavius Brine was an octopus.
Who stars in this one?
Tom McGrath, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Malkovich, and Christopher Knights plays in this one.
That is a fantastic crew.
Yes, so far the movie has grossed $373 million dollars.
Does Chris Miller play in this one too?
Yes, he plays as one of the penguins, Kowalski .
It is probably no longer onthe big screen any longer.
But it can be rented! I am going to rent it off of Netflix.
I love cartoons like that, they are comedy relief.
It helps me relax.
We could all use that on occasion.
You can come over and watch it with me if you want to.
I will bring lunch too!
