So, what are your favorite kind or movies?
I love sci-fi movies the most.
Same for me as well.
What franchise is your favorite?
I'm a Star Trek guy myself.
Star Trek is good, but Star Wars is better.
Star Wars is good, but those middle movies were kind of shaky if you ask me.
I know they weren't the strongest, but they had their good parts.
What good parts?
Seeing Anakin Skywalker grow up was kind of cool.
The kid in the first movie was OK, but Hayden Christensen was just so whiny.
I know what you mean, but the action in the second and third prequel movies were great.
I still think Star Trek is a better franchise.
Why is that?
There was always a lesson to be learned about humanity hidden in each episode.
Star Trek always felt a bit preachy to me.
I really identified with the characters when I was growing up, especially the next generation cast.
Original series with Kirk and Spock was my favorite.
Yeah, it's hard to vote against the original cast.
Overall, I like both franchises I guess.
