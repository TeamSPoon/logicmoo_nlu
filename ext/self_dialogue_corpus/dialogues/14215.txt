You know, I have to admit that I am really surprised that Lady Gaga can actually sing.
I know what you mean. I thought she was just a blonde publicity stunt.
I heard Bad Romance and it was good.
My favorite is The Edge of Glory.
That one is really really good too!  Did you see her on that awards show singing Julie Andrews songs?
I did!  I was really impressed!
I couldn't believe she had the talent! She also sings with Tony Bennett, right?
She does and she is very good!
I guess the girl has some vocal range after all!
It'll be interesting to see what songs she comes out with over the years!
