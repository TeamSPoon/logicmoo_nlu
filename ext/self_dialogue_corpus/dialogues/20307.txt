Hey did you see Passengers yet?
No I have not.
That bis a different movie for sure.
How?
It takes place in the future where a luxury space ship traveling to a planet many light years away, encounters an asteroid hit that is messing the ship up slowly.
So, what happens?
Well the ship wakes up guy that is an engineer, he is not of the crew though.
Why?
No one knows why, however he befriends a bartender, and wakes mup a hot girl because he was lonely.
Getting good.
Then the ship wakes up the Captain and he figures out why the ship is acting very strange.
What then?
Well the girl finds out that he woke her up and not an accident, she get really mad and the ship gets worse and the captain is dying.
OK, no what happens.
They finally figure out what to do and just about get killed trying to do it.
Any one die?
Just the Captain, and they figure out they have many years before they get to where they are going and will be gone by then.
How do they save the ship?
It turned out, they had replacement parts and they fixed it. How they do it is an adventure.
I gotta see that this evening.
