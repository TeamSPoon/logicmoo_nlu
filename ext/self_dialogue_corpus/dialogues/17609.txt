Mariah Carey is gorgeous.
You just come out the blue with that?
I'm watching the Hero video.
I like that song.
The girl can sing. And she's gorgeous.
You stupid.
I think I might have to add some more of her music to my library.
I know you got Dream Lover?
Yeah. That and a few other ones.
I like Mariah but I would choose Toni Braxton first.
Toni has a bit different sound.
Naw, they sound about the same.
No, Toni be singing from pain and emotion. Mariah just be blowing for that commercial money.
Naw. Shake it Off, you know she talking about some dude that did her dirty.
Probably Eminem.
Man Eminem ain't know what to do with that.
I know right. He was too busy trying to get her on video.
He made a wild song dissin both Mariah and Nick Canon.
That's 'cause Eminem is straight hood.
True that, but he can rap with the best of them though.
