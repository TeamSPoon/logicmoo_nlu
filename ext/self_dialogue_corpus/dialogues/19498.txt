What are still some of your favorite Kids movies?
Like Cartoons?
Cartoons or any other ones.
I still love Homeward Bound.
The one with the lost dogs?
Yes, I love any of those silly dog movies.
There was Air Bud too.
I think that one was so cute.
It was kind of fun to watch as an adult too.
The moral stayed true.
What is your favorite cartoon then?
Has to be Shrek.
That is not even really a kids show.
It is a kids show that adults can watch too.
Some of the jokes are made just for adults.
I love that they just keep making new ones and people just keep watching them.
Eddie Murphy was so funny as Donkey in that movie.
I think the whole story line of Fiona was just perfecy.
It showed that beauty is not every thing.
The whole reverse princess and the frog thing.
