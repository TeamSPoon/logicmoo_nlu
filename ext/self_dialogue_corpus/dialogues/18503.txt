I have been trying to get more into music.
Are you a fan of a particular genre.
That is the thing, I do not know.
What are some songs you like?
I like stuff that sounds live.
Maybe you would like country then.
I liked some stuff by Kenny Chesney.
Like what?
His song, "Living in Fast Forward".
That is a sort of hip country song.
I guess.
You might like some TIm Mcgraw music then.
What does he sing?
He has had dozens of hits.
Do he sing the one about the kid named Johnny?
Don't take the Girl. Yes, that is his.
I think I would like songs like that one too.
Then I would look into some of his older stuff.
Like what?
Living on Refried Dreams, was a big hit.
