Did you ever listen to Red and Blue EP by Lady Gaga?
No, I have not. What was it like?
This was one of her earlier albums in 2006.
What songs were on it that you like?
Wish you Were Here, Words, and Red and Blue are on that album. They are great songs.
I do have another one of her albums.
Really?  Which one do you have?
I have The Remix released in 2010.
Which songs do you like on that one?
Poker Face and Love Game are two great songs on that one that are my favorites.
Poker Face was so big, at one point you heard it on the radio constantly!
Did the album ever get any awards?
It was nominated for Billboard Music Award for Top Dance/Electronic Album.
What label was it released under?
Streamline was the label for that album.
That's pretty cool, almost every single album she creates gets some sort of award.
She is quite an amazing performer. I want to see her on stage.
We should book tickets to go see her this summer.
Let's check Ticketmaster for her concerts.
Sounds like a plan!
