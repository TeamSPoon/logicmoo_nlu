Did you see the new Marvel movie?
Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2? yeah!
What did you think?
I liked it, but it was not good as the first one
I thought so too. the movie seemed too busy
yeah it was good, but they had too many different story lines
They also kind of tried too hard to be funny
I agree the. The movie was funny, but some of the jokes seemed forced
The love story seemed forced too.
yeah the characters are clearly going to get together, but it became a will they wont they scenario
I really liked groot in the movie
yeah he was funny
Do you think Spiderman will be good?
I hope so. I love spiderman
Me too, but this is the third reboot
yes, but now marvel has control of the franchise and they make good movies
I liked the older ones but the sequels to spiderman are never that good
you are right this one maybe good but lets home the future ones are good too.
Is spiderman going to be in infinity wars?
I think so.
