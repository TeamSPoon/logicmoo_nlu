Have you seen the movie, "Bridesmaids"?
Yes, it's a good movie. Very funny.
It's one of my favorites. What types of movies are you into?
I like a little bit of everything. You?
Same here. Do you like horror movies?
I do, but they can't be gory. I am more into the suspense parts of the horror films.
So I'm guessing you didn't like any of the "Saw" films?
No, not at all. Way too gory for me.
Have you seen the movie, "Would you Rather?"
Yes. That movie was crazy. So crazy.
It really was. And the ending was intense.
I didn't think she'd shoot the guy. I really didn't.
I thought she would. She had been through so much already, what else was there to lose?
And when her brother committed suicide? Unbelievable.
I know! So crazy!
I had trouble watching the drowning in the barrel part.
He didn't even let her hold her breath first! He just pushed her right into it!
I know!
There were so many people, you would think they could have all escaped.
They tried. The other guys had weapons, though.
