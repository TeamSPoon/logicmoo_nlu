Do you think Roger Gidell is doing a good job?
No, I think he's pretty bad
He doesn't deal with any of the major issues of the NFL
Like concussions and cheating and money and crime?
Yes. He skirts them all
Do you think they need a new commisioner?
Yes. The NFL makes so much money and the players and fans get very little from it
They definitely shouldn't get tax breaks for stadiums
And the players should all get better pensions and medical care
They destroy their bodies for our entertainment
The least we can do is pay them a decent wage
I also really liked that Colin Kapernick stood up for black lives matter
Me too.
It was dissapointing how upset people got about that
I agree
His teammates seemed to stand by him.
His coach could have done more
The whole NFL could have done more
I'm glad he stood up for that though at least.
Yeah. It starts with one person
