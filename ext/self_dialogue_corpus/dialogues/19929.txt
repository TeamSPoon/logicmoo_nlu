Do you see any merit to making a music video anymore?
No there is no revenue to make them
Youtube charges for ads
Right and they get it, the artist does not release it to YouTube
Why doesnt an artist prevent the video from getting to YouTube unless they get a cut of the ad revenue?
I think thats a model that more musicians may take.
What about the artists that can afford to be like that.
They have to adapt just like everyone else.
But why do you think they dont do huge videos anymore?
There really is no reason to do them like that.
I dont think you are wrong I just dont think you are right either.
Sure it is, people dont watch MTV anymore.
Yeah but the artists werent getting money from them either.
I still think a YouTube video shouldnt be a mini movie.
YouTube or MTV, the mediums are essentially the same.
Except alot of musicians arent featured on MTV but can be YouTube stars.
Is that how most music people want to be remembered?
As long as they are talked about.
I think its a poor attitude
Its the direction of the industry
