What rap song do you know every single word to?
Oh man, Afroman's Palmdale. I would like sit at home and play that song for hours.
Never heard of it, all I know is that song Because I Got High.
Ha, that's a good one too. "I was gonna clean my room, but then I got high."
I think I for sure know every single lyric to Jay-Z's 99 Problems.
I think I do too! That song is such a classic, I feel like probably everyone has heard of it.
For real. But you know what? I don't really listen to that much Jay-Z.
Me neither actually. I think most of the time I hear him featured on one of Kanye's songs or something.
You're right. The last song I heard by him was Shining, but that was on DJ Khaled's new album and it featured Beyoncé.
Oh I will listen to anything featuring Beyoncé.
