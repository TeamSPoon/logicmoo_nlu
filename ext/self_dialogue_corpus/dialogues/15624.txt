What do you like to listen to when you exercise.
A bit of everything. Usually higher tempo, you?
I listen to a bit of everything, but there are certain things I wouldn't normally listen to that I listen to while workingout.
Like what?
Like I love hip hop, but I find a lot of "trap music" to be vulgar. However, the beats are so good for running, it really pumps me up.
I know what you mean! I'm a huge Chief Keef fan when I work out!
Ha! Ha! Him and Bobby Shmurda!
Right on, right on. I listen to a lot of stuff though: The Strokes, Kanye West, Daft Punk, YG, Prince, Black Kids.
Yeah, the music really motivates me to get out there and running. Do you change up your playlists?
Yes, I can do a playlist that gets light revisions for a couple of weeks. After that it's out with the old in with the new.
True, if you're working out a lot stuff tends to get old. Have you ever tried working out without music.
You know, I know it's supposed to be all good and meditative, but I can't get into it. I need something to distract me from the pain sometimes.
Yes, I need Kanye and Kendrick and Julian Casablancas to distract me!
Right? I worry I am blowing out my ears though.
Why's that?
I listen to my music with over the head earphones so loudly!
That sounds dangerous too if you're doing street running.
Yeah, sometimes I can't hear cars. It's a really bad habit, but it's hard to not pump up Yeezus all the way when you're hitting your fifth mile.
I get the impulse. Music is meant to be played loud.
It's much better loud. The hearing loss is the side effect of the pleasure.
