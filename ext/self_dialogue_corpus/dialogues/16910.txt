Did you see Come From Away on the Tonys?
I didn't watch them this year.
Oh, you totally missed out!
Which one is Come From Away?
It's the one about the people stranded in Newfoundland on 9/11.
Oh, right with the redirected planes?
Yeah. They performed their opening number and it was awesome!
Oh? What did you like about it?
Well first of all it was a total foot-stomper. The music was spot on for Newfoundland.
How so? I don't know the place.
Well think about it like this. Celtic-Canadian island music.
Ok so fiddles and beats and people with accents?
Exactly! One of the girls in the number actually pulls out a fiddle in the middle of the song.
That's great!
It really was. The song was totally ensemble driven too.
It didn't have a lead?
Well a couple of people sang more solo parts than the rest but it was a cast number. Lots of people soloed.
I heard that the whole show was like that.
It's definitely an ensemble show, and if the rest of the songs are anything like that one the energy is High!
Awesome! I'll have to look up the performance on Youtube.
