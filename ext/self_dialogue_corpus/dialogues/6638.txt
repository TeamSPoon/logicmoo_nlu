What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
I was really into The Little Mermaid. I thought Ariel was really cool.
I did too. I loved that she was strong willed and wanted to see the world on land.
Ursula the sea witch always made me nervous though.
I would always gets scared she was going to keep Ariel's voice even though I knew better.
Ha, well she didn't play fair. I would get so mad every time I watched it when she would change into a beautiful woman to charm the Prince.
Me too, but the worst was when she actually hypnotized him.
Exactly, she was quite the villain.
I loved Ariel's friends Flounder and Sebastian.
They were so cute.
