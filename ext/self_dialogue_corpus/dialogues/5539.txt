Did you see the really old Disney version of A Christmas Tale?
No, I'm sure I didn't. What was it like?
Well it was essentially just an update of the Dickens story, except with Disney characters.
Ah, let me guess, Scrooge was Scrooge McDuck?
Obviously. And Mickey was Bob Cratchit.
Was that were Scrooge McDuck originated?
I have to assume so. The character is clearly a great fan of money.
Well he had to come from somewhere. And Duck Tales was just terrific.
Yeah, he was my favourite Disney character growing up.
Mine too. I so wanted to be one of those kids.
