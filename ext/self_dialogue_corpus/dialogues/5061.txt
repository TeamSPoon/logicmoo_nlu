This has been an interesting season so far.
I know a lot of surprising teams doing well.
I know! I can't believe how well the Twins are doing!
They're in first place!
So many people picked them to finish last in the division.
I don't think they will be able to keep it up though.
You're probably right. I bet they fade away before August.
How about the Rockies?
They are surprising as well.
I think they might make the playoffs.
They look like they have a good team.
The NL West is always a tough division.
What's wrong with the Cubs?
I don't know. They're not looking like World Series contenders.
They have been disappointing to say the least.
They have so much talent too.
I know. I think they'll figure it out and be a contender.
Who knows? Maybe they're starting another World Series drought.
No way they go that long in between titles again.
I'm sure that's what fans were thinking in 1908 too.
