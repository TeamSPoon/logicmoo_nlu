Oh my God, it's October and they're playing CHRISTMAS MUSIC already.
Yeah, um, would be nice if they could wait until after Halloween if they can't wait until after Thanksgiving.
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Christmas music, all kinds, but it is to create a certain seasonal spirit and overkill kills the vibe.
Yeah, I don't love it really. I like a few songs from childhood, but mostly it gets on my nerves.
Yes but that's because you focus on the commercialism, right?
Exactly. Every commercial, every store, whole radio stations that change format for two months. Blech.
My great memories stretch back to the 60s when I was a kid. My gram liked us to sing all the old churchy ones.
What are the church ones?
Hark the Herald, We Three Kings, Little Town of Bethlehem, Joy to the World etc.
Oh I like those!
See? I'm not saying I don't love Mariah and few other modern ones, but I don't wanna hear the Back Street Boys reunite for Jingle Bells.
Hahaha yes and nobody needs Grandma to get run over by a reindeer or mommy to be kissing Santa Clause.
Absolutely. All that stuff is sooo gooofy and has nothing to do with my Christmas joy.
Can you still sing the churchy ones?
Yes. Gram was clever enough to leave us her stack of little blue song books she would pass out to us every Christmas.
Wow so it's tradition for you for real! Did you guys go caroling hahaha?
Don't laugh - I actually did go caroling when I was a kid, but not with my family - neighbor friends.
Is that like going wassailing? hahahaa
I don't think so. As far as I know, "wassail" is some sort of homemade alcoholic drink made of spices and honey.
Hahaha that would be a very Dean Martin Christmas.
