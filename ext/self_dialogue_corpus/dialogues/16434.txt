What kind of music are you partial to?
Well I really like a lot of different kinds of music except abstract jazz. I can tolerate it a little.
Yea I am with you on that one I like jazz but not that kind.
How about Jamiroquai do you like them?
Oh yes i do love some Jamiroquai and I love his goofy crazy hats!
It's really sad one of the guys died and  Jay Kay getting sick.
It's too bad they had to cancel their concert in Japan.
Yes I am sure there a lot of disappointed people. But you know everything happens for a reason. Japan is such an iffy place to be with the radiation.
Do you like Ween?
Chocolate and Cheese is a great album!
I completely agree. They sound so different on every song.
Do you like to watch The Voice? My husband and I are big fans.
It is a unique way to do a singing contest that's for sure.
I like how all the judges are so kind and supportive of their proteges.
The judges crack me up with their silliness.
Some of the judges I didn't like too much.
When they have the famous singers come on and help the contestants is when it gets really interesting.
Yea it's pretty cool to see who each one is going to bring on.
I was glad to see a country music singer didn't win this time.
It is kind of surprising since there are so many country fans.
