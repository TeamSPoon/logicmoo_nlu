What do you think of Madonna?
Oh I love her, The Material Girl is the best.
She sure is, what's your favorite track?
It's like trying to choose a favorite child honestly, but Papa Don't Preach probably.
Great choice, but I'm partial toward Like a Prayer.
That's also a great choice, guess I'm mostly a fan of her early 80's stuff.
Oh it was absolutely her best period overall, so many classics. Can't believe she's still going strong.
She has talent in spades, that certainly helps.
Agreed, she's also a surprisingly decent actress.
Absolutely, you won't confuse her with an award winner, but she's certainly more than adequate.
