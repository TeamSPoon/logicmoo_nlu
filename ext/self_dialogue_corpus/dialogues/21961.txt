My girlfriend and I just saw Wonder Woman.
Oh yeah, what did you think?
It was great, so much better than I thought it would be.
Really, that good?
Indeed, the story was captivating and the acting was solid.
Who all is in it again.
Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and is fantastic.
Yeah, she's pretty beautiful too. Who else?
Lets see, there's Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen and Chris Pine.
Isn't Pine the love interest?
Pretty much.
I bet he's all macho at first and doesn't like Wonder Woman, typical man.
Oh no, quite the contrary, he knows she can hold her own from the start.
Wow, that's cool.
Yeah, it was really smart, which you don't get so much with superhero movies.
No joke, just look at the Transformers movies.
I'd rather not, I'd go see Wonder Woman again though.
It's on my list now that's for sure.
Great date movie too if you want to bring your partner.
I might just do that, thanks for the info.
