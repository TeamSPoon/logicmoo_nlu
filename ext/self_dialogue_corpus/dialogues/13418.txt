Ewok or Jawa.
Ewoks. Jawas are thieves.
They look a lot cooler than  Ewoks, though.
I guess I agree with that. Ewoks are overall pretty annoying.
They literally kill Return of the Jedi.
I don't know if they kill it, but it's definitely the lesser film of the Original Trilogy.
I feel like it's the worst film in the series.
No. No way. That's episode II and all it's crappy love story.
George Lucas would have done really well to let someone else handle the writing of the prequels.
He should have let someone else direct them, too.
