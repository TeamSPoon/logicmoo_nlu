Did you watch the Warriors play last night?
Yes, it was an awesome game!
Even better to see it in person.
What?! You were there?
Yes! Up in the nosebleeds, but the atmosphere was awesome.
That's amazing, especially to be there for a playoff game.
Yeah. I always thought Steph, Klay, and KD were fun to watch on TV, but it is nothing like seeing it in person.
I can only imagine. I forgot, how many points did Steph end up with last night? I know he's been in a slump.
Well he broke out of that slump last night. He finished with 38.
That's right! And Klay had 42, right?
Yes, and add in Durant's 34 and you had quite the trifecta.
Getting Durant in the off-season was such a good move for them.
I know! I'd take him over Bogut hands down.
Yeah, I was wishy-washy on him. I miss Barbossa though.
He could come in at clutch moments, but I'd still take KD.
Oh, definitely. He really helps pick the team up if Klay and Steph are off.
He does. But on an "off" night you are still getting 28 points, I mean how bad can it be?
Very true! It looks like we may have a Warriors/Cavs rematch this year for the championship.
I hope so! That would be one heck of a series.
Yes! Let's hope the Warriors don't blow it again this year.
