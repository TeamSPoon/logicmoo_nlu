Have you been listening to any good music lately?
I have been listening to Little Mix.
Oh I love that group!
I know they are just the cutest!
I love their song Move.
Oh that song is very catchy.
I love when Perrie has her part in it.
I like that too and I like Jesy's part.
They are all so talented.
I also like the song Hair.
That is a good song for when you are done with a breakup.
Totally agreed.
Do you like the song called You Gotta Not?
Oh yeah from their recent album? That is good.
I also like their song power.
I do too.
They are a great group because they are about empowerment.
Exactly and that is just what we need.
Well anyways, I loved talking to you!
Same! Have a great day!
