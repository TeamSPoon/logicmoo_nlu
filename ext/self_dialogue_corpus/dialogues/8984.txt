How much do you like George Harrison?
Love George. Loved the Beatles.
George was a great rock guitar player.
He had a unique style I liked.
I thought something was one,of the most beautiful songs ever written.
Didn't Frank Sinatra say that?
He did,but I think he gave credit to Lennon and McCartney.
He did,but obviously George wrote it.
Beautiful song indeed.
It's been covered by a lot of rock bands over time.
