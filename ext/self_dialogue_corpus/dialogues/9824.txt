Man, what happened to real rap?
What do you mean real rap?
You know, like MC hammer and Vanilla Ice....
Ha! those were the days.
Oh and don't forget Will Smith.
Will was actually pretty decent.
Well, without hammer we would never have had Eminem so we owe him that.
We also Got SnoopDog
Lil Wayne
Don't forget Ice Cube
