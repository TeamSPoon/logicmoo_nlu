Do you think we are due for another Batman reboot?
Well, they have one with Gotham, kind of.
yeah, but that's early batman. It's about time for another adult Batman.
I don't know how they could possibly improve upon The Dark Knight.
I agree, those were pretty much the best Batman movies ever.
I've always been a little partial to Jim Carey as the riddler.
He did make an excellent villian.
He does so well with his body humor, that really makes his character.
Do you have a favorite Batman actor?
Anyone but Ben Affleck!
