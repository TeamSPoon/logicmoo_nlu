Hey, what do you think of Queen?
Queen as in.. the band?
Yea, the band
They are great!
I totally agree with you
Our music teacher had us perform queen
Oh, really?
Yea we did quite a few songs
That would have been awesome when  I was back in school!
The thing is we weren't allowed to do "Fat Bottomed GIrls"
Oh, why?
He said it was "degrading to women"
Haha!  So is every other song that is in the genre of "rap"!
I agree!  Too sensative
For sure, that song is great!
I totally agree!
What else did you do?
We are the Champions
Another awesome song - I'm jealous!
Yea it was great!
