What is your favorite old school Disney film?
The Little Mermaid. It was my favorite growing up.
I loved that film.
You "loved" it? What happened?
I still love the music and all, but the message is sort of not my style anymore.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a much bigger fan of the Disney films that show more women who are empowered and don't need a man.
Like Mulan and Moana?
Exactly. So The Little Mermaid has been overshadowed for me.
That makes a lot of sense.
