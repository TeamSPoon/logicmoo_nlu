How did you feel when Peter missed Mary Jane's play?
She overreacted with his not being there
He tried to get there, but was doing spiderman stuff
He did make it to one performance
Do you remember Harry's flowers compared to Peter's
Yeah, they were so much bigger!
I wonder if she would like Peter if he was not spiderman
I doubt it
She wouldn't have dated him if he wasn't
I like it when his secret identity is revealed
