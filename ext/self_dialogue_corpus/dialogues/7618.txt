I wish I had a fast broom.
So you could sweep faster?
No.  Imagine having a broom you could fly around on.
Like a witch?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about Harry's super deluxe broom he got as a gift.
Oh yeah, the one his uncle gave him.  Very cool.
I would fly everywhere on that thing.  It wouldn't be just for Quidditch.
I think it would be uncomfortable.
You think so?
Sure.  Have you ever sat on a broom before?
