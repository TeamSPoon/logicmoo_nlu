Which is your favorite of the three Toy Story movies?
My favorite is the original, for sure. I love the scenes when Buzz and Woody are at Sid's house.
I like the tea party scene when Buzz says "I am Mrs. Nesbitt!" Like he's brainwashed or something!
Which is your favorite of the three movies?
My favorite is Toy Story 2, because I like Jessie and Bullseye a lot.
I like all of the Al's Toy Barn scenes.
Even though Al was sort of a bad guy in the movie, his store did look like a lot of fun!
The song that Jessie sings is so sad, though!
It is. At least she ended up with a happy family that loves her.
Much better than being forced to ship off to a museum and never be played with!
