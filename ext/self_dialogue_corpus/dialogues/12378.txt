I was shocked last year when Carrie Fisher said she had an affair with Harrison Ford.
She did?  I never heard that.
Yes, supposedly while they were filming, they were having an affair.
Wow.  Well, they definitely had chemistry.  The sparks were almost visible.
Exactly.  And , it's Harrison Ford.  He's a hunk.
Poor Carrie Fisher.  I heard she was supposed to have a large part in the upcoming film.
Yeah, and her death was tragic - unexpected.  I wonder what they'll do now.
Who knows.  Maybe CGI?
The Star Wars franchise loves CGI, so that makes sense/
They definitely can't replace her.  Fans wouldn't support a new Leia.
