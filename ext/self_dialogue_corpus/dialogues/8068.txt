How do you feel about Cyndi Lauper?
She's the best!
I'm also a big fan, from girls just want to have fun, to true colors, great stuff.
She always seemed to be more individual as a person than a lot of other pop artist's.
I agree with that assessment, remember the sing she did for The Goonies?
Oh how could I ever forget that, had a really fun video as well.
Actually it's my favorite video ever made.
It's in my top five or so, is she still performing?
She is, opened for Cher a couple years back, didn't get to go though.
Too bad, would've been a really fun show to attend.
