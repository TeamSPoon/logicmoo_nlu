What kind of music are you into.
I like most everything...except Country.
Oh, yeah? Why not Country?
I hate all that twangy garbage.
Garbage?!
Sorry, didn't know you were a fan.
Probably my favorite genre.
Sorry.
It's OK. No offense. Lots of different genres for lots of different folks.
Thank you for being so gratious.
No worries. I'll bet there is a country bone in you somewhere.
Doubt it.
Johnny Cash?
Oh! Ya got me!
I knew it.
Forgot about Johnny.
Did you hear his cover of that Nine Inch Nails song?
Hurt?
Yeah.
That was pretty alright.
