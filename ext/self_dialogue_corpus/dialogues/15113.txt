So, Groundhog Day is in the news these days.
Yes, they have made it into a Broadway musical.
It has a good premise that would be suited to becoming a play.
I wonder if Bill Murray has seen it?
Well he is a difficult person to follow in that role.  He did a great job.
Yes, to have to reenact the same scenes over and over again.
Interesting fact, it didn't do too well at box office when it was first released.
I wonder why.  It has all the elements to be a classic.
Yes, especially when "I got you Babe" is played over and over!
Yes, and Andie MacDowell.  I love her in all her movies.
