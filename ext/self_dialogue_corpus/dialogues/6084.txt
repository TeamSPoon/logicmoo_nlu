You saw the live action Beauty and the Beast, right?
Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago. It was really good. Why?
I was wondering how you felt it held up to the original cartoon version?
I thought it was a perfect copy of the original! The songs were so beautiful and the characters were all cast perfectly.
Really? It was that good?
Oh, absolutely. Beauty and the Beast was my favorite Disney movie as a kid, and I thought the live action version was amazing.
Wow! And Emma Watson portrayed a good Belle?
She made the perfect Belle!
She's one of my favorite actresses, so I didn't want to disappoint myself if I didn't like the movie.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
