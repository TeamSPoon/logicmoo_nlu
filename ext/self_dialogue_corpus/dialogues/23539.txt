I just feel like asking, but are you a fan of the Friday film series?
You mean Friday the 13th, like with Jason Voorhees?
No, I mean the Friday films, with Ice Cube.
You know, I'm not sure I've seen those before.
Oh, well I guess there's no point in me asking.
It's fine. You can tell me about them if you'd like.
Alright, then. Basically it's about a guy living in a ghetto neighborhood in Southern California that experiences conflicts particularly on Friday.
The series, or just one movie?
Basically the whole series. The first one revolves around Ice Cube and Chris Tucker's characters of Craig and Smokey dealing with a neighborhood bully named Deebo, who's played by Tommy Lister Jr.
Is it funny at all?
Yes, it is. the whole series is of comedy movies.
Alright then. Tell me more.
The second one takes place some time later, and revolves around Craig and his cousin Day Day, who's played by Mike Epps, dealing with a family of thugs that live across the street from them.
Sounds pretty similar to the first one.
Yeah, the three of them are pretty similar. The third and last one is about Craig and Day Day trying to collect rent money after being robbed by "Santa Claus" on Christmas Eve.
Now that just sounds silly.
It is, but trust me. They're pretty funny.
Are there any other actors in those movies that I might recognize.
Off the top of my head, I know that John Witherspoon, Terry Crews, Nia Long, and Clifton Powell have all starred in at least one of the movies in the series.
Well, if I find one of those movies on Netflix or anywhere for streaming, I'll give it a watch.
