Zombie land is perfect
I think it is okay
Just okay?
It does the comedy zomble thing well
It is perfect at it
Nah
Why do you say that
Because i think it lacks in some areas
But what is it lacking
Sometimes it is repetitive
How though
Because it is
Well then
Plus i think other movies did it better
What ones
Shaun of the dead
That was okay i guess
Are you kidding especially the end with the chained up zombie
I do not recall that scene
Wow
