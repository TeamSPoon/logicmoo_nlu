I saw a strange movie the other night.
What was it called?
Americathon. It starred John Ritter and Harvey Korman.
Wow that must be over 30 years old.
Yes I think it was made in the late 70;s.
What was it about.
Basically that the US was going bankrupt and needed to borrow money from someone to save it.
Ok, sounds interesting, I guess.
Well a Native American gives a loan of 400 billion dollars but wants it paid back in 30 days.
Wow, how ironic.
So they come up with an idea to have a telethon to save the country. There would be acts and people could donate money.
Ha, that sounds really weird.
It was weird. It ends up that people were so poor that they were all living in their cars and either biked or ran to work.
They acted like that was normal?
Yeah. They could even watch tv in their cars which was funny since they were so poor.
What was the telethon like.
The acts were horrible. Lots of ventriloquists and singers.
I guess people nowadays would find it dull?
It was not a good movie really. It was interesting in it's concept but...
It kind of stunk I guess is the best way to put it.
