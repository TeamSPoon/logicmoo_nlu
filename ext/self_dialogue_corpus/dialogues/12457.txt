One of my favorite parts of Star Wars is when Luke goes to Dagobah to train with Yoda.
That is a great little storyline!
I always thought Yoda was kind of a perfect teacher. He's patient but firm.
He does talk really weirdly though.
I sort of wondered if he was supposed to be, like, a mountaintop guru from a kung-fu movie.
I can see that. That's probably the trope they were going for.
Yeah, but even so, I think it turned out really well.
If only Luke had actually listened to him!
I know. But it ended up being good for the story!
I guess so.
