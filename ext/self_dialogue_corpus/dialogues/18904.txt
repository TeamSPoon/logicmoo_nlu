I like music from the romantic period.
What's that?
Its the style that followed classical.
It sounds like classical, doesn't it.
Yes. To the untrained ear, they sound very similar.
What's the difference then?
Romantic period music used more extended chord structures, like major 7ths and 11's
I get you.
One of the reasons people think the two periods are the same is Beethoven.
I like Beethoven.
His music bridged the two styles, even though it is considered classical by most.
So Beethoven used complex chords?
Yes, but it was not thematic, it was only in passing.
I've got some favorites that I don't know if they are classical or what.
Tell me some composers or compositions and I will try to categorize them for you
Bach.
Okay, he belonged to neither. His music was of the baroque style.
That was before Beethoven, I believe.
Yes. Liszt for example, was romantic.
Like the Hungarian Rhapsodies which I love.
