Okay, I have a tough question for you about music.
Alright, what is that?
What is your favorite insturnment, I know you play a lot.
I do play quite a few, but I think my favorite is the trumpet.
I love the old big band music where someone is just wailing on a trumpet.
And that is why I like it!
I really like how Michael Buble and a few other people are bringing more music back from that era.
So do I. I feel like our generation has got very far from what music really is.
I agree. Half of the "music" these days is just a computer doing sound effects.
I agree, I miss the old big bands. They were so talented!
Like Benny Goodman, I know that is reaching back around 80 years. But man, that was some good music.
You truly had to be talented back in the day. It took hard work.
Or think of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, or Nat King Cole. They were incredibly talented and had to work very hard.
I feel old saying this, but they just don't make music like they used to.
That is true. Though one thing I have really gotten into is accapella.
I enjoy some modern accapella groups as well. They really have to work at it and it is pure vocal music.
Do you listen to Straight No Chaser?
I do, they are fantastic. I also like Pentatonix.
You know who does a couple good covers of older songs that really suprises me? Adam Levine.
I haven't heard them. I guess I will have to check them out.
