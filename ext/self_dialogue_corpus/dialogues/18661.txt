I can't stop listening to the new Migos album.
Really? I can't stand them.
I love their music. It's so catchy and it gets me pumped up.
I've never been a fan, and frankly I don't get why they're popular.
They're popular because their music is fun and easy to listen to.
Sure, but you can't even understand a word they are saying.
You don't need to. It's about the vibe of the music and how it makes you feel.
Personally, I think artists like them are an embarrassment to rap and hip-hop.
How? If people enjoy listening to them then they are doing something right.
Popularity in music doesn't equal quality. Rap is a genre that started from poetry. Meaningless lyrics completely abandons the genre's roots.
You just haven't caught up with the times. Hip-hop is different now.
Just because it's different doesn't mean it's better than it was. There are so many terrible famous rappers.
Like who? Migos is only one group.
Future, 21 Savage, Young Thug, just to name a few.
You have to admit that they make some catchy music.
I do admit that. However, for my personal taste, even catchy music isn't enjoyable if the lyrics are unbearable.
Well, some people don't mind just listening and not thinking about what every line means.
I suppose. I guess many people would rather just listen to what sounds good and move on.
That's what I do. I listen to music to enjoy it, and I enjoy listening to Migos.
Fair enough. I don't ever think I will, though.
