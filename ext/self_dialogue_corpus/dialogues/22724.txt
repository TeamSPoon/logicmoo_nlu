Did you watch the Kong movie from the early 2000s?
I think so.
It's the one where they go to his island capture him bring him back and try to show him off to the world.
Yeah I remember it now.
I think it was alright but it was missing something.
Yeah I think it was the human element.
Why do you say that?
I always took him as this character that is very related to humans in the sense of his thought process and less of an animal.
That's a good point.
Yeah but I liked the movie.
Remember the scene at the end when he's on top of the building.
Yeah the one when he's holding the girl hostage.
Well he loved the girl I think he was just trying to protect her.
That's a fair point of view.
I can't believe they shot at him with planes.
They had to do something.
Either way I loved the movie.
It was a little different than you'd expect from that type of movie.
Yeah it was solid so I give it a 4 out of 5 you?
4 out of 5 as well.
