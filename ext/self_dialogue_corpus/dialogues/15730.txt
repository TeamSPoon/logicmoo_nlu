This party is boring. Put on some tunes!
What do you suggest?
How about some electronic music?
Oooo, that could be fun. Electro coming up!
This stuff is weird. What band is this?
Its a pretty popular guy call deadmau5.
I've heard of him, but this is definitely unlike his regular music. Very ambient.
Yeah, he tends to make things all over the spectrum.
I can groove to this though. It makes a great atmospheric.
I'm glad you like it!
The party is way better with music.
Yeah, anything to help fill those awkward silences, right?
Could you imagine going to a swanky club and just hearing voices?
That would be really weird.
All that dead air and alcohol, and nothing to dance to.
What a shame.
Turn it up!
Don't mind if I do.
I like my music loud.
Good thing I have loud speakers!
