Hey, do you like vampire movies?
I like vampire slayer stuff, like BUFFY!
Well, that's a show, but I do like Buffy.
Still the answer is yes....as long as you don't mean Twilight.
oh my god, NO! I mean like John Carpenter's vampires, or Let the Right one in.
You know there's a version of Let the Right One in with english speaking actors, right?
NO WAY!
yeah, it's called Let Me In.
I have got to watch that! Queen of the Damned is my other favorite.
Me too! It has an amazing soundtrack.
Since I know you like vampire tv shows; have you seen American Horror Story; Hotel?
YES! although I was sad that Jessica Lange was not in that season.
Yeah that was pretty crappy. The sexy creepiness of Lady Gaga reminded me of the Bordello of Blood movie,  I think it was a tales from the crypt special, It scared me more than any other movie I saw as a kid.
I wish that there were more tales from the crypt movies.
There is a whole bunch of them actually, they were pretty successful in the 90's.
I miss 80's 90's horror. Child's play and Nightmare on elm street were amazing.
They were the epitome of horror back then. Especially nightmare on elm street.
People didn't sleep for days, thinking Freddie was gonna get them in their sleep.
I know it gave childhood me nightmares for weeks.
Yeah, my mom was mad at other family members for letting me watch it.
