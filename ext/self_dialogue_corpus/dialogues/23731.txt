I watched The Mighty Ducks the other day.
That's pretty old.
I've seen it before but I watched it on cable.
It's a good one.
Yeah. It's pretty funny.
What's the coaches name?
He's played by Emilio Estevez.
Pretty good actor.
Yep. He's a rich lawyer that changes his ways.
The kids help him do it.
Exactly. They show him what's important.
The kids are pretty good at hockey.
Yes. They get better in the movie.
Oh yeah. They started out bad.
They trained and practiced.
Don't they beat the good team at the end?
Yes. They beat the Hawks.
That's right.
It's a feel good story.
Sure is.
