Hey Did you see the new Wonder woman movie?
Yes! It was great!
I thought it was just like watching the original wonder woman.
Did you hear the movie was banned in some countries?
No I didnt hear that.
Did you also hear that the actress who played wonder woman only got paid $300,000?
What? That is a lot of money! What do you mean ONLY got paid?! LOL
LOL nevermind! Which was your favorite scene?
I liked when Wonder woman teamed up with the guy who plays Captain Kirk in star trek.
Oh you mean Chris Pine?

What I didnt understand was why they had to tie it back with Bruce wayne?
Yeah I didnt really understand what was the connection between Wonder woman and Batman
