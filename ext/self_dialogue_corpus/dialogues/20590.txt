What was your favorite Fast and the Furious movie?
Oh man, that's a tough one.  How many have they made now?
I think the one that came out earlier in the spring was number eight.
Can't believe there's been that many now.
So going back to my question, what's your favorite?
I would probably say Fast Five.  I thought that was the best setup to moving the series to be one not dependent on street racing.
I get that.  It was definitely a great example of a heist movie.
It also had the best villain of the series.
I wouldn't agree with that.  He was good, but not better than some of the other ones.
What did you think of the ending?
Where they were going through the streets with the bank vault?
Yep - pretty crazy, right?
Absolutely nuts.  Not exactly realistic, but awesome to see.
There's no way those cars could drag that heavy thing like a ragdoll.
The series isn't exactly known for being realistic though.
True.  They all should have died about 50 times by now.
They could have just ended the series on that high note, don't you think?
Yeah, they all had riches, were basically free of the authorities likely finding them.
In the end, it made too much money so they had to make more.
Which I'm fine with.  Why change what's working?
