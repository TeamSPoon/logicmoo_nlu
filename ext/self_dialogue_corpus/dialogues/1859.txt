so who is your favorite team?
my favorite is the Houston Texans.
i used to be a fan until Andre Johnson left the team.
he was a huge member of the team so i get that. who do you follow now?
now i follow the Oakland Raiders since i moved to California.
the Raiders are huge in Houston too so i can get that switch.
i remember when i lived in Houston seeing tons of sports bars either having Texans or Raiders gear on the wall. so it helped that i allready knew some names.
well the owner Mark Davis definitely knows what he is doing with marketing the team outside of states.
my favorite is when they both played eachother in Mexico City. that was a great game.
i was disappointed by the Texans losing but in the end it was exciting.
hopefully next season they do something as cool as playing in Mexico.
i hope they go play in Europe, NFL there would kill i think.
as long as they do some more huge teams like the Patriots.
vs Indianapolis or something.
something to make a tense game. like another Texans vs Dallas game.
oh yeah that was a super tense game.
well the rivalry made it so much better.
exactly. NFL needs more rivals.
as long as they are natural.
exactly. if it's not coming from the teams and fans it won't be the same.
