Which genre of music do you think has been the most successful?
Definitely pop.
I don't know.  I think country might have eclipsed it.
It is at least giving it a good run for it's money.
Country was huge in the 90s.  There were country bars on every corner.
Line dancing was the thing to do then.
Garth brooks was the biggest star at the time.
I think people are tired of it though and they have come back to pop.
Country is more like a phase that people go thru.
I went thru a country phase in the 90s.
It was the it thing to do at the time.
Now no one listens to country anymore.
Yes the country bars have turned into hot yoga studios.
Ha! Yes you are right.
You would think that since everyone has a youtube account now we would have a lot of pop stars.
I think that people who get famous because of a viral video are short lived.
Those are one hit wonders for sure.
Yes, there is a lot of talent out there though.
Most people won't make it though without the marketing expertise of the record labels.
That's true.  But everything is so accessible now it won't be long before everyone is a marketing expert.
