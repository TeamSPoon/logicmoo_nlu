Have you seen the original Blade Runner?
Yes, many times. It's one of my all time favorite movies.
Really? I found it very slow and boring.
Slow and boring? It's deliberate. There's a difference. Regardless, you have to admit the special FX are amazing.
Yes, the movie does look beautiful. Ridley Scott and his team created such a believable futuristic world.
Did you know that Deckard is a replicant?
What? No way. Why do yo think.
Remember when he had the dream about the unicorn?
Yeah, I remember. But why does that make him a replicant.
Well, at the end, do you remember the origami figure Gaff left at Deckard's apartment?
A unicorn, right?
Yeah. So how would Gaff know what Deckard's dreams are unless he knew that they were implanted, as they would be in a replicant.
Whoah. Never thought about that.
It's another reason I love the movie so much. So many layers. But make sure you're watching the final cut of the final and not the theatrical release.
Yeah, I've seen the theatrical release and it is not the same.
Way more overt in it's themes -- and I don't even think it has the unicorn dream, which sort of destroys the whole film.
Do you prefer the Final Cut or the Director's Cut?
The Final Cut for sure. It's the best version of the film. And make sure to watch Dangerous Days, if you get a chance.
What's that?
It's a 4 or 5 part documentary about the making of Blade Runner. A must-see.
