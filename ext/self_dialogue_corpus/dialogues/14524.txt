Boy the Celtics just weren't ready for the Cavs
The Cavs just have too much firepower
Yeah, as much as I love Isiah Thomas, he doesn't have enough help
I mean the Cavs are just bullying them
I don't think the Cavs ever took the Celtics seriously
I don't believe they did either.
Watching these games feels like a scrimmage
I mean they were beating this team by 41 points at one time
On their home court!
Exactly! This seems like practice for the Cavs
So that they can get ready for the real series against the Warriors
I agree with you. This was fine tuning for the Cavs
That's why the Celtics should have made some deals during the trade deadline.
Yeah if they could have added another star, it could've made a difference
But for now they are over matched and overwhelmed.
For sure. I mean they have had a great season
Especially considering the tragedy that Isiah Thomas went through.
I don't know how he played so well after his sister died.
Yeah kudos goes out to him. He is one tough cookie.
I guess you have to be tough when you are only about 5 feet and 9 inches.
