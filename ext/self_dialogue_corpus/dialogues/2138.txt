Hi there.
Hey.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah I'm a fan.  You?
Yeah I like it as well.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Odell Beckham.
He's good, but a little too cocky for me.
He's just a wide receiver that's how they are.  He's not as bad as TO was.
TO used to crack me up.
That popcorn one was the best for me.
Remember when he had a cellphone in his sock and took it out.
Yeah that was great.
Didn't he autograph something during a game as well?
Yeah he had a sharpie in his sock and signed something.
That guy is great.
Who's your favorite player?
I like Drew Brees a lot.
I can respect that.
Yeah.
