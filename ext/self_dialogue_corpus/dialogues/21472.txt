Have you seen the new Pirates of the Carribean movie?
No! Have you?
I just did, I loved it!
Oh man, I want to see it. Is it a lot like the other ones?
Yeah, the style is the same and Johnny Depp is in it. He is so good at physical comedy, he cracks me up.
Oh I know, you gotta love Captain Jack Sparrow.
Yeah, and Orlando Bloom is in it, but only at the beginning and the end. His son is one of the main characters.
Oh really? Was he good?
Kinda. I feel like his character needs to develop more. He wasn't as strong a character as Will Turner.
Do you think there will be more?
I do ... but I don't want to give too much away. If you watch it you have to stay till the end of the credits.
Oh one of those huh? Okay thanks for the tip! Did any of the other characters come back?
Captain Barbosa was back, and some of the other pirates from the other movies, but I can't remember the character's names.
No Elizabeth?
She does make a little appearance.
Oh nice. Watching those movies always makes me want to go to Disneyland.
Totally! I love it.
Me too. Do you want to go with me?
To the movies or to Disneyland?
Well for now we'll have to settle for the movies.
