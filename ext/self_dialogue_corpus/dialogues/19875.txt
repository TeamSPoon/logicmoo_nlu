Heard any good music lately?
Yeah i have been listening to Motley Crue.
Oh I love their music.
Yeah isnt rock the best?
I totally agree.
I just saw kiss in concert recently.
Oh how was that?
It was fantastic.
We should go together sometime.
That sounds like a plan.
Anyways what other music do you like?
I like maroon five.
Oh me too.
But i like their older music.
Same with me.
Their new music is not as good except for animals.
I totally agree on that. I still love songs about Jane.
I want to see them in concert.
