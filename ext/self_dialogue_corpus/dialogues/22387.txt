Did you hear that they're making a new verison of the movie The Lion King?
Yes, it's been on Broadway for a long while now.
No, I don't mean the Broadway play. I mean they're making a whole new movie.
Really? Why?? That movie is a classic! It doesn't need to be redone.
I know what you're thinking - whenever they remake movies the new version is never quite as good.
That is Exactly what I was thinking..
I think this one should be good though. It's going to be different.
Different in what way? They're changing the storyline?
No, it's not going to be a cartoon. It's going to be with actors, and they have some really good actors on board.
That sounds interesting then. I went to see a similar remake last month of Beauty And The Beast.
How was it? I was thinking about going to see it.
It was nice. My kids really enjoyed it even though they had never seen the original cartoon version.
Maybe I will take my kids to see it as well. They didn't seem too interested, but I'll drag them there with me since now I want to see it
Do you take your kids to the movies often?
Fairly often. You know kids these days love TV and movies.
I take my kids only once a month. We tend to see family comedies more than animated movies.
The next time you're planning to take your children to the movies please let me know. Maybe we can join up and have one big outing.
Oh that would be great! Have you already taken yours to see Guardians of the Galalxy?
Is it PG rated?
Yes it is, so we can all go.
