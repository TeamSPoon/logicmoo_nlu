What is your favorite movie with Burt Reynolds?
Take a guess what my favorite movie with him is.
Is it Smokey and the Bandit?
Yes of course it is!
That is my favorite with Burt Reynolds as well.
It is just such a suspenseful movie. They are being chased by police almost the whole time.
I agree that there is never a boring moment in that movie.
Sally Field is also great in that movie.
She and Burt make a great pair as they evade police.
Yeah I enjoyed when she took over the wheel that part was funny.
Did you like Smokey and the Bandit 2 or 3?
I liked the second one and sort of liked the third one.
Yeah they were definitely not bad movies.
I just don't think they were absolutely necessary. The first movie had a great ending.
I know it was strange how the ending of the first movie is so happy then the beginning of the second one is depressing.
I read that they tried to hard to make the second movie reflect the real world.
Yeah Burt and Sally broke up in real life so they couldn't be close in the second movie.
I think this was unfair to the fans of Smokey and The Bandit!
I agree we didn't need the movie to reflect real life! Movies are supposed to be an escape from the real world.
At least we will always have Smokey and the Bandit 1 and it will always be great.
