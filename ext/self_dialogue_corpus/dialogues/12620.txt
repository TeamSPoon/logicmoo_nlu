Could you see Darth Vader ever making a return?
The episode would have to come between 3 and 4 for that to happen.
You dont think they could revisit the 4, 5, and 6 episodes and maybe do something?
No I think that story has already been told.
I just think James Earl Jones played an awesome villain.
He did and his voice was perfect.
I just wish Kylo Ren could do the same.
He can but we have to keep an open mind.
I think he needs to start a more murderous rampage
Yeah you need the brutal ways of an evil empire
