Who's your favorite female singer?
Bjork.
She's amazing. Have you see her in concert?
Yes! At the Hollywood Palladium on the Biophilia tour.
How was that?
It was amazing. It was the first time I've seen her live.
I have never seen her live. What's your fave album of hers?
Hm, I think I really like Post the best. How about you?
I like Vespertine a lot.
Oh yeah! That's a great one, it's when she started to use choirs I think.
Yeah I like it better then her more electronic stuff I guess.
Whose your favorite female artist?
The first person I thought of was Tori Amos.
Haha! Is she even making music still?
Yes, she is. I havent heard anything recent though.
Yeah, I think she was really good in the 90s. Boys for Pele is a classic.
Under the Pink is my favorite.
Isnt Trent Reznor on that too?
Yeah, he sings back up vocals on Past the Mission.
That's right. There are a lot of good songs on that album, especially God.
