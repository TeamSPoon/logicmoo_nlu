Have you seen Moana yet?
Yeah it just came out on Netflix.
Its a great movie.
Yeah the grandma was the coolest.
I love that Disney is starting to add so much culture to their movies.
And woman empowerment.
I heard they actually went to a village in Hawaii to do research for the movie.
Thats great.
It woukd be so great to be so in tune with nature
I love how much they respect the water.
