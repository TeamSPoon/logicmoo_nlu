What do you think of the upcoming football season?
I think it's gonna be pretty exciting.
What are you most excited about?
Well, since I'm a 49ers fan, I'm curious to see how their revamped coaching staffe and personel will do.
Yeah, I suppose. But aren't they still rebuilding?
Yeah, but I think they might actually be improved regardless. It'll be cool to see if they made some good steps forward.
Who do you think will make it out of the NFC?
I still think the Atlanta Falcons are the best team in the NFC.
So you don't think the Cowboys have a shot?
No way. Teams have had an off season to watch tape on Dak Prescott now.
That is true. Who do you think is coming out of the AFC?
I think it's actually gonna be surprising this year. I can totally see the Raiders going to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, they were pretty good last year. And who knows what would have happened had Carr not gotten hurt.
Exactly. I think that it's possible that they go all the way to the Super Bowl.
Do you think they could beat the Falcons?
Yeah, I do. Who do you think is winning the Super Bowl?
I think that the Atlanta Falcons will probably win it.
That's a safe bet to take I suppose. Do you want to bet on it.
I don't bet. I'm just eager for the season to start since I love football.
Yeah, me too. I can't wait for it.
