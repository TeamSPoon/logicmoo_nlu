Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
I think it's Aaron Rodgers, but I think Tom Brady and his superbowl wins also enter the conversation.
Aaron Rodgers is so talented, but it's hard to deny the handful of rings that Tom has.
I do think superbowl rings matter, but based on pure stats, Aaron Rodgers is unlike anyone who has played the game.
I just think his argument would be stronger with more than one superbowl win.
Yeah, Mike McCarthy needs to get Rodgers another ring or two and then maybe the haters will be a little less quick to judge him.
Even though I think Tom might be my pick for the best, he cannot do most of the things Aaron does.
Tom is definately not quick on his feet.
Of course he isn't, he is several years older than Aaron and never was much of a runner in the first place.
That's why the Bill is a genius, he always plays to Tom's strengths.
McCarthy could take a page or two out of his book with Aaron.
Mike McCarthy relies too much on Aaron's athleticism and not enough on game plan.
Yeah, Aaron has had a lot of close calls that could've been rings if his team was better.
Every year, Aaron puts out a crazy amount of effort, only for them to lose in crazy championship games!
His hail mary in that Arizona playoff game made jump out of my chair in disbelief.
It was kind of like that Rodgers to Rodgers one in Detroit, but with a little more on the line.
Wasn't that Detroit hail mary for the division title though or seeding purposes?
It was. We ended up improving our record and seeding, but then lost to  Arizona that year in the playoffs.
With Aaron Rodgers though, the Packers are never really out of the running, but I could say the same about Tom.
I think that's partially true, although plug another quarterback in for Tom in that system and I think the Patriots will still be successful.
