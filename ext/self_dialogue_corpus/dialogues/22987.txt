Which do you like better, Kill Bill 1 or 2?
Honestly, I think of them as the same movie
Yeah it was intended that way but since they got split up, which do you like more?
I have no idea.  It's just one long movie.
Okay, I like the first one the best.
Why?
It's got more action and it's really exciting.  In the second, there's just a lot of talking.
How in the heck do you figure that?  She defeated Elle after kicking her butt and killed Bill...
But Uma Thurman's character didn't really do much in that part.  Elle killed Budd and Pei Mei, Budd buried the Bride and she just blinded Elle.
But she did kill Bill.
Eh, not sure he didn't just let her kill him.
Oh yeah, that's why he shot her with the truth serum gun
He just did that to make sure she told him the truth about why she left him.
Their whole relationship was weird.  I mean they love each other then they hate each other and then they get mushy at the end.
Do you think he slept with all those women that worked for him?
Duh.  They didn't adore him for tips or his boyish good looks.
You know you would have thought if he was going to be screwing around with all of the he would have gotten a vasectomy or something.
That's true.  You wouldn't think he would want all those women killing people for him with a pregnant belly getting in the way
Hmm... how's this for a movie?  A group of female assassins.. all pregnant at the same time.
What would you call it.. Prego By Bill?
