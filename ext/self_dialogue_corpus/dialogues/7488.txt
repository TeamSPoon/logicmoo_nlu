I just watched the last two Harry Potter movies.
Oh my gosh! What did you think!?
I was really pleased with it. I'm glad they split it into two parts to cover more, since the book was so long.
Yeah, it's nice now that we can watch them together, but it was awful when part one had come out and part two hadn't yet!
Did you see them in theaters?
I saw part one on opening night, but I saw part two in theaters a few weeks after it came out.
What was it like when Dobby died at the end of part one?
The whole theater was crying! He was such a loved character, and opening night was full of die hard fans.
Man, I wished I hadn't missed that!
It was something!
