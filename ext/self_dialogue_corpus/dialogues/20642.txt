I made a big mistake choosing a movie to watch last night.
What's that?
I took my ten year old son to watch Sausage Party.
Sausage Party! Oh no.. that movie is NOT for children!
Yeah, tell me something I don't know. I found that out too late!
How far into the movie did you figure out that it wasn't for kids?
Oh about the time they introduced the sexy looking hotdog bun.
That's funny but sort of horrible. Did you end up leaving the theater?
No way! Do you know how much movie tickets cost these days? I got my money's worth.
Your wife must have been pretty mad at you.
Yeah, she's still not talking to me. Luckily my son didn't understand what was going on anyway. He just liked the funny looking talking produce.
I actually thought it was a really funny movie. I love the character that's named after the Arab bread, Lavash.
He was hilarious! I also love the wise old piece of gum in the wheelchair that's supposed to be Stephen Hawking.
Seth Rogan is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood these days.
He really is, I love most of his movies. I should have guessed this one would be an irreverant cartoon.
Yeah it was pretty irreverant. Shocking, really.
At least at the end all the food is happy and celebrating. My son liked that.
What a feel good ending.
Kind of made me hungry too. What do you say we throw some hot dogs on the grill?
I'm in!
