So how are you doing this evening?
I am doing good, just counting down the days until football season!
I know what you mean there, I can not wait!
Who do you think will be the best team in the NFL this year?
That is a tough call. I would have to say the Patriots.
Do you think they will repeat?
I really do, they are so good year after year.
That is a smoothly ran organization from top to bottom.
It really is, and that is why you see the results from them on the field every season.
I have a good feeling about the Falcons this year, I think they might get back to the Superbowl for the second straight year.
I still can not believe they let that huge lead they had over the Patriots get away this past Superbowl!
I know, how many points were they up exactly?
They were actually leading by twenty five points in the third quarter!
Wow, that has to be considered the best comeback in NFL history.
It is the best one that I have ever seen without a doubt.
I feel that Matt Ryan will get another shot at it though.
I actually would not mind seeing a Patriot and Falcons rematch for this upcoming Superbowl.
Me either, I bet it would be another classic if those two squared off again.
I feel that the Falcons will be contenders as long as they have Ryan at quarterback, and Julio Jones at receiver.
Yea, Jones is the best receiver in football as far as I am concerned.
