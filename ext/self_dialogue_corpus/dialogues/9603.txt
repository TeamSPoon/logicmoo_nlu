I honestly feel like Eminem is a walking symbol of drama.
Why do you say that?
He's always writing about how much he loves his daughters, but goes off to abuse his wife and take sleeping pills.
Are you aware that he's been sober for a long time now?
What? When did that happen?
He has a song called "Not Afraid" where he tells all of his fans how thankful he is for them, and tells them that he vows to break that dangerous lifestyle.
Wow. That's admirable.
You're probably thinking about his earlier work.
Maybe. I'm just so used to him being profane and lambasting his wife and mother.
That's all part of his "Slim Shady" persona.
