Hey have you seen any good space movies lately
No not really not many people are into outer space stuff
I seen this good space movie about a month ago called life have you heard of it
I think I heard of is that a movie where they brought back some kind of species from Mars and it took over Earth or something
That's the one where they tried to wake up the little microorganism and every time ate somebody it got bigger and bigger
Yeah that was pretty scary one and it wasn't really much space to show
Another good one is Stargate actually came out with a movie you know it started as a TV series
I think I seen that one is that the one about the gods or something
Yeah the Egyptian gods and how rod and by trying to take over the world
Yeah I seen that when I was pretty good where you had to walk through the water gates to go to different planets
