Hey, who is your favorite person to see live?
You mean like musicians?
Yea, what was the best concert you've been to?
You know I went to that Billie Joel and Elton John concert tour a couple years back, that was pretty amazing.
That sounds cool, what made it good?
They had this dueling pianos type thing going on.
What does that mean?
Well, at first one of them emerged from the floor of the stage in a puff of smoke, just a platform and a piano rising from the ground.
That sounds cool.
Yea, and then when one finished the platform lowered them, then the other guy came out with another colored piano on the opposite side.
Wow, and then what?
When the second one finished he went back in the ground, then suddenly they both came up together.
Quite the buildup.
Yea, then they played a couple of their hits together.
That does sound pretty epic.
It was probably the best concert I've ever been to.
Yea I've heard Elton John is a great live performer.
Billie Joel is no joke either.
.Yea I love Uptown Girl.
You would.
