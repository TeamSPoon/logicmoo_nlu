I am looking for good "children's" music, do you know of any?
Is it for little children?
Yes, I am looking for something fun and catchy.
Honestly, I do not really listen to much "kid's" music.
Why is that?
I think kids can listen to just about anything.
Really?  I never thought about that.
Yes.  I do keep away from the ones with rough language.
That is probably a good idea!
My kid likes  music from the eighties, like Bon Jovi, and Michael Jackson.
Wow, that is pretty different.
Those two are some really different bands, aren't they?
They are, but they both have some really catchy tunes!
They really do, and my youngest loves to dance along to the music.
How fun!
He even tries to moonwalk!
Does he do any of the other dance moves?
No, not yet.  He is still really little, so he basically just walks backward.
Well, thanks for the recommendations!  I am off to look for my stash of eighties albums!
No problem!  Have fun with the "oldies" music!
