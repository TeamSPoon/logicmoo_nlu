Are you a football fan?
I am. I follow pro, but not college. I can't keep up with college...there are too many teams.
I'm the same way. Who is your team?
I really like the Broncos.
Ow! They are our number one rival!
Who is your team?
Arizona Cardinals. I've been a fan since they moved from St. Louis.
yeah, we kinda have love hate relationship...but I thought your rival was Seahawks?
Yeah...maybe. I can't stand the Seahawks!
Russell Wilson is good though. Isn't he?
I think he is over-rated, honestly. Same as Arron Rogers.
Well, they do win a lot of games though...
You know who's good? The new QB for the Vikings!
Oh, yeah...I can't think of his name...he's good!
They had a good season though.
I know, I would love to see them beat the packers!
Ha ha! Cheeseheads hates that.
My husband is from St. Paul, so we root for Minnesota against Packers.
It will be an interesting season, I think.
Yeah, I'm keeping eyes on the Raiders, too...
