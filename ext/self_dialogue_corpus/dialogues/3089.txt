How do you think the Saints will do this year?
I think they can catch Atlanta this year
Really? Didn't have them that high...
The defense is on the rebound.
Well, it can't get any worse...
Yeah, they let the defense down last year.
They gave up a lot of points last year
Way too many points..it was ridiculous
Well Drew Brees definitely has some weapons
Yup. Michael Thomas surprised me last year
Yeah...didn't think he was going to be that good either
Mark Ingram has to be good again too
He sure does. How is the secondary?
Dunno. They must be better.
Almost no defensive tds last year
They had five or six if I recall. That's about average
Yup. They have to get some touchdowns to help out the defense
Need a lot more three and outs
They did draft a lot of defense this year
They'll need it
