The Prequels weren't that bad
you're the only person who thinks that
really? i thought natalie portman was pretty good
okay yeah, padme is whatever
what's your problem with them, then?
um...the writing? jar jar binks? the acting? padme wasn't THAT good
i thought they were funny
sure, but they were terrible. the effects were somehow worse than the originals!
i guess...
at least the force awakens wasn't a flop
