How many movies do you think James Cameron makes in a year?
None if I had to guess.
You are right.
I mean he did Titanic and Avatar.
Thats about it in the last 20 years.
But look at how epic those movies are.
He cant really do a sequel to Titanic.
Avatar has many coming out over the next 5 years.
I dont know what is taking so long filming them.
I think they are doing 4 sequels in a row.
To be released one at a time?
Of course thats how it works.
Will people even be interested in them that late?
Yes, he only does good movies.
And how about Terminator?
I think hes doing them again as well.
They need to leave that franchise alone.
I dont think thats how Hollywood sees it.
Will the original cast be back?
Oh I am sure Arnold will at least have a decent role.
