Do you like iron man?
Yes, Robert Downey Jr plays tony stark so well
He does, hes a good actor.
I love iron man, because i love the machine twist on superheros
It is really neat
And tony starks a jerk, but he ends uo doing the right thing.
I agree, they are really good movies.
Ive enjoyed all of them
Me too, the first is my favorite though
I liked the second a lot
