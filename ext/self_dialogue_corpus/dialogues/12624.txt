The spaceships always seemed a little funny to me in Star Wars.
How so?
Well, like, x-wings are super cool, they're designed to look like futuristic planes.
Right. And Luke flies one, so we have to like it.
But aren't TIE fighters kind of weird looking?
They do seem like they'd be stiff or something.
Exactly. And Vader flies one and they seem so fragile. They seem outmatched.
Well, the rebels were supposed to win.
Right, but they're also supposed to be underdogs!
I see your point.
