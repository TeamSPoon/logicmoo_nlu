See any good horror movies lately?
I saw the movie, 'Get Out.'
I've heard about it.  Didn't a comedian direct it?
Yes.  It was written and directed by Jordan Peele.
You mean from 'Key and Peele?'
Yea.  He's now branching out and doing other things.
What was 'Get Out' about?
It's about this guy who goes up to meet his new girlfriend's parents in the suburbs.
How is that scary?
I can't say too much without giving it away, but he gets there and strange things start to happen.
Anything else you can tell me?
Well it actually covers a lot of different social and racial issues.  It's also a hybrid comedy.
Wow that's unlike other horror movies you normally hear about.
It is just so well-written.  All of those elements mix well together.
I'll stop by at Red Box on the way back from the office and get a copy.
It'll be well worth it.  Have you seen any good horror movies lately?
I saw 'Don't Breathe.'  It's about teens who rob a blind man's home, but end up being the victims.
That's a very interesting role-reversal.
It's good.  It stars Dylan Minette from '13 Reasons Why' and 'Goosebumps,' as well as Scott Lang from 'Avatar.'
Oh, I'm a big fan of 'Scott Lang.'  You watch 'Get Out,' and I'll watch 'Don't Breathe.'
