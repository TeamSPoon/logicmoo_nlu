I think they need to change the marketing of this.
What?
It Comes at Night.
Why do you say? I just saw the trailer and it looks good.
I've seen the movie and after seeing the new trailer released yesterday it's made me worried just how much people will be expecting something else going into this movie
That's disappointing.
This movie is a great film and it has one of the most intense moments I've seen in a movie IMO but..
But what?
The movie is very artsy and all the super creepy scenes in the trailer are from dream sequences.
What? Dream sequences?
Yeah. This movie is much more comparable to "the Road" then any horror movie.
Why do they do this? You lead people to believe it's one thing but....
But in actuality it's another?
Exactly.
Because they want to sell tickets.
That is only going to work once. When people realize this isn't what they thought it would be, they will tell their friends not to waste their money.
It's a very well made movie filled with tension.
That means nothing to me now.
Well, I'm just warning you strictly because most you are probably gonna get a film that you weren't expecting.
I don't know that they sat around a table & planned it out this way but I do feel a little burned as I was hoping for a creature flick.Thanks for warning me, though.
