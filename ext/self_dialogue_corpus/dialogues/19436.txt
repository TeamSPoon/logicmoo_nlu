What do you think of when you think of Christmas music?
I think of Christmas tress and decorations, cookies, etc.
Well yea I think of that stuff too but I mean what artists come to mind.
I really loved the group Transiberian Orchestra. Have you heard them?
I think so, are they popular?
Yes pretty popular especially around the holidays.
If you name one of their songs I bet I may recognize them.
One of my favorites is "Christmas Canon".
Oh I remember that! I heard that at a Christmas concert.
Yes it's such a beautiful song.
I love their music because it's like upbeat and just gets you going.
It really does. I love to listen to it when I bake or decorate.
That's a great idea! I can't wait for the Christmas season.
Me too, it's my most favorite time of year.
I also love the song "O Holy Night".
That one is beautiful as well, I sang that in a concert one year.
I think my son's class did too a couple years ago.
There's just something special about that time of year.
Yes I agree.
I look forward to it every year.
