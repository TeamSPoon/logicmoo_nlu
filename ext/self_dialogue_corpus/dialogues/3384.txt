Hey have you seen a good vampire movie recently?
Not in a while. I think A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night was good.
The Iranian one with Sheila Vand on a skateboard?
Yes, the vampire girl on a skareboard! It was slow but moody.
Have you seen Only Lovers Left Alive?
No, what is that one?
Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston play vampire lovers on different sides of the world. It is moody, too.
Is it a modern vampire movie or a historical one?
It takes place in modern times. In fact, they restrict themselves to specially "purified" blood because the modern lifestyle makes himan blood gross to them.
Haha, organic vampires, I love it.
