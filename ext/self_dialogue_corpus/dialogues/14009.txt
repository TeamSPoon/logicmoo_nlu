What did you think about Lady Gaga's album Artpop?
I thought it was great, but it didn't seem to be as popular as her other albums.
I agree, but it did have some hit singles.
Definitely. I loved Applause when I first heard it on the radio, and I still love it.
That is a great song, but I liked Do What U Want more than Applause.
I never expected her to collaborate with R. Kelly.
I didn't expect it either, but they really complimented each other on that song.
My favorite Lady Gaga collaboration was when she starred on Beyonce's song Video Phone.
I would love to see them collaborate again sometime in the future.
Me too. They are both great singers.
