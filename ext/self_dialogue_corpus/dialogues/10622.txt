Have you seen the new Fast & Furious movie yet?
That's the one where Dom switches sides right?
Yeah. I positively loved it.
I haven't really got to see it just yet.
Oh man you are missing out.
I know. The trailer look amazing.
You need to come over and watch it.
Dude I am up for that. I want to see what happens with that sub
You're going to love it. I really miss Brian though.
Totally. It was a big lose to them.
