Who do you think ends up with the worst record this year
Has to be the Browns
No way not again
Could be the Jaguars
I think they have a shot at the division
OK maybe the Bears?
Yeah they have a huge problem at quarterback
I dont like Trubisky at all
Add in that they traded future picks away to move up one spot and thats a recipe for failure.
Yeah I think they are going to go flat this year.
They havent been good in awhile
Yeah that too
Did Cutler sign anywhere
Nope still a free agent
And so is Kapernick right
Yeah
Amazing that Glennon got starter money
And Osweiler is still under contract for starter money
He has been a huge bust
He wasnt that great at Arizona State either
