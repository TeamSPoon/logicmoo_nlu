I like music in other forms than just music
Like how
Like in movies
Movies have some good music
They are composed pretty well
I love video game music
oh yeah those are cool
Some of the best composing i have heard
It is like a massage to the ears right
Exactly
Hah i think movie music is still better
Nah that is not possible
Why not
Because the sheer variation
What ever do you mean
Like the different types
I guess you are right it is more varied
Most easily
But it does not make movie music bad
Not at all
