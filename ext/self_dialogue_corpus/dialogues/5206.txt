Did you see the Disney version of Pocahontas?
Yeah. It was some great animation. Maybe not my favourite Disney movie though.
Oh, didn't you like it?
It was good, but the subject matter was a little heavy.
Oh, what, the whole native american subjugation thing?
Yeah, that's some deep stuff for a kid's movie.
No doubt. I think it had some historical inaccuracies too.
Well of course, they needed to take some liberties. They made John Smith seem much more heroic.
Not surprising. Authentic history doesn't make for a great narrative.
Precisely. It was still a well done film though.
