I was looking online at those top ten lists I love so much, and I saw one for Star Wars characters.
So who was the number one favorite? Yoda? Chewbacca? Luke Skywalker?
Nope, none of those. You know how movie-goers love a good villian.
It was Darth Vadar?
Yep, Darth was the number one favorite character.
So where did Yoda, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker land on the list?
Yoda was 5, Chewbacca was 7, and Luke Skywalker was 3.
None of them even made second? So who was second?
Second-Obi Wan Kenobi, fourth Han Solo, sixth R2D2, eighth Boba Fett, ninth Princess Leia, and tenth Darth Maul.
Wow, Princess Leia only ninth? I would have guessed that whole list differently.
