did you like the new Nine inch nails songs
what song is it?
its called shes alone or something
its shes gone away
oh yeah, i messed up
the song is pretty good though
it reminds me of their old albums
like which one?
the fragile maybe.
thats my favorite album by them.
the fragile was amazing.
we are in this together now is so good
its thematic and dark and epic
all at the same time.
yeah, its much better than downward spiral
even though thats their biggest album
yeah, its was good but no like the fragile
it wasnt as interesting
good concept though
yeah
