Did you catch the latest Adam Sandler film?
Was that one called like glitch or soemthing?
No, he has a movie called Sandy Wexler.
Is it funny?
It is, to an extent. Not as funny as his last one.
The last one was called Glitch right?
No, the last one was actually about a shoe maker, but his last cinema release was I think Blended.
Oh, with Drew Barrymore. Did not catch that one.
I do not think many did. He has been off his game for the last decade or so, since Little Nicky.
You did not see Grown Ups two?
I did not get a chance, was it funny?
Some of his best work.
Better than Billy Madison?
I think so. Not as good as The Wedding Singer.
I think that was his top five, my favorite was Happy Gilmore.
That one is funny. Really good, like 50 First dates, you like that one?
I did! I hated the Zohan  movie, did you like it?
No, it was garbage. Did you see the Spanglish more serious movie?
I did, it was different but I liked it. You like it?
I actually did more than Reign Over Me.
