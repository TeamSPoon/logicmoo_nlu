Makes you wonder why marching bands were so popular.
it began in war times. when infantry men had to actually march towards their enemies.
yep. I know. Without the drumbeat, people tire and slow down.
And by keeping them in time with drum beats you get to the war zone more quickly.
That became what?
Well, it combined with the various musical elements of the day. In the ancient world, it combined with the traveling musicians who performed at various festivals. which at later time became an elements of the military.
For the reasons we talked about.
Right. But as far as marching bands playing in sporting events like football, we do know the first band ever to play at a half time.
Which is...
The marching Illini. The band from University of Illinois at Urbana champagne. That was in 1907. The beginning of a great American tradition.
Huh, interesting. So before that year the half time show didn't exist?
Not as we thought of today. Certainly not with the marching bands. in the NFL half tiem shows come much later in 1920s i believe.
John Philip Souza thought the marching Illinis were "the world's greatest band"
Yep. And coming from the March King, that was a great compliment.
It's kinda sad that these kids get made fun of util they get to college. I mean band geeks in high school are the worst
it's pretty harsh on many of them, but by high school, most of them get over it. i think it's harder in jr high and earlier.
They're so vulnerable at that age.
Yep. And once they get to college and beyond, they're popular because they can play a musical instrument, which is something most popular kids can't do.
They were too busy being cool to learn an instrument. That's even sadder than being a band geek
No argument here. My kids are learning guitar and piano. No marching band stuff though. They will  bepopular even in high school, and even more so in college and after.
