Cars 3? Yes, there are three Cars movies.
Wait, what was Cars 2 about again?
The first one happened with Sally at Radiator Springs and the second was the spy one.
Oh, yah, I remember now.  Didn't Mater eat wasabi thinking it was ice cream?
Yah, that was the one.
So, what is Cars 3 about?
I haven't seen it, yet. I saw some previews with what I thought was an electric car.
That would be crazy, if Flash raced an electric car.
It would.  I don't think Lasseter did the storyline, though
I like Lasseter films.  If someone else directed it, I doubt Flash would win his big race.  Have you ever ridden in a Tesla?
