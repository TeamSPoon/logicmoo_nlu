Have you seen Lady Gaga live?
No!  But I've heard she puts on a great show.
I had tickets the last time she was here, but I couldn't go.  I had to work late.
Yeah, my sister went to see her.  She said it was an experience!
That is a good thing, right?
Yeah, she said she's a fan forever now because of how amazing it was.
I will definitely have to see her next time.
I want to go, too.  We should go together!
Sounds like a plan, now she just needs to come here.
That could be a long wait.
