What kind of drills do football players do?
I always see them banging their bodies into metal things they push.
I always saw them training on the bleachers.
Me too.
Did you used to play football at all?
No, but when I ran cross-country I'd see them at the track too.
They seem to train in a lot of different ways.
Yeah, they also were always lifting weights.
That's pretty important too.
They have to have brains to learn passes as well.
It takes skill, dedication, and effort to be good.
Football players don't always get the credit they deserve.
Being an athlete takes a lot of mental stamina.
Yeah, there are often negative stereotypes.
It's a shame.
Everyone has talents and we need to give credit where credit is due.
I agree.
Hard work is important and drive.
Determination is a must in football.
Bravery is important as well!
