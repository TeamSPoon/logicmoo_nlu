Who is your favorite robot from the Star Wars series?
I've always liked R2-D2, ever since I watched The Force Awakens.
R2-D2 played such an important role by carrying the disk.
Exactly! But I also like C-3PO for his cynical humor.
Yeah, his humor cracked me up. What did you think of K-2SO in Rogue One?
I loved him! He had a similar personality to C-3PO.
I was almost in tears when he sacrificed himself in the end for Jyn and Cassian.
Same here. Sometimes I feel like the droids are the real heroes.
Tell me about it. It's amazing how much character development occurs within the robots.
It would be cool if there was a Star Wars movie that focused on the robots themselves.
