Hey!
Hey!
We haven't talked in forever.
I know, right?
What have you been up to?
Listening to music, watching movies, housework, video games, keeping my son from getting into trouble.
What have you been watching?
Well... I saw Moana at the cheap theater.
Oh, did you like it.
I liked it better after renting it from the library.
Why's that?
I couldn't catch most of the words in the "You're Welcome" or "Shiny" songs because of the way they were performed.
Ah yes, you watch movies with subititles on.
Yep, I actually do like both of those songs now, but really couldn't follow them in the theater.
Kind of wrecks the experience when you can understand the words.
Yeah, I wish there was a subtitles option at theaters.
Hey, I went to a theater in Nebraska that had that option.
Really?
Yeah, it wasn't a main line theater though, just a community one.
Oh, well there goes hoping that a chain was starting a trend.
