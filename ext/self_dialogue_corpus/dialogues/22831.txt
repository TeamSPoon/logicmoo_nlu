Have you ever heard of a movie called The Untouchables?
Is that the one with Kevin Costner?
Yes, that's the one I'm thinking of.
Yeah, I saw that movie. Are you going to watch it?
I thought I might because I like Kevin Costner, but I hadn't heard of the movie before.
It's about an FBI agent who can't be touched by bribes like most officials were back in the prohibition era.
Is it based on a true story?
It's based on a real life character, and I know how he takes down Al Capone is based on real events.
Is it one of those shoot em up movies?
Kind of, but it's more than that because it gets into the way they had to get clever in taking down Capone since he never left any evidence of his crimes.
Did you like the movie?
Yes, I liked the movie, and you know I like movies with deeper plots.
I know you do, that's why I wondered.
I liked watching the strategy of how they worked, and the loyalty of the close inner circle of agents.
So it gets into the characters more than a typical gangster movie?
I think it does.
Kevin Costner plays the FBI agent you were talking about?
Yes, Elliot Ness, I think is his name.
Maybe I can watch it when I get some free time then. It sounds like I might like it.
I think you will, especially since it's a period movie.
