Do you like saxophone music?
It's my favorite instrument.
I love Kenny G's playing.
What's that instrument called he plays?
It's a soprano saxophone.
That's a little different than a regular sax?
Right, it's higher pitched and a little smaller.
What's the instrument that makes the deepest sound for saxes?
Well, it's not the deepest but the tenor saxophone is used by a lot of rock groups.
Yeah, I think that's the one I'm thinking of.
I always see the classic 1960's bands using musicians playing the tenor sax.
The saxophone is a beautiful instrument.
Yeah, I think so too.
When I was little, though, my mom didn't want me to play the saxophone because it could sqeak a lot.
Yeah, you have to practice to make good music.
I think that the musicians must practice for hours at time to get so good.
I guess music is like most sports.
In a way.  You have to keep your fingers going and practice.
I wish I could play music like the professionals.
That would be cool!
