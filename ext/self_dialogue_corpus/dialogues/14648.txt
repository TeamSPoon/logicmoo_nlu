Did you know basketball was invented entirely in the US?
Yes, In Springfield.MA.
Yep. I used to live there.
No kidding.
Nope. I went to Classical High back in the day. They changed that to Central high. That was back in 1986.
Did you play basketball?
No. But I guess I was a fan. It was well known that Basketball was invented there, so it was pretty competitive to get on the team.
I can imagine.
There's a museum dedicated to it.
I heard, I wanna go check it out soemtime.
It first began because it was cold and rainy but Dr Naismith wanted to keep his physical ed class active.
That was, what? Back in 1900s?
1891. December. he wanted a game that will keep students occupied during the cold winter months. And it gets COLD in Springfield.
Interesting.
The very first basket was made from hanging or nailing a peach basket to the wall at 10 ft height.
Huh.
That proved a stupid idea, because you have to climb up to retrieve the ball every time someone makes the basket.
Haha, that does seem kinda silly. They should've removed the bottom.
And that's exactly what they did. Ball would get stuck, and they would use a stick to poke it over and out of the basket.
That's still dumb, they should've attached a net or something to let you see the ball went into the basket and allow the ball to fall through.
