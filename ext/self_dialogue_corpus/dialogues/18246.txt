Hey have you head of Lil Dicky?
What who in the world is that?
He is a comedian but he is also a really good song writer and rapper.
Really what kind of stuff does he rap about?
All sorts of stuff. Some of it is really funny since he is a comedian and other times the songs are more serious.
Well what is one of his funny songs about?
He raps about saving money. Which is hilarious for a rapper to talk about.
That does sound really funny. Does he make music videos too?
Yes he does. That song I just told you about is call Save Dat Money and his YouTube video for it is really funny.
What is so funny about the video?
He walks around asking people to barrow their house and boat and things like that to shoot his video.
Oh wow this guy really does sound funny. I will have to look him up.
Yeah and like I said he does some other stuff too. Not all of it is funny.
Well what is another song that I can look up that is more serious?
He has a song called Molly. It is about the love of his life and how he lost her because of his career.
Hmm that sounds a little too corny but I will look it up.
No it is actually really well written and the lyrics are great. It is surprisingly one of my favorite songs.
Okay, you talked me more into I will look that song up as well.
Awesome. There is a music video for that song as well. Just YouTube him and you will find all his songs.
Okay cool. I will let you know what I think once I looked him up. I have been wanting to listen to some new music.
