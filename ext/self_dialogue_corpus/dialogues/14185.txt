Are you going to see Lady Gaga in concert in Las Vegas?
I'd love to go, where and when is the concert?
It's at the T-Mobile Arena this August
Okay, I will try to get tickets.
I hope she sings Born This Way because that's my favorite
That's a great song, but my favorite is Just Dance.
That's a great classic, what other songs to you like?
Well, Bad Romance is another of my favorites.
Maybe she will sing all of those in her concert.
I hope so, I can't wait to see her performance.
