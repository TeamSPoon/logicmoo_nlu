Did you see the latest Star Wars?
Yeah I thought it wasnt that great.
Why do you say that?
I think the acting was lacking.
You might be the only one to say that.
Maybe, but its the truth.
Did you want more of the original cast?
No I think they all showed up right.
How about James Earl Jones?
Now that would have been comedy.
