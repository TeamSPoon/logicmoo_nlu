Did you watch any of the newer Star Wars movies?
I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
Which did you like better?
I liked Rogue One, The Force Awakens was too much like a remake.
I actually liked The Force Awakens much better.
It was pretty much a remake though, there was nothing new in that movie.
I will agree it was pretty much a reboot but I did not like Rogue One.
Why not?
It just seemed too perfect and it was obvious what was going to happen.
I guess we see it differently.
