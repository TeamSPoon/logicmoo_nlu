So after watching Frozen the millionth time with my daughter, we tried Moana.
Mo anne-na. I heard good thind about it. What did you think?
It's Moe-Anna. Like Anna from Frozen. I made the same mistake too. It was great!
What did you like about it?
It featured a strong female character, had wonderful catchy tunes and one crazy chicken that made me laugh.
Always have an animal sidekick. Disney movie rule.
Is Timon & Pumba considered an animal companion cliche? Since, well Simba was an animal?
Umm, sure why not!? They brought that comic relief that the companion always has.
I agree. Maybe since they are lower on the food chain as well.
I like bacon.. Yup.. Yup..
