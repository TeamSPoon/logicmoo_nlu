Favorite Villian in Star Wars who is it?
The obvious would be Darth Vadar but I don't think that would be my favorite
So who is it?
Give me a minute this requires some deep thought
give me a break, its easily Boba Fett, he pretty much is the entire Clone army and he tries to kill Han and Obi Wan
Right but he's only in a few movies, I think that Emporer Palpatine might be the biggest Villian that I like
What?  Yoda almost kicked his butt
No he didn't he was so good he forced Yoda into hiding
That's right, I guess he is a pretty good villian
See I told you!
