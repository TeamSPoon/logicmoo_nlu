Have you heard the new Arcade Fire song?
Yeah! Didn't it get released yesterday?
I think so. They released a short tease for it first.
I love the sound. It's a nice blend of their last album the their earlier work.
I completely agree. I felt their last album Reflektor was missing the melodies that I loved on the first three albums.
Well, I think they wanted to try something new.
That's fair and understandable. Usually happens to artists who win Grammy's like they have.
Right. They suddenly feel the pressure to do something bigger and better next time.
Usually with mixed results, as in the case of Reflektor.
I didn't really like it to be honest.
Me either. There were a few stand out tracks, particularly the singles, but a lot of filler.
It felt much more like a jam session than a polished album. I had become used to their high production value.
Exactly! And the shame is, it was produced by James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem.
LCD Soundsystem is one of my all time favorite bands.
Me too. So you would think that two of my favorite artists working together would make a really great album, but sadly, no.
Well, we've heard new songs from both artists now and both sound great.
I'm very excited for both the new Arcade Fire and LCD Soundsystem albums.
I was a little worried when I heard the other Arcade Fire song that released a few months ago.
Oh yeah, "I Give You Power". I think that was a one off thing, commenting on the election.
It's an okay track. It feels more like Gorillaz than Arcade Fire.
