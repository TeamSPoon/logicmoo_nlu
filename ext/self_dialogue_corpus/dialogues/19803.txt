Hey, what do you think of the Termites.
Who are the Termites?
They're the one's that do that new song called "We are"
Hmm, don't sound familiar.
You know, "we are eveybody"
Oh, yeah, I've heard that.
Yeah, it's on the radio all the time.  I can't get the darn thing out of my head.
It's pretty catchy.  Have you heard anything else they've done?
No.  Just that.
I'll have to check em out on Napster.  I'd like to hear some more.
Me too.  They got an original sound that I really like.
Yeah, the horns really wail in the background.  Come's through just right.
I like the guy's voice too.
Yeah, a bit gravely.  Like, ol' ... what's his name
Eddie Money?
Yeah, something like him.  I really like his music.
Oh, yeah, me too.  I've seen him a couple times in the old days.
Really, I never did.  Like to though.
Well, I'd sure like to see the Termites.
Wonder when they are coming to town?
