What the hell happened to the Fast and Furious movie series?
What are you talking about?
It use to be about cool cars and racing.
It's still about that.
No, now they are on some Oceans 11 bank robbery stuff.
Yeah, I can see why you think that.
What do you think was the worst one?
Easy, that's Tokyo Drift.
Is that the one with Lil Bow Wow?
That's the one.
