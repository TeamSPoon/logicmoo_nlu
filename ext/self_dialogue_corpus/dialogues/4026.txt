Have you seen any of the John Wick movies?
No, they any good.
Well, the first one, called John Wick was great. Lots of action and a good story.
WHat;s it about.
This guy, he was like a hitman, but he fell in love. So he left it. But then his wife dies.
Woah, isn't that kind of a spoiler?
No, it happens in the first few minutes. So he's real sad, but his wife got him a  dog.
Awww, that's something.
And any way, these Russian mobsters mess with him and they soon find out he's the wrong guy to mess with.
That sounds good. I think I will see it. But don't tell me any more.
