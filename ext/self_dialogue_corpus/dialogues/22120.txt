Are you looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman?
I am it looks fun and action packed
Wonder Woman is a total hottie in the previews.
Yeah did you know she was a regular in the Fast and Furious movies?
I did do you have a favorite of those?
The last one I saw 6 was awesome - she gets killed in it!
Any new movies you want to see this summer

I am such a James Bond  movie fan and can't wait for the next one
Me too I am really interested to see who will play him next.
Are you going to see the new Minions this summer
OMG of course - my daughter is already bugging me to see it
Do you have any favorite kid shows you can tolerate as an adult?
I can usually tolerate the Minions and Despicable me movies
Do you think the new Mummy movie will be good
