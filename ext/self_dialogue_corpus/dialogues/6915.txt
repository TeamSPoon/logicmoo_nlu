What kind of drugs is Disney currently on?
What do you mean?
Have you seen how they are taking all their old cartoons and making them live action?
Yeah, and they look scary.
The Beauty and The Beast live action movie looks terrifying.
I wonder if they will do a live action Aladdin.
They did a live action Jungle Book.
That movie looked messed up.
If they redo Aladdin they I will be pissed.
You ready for cgi Robin Williams!
