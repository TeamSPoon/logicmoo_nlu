I just rewatched Return of the Jedi.
I haven't watched that movie in a while. I bet I can still quote the Emperor though!
Do you mean when he talks to Darth Vader or when he's talking to Luke near the end?
Both, but especially at the end when he's about to use Force Lightning on Luke.
Those movies had great villains. Do you think the new movie villains are as good?
I think Kylo Ren is pretty awesome, but I'm not sure I want to call him a villain just yet.
You think he's going to be redeemed in the next movie?
I don't know if The Last Jedi will redeem him, but I hope so.
I don't think a lot of people want him to be redeemed after Han died in The Force Awakens.
I think they still do. If not, Kylo will make an awesome villain to remember.
