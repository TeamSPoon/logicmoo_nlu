Thank goodness my son is too young to be into Disney movies. I love them, but I can't stand to watch the same movie over and over again.
Oh, he will get there. You just wait.
Hmm. I wonder which movie he will be into the most.
Probably Frozen.
Olaf is the greatest, and they have part two coming out in the future.
Yeah, my kids can't wait. I'm looking forward to having a new song blaring in the car on repeat. I hope it's as catchy as Let it Go.
Disney does a pretty good job with their soundtracks.
Yes they do.
I'm feeling a solo coming on...
Oh please, don't start singing in public again.
