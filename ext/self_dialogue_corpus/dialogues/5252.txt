I miss watching Lilo and Stitch, we should see it again some time.
Yes! I loved the music in it.
My favorite song was the one in the beginning when Lilo so was swimming and giving Pudge the fish a sandwhich.
I loved the amount of Elvis in there.
Can we talk about Nani though? She's such a lovely character.
I know right? She looks like an actual human being compared to the rest of Disney's animated women.
Not to mention that it's emphasized that her and Lilo's relationship isn't perfect.
Yeah, I can't imagine having to raise my own sibling at that age for either of them.
I can't imagine having to live with Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba.
Haha, that's true.
