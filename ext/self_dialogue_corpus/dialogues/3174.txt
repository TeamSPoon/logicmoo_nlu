Have you ever been to an NFL game.
No I have not.
You should go some time.
Have you been to games?
Yes, a couple of times.
Where did you go most recently?
I went to Lambeau Field.
That is in Green Bay correct?
Yes it is.
So you watched the Packers?
Yup.
Who were they playing?
They were playing the Chicago Bears.
Neat.
It was a very close game.
That's fun, how were the fans.
It got a little intense between the teams fans.
Rivalry games will do that.
They do.
Sounds like you had a blast.
