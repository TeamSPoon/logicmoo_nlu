Man, I hate this weather! It just won't stop raining.
I know. I wish we could find something to do to pass the time.
Hey I have an idea! We should watch some movies.
Yeah that sounds like a good idea. What kind of movie do you have in mind?
Well, since it is so rainy and dreary out why not watch something funny to brighten our moods?
That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any movies in mind?
How about something with Will Ferrell? He is always funny.
Well we could always watch Anchorman or Anchorman 2.
Those are good. I have seen them so many times.
Me too! Which one do you think is the best?
I have to say that I prefer the first one. It was totally hilarious.
It was pretty awesome but I think the second one was the best.
I wish they would come out with a part three to those movies.
Oh my gosh, that would be awesome.
Out of Will Ferrell movies do you prefer the Anchorman movies or Step Brothers?
Oh that's a tough one. They are all so good.
I love the Anchorman movies but the dynamic between Ferrell and John C. Reilly is impeccable.
Yeah they certainly do make a good pair.
Maybe we should watch them all again and see if we can rank them.
That sounds great. You can't go wrong with any of them though.
