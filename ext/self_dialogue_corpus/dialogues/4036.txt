If you had to pick a thriller film that set the bar for all future thriller movies, which movie would you chose?
Hands down it would be Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
Oh that shower scene is such a classic.
And the music that was played was so creepy.
I loved the twist that Norman was actually also his mother.
I didn't see that coming.
I don't think anyone did.
Janet Leigh did a really good acting job in that movie.
So did Anthony Perkins.
Alfred Hitchcock really put the movie on the map with his directing skills.
