How about that young talent on the sixers?
Yea, but Embiid can't stay healthy.
Oh no, hes healthy and domiant.
Idk but if he isnt the core doesnt look as good.
Not even with Simmons, Saric, and maybe Jackson?
The same Simmons who was hurt his rookie year?
We're talking about potential here. Look at the potential of all of these guys.
What is potential when it doesnt translate to the court.
Look, Embiid and Simmons together isn't appealing to you?
No, it is, but I'll believe it when I see it.
What if we get Lowry. Then will you believe?
I might. That would be a good pickup, but he wants a lot of money.
Hes coming off his best year at age 31. Give him the money.
I guess but dont go crazy.
Add Lowry to that core and you're in the playoffs. No?
I dont know about that, but maybe.
The Eastern Conference is rough.
Yea, its not the strongest.
We'll see how we fare. I wanna see everyone healthy.
Yea, lets see it!
