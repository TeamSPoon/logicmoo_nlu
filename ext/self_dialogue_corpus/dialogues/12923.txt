Since Force Awakens Lea has been in the older movies and now the new one.
Yes she has so?
Well which character do you like more her new one or her old one?
They're the same so how is that even a question?
I mean did you like her before or now in the new movie better?
I would say before because she had more story she played the part well and looked good doing it.
Do you think in her older age she might be more harsh and brutal?
I'm not sure we will have to see.
Do you think she will end up dying in the movies?
I hope not.
