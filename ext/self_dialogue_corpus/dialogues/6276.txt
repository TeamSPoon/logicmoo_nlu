What disney movie has the best setting or location?
Aladdin by far!
Oh great choice, but I'm going to have to disagree
What? What movie could have a better location than that.
I'm going to have to go with Lilo and Stitch
Oh, now that I remember, the Hawaii setting was really beautiful
Yeah, and it really went well with the story.
I feel that Aladdins setting worked better though
Yeah, and for the period in the 90s when it came out, it wasn't half bad.
It really spiced up the plot line as well
