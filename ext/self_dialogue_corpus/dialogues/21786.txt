hi danny, you've seen reviews for tom cruise "the mummy" franchised.
oh not really but i heard on E news that its not doing well in box office.
i am telling you, i wanted to rent on netflix but the reviews are so bad.
one would have expected that Tom Cruse starring on the already popular ''the mummy" series it would be an instant box office hit.
i had thought so myself, he was the reason i wanted to watch.
one thing i have to say though is that sometimes this reviews are of individual opinion you might just watch the movie and be like Okay so why the bad reviews.
lol oh that's true, happened so many times, good example was "now you see me"
oyeah "now you see me" got so many bad reviews.
aside the bad reviews the jacket art made it look like an amatuer movie even with morgan freeman starring.
it also had the guy that acted on "social network"
yeah jesse eisenberg.
yes that's his name.
true, when i saw the preview and album art i just scroll past it anytime i am searching for movie to watch
i did that couple of times as well until one say i exhausted all new movies and was like let me just waste time with it, but boy it was the most intriguing movie i ever watched that whole year.
same i was shocked with what was packed in it, movie was so engaging, and i still rate it on my top 5 list.
you see, so since then i don't really lay much emphasis on reviews, i just set aside a day to watch it , especially a movie like "the mummy" with cruise on it.
i might as well just rent and watch it though, it can't be that bad.
i bet.
anyways i will tell you my take when i watch myself.
oyeah no worries mate, talk later.
