What do you think of The Emperor's New Groove?
I like it a lot. It's funny with some characters that become endearing.
I like the dialogue between Kronk and Yzma.
The banter of Yzma and Kronk as well as Kuzco and Pacha is hilarious.
My favorite part is the scene at the restaurant where they keep almost running into Kronk and Yzma.
Yeah that part made me laugh a lot.
What did you think of the squirrel?
The squirrel in that movie was cute and it was funny how he bonded with Kronk.
Did you ever see the sequel Kronk's New Groove?
I did and it was pretty good but Emperor's New Groove was better.
