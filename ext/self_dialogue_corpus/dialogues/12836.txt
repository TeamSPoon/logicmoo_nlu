Hey you like Star Wars, right? Who is your favorite character?
You mean overall? It's so hard to choose, but I really like Leia
Leia is an awesome character, no doubt. I wonder how they'll handle her character now that Carrie Fisher has passed away.
I'm still really bummed about that, but I'm sure they'll figure something out for Leia in The Last Jedi.
Speaking of which, do you think Luke is going to turn to the dark side?
No, I think they're just trying to mislead people with that. But I'm still really looking forward to episode VIII.
Can you believe they're making an entirely new trilogy after the prequel movies were so controversial?
The prequels weren't that bad. Too much CGI, yes, but the stories and characters were solid
That's true. And I really hope Sam Jackson is right about Mace Windu still being alive!
And if he did survive, then maybe his kids will show up in one of the new movies! Maybe Finn is his grandson or something, too.
