I just saw Rogue One.
Neat!  Any of the old crew show up?
No, all new characters.
Who was your favorite?
Felicity Jones was super hot!
What role did she play?
She was Jyn Erso, who was recruited to rescue her dad Galen, who helped design the Death Star.
What happens in the end?
Jalen steals the schematics to the Death Star and gets them to Princess Leia, but dies.
Terrible!
