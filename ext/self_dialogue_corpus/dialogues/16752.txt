You going to the show?
I might go if i have time then. Have you seen any good shows lately.
A few good ones actually
Who have you seen you would say is good
I would say Green Death was pretty good
Were they?
They were pretty amazing live
I have heard of them but they did not seem too good
They are far better than they seem
Well i might take your word for it
They are truly amazing and worth listening and seeing live
Well  when is their next show
I am not sure i might need to look that up
Well look it up and let me know
It seems their next show is some ways off
Aww that is a shame what day
It is about 3 weeks from friday
Well that is not to bad
Wanna go together
For sure we can go together.
