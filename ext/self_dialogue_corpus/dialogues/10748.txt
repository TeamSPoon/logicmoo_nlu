What was your favorite car in the fast and furious movies?
That's an easy one Dom's car at the end of the first movie.
Do you remember how fast it was?
It's under 10 seconds I think 9 seconds to be exact.
Wasn't it a 1970 Dodge Charger?
Yes, I believe so.
Why is that your favorite?
I love the body style and it's black which is my favorite color.
Those are good reasons, do you like that the motor sticks out from the hood?
I do it give sit character.
