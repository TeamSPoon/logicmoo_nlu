Do you know who Halsey is?
Nope, never heard of her. Whats her biggest hit?
You must've heard Closer with the Chainsmokers?
Oh yes! That song is constantly on the radio.
Her solo stuff is even better.
It sounds like something I would want to hear.
Did you know that she has a song in a female narrative declaring her love for another girl?
That is unusual. Is that a first?
Yeah, I believe so! It was on the newspapers for a while.
What is the song called?
It's called Strangers featuring Lauren Jauregui.
Who is Lauren?
Oh, I forgot to mention! She is a member of Fifth Harmony.
Oh, song must be great then!
Yes, it has a very raspy and raw feel to it.
I just listened to it, i think it's fantastic.
You should check out the rest of her album.
I think I will.
It was the number one female album to reach number 1 in USA this year.
That is quite an accomplishment.
