Did you ever see Slapshot?
No.  What's that?
It was a movie from the 70's about hockey.
Is that the one with Paul Newman?
Yep, that's the one.
Okay, I remember it.  So it's good, eh?
It's hilarious.  You don't even have to be a sports fan to like it.
I should check it out I guess.
It's on Netflix.  Watch it and let's talk.
Sounds like a plan.
