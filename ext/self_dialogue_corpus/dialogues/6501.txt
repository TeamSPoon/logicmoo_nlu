Are you going to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I will probably see it when it comes out on DVD. I've seen all the previous ones.
I don't know how I feel about it. The series has gone a little stale.
Yeah, I feel like Captain Jack Sparrow's character has gotten old.
The first movie was awesome, but it seems like they are really milking it now.
I think that's true of all movie series.
Having said that, I will probably still see it.
I still am a Johnny Depp fan, but I won't waste money and time going to the theater.
I much prefer him as Captain Jack Sparrow than the Mad Hatter in the Alice in Wonderland movies.
No disagreement from me!
