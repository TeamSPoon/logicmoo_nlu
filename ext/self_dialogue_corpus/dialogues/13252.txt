Did you like Anakin when he was an adult?
I thought he was sort of flat.
I agree. They should not have cast the guy they did.
He should have been less of a complainer.
Yes and they should not have had that love story.
I agree. I also did not like making him a kid.
They should have just left that story altogether.
I think that character only works as Darth Vader. Keep his history a mystery.
Yes. It was a mistake to try to go through his journey.
Yeah. But, at least we can forget the prequels.
