What is your favorite genre of music?
I think I like pop music the best.
I never would have guessed that. Why?
I just like knowing songs other people know and the songs are always pretty catchy.
You're right about that. I haven't been able to get "Call Me Maybe" out of my head since the first time I heard it five years ago.
See, everyone knows pop music! I really like Taylor Swift.
Is she considered pop?
I think these days she's considered pop music. She used to be country when she first started singing.
I'm not sure how I feel about Taylor Swift.
What do you mean?
Well, some of her songs are good, but others are just annoying.
Which songs are annoying?
I wasn't the biggest fan of "Shake It Off."
I loved that song!
Well, to each his own, but it got stuck in my head like "Call Me Maybe."
I think getting a song stuck in your head means you like the song.
Maybe at first, but after the millionth "shake it off" going through my head, I started hating the song.
What Taylor Swift songs do you like?
I like her older stuff like "Love Story"
I like that one too! At least we can agree on that!
