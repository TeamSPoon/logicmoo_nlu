do you have a favorite star wars movie ?
do i ! its the first one. i still watch it from time to time.
ya me too.
i remember when it first came out. i was 12 and in the 7th grade it was 1977.
a whole group of my friends went to go see it at the theater.
in my small town there was only one theater and the line to see star wars went all the way around the block.
i thought it was a good movie back then. now it seems even better.
ya i know what you mean. its relevant because in our government the republicans have become the empire. right ? that is what you mean ?
oh totally ! we need luke skywalker and hans solo r2d2 and cp3o to come and save us from the evil empire.
donald trump is really darth vader!! oh thats funny. well see you, nice talking to you. this is my stop.
