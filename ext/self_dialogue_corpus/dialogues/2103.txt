Are you excited for NFL football to start back.
I am, when does pre-season start back again?
NFL pre season games will start in August.
Who is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowbys are one of my favorite teams in the NFL.
How did they do last year?
Dallas had a magical season last year winning 13 games and getting the bye in the playoffs.
What was different abou the season?
Dallas started Dak Prescott and he was a phenominal quarterback.
Where did he come from.
Dak played at Mississippi State University and had an oustanding career there.
Is Dak returning this year to Dallas?
Dak was named offensive rookie of the year and went to the probowl so I think he will start for sure this year.
How did they do in the playoffs with Dak Prescott?
They played a great game but lost a close game to Green Bay.
I bet that was disheartening for the fans after having such a great year.
Yes it was disappointing for Dallas to lose the first game in the playoffs.
What happened to the other Dallas Quarterback?
Romo got injured and Prescott took over with a fury!
I am excited to see what the Dallas Cowboys do this season in the NFL.
