Did you get to see Arrival yet?
Yea! We watchedâ€‹ that the other day. It was during the day because I was scared.
It does get pretty intense, I don't blame you.
I don't know what it is about alien films, they seem more real, and scare me much more.
No that's totally fair. I felt they handled the human response to the ships really accurately.
Right? Like all the military involvement and secrecy around it.
Definitely, and the media speculation around it.
Man it was good. Amy Adams is always awesome though.
I do love her. Who is her male co-star again?
It was that guy who plays Hawkeye in the new Marvel movies.
Oh yeah, Jeremy Renner.
That's right. He's in the newest Bourne film too right?
Yeah The Bourne Legacy, after Matt Damon left it.
Those were fun flicks!
Yeah they were. I think they're done making them after the Renner one.
That's too bad. It was a fun series. It felt a lot like Mission Impossible.
Yeah it really did!
Lots of extreme action that's just sort of believable because maybe we really do have spies that advanced.
Oh I believe it could be possible. They just have to train an insane amount.
Either way, it was a great set of movies.
