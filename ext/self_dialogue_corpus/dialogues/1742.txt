Whose your favorite NFL player?
Well I really like Tom Brady, I think hes a great quarterback.
Are you a Patriots fan?
I actually am, I consider myself a fan of the team.
Really? how long have you liked them?
Well its been a while I remember always rooting for them but I became a real fan in the last superbowl.
And why is that?
I think that the comeback was pretty epic and also inspiring.
Yeah it was a great comeback, I thought Patriots were lost already.
It was pretty hard to recover from that, so whose your favorite player?
I really like Matt Ryan I think he has a lot of potential.
Oh and what team does he play for?
Hes the QB for the Falcons.
Are you a FalconÂ´s fan?
Not really I just like the player.
And what is your favorite team?
I really like the Raiders.
Oh that team is cool as well, though they havent had luck lately.
Yeah I know they used to be a great team but times change.
I know, they  used to be pretty good but hopefully those days will return.
