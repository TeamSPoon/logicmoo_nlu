Which was the better Dawn of the Dead the original or the remake?
The original for plot line and overall creep factor.  But the remake had better special effects and acting.
I know what you mean.  Some of the acting in the original was pretty suspect.  And the makeup was just plane lazy.
But it was way scarier.  The fast zombies just aren't as creepy.
I know, sometimes they are but it doesn't churn your gut the same way.
The plot device of the helicopter was pretty solid in the original as well.
But the sequel had that guy on the roof.  Too bad they couldn't save him.
Yeah, he added comedic relief when it was needed pretty badly.
Broke up the gore a little bit.
I also like the happy ending of the original as well.
