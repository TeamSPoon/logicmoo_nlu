What do you think about Ron in the Harry Potter movies?
I think he's a tool.
No!  He's awesome!  He introduces Harry to the wizarding world.
He is just a patsy who gets dragged into dangerous situations.
But he saves them by playing wizards chess!
That's one instance. He's so unimportant that they can write him out of half of the last movie.
But I miss him when he's gone!
And why would Hermonine MARRY him? She can do so much better.
But they love each other!  It's a timeless love!
It's a trite love.  She'd be better off with a dentist.
