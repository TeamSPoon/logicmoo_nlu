He is an excellent songwriter and I love the tone of his voice.

He inspired a lot of country music musicians.
That is true.

Yes, it was called Walk The Line.
That is also the name of a song, isn't it?
It is! That is one of his most popular songs.
A lot of artists have covered it over the years I think.
You're correct. The artist Halsey did a cover a few years ago.
Cool! That probably opened up the song to a whole new audience
You're right I think. I bet a lot of her fans had not listened to a lot of Johnny Cash music.
