What do you think about Jason Momoa playing aquaman?
I think it's awesome man, can't think of a better actor?
Really? What hashe done besides Game of Thrones?
He was Conan man!
Conan?
Yeah, Conan the barbarian.  Haven't you seen the movie?
No, is it any good?
I wouldn't say it's my favorite movie of all time, but it's entertaining.
Who else is in it?
Ron Perlmen is in it and so is Rose Mcgowan.
What? I didn't even know they made a movie recently.
I mean it wasn't really that recent, it as released in 2011.
Dang, I didn't know.
I guess most people didn't it kind of tanked at the box office.
Well, that explains why I haven't heard of it.
I guess, I found it searching hulu or netflix one night.
That's cool. But back to Aquaman, how good does it look?
It looks awesome man, I'm stoked.
Me too, we'll have to go together.
Definitely, hit me up when it gets closer.
