Hey are you excited that its almost time for the NFL season to start?
Yeah, July is the last month there isnt any football on for the rest of the year, I think!
I know, what is your favorite team?
Mine is the Green Bay Packers.
They are pretty good, I am partial to the Redskins.
That must be difficult.
Yeah, believe me, it seems like they destroy everything good they touch.
Oh yeah, whatever happened to RG3?
He was injured like every 5 minutes and then left for the Browns.
The Browns? Thats like the Titanic of the NFL, there's no escape.
Tell me about it. If I were Kirk Cousins I would be planning my escape 24/7.
Does that one guy who everyone hates still own the team?
Daniel Snyder? You bet, he's micromanaging the team into oblivion.
How's the new coach working out?
He's pretty good, he's the brother of the guy on Monday Night Football.
Oh I like him, Jon Gruden?
Yeah - I'm hopeful this year maybe we can make the playoffs.
I'm hopeful we can win the Super Bowl.
Well you have Aaron Rodgers, so anything is possible lol.
Yeah he's one of the best quarterbacks I've ever seen.
