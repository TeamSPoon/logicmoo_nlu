What do you think about Steve Smith Sr. retiring last year?
Man I can't believe you asked me that.
Come on, why you say that?
I feel lke I lost my best friend.
Ha, you crazy.
You know Baltimore my team right.
Oh ya'll done.
Tell me something I don't know.
Steve was the man. Loved his play and smack talk.
Me too. Followed him since he was with th Panthers.
Yes he did well on that team. Why he leave?
They let him go.
Was it about money?
Man it's always about the money.
They should have kept him.
True but I'm glad he came to my team.
I heard once that him and Cam didn't get along.
That's somewhat true. Steve was trying to teach him the ropes.
That age difference probably ruined it.
Yep them young quarterbacks just won't listen.
