Did you ever go through a Justin Bieber phase?
Surprisingly, I did not.
Really? You're the only girl I know who wasn't obsessed with him in middle school.
I just never cared for him all that much.
Do you like "Love Yourself" at least?
Yeah, I'll admit I really like that song. It's relatively new, right?
I'm pretty sure it came out sometime last year.
My favorite line of it is "My mama don't like you and she likes everyone."
I agree 100%. It's so true too.
Right? My mom has the best perception on all of the guys I date.
Are you familiar with his older music at all?
I know like "Baby" but I just really don't like it.
Why's that?
It just sounds super auto-tuned and I feel as though the lyrics are super uncreative.
I could see how you feel that way.
There doesn't appear to be any sort of originality to it and it's basically the chorus over and over.
You still like, though?
I really do. I wouldn't say it's quality music or anything but it definitely puts me in a great mood.
I understand. That's kind of how I feel about Miley Cyrus.
That's exactly what I would relate my opinion too.
