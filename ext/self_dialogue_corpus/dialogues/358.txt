Have you seen Deadpool yet?
Not yet.  How was it?
So cool!  It swore a bit though.
A bit?  I heard it was nonstop vulgarity.
It definitely earned its R rating.  It's not kid appropriate.
How did Ryan Reynolds do in it?
He was brilliant.  So funny and charming.
Even disfigured?
He's dreamy either way!
Well, I like my men a bit less murderous if you know what I mean.
