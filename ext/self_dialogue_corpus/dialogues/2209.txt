What do you think about the last NFL season?
In general I think it was pretty disappointing, especially the playoffs
I agree; there should be more variation in the teams making the playoffs
The regular season wasn't all that great, either, for just about any team
Yeah, unless you're a Patriots fan, and even then you get four games without Brady
Not that that made much of a difference for their win percentage
And you really can't argue with the end result, even if you're a fan
Patriots fans will always find something to complain about, even after a historic win that shatters about ten different streaks
I guess there's no satisfying some NFL fans
I really enjoy the sport in general, but seeing the same teams win and same teams lose every year is tiring
It was strange seeing the Bengals miss the playoffs for the first time in several years
I would have been more surprised to see them win a playoff game, to be honest
The AFC North ended in bitter disappointment, with the Ravens outshined by the Steelers, and then the Steelers getting crushed by the Pats
You really can't depend on the Steelers when it really matters
I think if the Steelers are going to knock the Ravens out of the playoffs, the least they can do is put up a fight against the Patriots
The Patriots rivals seem to be just about everyone else at this point
I think the rest of the league will loosen up once Brady and Belichick are gone
Which, with any luck, will be very soon
And with Ben Roethlisberger nearing retirement, it will be harder for the Steelers to make repeat appearances
It's about time for some parity in the AFC already!
