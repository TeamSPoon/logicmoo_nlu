What do you think about Radiohead?
They are one of those bands that I can't decide on.
That's odd, what do you mean?
Well sometimes I hear a song by them and I like it, then other songs I'm not too thrilled by.
Hmmm I wonder what the common element you are not liking is.
Well for one thing I'm not a fan of the singing.
Ah, well yes I could see that being a problem.
But then I quite like some of their music. I really like Jonny Greenwood's film music as well.
But if you are not a fan of the singing then they are never going to be a band that you love.
I suppose that's true, all my friends are Smiths fans but I could never stand Morrissey's voice.
I'm the same way with The Doors, the music can be great but then he starts crooning his terrible lyrics and I have to switch it off.
Exactly! That was the only film I ever walked out of the cinema during, the Oliver Stone one.
Luckily I've never seen that. Then again there are singers that I'm not fond of but I got used to over the years.
Really? I can't imagine putting myself through that, sounds too much like homework.
Well you just adjust your ears over time. For example I couldn't stand Bjork when I first heard her.
Oh I get that, I enjoyed The Sugarcubes but I've found most of her solo stuff impenetrable..
You should give her solo albums another try, sometimes things are worth persevering with.
Again it sounds too much like homework, music should be fun!
Should it be fun all the time though? Think of music in horror films, that doesn't sound like much fun on its own.
Yes but I wouldn't want to listen to it on its own, leave it in the film!
