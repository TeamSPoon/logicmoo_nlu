So, if I'm going to watch a Marx Brothers movie -- I know I'm going to regret asking this, but -- where should I start?
Well, there's a question.
No, please. Just give me a title. Seriously.
Okay; people are going to tell you Duck Soup, but ignore them. Go with Night at the Opera.
Okay, Night at the Opera. Why?
First, it's easily their best movie just in terms of its writing, its direction, its setpieces. Second, the party of the second part shall be known as the party of the second part.
Oh, uh. So... I take it you're being referential again. Should I understand what you're saying?
Not really. Not yet.
This is why I never ask you anything.
You're really missing out.
