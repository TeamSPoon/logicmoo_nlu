Do you like any of the music from the 1980s?
Some of it, there were some good rock bands from the 1980s.
What bands were those?
I really liked Guns and Roses and Bon Jovi.
They were pretty good. Did you hear that Guns and Roses got back together and are on tour?
I did hear that. I saw a clip of one of their concerts on YouTube. They still sound pretty good.
What song was in the clip you saw?
It was November Rain. Somebody recorded it with a cell phone, the video wasn't great, but the audio was good.
I remember November Rain, it had a great guitar solo.
What's the name of the guitar player?
His name is Slash.  He went on to form a band called Velvet Revolver.
Velvet Revolver, wasn't that the band with the guy from Stone Temple Pilots?
Yes, his name was Scott Weiland.  I think he died not too long ago.
I heard he had died, never could get over his addiction to drugs. Seems to happen to a lot of rock stars.
Kind of like Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, and Janis Joplin.
Seems like most rock stars go through a period of drug abuse.
Yeah, I just read about Eric Clapton's addictions to heroin and alcohol.
It's amazing he survived. Lately, he's been using his fame to help other addicts.
I've heard some people say that musicians are more creative when they are high on drugs.
I've heard that too, but I don't believe it. There are plenty of musicians making great music that have never been addicted to drugs or alcohol.
