I want to go see the Mummy soon.
You mean the new movie with Tom Cruise in it?
Yes, it came out recently, and I heard it was pretty good.  I love the special effect looks.
That mummy's eyes are crazy with so many eyes in it!
Oh I know! I love thrillers m and this one looks so fun! I think the movie theater has it playing tomorrow at 5pm.
Who plays the Mummy?
Sofia Boutella plays the mummy, and does a great job from what I have heard.
Would you like me to go with you tomorrow?
Yes, that would be fun!
Ok, I will pick you up after work!
