I am so disapointed in Disney
Why
Because their movies
But what about their movies
They are just bad
No way
I dont mean all
Then what do you mean
Their new sequels
Some of them are not that bad
But they are so generic
is that a bad thing
Well yes
But why
Because they used to innovative
Sometimes you dont need innovation
But it should not be cliched to the point of boredom
I guess
No i am right
Possibly
