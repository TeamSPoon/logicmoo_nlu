Do you remember Outkast?
Of course. That was back when hip hop was still awesome.
I was just realizing how many hits they have. It's more than I thought.
I just remember "Roses". I used to love that song.
They also had that "Hey Ya" song.
Oh yeah. How could I forget that one?
"Ms. Jackson" was another really big one.
I forgot about that one too. I guess they did have a lot of hits.
I wonder what ever happened to them.
I think andre 3000 just does his own music now, for some reason.
