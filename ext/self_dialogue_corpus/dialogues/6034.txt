Did you see that interview with Tarentino on The Hateful 8?
No. How was it?
He totally bashed Disney.
Why?
Apparently his movie got pulled from a few cinemas.
What does Disney have to do with that?
They threatened theaters that if Star Wars didn't play in "x" amount of showings they'd pull it.
What bullies!
I'm still going to watch Episode VIII
Duh!
