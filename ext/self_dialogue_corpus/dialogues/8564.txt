I really loved Kesha's cover of  Zedd's True Colors.
I think it is the saddest thing ever. Makes me cry every time.
I think it's powerful. Especially the last chorus, it really feels like finally defeating your demons and surviving.
I never thought of it that way, but that's a really good point.
I hope her new album will contain less autotune and party songs and more emotional powerful ballads.
That would be great. Her voice really is amazing,
She did a live performance of Gaga's Till It Happens To You, that will blow you away.
I bet. That song is already emotionally charged, with Kesha's voice added to it, it must be incredible.
It is. Its one of my all time favorite cover songs.
I'll definitely make sure I check it out. Thank you for telling me about it!
