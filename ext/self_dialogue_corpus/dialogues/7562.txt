What death is the saddest do you think?
Dumbledore in Half-Blood Prince! I hated Snape for doing that!
I hated him too but then he was actually a good guy!
I wasn't expecting him to be good! I was ready to hate him!
Or what about when Hedwig was killed and fell from the sky?
That was so sad too. Harry was so upset, it was hard to watch.
Or Lupin and Tonks when they just had a baby?
At least he got to grow up not having Voldemort in his life!
Yes that is one good thing!
And Harry can take care of him!
