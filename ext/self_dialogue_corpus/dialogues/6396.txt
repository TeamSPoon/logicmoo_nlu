Did you know the Little Mermaid came out the same year we were born?
1989? Really?
Yeah, I was shocked to find that out. I swear I could have remembered it coming out when I was like five.
That's definitely around when I watched it for the first time. Thinking back, I don't remember seeing it in theaters though.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's weird to think it came out in 1989 though.
I know what you mean. I have this weird bias where I think that movies have improved so much within my lifetime, but it's kind of unfounded.
Right, I have that bias too, but I really think it's the technology that changed not the quality of movies so much.
I disagree, I think that there are way many more great Disney movies coming out today.
I guess you might be right. I really loved Ratatouille, Inside Out, and Moana.
Moana was fantastic. It really inspired my younger sister.
