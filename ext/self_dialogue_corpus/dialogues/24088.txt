Seen any good movies lately?
No, I haven't been to the movie theater in ages.
Yeah, me either but I'm stoked for the new transformer's movie.
I didn't know there was a new one.
Yeah it's The Last Knight.
Who's in that?
Mark Wahlberg and Anthoney Hopkins
Really? Is it a new series?
No it's the fifth movie in the series, but it takes place in the dark ages.
Really?  Aren't the others set in modern times?
The first three were.
Hmmm, I'll have to check it out.
Yeah they're really good.
Who directed them again it's some one big isn't it?
It's Michal Bay I think
Oh he did that bad boy's movies didn't he?
I think he did.
Those were really funny. Are the transformer's movies funny?
Yeah they are more serious but they have some really funny moments.
Cool, I'll check it out.
