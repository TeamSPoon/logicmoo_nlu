As insanely popular as the Star Wars movies are, episode one: The Phantom Menace was not a well received film. Why do you think that is?
Believe it or not, I don't think I have sat down and watched that entire movie. It just didn't really seem like that big of a must-see film to me.
I can see your point in that. I've seen it a couple of times and really don't think there is a ton going on.
I was never a huge fan of the idea of seeing such a young Anakin. I understood what they were going for, but it just didn't do much for me.
That being said, what kind of problems have you heard about that movie?
The big things I've heard that hurt the movie are the young actor who plays Anakin is said to have been very "wooden" and the CGI looks bad.
Those are both problems I've also heard and agree with. I also felt Qui-gon was killed pretty anti-climatically.
I have watched that clip of YouTube. The fight scene wasn't bad, but his death came out no where to me.
Agreed. I think long-time fans who have seen the original, maybe have known it was coming, but it still wasn't very strong.
And if memory serves, we never see him again. Not even in a vision or flashback.
