I'm going to the Lakers game tonight. Do you want to come with?
Sure. What time does it start?
Around 7. They're playing against the Cavaliers.
That should be a good match up.
Sounds like it. I miss the days of Kobe and Shaq, though.
Those were epic times in basketball.
Yeah, I don't think we'll see anything like it again.
There's plenty of young talent out there.
I know, but I just don't get as thrilled as I used to.
Then why do you still watch them play?
Because I'm a fan. It's my duty to support the team.
Not me. I dropped the Bulls like a bad habit after Jordan left.
That's because you're not a fan of the team. You're a fan of a player.
That player made the team what it was and no one's been able to do it since.
Well, maybe you're right.
Of course I am. What time are you picking me up?
I want to get there early so be ready by 6.
What seats did you snag?
Third row.
Pretty good. Should be a fun evening.
