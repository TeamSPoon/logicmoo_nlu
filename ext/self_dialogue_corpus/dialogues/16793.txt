What's the best concert you've ever seen?
That's hard to say. I will say that when I saw ZZ Top, they were amazing. They played for two hours straight.
Aren't they in their 90s or something.
Probably. But they could still rock. And you realized just how many hits they had, going back decades.
Fun trivia fact: their first tour was opening act for Jimi Hendrix.
That is amazing.
I saw Bon Jovi when they were an opening act, hardly anybody had really heard of them.
That's funny. Who did they open for?
Ratt.
Wow. Now that's some old 80s hair-metal. I got to see KISS, which was cool.
Cool! Were they all dressed up and in makeup?
No, unfortunately this was after they gave that up.
Oh, you mean from their "I was made for lovin' you" days.
Hey, I'm sure you saw some less than awesome concerts.
At a casino once,  just happened to stumble into a Molly Hatchet concert.
Molly Hatchet is still around?
Yep, and they were trying to rock.
Trying but not succeeding?
Definitely not succeeding. But they still had their groupies there.
That gives me a terrible mental image.
