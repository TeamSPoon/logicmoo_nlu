Do you know how to play basketball?
A little bit but I do not know all of the rules. Do you want to teach me more?
Sure I can teach you a few of the rules what do you want to know?
What is traveling?
Traveling occurs when rather than dribbling the basketball you hold the ball while still moving or taking steps.
So can I take any steps when holding the ball
Yes, you can take two steps when holding the ball. At which point you must shoot or pass the ball.
So how do the points work in basketball?
Typically the points in basketball are 2 points and 3 points. 2 points are awarded for most baskets.
How do you get 3 points in the game?
Three points are provided in a basketball game when you make a basket from behind the three point line. This is further away from the basketball hoop.
So it could be a risk trying to make 3-point shots I guess.
There are also penalties in basketball. A penalty may occur when a player pushes another player, a foul.
What happens when a penalty occurs?
Depending on the location of the penalty, penalty shots may be awarded.
What is a penalty shot?
A penalty shot provides the player that was fouled with two shots into the hoop from the top of the key. The other players must stand on the side of the key and not defend their basket.
Sounds like penalty shots could allow a team to make lots of points.
Each penalty shot is only worth 1 point. Typically if you make the first shot you get a second shot opportunity.
So the three ways to make points are regular 2-point shots, 3-point shots, and penalty shots?
