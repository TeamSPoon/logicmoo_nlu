No I never learned!
i taught my granddaughter how to play.
What songs can she play?
Well really only one, Smoke on the Water.
That is a good song, I think everyone learns to play that.
Yea Me too.
Who did that song anyway?
Deep Purple.
Oh yea, they were good.
Of course, they were a seventies band.

Yes he was.
He was a good guitar player.
