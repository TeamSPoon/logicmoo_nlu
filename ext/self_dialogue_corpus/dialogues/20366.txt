Have you ever watched when Harry met Sally?
No I never have,
Really I can't believe it.
I'm not a big fan of Billy Crystal.
But you have to love Meg Ryan.
Of course I do she is really quirky.
The first one is better than the second one.
That is what I have heard.
Most people have heard about the dinner scene.
Yes that is true.
I like Billy Crystal I thought he was really funny in City Slickers.
I did watch that with my husband and thought it was alright.
Then you would really like When Harry met Sally it is much better in my opinion.
I have thought about watching it but have never got around to it.
We should pull it up on Net Flix and watch it together sometime.
That sounds like fun.
How about next Saturday night at my house since my husband will be working late.
Sounds good.
Great you bring the wine.
See you then.
