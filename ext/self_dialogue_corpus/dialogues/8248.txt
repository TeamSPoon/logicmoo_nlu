Do you know the pop band OK GO?
Yeah! I saw some of their music videos.
Their videos are so creative!
My favorite one is for the song "Upside Down & Inside Out." It is so cool!
That one is great. I also love "The One Moment" video
The colors they use in that video are really beautiful.
I agree! And the way that they shot it is very interesting too.
Did they do it all in one take?
I believe that they did!
Wow! They must have been working with some very talented producers and directors.
