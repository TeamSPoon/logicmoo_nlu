Can  you think of any recent Disney movies that spawned hit songs?
Well, Disney often has really catchy songs.  But the only one that comes to mind is "Paint with all the colors of the wind"
That was from  Pochahontas,right?
Yeah, I think that was it.  The one with the Indian and the Pilgrim
Yeah, that was like, the mid 90's
Who sang that song anyway?  It wasn't the movie version that made the charts, was it?
Wasn't it Vanessa Williams?
Yeah, but those movies have had some great songs.  Like Let it Go from Frozen?
Or most of the songs from The Little Mermaid
Heck,going back to Snow White there were some great songs!  Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to work we go...
