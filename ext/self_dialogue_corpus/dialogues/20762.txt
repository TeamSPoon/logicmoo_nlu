I saw Citizen Kane for film class.
Now that's a real Orson Welles classic.
A lot of people think it is the best movie ever made.
It was based on a newspaper publisher, right?
Actually, three people - William Randolph Hearst,  Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick.
Wow.  What was the name of Welles' group?
The Mercury players.
Who were they?
Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins, Erskine Sanford, and Everett Sloane, to name a few.
Cool.  Who played the blonde bimbo?
Dorothy Comingore
Who played the first wife?
Ruth Warrick, who later was in All My Children.
Wow.  Who played the little Jewish guy?
Everett Sloane.
Who plays the reporter?
William Alland.
He never found the meaning of Kane's "Rosebud".
No, he never did.
It was the sled.
