Who is your favorite female singer lately?
Lately, I would have to say it is Pink.
I like her too.  She seems pretty edgy and bold.
I know!  She seems like she is not afraid to speak her mind.
Have you ever been to one of her concerts?
No.  I hear they are amazing.
I saw her perform on one of those awards shows once.  If her shows are anything like that, they must be incredible.
She really seems to go all out!
She sure does!  In this one, she was doing some sort of aerial acrobatics.
Whoa!  That sounds wonderful.
And she just recently had a baby!
She must be very busy.
I think she must be!  I don't know how she does it.
What is your favorite song?
It has to be "just give me a reason".  Do you remember who she sang that one with?
Wasn't it Owl City?
Yes!  They are pretty good, too.
Yes they are!  This was one of my favorites.
I like the ballads, but I really like the edgier ones best.
Yes, that is what she is known for, I guess.  Being edgy.
