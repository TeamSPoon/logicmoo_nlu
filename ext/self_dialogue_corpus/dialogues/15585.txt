One of my favorite artists of all time is Jeff Rosenstock.
He has more talent than I imagined.
We Cool was an independent release.
How did he fund it?
He asked fans to pay what they could.
Thats what rock needs, more DIY ethics.
Yeah and he embodies them all.
I wish more bands were like that.
I think that he also tours alot right?
Yeah its the way for him to make money.
I like artists that follow this mindset.
Yeah it makes their stories more interesting.
What is his best song?
I think Nauseau is what draws fans in.
Does he play all the instruments?
He does when he records the albums.
Then he has a touring band?
Yeah because its impossible to do everything.
Have you seen him live?
Yeah he does a sax solo while crowd surfing, its pretty cool!
