So do you ever listen to the radio?
Very rarely...
Why not?
Most of it is so bland and boring.
I know what you mean.  I heard that the language and complexity has been devolving over the years.
It must be from what I'm hearing...
You must like something?
Taylor Swift writes some good songs...and I like Sia a little.
I know a few of each of their songs but not much.  How about the new Gwen Stefani album?
I haven't heard any of the songs on the radio but there are a few good tunes.
Didn't she dedicate it to her new boyfriend?
Yes, but I can't recall his name.  I know he's a country singer and they're both on The Voice...
I don't really watch that but I do like the album.
It was just alright for me.  Why do you like it?
It was so dance-able!
That really is her wheelhouse!  She also has quite an alluring voice.
Yes, there's something so sensual about it.
Agreed.  I'll have to give it another listen.
She looks so young too!
I know!  I hope I look that good at her age!
