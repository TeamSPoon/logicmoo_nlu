Have you listened to any Lionel Richie songs lately?
I have actually! I listened to 'Hello' just yesterday.
I have been listening to him as well.  I love 'Hello.'
Me too. Adele may have stolen his title.
Haha, that's funny.  I think 'My Love' is such a classic.
That song is actually my parents' love song!
Aw how sweet. It's a great wedding song.
I agree. He is a legend.
What about Kenny Rogers?
He is my jam! I love his song, 'Lady.'
He is my parents' favorite! Their wedding song was 'Through the Years.'
Wow, our parents have really great taste.
Haha, I think you are right.
Kenny is like what I listened to in my childhood.
Do you listen to Dolly Parton?
From time to time I do! I really like 'Jolene.'
That song is pretty classic.  I like '9 to 5.'
I forgot about '9 to 5!' Wow, time sure does fly by.
It does, sooner or later we will be seniors.
I'm not ready yet! Let's just enjoy the classics.
