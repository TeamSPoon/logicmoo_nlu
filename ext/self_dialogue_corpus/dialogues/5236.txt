Did you see the live action of The Jungle Book?
I did. That movie was intense in some scenes but really good.
I found it interesting that they had Kaa as a female in this one verses the cartoon version.
Yes but 	Scarlett Johansson's version made Kaa's voice sound very scary as the snake was trying to eat Mowgli.
I was sad though when Shere Khan killed Akela.
I was too. Shere Khan was definitely fearsome and intimidating compared to the animated version.
King Louie was pretty entertaining.
I liked him a lot but I wasn't expecting him to be so huge.
I also really liked Baloo and Bagheera's banter a lot.
Yeah those two were really great in their performance.
