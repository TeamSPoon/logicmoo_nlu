I have loved pop music since I was pretty young.
I have to! Who was your favorite growing up?
I loved listening to Britney Spears music when I was 11.
I really liked her original music back in those days.
Yes me too!
She was pure and wholesome back then.
I'm not as big of a fan of her music now.
I'm not either. Did you like 98 degrees?
Wasn't that a pop boy band back in the late 90's?
Yes it was and they were great!
