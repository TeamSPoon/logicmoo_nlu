Do you think you'll go see the new Cars movie?
Yes! My son loves those movies!
I heard it was pretty good. Let me know what you think of it.
I think we might go this weekend. It's nice to go to the movies when it's hot outside.
I agree!  I love to sit in the air conditioning when it's so hot.
I saw the first two Cars movies and I liked them a lot.
They are pretty good. We visited Disneyland recently and the Cars world was my favorite part.
It looks so real!  You feel like you're in the movie.
It's amazing how they can create something that seems so real.
I hope they add a Moana area to Disneyland.
That was such a good movie!
I love the music. We listen to the soundtrack often.
I can't wait to see what Disney releases this November.
I think it's a movie about Mexico.
They usually release the best ones during the holidays.
I agree!  I love taking the kids to the movies on the day after Thanksgiving.
We have that tradition too!
It's usually crowded but you can buy your tickets ahead of time.
I'll have to try that!  We usually wait in line.
Try it!  It saves time.
