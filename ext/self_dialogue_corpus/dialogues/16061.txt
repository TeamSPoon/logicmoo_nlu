Have you heard of Twenty One Pilots?
Just this past year. I enjoy them.
Which song do you like most?
I think blurryface. It has such a catchy chorus.
It is actually called stressed out.
Oh. My bad. I just love the line,My name's Blurryface and I care what you think.
I think a lot of people get mixed up on the actually title of this song.
I also thought the line, good old days, was good dope days .. at first.
Hahaha either one actually works well. Maybe you should join the band.
Thanks. I wish but I'll stick to my day job.
I really liked the Heathens song of theirs.
It was in suicide squad right?
Yes, best part of the movie.. I think it ran at the credits only though.
I liked that song too. Heathens has such a sultry moody vibe and I love it.
They have some interesting melodies in it, it is like melancholy yet sensual somehow like you said.
I am looking forward to them putting out more songs soon.
I hope they do sooner than later. Did you see them at that awards ceremony in their underwear?
No, why were they in underwear?
Pretty adorable actually. They won took of their pants and said due to a prior saying if they won they would accpet in their undies.
They are young, adorable and talented.
