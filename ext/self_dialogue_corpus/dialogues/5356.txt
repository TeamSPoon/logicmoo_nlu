Did you just love The Lone Ranger?
Yeah absolutely. Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, totally awesome together.
No kidding.
The only thing was it was such a long movie.
Some of Depp's antics fell flat too.
I think he was miscast.
I think he said something publicly to this effect.
But I think Armie was spot on in his role.
The final train scene went on way too long for my taste.
They must have been trying to top all previous western train scenes!
