Do you like Tony Bennet's music?
Yes, I do!
He has been around for so long but he has become popular again.
It's great isn't it!
Yes, did you hear the song he did with Lady Gaga?
Yes, I love it.
I would love to see him in concert.
Me too! Is he touring?
I'm not sure. I think he may have a show in Vegas
That would be fantastic to see.
His music is so smooth and mellow and his voice is still so awesome.
I know, he has really aged well.
I wish Sinatra was still around.
I saw him in concert in his later years.
How was that?
Kind of sad, his voice had really taken a hit. He did not sound great.
It's interesting how some of their voices age and others not as much.
Yes, I think smoking may have something to do with it.
That generation of singers had such a great sound.
Glad some of them are still around.
