Have you ever happen to see the movie Dumbo, which had been made in 1941 by Walt Disney!
Dumbo, yes i have seen that movie few years ago.
Dumbo was a baby elephant, who was growing up with a circus performing team.
Yes i remember that, Dumbo had quite a larger ears than other elephants right?
Yes thats right, all the time he was thinking its really hard to manage his larger ears.
Yeah i was also wondering why he has such a larger ears when i was watching the movie for the first time.
Everyone thinks the same i guess, his larger ears was noticable all through the movie.
And but it has really inspiring climax, it is such a beautiful story told in a brilliant way!
You are right, Have you seen it till the end?
Yes i did, and it gave me goose bumps when the baby Elephant flew using his larger ears as wings!
