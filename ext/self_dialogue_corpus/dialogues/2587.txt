Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cleveland Browns.
They had a rough season.
Tell me about it. They only won one game.
Do you think they will be better this year?
They should be a lot better. They signed some good free agents and had a good draft.
Who did they take in the first round of the draft this year.
They drafted three players, Myles Garrett, David Njoku, and Jarbill Peppers.
Those guys were all very good in college.
Hopefully they are good enough to help turn the team around.
Have they found their quarterback yet?
I sure hope so.
Who do you think will start at quarterback for them this year.
I think it's between Cody Kessler and Deshone Kizer.
Deshone Kizer went to Notre Dame, didn't he?
Yes he did. The Browns took him in the second round.
Who do you think their best player is?
I would say that it would have to be Joe Thomas.
He has been there for a very long time.
It's hard to believe, but he has never missed a game.
