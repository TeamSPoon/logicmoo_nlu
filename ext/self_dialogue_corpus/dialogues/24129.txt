Hey. I'm looking for a movie about food?
Why about food?
Well, I'm taking a home-ec course, and I need to write an essay on food.
Hmm I don't know. Supersize me?
What's that about?
It's about Mcdonalds, and specifically a guy who eats it every day for a month.
Jeez. That sounds terrible.
Right? He even threw up on tape.
Eww. That's gross.
Yeah. Maybe you don't want to watch.
Is it interesting?
As far as documentaries go, it was pretty alarming
Oh yeah. I bet there's lots of stuff about McDonalds that I don't want to know
Maybe it'll be good if you know
Agreed. I think I'm going to watch it.
Hey, by the way...
What's up?
Want to get Mcdonalds?
Sure.
One last time before I find out what's really in their burgers.
