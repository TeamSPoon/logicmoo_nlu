What did you think of Rogue One?
I thought it was a pretty good movie.
It definitely filled in a lot of information that was intregal to the original movie.
I thought the action scenes were pretty good and very classic.
I thought the heroine was a lot like Rey.
I think Star Wars really likes having a strong female character.
Yes, but they do kind of seem alike, don't they?
I still thought it was neat that they CGIed Leia into the movie, despite her passing.
Do you think they will do that in the future? how will they explain her death in Episode 8?
I don't know, but Han is gone too, now. I wonder if they still would have killed him off if they had known.
