The last few Disney movies haven't been that good.
Please tell me you didn't just say that!
I did and I meant it! Come on. Moana was the only decent flick.
What about Secret Life of Pets?
Literally put me to sleep.
Yikes, okay. Zootopia?
Cute, but they could have done better. Really pushed the envelope.
What's your all time favorite Disney movie, then, Mr. Snob?
Oliver & Company
You're ridiculous
