I just watched The Hateful Eight.
How did you find it?
I loved it . Quentin is a genius.
You have to give the actors their due credit.
True. Samuel L. Jackson has become a mainstay in Quentin's movies
I think the movies couldn't be the same if they cast someone else in the roles he plays.
Yes. He is so vibrant and always adaptive.
And dynamic too.
True. Could you watch this movie again?
Most certainly, though not within this year.
I have watched all Quentin Tarantino movies and I think this is way up there with the best.
I think Kill Bill is better.
I honestly don't see how
Character development is better in Kill Bill.
I think you just love Uma Thurman .
Who doesn't? She is a brilliant actress.
Is she your favorite?
I can't say that. I do'nt even have a favorite .
Why is that?
I think actors are somewhat confined to portray what writers want in the way that directors want them to.
