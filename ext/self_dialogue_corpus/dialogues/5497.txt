I really want to watch Wall-E again.
Why?
I remember that it had a big emotional impact on me, but I don't remember too much of the plot.
I love Wall-E--it had two settings.
The "dump" where Wall-E lived was one, right?
Yep--the other was a spaceship full of humans.
Oh yeah! The people couldn't move on their own--let's hope that's not prophetic!
I know, right?
I also remeber there was a romance...
Yeah, with Eva! How could you forget her?
