Are you ready for the start of the season?
Yes I am!
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the Patriots will repeat as Super Bowl champs.
Isn't Tom Brady getting a little old?
He's still in the prime of his career.
Who do you think is the underdog team to make the playoffs?
I like the 49ers.
What about the Titans?
They could do it.
Do you think Marcus Mariota could get MVP?
Nope, I think Brady will get it again.
Do you think about any team besides the Patriots?
There isn't another team worth thinking about.
There are plenty of other teams worth thinking about.
Not with 6 Super Bowl Rings.
What about the Steelers, Cowboys, or 49ers?
They still don't have 6 Superbowl Rings.
I think the Titans will win it all.
We'll see at the end of the season.
