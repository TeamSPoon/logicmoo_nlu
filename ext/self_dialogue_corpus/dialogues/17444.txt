What was you favorite band when you were growing up?
I used to love the  Beatles.
But they were even before our time!
I know but I really liked them and got very involved in their story.
Who was your favorite?
John Lennon. I used to dream of meeting him.
How old were you when he died?
I was 15, it was devastating. It kind of still is.
What was your favorite song?
I thought 'Yesterday' was haunting and beautiful.
You don't thing so anymore?
I found out Paul wrote it almost exclusively, so I decided I did not l like it anymore.
What is your favorite album?
Everyone says Sgt. Pepper but I think it's overrated.
So which one do you think is best?
I really loved 'Rubber Soul' but no one else seems to.
I don't even know that one.
Revolver is pretty good too. I like Help! best of their movies.
What is your favorite song now?
You've got to hide your love away. I love the way he sings it and it makes me think about what he was going through publicly at the time.
