I love football and can't wait for the season to start.
We usually have our fantasy football draft on labor day weekend.
That sounds like fun!
We hold two drafts, one at noon and one at five.
I'm looking forward to watching the games on Sunday afternoon with family.
We have NFL ticket so we catch all of the games.
I think the Saints will be tough this year.
I agree, I love Brees and Sean Peyton is a great coach.
I think they will be tough, they picked up Adrian Peterson, he'll be good in a rotation with Ingram.
My sleeper team is the Packers this year.
They do have Rodgers!
Besides Rodgers, they have great receivers and their defense is underated.
I'm thinking the Giants will surprise this year.
They have one of the best defenses in the league.
In addition, they added Marshall which will open that offense up.
He's a huge addition.
Eli Manning's been there before - he knows how to win.
I love teams with great defenses.  They always seem to do well in the playoffs.
They are a little sketchy on running back with Perkins.
Who needs to run when you have OBJ and Marshall...
