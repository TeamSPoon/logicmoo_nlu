I saw The Parent Trap last night.
The original or the reboot?
The 1961 original.
I loved Hayley Mills in that.
Maureen O'Hara was lovely as well.
Vicky Robinson was great as the fiancee.
She played a role in the fiancee's mom in the reboot.
Cool. Who was the minister?
The great Leo G. Carroll.
He was great in North by Northwest.
