Free throw shooting is terrible in the league anymore
Why do you think that happened
Guys dont care about shooting
That cant be true
Sure it is, look how many guys just drive the lane
Then you have guys like Steph Curry
OK and thats one guy
I see where you are trying to corner me
Not that, its just hes one example out of 150 you can come up with.
Well its important to know theres no way guys cant shoot.
Teams are always searching for shooters.
I think the Sixers are example one of that.
Yeah they need a scorer but more importantly a scoring guard
I have seen Embiid throw up 3s
I am sure the team hates that
He can get back on defense quicker
But then you have your guards trying to rebound.
If theres a better method tell me
Thats not what I am here to do.
Well the NBA needs better shooters I can say that
