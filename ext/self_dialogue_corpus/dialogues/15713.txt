What's your favorite genre of music?
I really like progressive metal.
What's that? I've heard of progressive rock and metal, but not progressive metal.
It's basically just those two things put together.
Cool, but how does that work?
Well, you start with heavy metal, and then you add some of the wilder time signatures and song structures found in progressive rock.
Okay, I think I've got it. It's more like Metallica than Yes or Genesis?
Yes, most of the time. Though there are some bands like King Crimson that have approached from a more progressive rock angle.
Okay, that makes sense. I had always thought of King Crimson as progressive rock.
They mostly are, though they stretch to progressive metal sometimes.
Okay. So what are some of your favorite bands?
I really like Dream Theater and Symphony X.
Oh, I think I've heard of Dream Theater. Haven't they been really popular lately?
They have. Their last few albums were top 10 hits.
And they have all those crazy song structures and time signatures you were talking about?
They do. They write some of the most complicated songs in the genre.
It's weird that they've gotten so popular with that type of music. Why do you think it's happened?
Well, with file sharing services, I think bands really have to offer something extra in order to get people to buy their albums.
You mean like more complicated songs?
Exactly.
