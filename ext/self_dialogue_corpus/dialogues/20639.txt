Do you like animated movies?
It depends on what the genre is.
Did you like the South Park movie or the Simpsons movie?
Yes I enjoyed both of those. However I do not like animated movies for children.
Yes I agree I could never get myself to watch the Dora The Explorer Movie.
That is also an animated movie I could never watch.
I know I would definitely reccomend it to my friend's little kids but never with my bestfriends would I put that movie on.
It would almost be embarrassing to be at a party and suggest that everyone should watch the Dora The Explorer movie.
I don't want to be that guy!
There are some animated movies made for kids that I do enjoy however.
Could you give me some examples?
Up was a great animated film with a good story.
Yes I have heard from people that is a good movie.
It is and I reccomend you watch it when you get the chance.
Shrek is another great animated movie.
It definitely is I enjoyed all three installments.
Yeah that is a movie all audiences can enjoy.
It is definitely good to have movies that appeal to everybody.
Yes that can solve some arguments quickly.
Definitely or prevent them to begin with when you put on a movie everyone can enjoy!
