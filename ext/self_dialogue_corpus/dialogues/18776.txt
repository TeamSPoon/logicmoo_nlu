I've been into contemporary classical music lately.
Oh yeah? Like who?
Well, I bought The Essential Yo-Yo Ma, and I've just been listening to it over and over and over.
What do you like about it so much?
He's got a great range of styles. He can do western and eastern music equally well.
That sounds like something I'd like.
Probably. I've discovered it's really tough to find artists that do classical stuff that I like.
Hmm. What else are you listening to?
A lot of downtempo hip-hop, some post-rock, anything I can find that's ambient.
So stuff like Explosions in the Sky?
Exactly that sort of thing. Anything calm or relaxing.
Why are you so attracted to music that's like that.
Most of the time, when I listen to music, I'm also doing some kind of work.
So it doesn't distract you.
Yeah, it just kind of lulls me into a rhythm.
I wish I could work like that. My brain is too active.
So what do you listen to when you're working then?
Mostly up-beat pop songs. They make me feel peppy.
That would distract me so much!
Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
