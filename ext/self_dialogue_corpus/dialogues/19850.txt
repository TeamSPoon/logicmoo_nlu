Why dont more female fronted bands exist?
Tough question to be honest
Do you think they all sound the same?
I could get into trouble answering that one.
I believe there is a sort of generic sound they emit.
I dont believe thats entirely true but I can see where you would think that.
If I had to pick my druthers I would say they sound too close to one another.
I agree there is a lack of variety in most of the music they create.
If some female artists end up succeeding they make them solo artists.
That sounds bizarre.
Yeah I know but they have the sex appeal in my opinion.
Yeah I guess I can hanker on that one.
Paramore was or is a great band.
I dont know if they still make music.
They definitely do I think their time passed though a bit while back.
So they have short shelf lives?
It appears to be the answer.
Geez that doesnt bode well for the up and coming acts.
Its just the nature of the music industry.
But chewing out and spitting out stinks no matter male or female
