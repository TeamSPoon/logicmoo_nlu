I don't like when people try to predict how every NFL team will do beforehand
Why not?
I don't know. It takes the fun out of it.
Do you play fantasy football?
No. That also takes the fun out of it.
It certainly gets involved.
I like the predictions that the Bills will do well this year
I've always liked them as a team.
I remember they went to the superbowl against the cowboys when I was a kid
Who won?
The cowboys
Oh, that's dissapointing
Yeah. I think the Dolphins will do well this year
Me too. I never liked Dan Marino
Who is their new quarterback?
Matt Moore
Is he a big guy?
He's 6'3"
That seems about average
He's a good player
