We are planning a Mike Judge marathon soon, are you interested?
You just planning on watching a bunch of his movies?
Yea, Beavis and Butthead, Office Space, and Idiocracy.
No Extract in there?
That movie was terrible.
Yea, I agree glad you aren't watching it.
We will be getting together Sunday, care to join?
I would love to, been meaning to watch Office Space again.
That movie is way too good.
One of the all time greats in my mind.
Idiocracy was really good too.
It is hilarious how accurately it portrayed American culture.
It even seems that some of what he brought up came true.
That is the thing about Judge, it seems like he really captures what life is like for different people.
And yet, his work varies so much, from the tech world to government and politics, to living in the South.
Yea, he sure is a talented dude.
Anyways, see you Sunday then?
Sounds good, when should I arrive?
I would say around noon time, we can eat lunch and start.
Sounds great, see you then!
