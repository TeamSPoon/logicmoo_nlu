Have you heard of the movie The Fifth Wave?
I even read the book.
It was a book? I didn't know that.
The 5th Wave is a young adult, science fiction novel.
When was it published?
The novel was published in 2013 and is the first installment in The 5th Wave trilogy.
Oh. Well I just watched the movie on cable a few hours ago.
How did you like it?
I thought the book was was better than the movie.
It being a book is probably why I didn't like it too tough.
Why do you say that?
The movie felt rushed and like it was missing something.
I think a lot of people didn't like it when it first came out. They felt the story line was generic apocalyptic science fiction.
It felt a lot like an uninspired fusion of Independence Day and the TV mini-series "V".
But with a bad twist, right?
Yeah. The 5th Wave felt more as if it were cobbled together from a host of other, better science fiction stories.
I think it could have been done better.
That is what happens when Hollywood doesn't follow a book exactly as it was written.
I hate it when they do that. Just follow the book and it will be good.
They don't know how.
