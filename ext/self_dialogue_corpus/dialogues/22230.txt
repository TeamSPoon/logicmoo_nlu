I miss seeing jackie chan in movies
What do you mean
I mean he does not play in movies that much anymore
He does a little though even if it is not much
It is not the same though the movies he does now are not that great
They are far from bad movies though
But they pale in comparison to his old movies
I mean you know he might not like that stuff anymore
Have you ever seen Half a loaf of kung fu and legend of the drunken master they are both classics
I have seen them and they are pretty good even if they are dated
Well they are older movies how would they not be dated.
I am not meaning it like it is a bad thing though
I guess so but using words like dated make it sound bad
Nah they are not bad at all they are pretty awesome
Those are the kinds of movies i miss though you dig me.
Well yeah i get that but you know the torch has been passed on to younger actors
Their is hardly any actors like him out their anymore though
But their are some good kung fu actors out their you cannot deny
Well yeah i mean i cannot deny obvious facts
Exactly it is the truth!
