What do you think of Jimmy Buffett?
I absolutely love him and his music.
He does have some really neat songs.
Oh, his music is all happy tunes!
His music makes me feel good.
I am a beach person, and his music is beach type music.
It sure it is and makes me want to dance!
Have you ever been to one of his concerts?
I did a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely.
Where did you see him in concert?
It was in Las Vegas at the MGM.
Really?  Lucky you!
We were invited to the pre-concert pool party at the MGM.
I am sure that was a blast!
I was amazed at how some of the people were dressed in their Buffet outfits.
Oh yearh, some of them really get into the grass skirts, the beach hats.
If we would have known, Ray and I would have dressed up more like lot of the others.
You still had lots of fun; even not being dressed up in Parrot Head clothes?
We definitely did.  If we ever have another chance to see another of Buffett's concerts, we will go for sure.
If you find out he will be in concert anywhere near us, let me know.
