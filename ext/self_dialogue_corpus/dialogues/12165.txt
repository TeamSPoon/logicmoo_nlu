So you know any good Star Wars trivia?
Oh, a few things yeah... for instance, you noticed in the prequels how Mace Windu's lightsaber is purple?
Yeah, that's like the only purple lightsaber we've seen in the films so far.
Well, that was Samuel L Jackson's request.  He asked Lucas if he could get a purple, but didn't find out until seeing the movie that Lucas actually granted his request.
Oh, that's pretty cool.  Hey, here's a good one... the movie The Force Awakens takes place thirty year after Return of the Jedi, right?
Uh... I guess... not too familiar with the chronology.
Well, it does.  And get this, The Force Awakens was released 32 years and 7 months after Return of the jedi.
Wow... that's pretty neat.  You got that from IMDB didn't you?
Guilty as charged.
Ha!
