Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't seen it yet.
I want to go see it so bad!  It looks amazing!  I love Captain Jack!
I love those movies, should we make a plan to go together?
Yes I would love to, I'll get the tickets for us!  I can't wait to see Javier Bardem in this new movie!
Oh I forgot he plays the villain!  He is a great actor!
Yes I enjoy watching him, so shall we go next week?
Yes that sounds like a great plan.  If you will grab the tickets I will pay for the snacks!
Great, can't wait!
See you then!
