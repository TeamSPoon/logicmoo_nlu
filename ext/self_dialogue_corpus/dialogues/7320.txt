I saw Fantasia on Netfix last night.
I remember that my Aunt Catherine took me to that when I was around 4 years old.
Did you like it?
I remember being really afraid when the brooms came to life and were putting buckets of water all over the place.
That scared you?
Hey, I was a little kid. Yes it scared me.
Did you tell your Auntie you were scared?
No, I didn't want her to feel bad for taking me to the movie.
That was nice of you.
She recently died so I now look back at it as a good experience because she and I were together.
