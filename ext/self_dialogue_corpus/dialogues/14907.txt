What's the funniest Pixar movie?
I would probably say the Cars franchise.
You must be crazy.  Those were awful.
No they weren't.  You didn't like Mater?
Of course not.  He's a bad caricature of a hillbilly.
You're reading way too much into this.
No I'm not.  He's a bad stereotype locked into a bad movie.
It's not a bad movie!  You just don't get humor.
I think you're the one who doesn't get it.  Cars?  Yuck.
'Get er dun!
