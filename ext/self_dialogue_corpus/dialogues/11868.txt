Just sitting here listening to Breakfast with the Beatles..It's on on Sunday mornings on the local rock station. Good Stuff.
Oh yeah, I don't know much about the Beatles. They're pretty old right.
Yeah, they've been around a long time, but their songs are so classic. Hey Jude is one of my favorites.
I love the song Yesterday...that's them right?
Yep, they had a ton of good songs, although some times they got a little wierd.
What do you mean?
Well there is one called "I am the eggman" at least I think that's what it is, and it is strange. Literally they say "I am the eggman, I am the walrus..coo coo coo choo"
WTH? Really? They must have been on some serious stuff.
Maybe, it was the 60's after all. I know alot of people say John Lennon was a drug user.
Didn't he get shot?
