Who is in the NBA playoffs?
I think it's the Warriors and the Spurs.
Oh cool.  I'm not a fan of either team.
Yeah, me either but I enjoy watching basketball.
The game the other night was good I heard.
Yeah it was awesome.  Great shots, high scores.
Awesome.
Both teams are really talented.
Who is winning in the series?
I think the Warriors right now but it's anyone's game.
OK cool.  I used to watch the Bulls back in the day.
Oh yeah, Michael's hay day was awesome.
Him, Pippin, Armstrong and Rodman.  Classic.
They were great together, that's for sure.
I don't think that can ever be duplicated.
Well Kobe tried.
I suppose so.  I don't think it's the same.
Die hard Chicago fan?
Nah, not really.  I just marvel at MJ's talent.
Well there will never be another Michael Jordan.
