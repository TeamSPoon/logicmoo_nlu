Hey what was your favorite parts about New Hope?
Gosh, so many. Maybe Mos Eisley?
What about the trench run with x-rings.
Yeah that was cool too.
And the parts with sneaking on the death star.
Oh yeah, like when they're saving princess Leia
Yeah and they pretended Chubacca was a prisoner.
Haha yeah, and the trash compactor monster.
Yeah but hey R2D2 saves them.
