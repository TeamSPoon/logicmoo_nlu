I hope Disney has a new movie coming out soon. I'm sick of watching Moana with my little one.
I don't know when their next film comes out but I know they just finished filming a Mary Poppins reboot.
Who is starring in that?
Emily Blunt is Mary Poppins and Lin-Manuel Miranda is playing Bert
The guy from Hamilton? That should be great!
I think so too! I also read that he is going to be Sebastian the crab in the live action Little Mermaid remake.
They must be out of ideas since they are remaking everything.
Probably so. I know they are doing a remake of the Lion King that way too.
That's such a classic! I don't know why they would bother remaking it.
I guess nostalgia makes big bucks.
