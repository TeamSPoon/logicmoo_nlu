Have you heard of Lady Gaga's song Born This Way?
Yes, she wrote it because she was inspired by the 90's music that empowered LGBT community and women.
All of her sounds seems eccentric but good.
Yes, her music is very powerful and sends a message with each song.
What other songs of hers do you like?
I like her song Paparazzi.
I heard the song comes in different chords.
I think it's in the E-chord but I also her it acoustically as well.
I only heard it on the piano.
She is a good pianist and play it in most of her songs.
