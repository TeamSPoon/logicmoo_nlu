Do you know if Lady Gaga has a new album coming out soon?
I haven't heard anything about it, but I wish that she would release something soon. She's one of my favorites.
Her songs are so catchy, but heartfelt. I love hearing them when I go to the club.
I know! "Bad Romance" was my favorite when it first came out.
I think she's different from the other pop divas, because her style is so out-there at times.
Yeah, she definitely pushes the limits of what you can do in pop culture.
What was that song she did with Beyonce?
Oh! You mean "Telephone"?
That's the one! That song was awesome.
It sure was! Man, I hope she releases a new album soon.
