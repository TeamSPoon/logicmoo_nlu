I see Netflix has added a couple of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
I'm really glad, I think it's past due.
Are you a fan?
I am, I'm a big fan especially of the first one. It's kind of nostalgic for me cause I remember watching it as a young kid and being enthralled, even though I had recurring nightmares about Freddy Kreuger.
That's kind of ironic. And I'm surprised your parents let you watch it.
Yeah, I remember seeing it at like 7 years old! I'm surprised cause I didn't remember the nudity and other stuff that was in it until I rewatched it again recently.
"other stuff" like Robert Englund.
He did a fantastic job portraying Freddy!
Hence giving you nightmares.
Yeah, but I forgive him. I'm really glad he, Heather Langenkamp and Wes Craven got to come back and play themselves in New Nightmare.
