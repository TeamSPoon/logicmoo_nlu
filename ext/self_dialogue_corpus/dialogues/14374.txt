So, which teams should blow it up?
Clearly, the Pacers. I just don't think they have the ability to convince PG to stay
Agreed, their best chance is to convince the Lakers to give up a good piece to acquire George
Would the Lakers actually do it?
What we know from Magic when he joined the Dodgers, the man loves a splash
George would be a splash. But isn't it better to wait?
Definitely. To me, the Lakers should continue to bet young
Draft Ball?
Yes. Look into trading Russell for a shot blocker. Figure out George in 2018
That is the wisest decision, but not so "LA"
Back to exploding teams - what about Toronto?
Tough question. This team can't make the finals if Lebron is around. Is that good enough?
Even further, can it last much longer. Lowry is older.
I still don't like DeRozan's game in the post season. And Lowry hasn't been great in the playoffs
It's tough because they can't trade anyone besides DeRozan and who would take him?
I mean, the Lakers?
Hah. I hope not
Another blow up candidate - Chicago
Yep. But they won't because they are the Bulls
Trading Jimmy would give them a fresh start. Which they won't take
