So I finally saw La La Land last night.
What's your verdict?
Great film.  Music is probably some of the best I've heard of ages.
I also loved it with a few exceptions.
What did you not like?
I'm not sure I liked the casting of Ryan Gosling?
Really?  That's surprising.
I just don't think he danced well enough.  Acting was fine, dancing was just mediocre.
I never really noticed a problem with it to be honest.
I think Emma Stone was fantastic though.
She definitely filled the vibe of someone trying to be a star.
And she can dance and sing which helped her out.
For me, the music was the best part.
Agreed.  Awesome music.
What was the best song from it?
City of Stars of course.
I'll be different and say Someone from the Crowd.
Great tune as well.  Can't go wrong either way.
Wish it would have won the Oscar over Moonlight though.
You can't win everything in life.
