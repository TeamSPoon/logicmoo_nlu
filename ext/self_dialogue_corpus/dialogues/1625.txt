Which NFL team do you think has the best mascot?
Whatever the Colts mascot is called seems to be pretty entertaining to watch
I do always see him behind the end zone during games reacting to plays on the field
That's what mascots are supposed to do to entertain people, even if the mascot itself isn't all that interesting
Didn't the Jaguars' mascot parachute into the stadium once?
Someone did, and I would put it past Jaxson to do something like that
Florida's teams have pretty cool mascots, like the Buccaneers guy who is literally just a pirate
And it's too bad the Dolphins don't use a real dolphin as a mascot, but I suppose that wouldn't be a great idea
Remember the Seahawks' live hawk that landed on someone's head before a game?
I wouldn't expect a dolphin to do something like that, but I get your point
The Ravens have a pretty cool mascot named after Edgar Allan Poe
That makes sense, since he wrote The Raven and both the team and mascot are based on that
There used to be three mascots named Edgar, Allan, and Poe, but now there's just Poe
I wonder why they did that, but I imagine it saved money and was easier to manage
Do the Green Bay Packers have a mascot, or is it just cheese?
I think the fans are the mascot, since the team is community-owned
They don't have cheerleaders either, if I remember right
Well some people might argue that NFL cheerleaders don't really serve a purpose
They do a lot of work in the community, though, so I still think it's a good idea to have them
And I'm sure the NFL is glad to have people who will help sell merchandise, if nothing else
