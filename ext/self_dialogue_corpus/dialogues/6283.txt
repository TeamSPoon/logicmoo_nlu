Have you ever watched The Little Mermaid?
No. I told you I haven't seen many Disney movies.
You're so uncivilised!
Yeah, my mom didn't let me watch a lot of Disney movies growing up.
How come?
She was against the magic in them she said.
Aw, that's too bad. I think there are plenty of Disney movies that don't have magic in them though.
Like which ones?
A lot of the older ones I think. There were some ones about famour historical figures, and wasn't there one about some animals trying to find their way home?
That sounds familiar!
