Have you seen Logan yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller.  Did you like it?
I want to go see it.  I haven't been able to yet.
What is the story line?
Logan is older, and meets a young mutant whom he has to protect.
I remember seeing previews of the girl.  She looks like him too.
Yes, she has claws and power like him, in fact I think in a way he sees her as his own.
Who directs this one?
James Mangold is the director for Logan.
Fantastic, I love his work!
So far, that movie has grossed $614 million dollars in the USA.
That is amazing. Who stars in it?
Well, they have Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, and Richard Grant as a few in the movie.
That is am all-star cast!
Yes indeed!  Logan is a good series continuation of Wolverine.
Have the critics given it good ratings?
8 out of 10 stars so that is very healthy for a rating.
We should go see it.
I have some time free on Sunday if you want.
Ok I will pick you up.
