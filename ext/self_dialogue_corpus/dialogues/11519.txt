I know you said you were into rock, but does that include the Beatles?
Yeah, definitely. I don't know all the ins and outs of the band, but I love the Beatles.
Oh okay, cool. I like them a lot too.
Yeah, they're such a talented band. They were like an all star band.
I vaguely remember one of my friends saying that Mick Jagger once said something to the effect of "We have one lead singer, they have four," when referring to the Beatles.
Wow, that's impressive! They're all geniuses, but some of their songs are kind of out there.
For sure, the Beatles went through a huge artistic and style change over there short time as a band. Initially they were all in suits playing pop songs and they became a pretty trippy band wearing lots of flamboyant and colorful outfits.
Yeah, like the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They had awesome outfits in that vinyl art and they looked really stoned, haha.
Haha, yeah. Oh, another interesting tidbit is I think Yesterday is the most covered song of all time, but I could be wrong about that though.
I love that song. I wouldn't be surprised.
