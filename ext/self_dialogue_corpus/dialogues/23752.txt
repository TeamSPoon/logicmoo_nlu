I just watched my first Patrick Swazye film.
Really? He had so many hits.
I know, I am behind the times.
What one did you watch?
It was called Roadhouse.
That one is about the bar in Jasper Missouri right?
Yes, he was so cool in that movie.
He is really good at the action stuff.
What other action movies did he play in?
He did a bit of fighting in Point Break.
Who else plays in that one?
It had Keanu Reeves.
What is it about.
Mostly surfing, a bit of crime and lots of action.
I know he made romance movies right?
He did, my favorite is Dirty Dancing.
I have seen the remake.
The remake is not even worth watching.
Was the old one a good movie?
It was amazing, he did all of his own singing in the movie too.
