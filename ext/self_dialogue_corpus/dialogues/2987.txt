What do you like most about the game of football?
That's a really hard question because there are a lot of elements that are really engaging.
If you had to pick one, what would it be?
I think I would say that I really like the physical contact the most.
Big hits are always entertaining.
Not just big hits, but even just two large men trying to push each other around.
A lot of injuries result from those big hits though.
A lot of injuries happen without big hits too.
Most of the injuries I see are the result of some type of hit or tackle.
When you see a player injured in baseball or basketball is it because they got tackled?
No, but players in those games aren't frequently receiving head injuries.
Would you say football players receive more head injuries than boxers?
I would actually have to look at some statistics on that, but I feel like boxers probably have more head injuries.
And Muhammad Ali is a pretty good example of how debilitating they can be.
It sounds like you're defending football injuries.
No, I'm not defending them.  I'm just stating the fact that many sports have frequent injuries.
So do you think the NFL should do more to protect players from injuries?
I think they should always be pushing for that, but you also have to realize that everyone involved with football knows how dangerous it is.
And yet many players are quite vocal about their love for the game.
Indeed, some things are so physically and mentally rewarding that they're worth the risk.
