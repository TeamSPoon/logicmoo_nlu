Hey, a good friend of mine is going to be playing a gig in Ocean Beach.
Yeah? What kind of music does he play?
Well, it's kind of a jazzy/blues sort of genre.
Sounds interesting, how many people are in the band?
There is a drummer, a base player and a lead guitar player.
Cool, tell me more.
My friend Jose is the drummer and he absolutely rocks it.
I think I have heard him play with a local rap band
You probably have, he is very talented.
What is the name of the band he is now?
They are called "The Band of Solos"
Ah, that is a pretty cool name.
They are going to be playing at Mother's  Saloon next month.
Do you know the date?
I'm pretty sure they are performing the second Saturday in July.
Do you know what time their set is scheduled?
No, but I will send you a text message as soon as I get home.
Awesome, I look forward to hearing that band play.
Cool, the bigger the crowd the better!
I will bring some friends to check them out as well.
