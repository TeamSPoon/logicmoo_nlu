What's your favorite type of movie?
I like comedies, Judd apatow movies are the best.
Yeah, knocked up is a classic.
Yeah I like Seth Rogan, so basically anything he is in I'll watch.
I like Katherine heigal in that movie also.
Have you seen her in the ugly truth?
No, what's that about?
It's so funny, it has Gerard butler and he is this crass guy that is really rude to everyone but basically a relationship genius.
I love Gerard butler.  I like how he can be serious and then hilarious in the next movie
I'm sure you've seen law abiding citizen then right?  That's one of my favorite movies.
Oh yeah, it's so good.  The stuff he's capable of doing in that movie is crazy, who thinks that up?
I know right?  When he paralyzed the guy with the toxin in the gun.... wow.
Yeah, they deserved it though.  He's a real good hero type. Like in Olympus has fallen and gladiator.
Yeah those are cool movies also.
Did you know there is a sequel to Olympus has fallen called London has fallen?
No I didn't, is it pretty similar?
Kind of, similar story but it doesn't feel like a repeat.
Have you ever noticed that pair of movies come out a lot that are really similar.  That can't be a coincidence right?
Like what?
Like Olympus has fallen and white house down. Or the illusionist and the prestige.
