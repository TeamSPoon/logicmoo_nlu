Have you watched any great movies lately?
I have, I just watched one called Into the Wild.
Is that a new one?
No, it came out a while ago.
Oh, wow, how did you get into that one?
I heard the soundtrack for the movies at a pals house. It blew me away.
The movie or the music?
Both really.
Was the movie that great?
It was a true story, but really had this huge sense of purpose you know.
And the music?
The music was the perfect companion. It really helped you feel as if you were on the adventure.
That is what music should do for movies. Evoke something.
Emotion, elation. Whatever the director wants us to feel.
I think that is why music is important.
I really enjoyed a few films even more, due to their music.
Like?
Nick and Nora's infinite play list.
Is that not just about the music.
No, but the music really makes the movie worth while.
