Did you know that Paul McCarthy wrote a song about his dog?
No, I didn't know that.  Which one?
Martha, My Dear.  He really loved his dog!
What kind of dog was it?
An Old English Sheepdog.
I think I heard he wrote Hey Jude for John Lennon's son.  Do you know if that's true?
Yes, John and his wife Cynthia were getting divorced and he wrote it for their son Julian.
What Beatles song is your favorite?
Oh, wow, that's a hard question.  Maybe Let It Be if I had to pick just one.
That's a great song for sure.
