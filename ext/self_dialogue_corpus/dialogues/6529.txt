Do you think there should be a new lion king for future generations.
I feel that the original is good enough for all generations.
I think they should make it so mufasa doesn't die.
But that ruins the whole premise of the plot.
No, I just feel they can go in a different angle beside killing off a father.
You are crazy. Nothing is wrong with the movie.
The movie is great it just can be better.
Nothing is better. It's a classic.
Classics can always get redone.
You have the right to your opinion
