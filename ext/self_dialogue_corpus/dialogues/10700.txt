Am I the only one that gets sort of angry at the Fast & Furious characters?
In what sense?
In that those guys are all villains.  They are actual bad guys.
Now that you mention it, they are all thieves and crooks.
More than that even, it's their total disregard for everyone outside of their "family."
That is so true.  In 'Fast Five,' they basically destroyed parts of Brazil while dragging that bank vault with their cars.
And don't forget 'The Fate of the Furious' when they go to Germany and kill a bunch of police officers who try to stop them from stealing.
That was even worse.  They always cheer and have a good time about it too.
I think that's why for me, I just can't sympathize with any of them.
It's very hard to root for characters with such few morals!
