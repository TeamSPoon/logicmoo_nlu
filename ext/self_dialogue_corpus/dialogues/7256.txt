Lion's King is the best Disney movie of all time.
I'd debate you on any other day but you got me in a good mood.
What can you even debate, it's absolutely perfect.
Can't argue that it's perfect, really.
Exactly, the characters, the music, the story, the visuals, it's the best.
Agreed, Akuna Matata is the best Disney song ever.
One of them that's for sure, I Just Can't Wait To Be King is just as good if not better.
Oh I forgot about that one.
How can you forget the best song in the movie?
By thinking of another great song.
