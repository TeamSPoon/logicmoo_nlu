I heard you say you are not a big Disney movie fan.
Yeah, I hate to say it. Disney movies are so corny!
Are there any you actually like? I think a lot of them aren't corny.
I do like Lady and the Tramp. The dogs won me over.
That's a good one. I don't know anyone who can resist its charm.
I guess I would also have to say that I liked The Sword and the Stone.
Oh, a classic! Merlin is so funny in that movie.
He cracked me up. It was a wonderful film.
I feel like you can't really say you hate Disney movies if there are some you really like.
Yes, but there are so many that I hate as well.
