What's your favorite Beatles song?
Hmm...I really like Here Comes the Sun!
Ooh, that's a good song! What do you like about it?
It just sounds so happy! And I love the guitar part.
I like While My Guitar Gently Weeps!
I like that one too! Did you know Eric Clapton played the lead guitar on that?
I did! Have you heard Santana's version of it?
Yes! It is really good!
I know! I also enjoyed Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton's performance of it at the Queen's Golden Jubilee.
I haven't heard that! I'll have to look it up!
