Are you a fan of The Cranberries?
Yes. Did you know they are an Irish rock band?
I know! I grew up listening to their songs.
I love the song called Zombie.
Me too! That's one of my favorites.
The other song, Dreams, is one of my favorites.
Yes! I use to play that one on my CD player all the time.
What about the song Linger?
Also a favorite of mine.
I went to their concert once and they were great!
Really? I have never been to one.
They sound better live than on the album. I was screaming like crazy!
That's amazing and rare. I bet you had fun!
Dolores O'Riordan's voice is so different.
I agree. That's why I like The Cranberries.
They are a great band! The guitarist, Noel Hogan, is so great.
Yeah! He plays guitar so well.
The drummer, Fergal Lawler, is pretty awesome too!
I agree with that! We should listen to one of their albums right now!
Yes! Let's do it!
