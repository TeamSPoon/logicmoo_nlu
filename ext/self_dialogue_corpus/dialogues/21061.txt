Have you seen Manchester by the Sea yet?
No. I missed it when it was out.
It's on Amazon Prime now.
Cool. I'll have to check it out,
I watched it last weekend.
How was it?
I like it. Nice New England flavor to it.
I love movies filmed in locations I know.
Me too. One time they filmed a movie up on the Merrimack.
I think I remember reading about that.
It was a Mel Gibson movie.
Not a fan.
Me neither. But I tried to find the scene.
You watched the movie?
Well kind of. I fast forwarded through it once.
How did the scene look.
I couldn't find it! What a waste of time.
That's too bad. So how was Manchester by the Sea?
It was pretty good. One scene was just amazing though.
I guess I'll have to watch. Maybe this weekend.
