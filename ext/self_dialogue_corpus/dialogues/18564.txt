Have you ever heard of the song called I love Rock n Roll?
I am not sure is that one by Joan Jett?
Yeah, Joan Jett!
That is an old song but I really like it.
Me too and I just heard it for the first time the other day.
You would probably like the song called Under the Boardwalk by the Drifters.
Oh really, why would i like it?
It is a beachy song and really upbeat.
I probably would really like it then because I like songs that make you feel good.
Yeah, that would be on my top 10 favorite list for sure!
Do you have a favorite song or band that you can not live without.
I have a off the wall favorite song called Cry Me a River.
Are you talking about the Justin Timberlake song?
Yes, I can not help but loving that song.
You have eclectic taste in music.
That is the perfect way to describe it actually.
I think enjoying a wide range of music is healthy.
That is how I think too. For example I love country music too which is odd.
I want to go listen to Pandora right now.
That sounds fun and I think I will too.
