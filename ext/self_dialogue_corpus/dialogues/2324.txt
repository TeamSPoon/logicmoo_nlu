Which two teams do you want to make it to the SuperBowl this year?
I really want to see the Patriots and Seahawks rematch.
I don't know man, it wouldn't even be the same.
What? why not?
Because Beast Mode isn't on the team anymore.
That's true, but they both still have a lot of the same players.
Yeah I guess so.
I just wouldn't want it to be a close game this time.
Who would you want to win?
I would really love for the Seahawks to win.
I just feel like, I want to mix it up, I don't want the Patriots to even make the Playoffs.
Is that to mix things up? Or just because you don't like them?
Hmm.. Why can't it be both?
The Patriots are a good team though.
Talent wise, I guess. I'm just really sick of them.
I don't know if you will get what you want this year.
Maybe not, but I can always hope.
Maybe they will make the playoffs, but lose early.
That would work for me I guess.
Keep your fingers crossed.
