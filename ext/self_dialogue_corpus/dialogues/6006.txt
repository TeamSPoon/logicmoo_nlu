Have you heard that Disney is doing a remake of Mulan?
Yes, but I can't believe that they're not including any songs!
I know! What is Mulan with "Reflection" or "Honor to Us All"?
And don't forget "I'll Make a Man Out of You" by Donny Osmond!
Oh, yeah, that one's fun to sing along with.
I also heard that they are removing the love interest with Shang.
Like, they won't even have his character?
I'm not sure, but I think that's what I heard.
Wow, that's crazy. Will this even be the same story line? What about Mushu?
I haven't heard about that. Hopefully they keep him!
