The other night, I sat down and watched the classic 1970's thriller, Jaws. You've seen that one, right?
Of course I've seen Jaws, but it's been a long time. I remember thinking it was great.
Yes, it is a great movie. And for being over four decades old, I still think it holds up.
I would assume it does. It's been at least a few years since I've watched it, but I remember enjoying it and felt it has aged well.
I think one of the best things about Jaws is how you really don't see how much of the actual shark.
That is a brilliant thing, but I remember watching a documentary that said that was not supposed to be the case.
Yes, I remember hearing that, too. Because the mechanical shark did not work too often, they had to come up something else.
That is correct and therefore Steven Spielberg then had to have the shark implied.
Do you think that single change made the movie even better?
Yes, I do. There is nothing scarier then something you can't see.
