What actor is the best in thrillers?
I would go with Clint Eastwood myself.
Really? Which ones has he done?
He has some really good thrillers. Have you heard of Blood Work?
Yes! That was a good one actually.
Absolute Power was another really good movie.
I have not seen that one before.
It is really good. Have you seen A Perfect World?
Nope! I am going to have to catch up on Clint Eastwood thrillers!
Yea, he has some very good movies out.
