I need help choosing a dress for the wedding next weekend. Can you go shopping with me on Friday?
Yeah, sure! I love shopping for dresses! What time do you want to go?
Around five. I'll pick you up.
Sounds great! So, are you thinking about using a long dress or short dress?
Well, I'm not quite sure but I think a long dress will look more elegant, considering the occasion. Don't you think?
True. Long dresses do look more elegant but a short dress will draw more attention from the single bachelors!
Oh yeah! I didn't think about that! Maybe I should buy a short dress instead.
Do you have a nice high heel pair of shoes?
Uhm, I have a pair of shoes with heels but they're not very high.
Oh no, you'd better pick me up at three. We're going to have to go shoe shopping too!
But I wasn't planning on buying shoes too!
You cannot wear a short sexy dress with low heels! Short dresses draw attention to your legs!
This wedding invitation is becoming expensive. Maybe I just won't go...
No, no, no. Relax! I know a great store for dresses that always has good sales.
Don't you have a dress or a pair of shoes I can borrow? You go out a lot.
Actually, yeah, I do! Now that I think about it, I have the perfect dress for you!
What color is it?
It's a sassy red! It'll look great on you!
Are you sure? Sassy red? That sounds a bit extravagant for me, don't you think?
Don't worry. Leave it to me. Come on over tonight after work.
