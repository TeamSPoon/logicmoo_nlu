Are you a fan of the Superman movies?
Not really, I think I like Spiderman more.
Why Spiderman?  He's just a scrawny kid.
Well, that's probably why.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's more relatable.  Superman is an alien.
They both have super powers.  You can't really relate to either one.
I know, but out of the two, I have more in common with Peter Parker.
I guess I see what you are saying.
Yeah, he's just a common guy that can kick butt.
