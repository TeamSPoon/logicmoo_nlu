LiLu, do you remember the rock group, Asia?
No. What's that?
What's that? Beside the continent, it's probably the best band ever!
I doubt that.
How can you say that? Asia rocks!
Maybe, but if I've never heard of them, how can they be that famous?
Oh, I didn't say that they were famous. I said they rock!
Fine. Why do they rock?
They were the quintessential euro supergroup of the eighties!
QuintessentiaL?
Yeah, quinessential!
You don't even know what the word means!
I do too! And Asia was quinessential!
Fine. Did they have any hits?
Did they have any hits? Absolutely!
Name one.
Just one?
One.
Alright. Songs like, "Heat of the Moment", "Only Time will Tell", and "Without You"
I said one. You are now disqualified from any further participation.
