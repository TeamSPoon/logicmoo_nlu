What do you think of Kendrick Lamar?
I think he's good, not sure if he's as amazing as everyone says.
Oh? I think he's amazing. Why do you say that?
I just don't see what he's doing that hasn't been done before.
I don't know if he's completely changing the game, but you have to admit he is unique.
I suppose. Unique does not equal great, though.
True, but Kendrick has great lyrics, great technique and mass appeal.
There are a couple of tracks I like, like "Swimming Pools."
"Swimming Pools" is great because it's a deep and thought-provoking song disguised as a mindless club hit.
Yeah, I kind of get that.
What do you think about "HUMBLE." his recent single?
I think it's fine. Nothing special.
"HUMBLE." is interesting because it's the opposite of "Swimming Pools."
What do you mean?
Well, "Swimming Pools" is a deep song that sounds like a mindless song, while "HUMBLE." is a mindless song that sounds deep.
I guess you just kind of assume all Kendrick Lamar songs have deep meanings.
If you listen to the lyrics, "HUMBLE." is basically just Kendrick bragging about how awesome he is. Not much to it.
Maybe I should listen more closely to his lyrics.
He's very clever in the way that he puts things together.
I'll keep that in mind.
