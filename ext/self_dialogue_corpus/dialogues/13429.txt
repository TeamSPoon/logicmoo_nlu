What did you think of the new digital remastered versions of Star Wars?
They were pretty good, some of the stuff wasn't though.
Like what?
I didn't like that extended Cantina scene on Tattooine, they had an entire new musical number thrown in.
So?  What's wrong with that?
It was just cheesy, you have this 80's quality movie then suddenly you just threw in this high quality dance number with aliens.
I thought it was pretty funny.
You would, you also loved Jar Jar.
Hey man, Jar Jar was a very well developed character.
My point exactly.
