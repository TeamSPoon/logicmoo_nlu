Did you see Logan?
Yea, and I thought it was terrible.
What? Why?
It was just too long and it never really captured me.
Are you crazy? That was an amazing movie!
What was so good about it?
The plot line, the action, almost everything!
No way, the plot line was too basic.
What?! He was falling apart and he got a reason to be alive in the end.
Didn't he die?
Supposedly, but you never know.
I wish they wouldn't have left it open for another sequel.
Why, the movies have been great.
No they haven't. They have played up to people nostalgia, but almost none of them were impacting.
You are so wrong, don't you think it's a good analogy for today's world?
How so?
Well it's a story about outcasts, people outside of the norm trying to find a way to fit in.
I never really thought of it like that.
Does that change your mind a little?
Not really, still terrible movies.
