Where you headed?
To the theater.
What's playing?
Alien.
Another one?
Yup.
I hadn't heard anything about it.
I think it'll be good.
I did like the others.
Which one is your favorite?
I'd have to say the first one.
Least favorite?
Predator vs. Alien.
I never saw that one.
Don't waste your time.
Was that a Ridley Scott.
I don't think so.
He did direct Covenant.
Maybe I'll go with.
Cool!
