Were you ever able to go to a Beatles' concert when they first came to America?
No, but that would be quite a memory to see them at that time period. The earlier songs are the best.
I really liked P.S. I Love You and Do You Want to Know A Secret.
Do You want to Know A Secret was one of the few earlier songs sung by George Harrison.
Their earlier songs were so optimistic and joyful.  Why do you think they were so popular at that time?
I think that there were so many Baby Boomers coming of age, that they just fell in line when it came to the Beatles.
The Beatles really worked well together in the beginning. Love Me Do and Please, Please Me harmonies were so addictive to listen too.
I think I Saw Her Standing There just epitomizes the earlier songs -- full of energy and the great guitar of George Harrison.
These early songs really targeted the teenage girl audience.  I recall all the screaming and fainting when they sang!
Yes. The first line of If I Fell In Love With You just seemed so personal and the women loved it!
