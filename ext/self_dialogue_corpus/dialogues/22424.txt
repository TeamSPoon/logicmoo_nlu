What did you think of the IT 2 Trailer we just watched?
Oh My God. I can't wait to see it.
I know right.
I didn't know they were making another It movie.
Neither did I.
Pennywise's voice is going to be a huge factor on if this movie is good or not.
You're right. And since we didn't hear him talk I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.﻿
Yeah but we have to remember, this Pennywise doesn't need to sound like Tim Curry's Pennywise. Bill Skårsgard is his own Pennywise best interpreted by the novel.﻿
I agree. Tim Curry was great, but his Pennywise was a far cry from the seductive creature in the book.
People are going to hate on Bill Skarsgard simply because he's not Tim Curry, but given that Tim Curry didn't give a "true to the book" performance, we have to go into this movie with an open mind.﻿
Tim curry was a legend in the original films of IT, but I believe this guy who's portraying him now is good.﻿ At least, it looks that way from the trailer.
I think his voice is going to be calm and pleasant. Not creepy at face value, but creepy because what's creepier than a calmly pleasant clown?﻿
That's so true.
I know I probably shouldn't, but when I saw that kid hit his head I laughed so hard.
I think that is why they put that scene in the movie.
I wonder if  this movie going to be about them just as kids or are they going to grow up into adults like the original IT.
I was thinking the same thing.
Or is this just like a completely new version like a completely new story just wondering?
I think it's gonna be split into two movies. This first one is just with the kids.
Yeah, I was kind of thinking that myself just now if so it should be good it will show a lot of what happened to them when they were kids .
