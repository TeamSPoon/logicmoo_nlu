Do you like The Beatles?
Not really, I'm more of a Rolling Stones fan
They're great, but I think The Beatles have them beat, no pun intended.
Oh yeah? What are your favorite songs?
There's so many, but if you like the Stones then you should check out Day Tripper and Run For Your Life
Are they like All You Need is Love? I've heard that one, and I like it but it's not my favorite
Those songs are very different, as are a lot of their songs. They even have some heavier stuff like Helter Skelter and Back in the USSR
I haven't heard of those before. I wonder why they don't get any more attention?
I don't know, but the deeper you go into their catalogue, the more gems you'll find. It's like a bottomless well of amazing music, especially albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road
Alright, thanks for telling me! I'll give them a listen as soon as I can.
