What is your favorite disney film?
I think that would have to be Aladdin. You?
My top pick is The little mermaid. So many I love though.
Ya they have a lot of great ones. Like The Lion King.
What a great soundtrack on that one. Loved it!
I heard they are making a real life little mermaid.. I wonder if they will do many more real life versions.
I heard about a real life little mermaid a while ago, not sure it is a disney production though. I think chloe grace mortez was cast.
I will have to look into it more.  I like her. She was adorable in kickass. seen it?
Ya years ago now. It was a cute film.
Entertaining movie but kind of fluff. Not oscar worthy.
Ya for sure. I also liked dark places with johnny deep. She wa sin that as well.
I liked that film too. Funny movie. Again good movie soundtrack.
Eva green was really good in it too.
Ya she is so beautiful. Actually just read she is going to be in the dumbo movie.
What they are making a new dumbo?
Ya a real life version,I suppose it is the new trend.
Wow, that is crazy. Wonder how they will pull it off.
Considering a flying elephant I would say computer graphic magic will play a big role.
Good point. Should be interesting.
I want to see it for sure.
