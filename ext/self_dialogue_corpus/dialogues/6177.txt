I wonder how Disney consistently comes up with great new movies?
Well, a lot of Disney movies are based on old fairy tales and legends.
I knew that about the older movies, but some of the newer ones?
Yes. For instance, Frozen was based on a Hans Christian Andersen story.
Really? I had no idea about that.
Yes, and Moana was based on a Hawaiian Legend.
I wonder what new ones they will adapt?
I don't know. I do hope there are more Pixar collaborations.
Yes. Those my favorites.
Me, too.
