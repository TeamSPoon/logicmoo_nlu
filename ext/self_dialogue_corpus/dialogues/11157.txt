So who did you think was the best dressed at the 2017 Grammy's red carpet ?
Well I really liked the golden outfit that Cee Lo Green had on.
I noticed that Solange Knowles also was wearing gold.
Yeah there were a few celebrities that wore gold this year but which golden dressed celebrity was your favorite ?
I really liked the golden top that Katy Perry wore on the red carpet.
Yeah that was really tight on her body but who was your favorite dress male at the Grammys ?
Definitely James Corden with his silky jacket and did you see who he was standing with ?
Yes Julia Carey in that golden, form fitting mini dress she looked gorgeous as well.
I really liked the dress that Kat Graham wore with he different striped colors.
You know who really looked cool though ?
Who are you talking about ?
Nick Jonas with his black metal studded outfit I thought it was very stylish.
I though Halsey was even more fashionable with her bare breast nearly hanging out in that blue silk outfit.
What it a blue silk dress ?
No it was a silk blouse and silk pants with the blouse unbuttoned and her breast nearly hanging out.
Yeah that was really provocative.
What did you think of Mya's red silk pant suit ?
I thought it was gorgeous but really safe I think she could have pushed the limits more.
What did you think about Camila Cabello in her gray satin style dress ?
I thought she looked adorable.
