What do you think of Lady Gaga doing big band standards with Tony Bennett?
I think their team up was amazing!
Me too. Did you see them perform on the Grammys last year?
I did. They did Cheek to Cheek together, and they brought the house down.
Lady Gaga is awesome, the way she can do so many styles of singing.
She brought a lot of modern energy to the song, while at the same time blending in with the traditional icon Tony Bennett.
They got a standing O at the end. It was great.
They actually won the Grammy for traditional pop album, and it was well deserved.
Whoever thought of teaming these two up needs a big raise. It was unexpected and brilliant.
I think it would be really cool if more contemporary singers would experiment with older treasures in the business. Look at the magic they can create.
