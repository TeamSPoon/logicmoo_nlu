I'm sure they will do a good job with the new movie.
Ya I hope they have good music in it.
I'm pretty excited to see it.
I've seen every Dinsey movie and Frozen is one of my favorites.
Oh wow I know I have seen a lot of Disney movies but not sure if I have seen every one.
Ya I try to make sure I see every Disney movie at the theater if possible.
wow that is really impressive. Which ones were your favorite?
Hmm... that's tough. Frozen definitely and Toy Story
Oh ya I liked Toy Story a lot too. I haven't seen the third one yet.
You should I bet you would like it.
