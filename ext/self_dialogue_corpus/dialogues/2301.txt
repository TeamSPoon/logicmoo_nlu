Can't believe it's football time.
I know, I'm excited.
Who is your team?
I like the Raiders.
Are you upset about them moving to Las Vegas.
No, I love to gamble, so it works out.
Really? But don't you think they will lose their edge?
Nope, I think it's pretty static.
Who is your favorite player?
I love Derek Carr.
Do you think they overpaid him though?
Yes, but he is their first competent QB in forever, so you had to keep him.
You think he'll get even better this year?
Yeah, I like his chances with our new receivers.
Do you think they'll be a playoff team?
Yes, I think we'll win about 11 games this year.
Hmm.. and who are you worried about?
No one really, I think we're capable of beating anyone.
Ok, well good luck.
Thanks.
