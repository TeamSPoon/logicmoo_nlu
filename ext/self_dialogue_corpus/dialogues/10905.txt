Did you hear they are planning on making more Fast and the Furious movies?
Wow, how long are they going to milk that franchise?
It is still going strong, one of the most popular action movie series.
They should really consider ending it.
Have you been watching the newer ones?
No I have not.
They are actually really good, better than the originals.
The originals were terrible so no surprise there.
I think the new ones are coming out in 2019 and 2021.
That is still so far away, they already announced that?
