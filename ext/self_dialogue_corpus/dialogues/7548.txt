What's your favorite part of the Harry Potter series?
Oh that's easy to put it simply "your a wizard Harry".
That was an awesome moment by why is it your favorite?
That's when he finds out he's a wizard.
Yeah, so what?
That's the beginning of it all, this whole magically epic franchise well the movies at least.
Yeah i'm not sure it's my favorite though out of everything in the movies.
It sets the stage and how many times have you heard that saying.
Way too many.
Plus Hagrid says it and he's one of my favorite charcters.
