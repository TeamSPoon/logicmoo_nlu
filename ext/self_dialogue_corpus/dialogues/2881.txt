Anither wide receiver for the Bengals. Why?
Are you talking about the dude from Washington?
Yup
Thought so. I'm still shaking my head
The Brrownies took Peppers...oh my goodness
I cannot believe it. I simply cannot believe it.
Once again the two Ohio teams mess up in the draft
Yep...don't know whether to laugh or cry
Three of the best dbs coming out of college, and they draft none of them
I knew Marvin Lewis would do something like this
We should have gotten Lattimore
My co-worker is a Browns fan. And he is hot man
I don't blame him...
Cannot get mad any more. It is what it is
I almost think they shouldn't have brought the Browns back
Or we should have gotten Pittsburgh's team.
Hahahahaha good one
I am only tellin g the truth
We can always hop for change.
That only worked for Obama man
