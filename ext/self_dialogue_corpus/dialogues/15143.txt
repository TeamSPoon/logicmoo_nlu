What music decade is your favorite?
I would have to say the 80s.
So many classics came from that era.
I liked Madonna back then and now.
I remember when Material Girl came out in 1984.
Like a Virgin was one of my favorite albums.
Her songs are so catchy.
She had a great voice and talent.
She sold more records than any female artist.
They didn't call her the Queen of Pop for nothing.
Her tours attracted millions of people.
People really wanted to see her live.
She had some great performances.
I liked her when she performed at the Super Bowl.
Yeah, she was wearing the leather jacket that was pretty recent.
It was in the 2000s.
She's still got all the talent after all these years.
She was an icon that people looked up to.
She influenced many artists.
I'm sure Taylor Swift was influenced by her.
