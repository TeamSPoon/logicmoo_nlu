What's your opinion on the Dallas Cowboy?
Ehh, I like them, though there are some people who just hate their guts.
Yeah, I don't understand why.
It's probably because of the stigma of them being arrogant and such.
I don't really see that in them, though.
Me neither. Seem to me they are very genuine and great players.
I love Tony Romo, it's really unfortunate that he's plagued with injury.
Yeah I feel really bad when he was injured in preseason.
But hey, if he wasn't injured, we wouldn't have never found Dak Prescott.
Yes! He was so good!
I love watching him play, such great arm.
And his running back too. Ezekiel is very explosive.
I just wish we had a better defense.
Well, we do though. We drafted a lot for our defense. After this year, I think we can be very good on both side of the fields.
Let hope so. I wish we can have JJ Watt on our team though.
Oh yes, I love watching him play. Such great plays and concentration.
Too bad, he's a player for our rivalry.
Haha but the Texans are not really good, let hope he'll switch teams
I hope so, too.
All this football talk makes me want the season to come already.
