What do you think about this leggings craze?
I think leggings are fantastic when worn as leggings, not as pants.
With so many companies using marketing sales and pop up stores do you believe they are all the same?
I think some companies like LuLu Roe and Buskins have great quality products but there's a lot of copy cats with poor quality.
What body type is best for leggings?
I think all body types are good for them as long as the style is coordinated right. Anyone can pull them off with the right top!
I happen love my Buskins because of the price, free shipping benefit, and they aren't sheer at all.
Yeah, I have seen some amazing prints also. My favorite are the aztec designs.
I really think there should be more options for the plus sized girls when it comes to bottoms so this trend is perfect.
It's funny how popular they've become and how fast these companies have grown.
Yeah, I remember as a little girl just wearing "tights" and a dress. I had no idea they would evolve into what they are today!
It's not a bad thing for sure. I just don't like when people wear them as pants with a top that doesn't cover their butt or thighs.
They do need to be worn with a tunic or dress, I agree.
Which is better to go with them? Boots or sandals?
Some I wear with sandals but mainly boots and a short dress. It gives it that edgy look.
Speaking of boots! Best brand?
Dr. Martens of course!
Omg you and I are too much alike.
Most people think they are outdated.
No way! They will never go out of style just like leggings won't.
