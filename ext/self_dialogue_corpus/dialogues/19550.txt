So what's going on with britney spears?
What do you mean?
I mean is she on drugs or something?
It's hard to tell.
She has been acting very strangely recently.
I totally agree on that one.
Someone should learn from her about how to mess up your successful career.
Yes, exactly. I think she was not able to handle all the fame.
It could be. Or it is that drug issue is very common in music industry.
I don't think so. I mean there are many good artist out there who do not do drugs.
How can you be so sure?
Come on, you think all the artists are on drugs?
No, I am just asking how can you be so sure?
Maybe be cause they don't act so weirdly like britney.
Well, That's not enough of an explanation.
What do you want? Their blood test?
Yes, I definitely want their blood reports.
Are you kidding me?
Yes, I am just fooling around with you.
Well, In that case, I am okay with that.
