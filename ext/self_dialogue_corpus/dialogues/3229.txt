I saw Sixth Sense again not too long ago.
That's a classic. That's when M.Night Shyamalan was doing it right.
Yes, he's just now beginning to turn around with The Visit and Split.
Yeah but in the Sixth Sense, he really got the atmosphere right.
I agree. No one saw that ending coming.
Neither did I. Haley Joel Osment did such a great job in that role.
He really did. Bruce Willis too, but Osment stole the show.
That part with Donnie Wahlberg at the beginning was one of the scariest parts.
Yes that and the part with the little girl who kept appearing to the little boy.
I don't know if I could handle a gift, or curse, like being able to see dead people. It would drive me nuts.
