Let's chat about music: who's your favorite pop singer right now?
I love Lady Gaga. She's so inventive.
Have you heard her new album, Joanne?
Yes! I especially like the song, "Million Reasons".
I do, too. It's an emotional song.
Did you know she named the album after her late aunt?
Yes, I did. I saw a story about that on TV a while ago.
Oh, I just found that out yesterday.
I think it makes the album more special. It is different from Lady Gaga's other albums.
I have to agree with you on that.
