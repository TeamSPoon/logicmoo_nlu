What's your favorite female artist?
It has to be Taylor Swift.
I remember when her music came out a few years ago.
Her first song was Teardrops on my Guitar.
What songs do you like of hers from current pop hits?
I really like Shake It Off and 22.
Those are some great pick me up songs.
They put me in such a good mood.
Her songs used to be kind of depressing.
Yeah, but now it's less sad love songs and more pop sounds.
