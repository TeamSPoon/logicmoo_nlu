I love Gerard Butler movies. Have you seen his latest?
What is his latest? I am not even sure.
I don't know that it is his latest, but I saw London Has Fallen recently.
I haven't seen  that yet. What is that about?
Well it is a sequel to Olympus Has Fallen. Have you seen that?
I have. So the characters are the same?
Yes, they are. It just takes place as a terrorist attack in London.
Oh, well I liked the first one. I guess I will have to try to watch that one.
You should, I think you will enjoy it.
You know what I think his best movie is?
What is that?
Law Abiding Citizen.
I have seen that one. It was okay, not really my favorite.
What is your favorite Gerard Butler movie?
I would say probably The Bounty Hunter.
Is that the one with Jennifer Aniston?
Yes. It is a romantic comedy.
Of course, you like romantic comedies.
I do, but I think the plot of this one is truly unique in the genre.
I agree. I love the chemistry between the actors.
