When was the last time you went to the movie theater?
I went last week, actually.
Oh, nice, what movie did you see.
I saw the new Baywatch movie.
Oh, nice!
Yeah, have you seen it?
No, I didn't know there was a new one, actually....
It's SO good, it's with Zac Efron and the Rock.
Oh, I love those actors! Was it funny?
It was hilarious, so many good moments.
I kind of want to watch it now.
You should, there was also some special guests in the movie!
What do you mean?
Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff are in it!
No way, that's awesome.
Yeah, they are only in for a couple minutes though.
That's better than nothing. And there's still a lot of action in the movie?
Oh, there's tons - so many fight scenes.
Well, do you want to watch it with me and see it again?
I would love to.
