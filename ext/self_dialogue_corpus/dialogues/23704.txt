So I finally watched John Wick Chapter 2
Oh yeah? What did you think?
It was confusing. Why was he so pissed off at the russian mob? Over a dog and a car? And what marker, what?
Yeah it's kinda weird how the chapter 2 is much more expansive in terms of background info than the original
I'll say. And Wick was like an agent of some secret killer organization.
Well, he retired from killing. But he was dragged back into the violence by the idiot son of the Russian mob boss.
He's the one who kills the dog and steals the car?
Yes. And he messed with the wrong guy, because he used to be this super killer, and the dog was a gift from his dead wife.
And he loves that car.
And everyone loves that car. It's a 1969 Boss Mustang  429 cubic inches of American steel. That's a dream car for just about any red blooded American. That IS an American car.
Whatever, so that's the part 1? This idiot kills and steal the car, and John Wick avenge?
Well, more or less, except the idiot is a son of a Russian mob boss. So the boss wants to deal with Wick.
Obviously.
So the boss and Wick go at it at the end of the first film and Wick kills the boss. But, but, there is yet another boss, sort of. Boss's brother.
Of course there is.
And So happens that's where the chapter 2 picks up. Wick heads on over to pick up his car, and kills a bunch of people.
Why did he leave the boss alive, that's so stupid that you would want to make a deal with a Russian mob.
because that's not what the chapter 2 is about.
i get that. but still loose ends. It makes me feel icky. So this Italian guy is the real killer Wick has to deal with?
He is a total bad ass. As a matter of fact, it was that Italian guy who released Wick so he can live a peaceful life with his wife. That's what the marker was. And Santino wants now to cash in his marker. The beginning of the chapter 2. This series is gonna be huge. They might even do more than a trilogy.
