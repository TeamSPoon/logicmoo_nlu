Kendrick is one of the new best rappers out right now.
I agree hes very lyrical and one of the best to do it.
I wonder what his next move is going to be.
After loyalty came out I'm not really sure if he's got to do much more.
Someone else who's really stepping up is J cole.
Really? I wasn't sure if he was any good.
J Cole is definately one of the best out as well. 2014 Forest Hills Drive was a classic.
I'll have to give that album a listen when I got some time.
You have to! I think it really defines the kind of experience he has in music.
But is he better than Kendrick?
No I don't think many people are, but that doesn't mean hes not great still.
Yeah that is true. Who would you say he raps similiar to?
Well he said himself he was influenced by Nas and even has a track about him.
Oh really? Nas actually thinks this guy is good?
Yes. The song "Let Nas Down" was about his interactions with him and wanting to strive in music.
Wow thats interesting and really makes we want to check it out.
Yeah and after you listen to that album you can head to his older stuff which is also good.
Which one should I pick up?
Cole World : Sildeline Story is his first so I'd start there.
Alright cool! Thanks for that.
