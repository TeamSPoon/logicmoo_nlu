Did you watch much college basketball this year?
Yeah, especially during March Madness!
The tournament was great this year wasn't it?
It was good basketball. Less upsets than usual though.
I agree. I think a lot more teams are stronger now.
That's probably true. A lot of the smaller schools can really compete.
Did you think Villanova would repeat?
I was hopeful they would, but I didn't think so.
Me neither. It's so hard to repeat, and they lost some good starters.
Yeah, but I like how most of their players stay all four years.
Same. I'm not much of a fan of one-and-done players.
I think it takes some of the purity out of the game.
Some schools are just player mills to produce professionals.
I guess they have a place, but I prefer players who are truly student-athletes.
Yeah, I guess it's nice to have both.
True. I like seeing those young superstars as well as the seasoned seniors.
I'll be interested where players go in the NBA draft.
Yeah, it's really a great draft class.
Some of the teams who have early picks are very young, so the draftees could make a big impact quickly.
It should be fun to watch them grow in the NBA.
