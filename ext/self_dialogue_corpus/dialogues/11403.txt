Do you think the Beatles will continue to re release their albums like they have with some.
I think so. I believe they are all going to be available on vinyl again.
Wow,that would be great.
I have most of the original Beatles albums from when I,was,growing up.
I do too. Great album covers.
They were very creative in that respect also
Nothing like going out and buying the brand new Beatles album.
Seemed like everyone I knew was waiting for the next one.
Incredible albums they wrote
Never be another band like them
