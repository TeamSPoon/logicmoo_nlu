Thinking about it, I'm a really big fan of how vulnerable The Beatles were.
Oh, I know. They wore their vulnerabilities and insecurities on their sleeves.
Think of a song like "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away."
Exactly, it's about fear of heartbreak and of showing your love.
Or "I'm a Loser"
Ha ha ha! That's a pretty self-deprecating title.
Yes, it is. I think another great, although less heart-on-the-sleeve is "Let It Be."
Why do you say that?
Well, the song is about the stresses and troubles and darkness of light and deciding to just let it be.
That's true, I've actually never realized what that song is really about even though I've heard it hundreds of times.
