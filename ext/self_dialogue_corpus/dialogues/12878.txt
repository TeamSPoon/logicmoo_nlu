What did you think of the latest movie?
I thought it was pretty good. Definitely better than the previous three.
Can we at least agree that the one's with Mark Hammel were the best?
No doubt. The original three will always be my favorite trilogy.
What's your favorite scene from Star Wars?
The light saber fight between Darth Vadar and Obi One is classic.
It's the whole good versus evil thing going on.
Not only that but it was so new for it's time. The special effects at that time were breakthrough.
To me Star Wars just takes you to another place.
I agree. I've never found another movie that just lets me completely get lost in it for a few hours.
