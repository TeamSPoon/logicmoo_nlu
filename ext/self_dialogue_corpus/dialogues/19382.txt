Were you a big Limp Bizkit fan?
Yeah, I really liked them.
What happened to them?
Fred Durst became a psycho and the band broke up.
I thought they were back together?
They comeback then break up every once in a while.
They were huge in the late 90s early 2000s.
During that period they were arguably one of the biggest bands on the planet.
They had a different sound.
It was just a rap metal hybrid.
Do you remember when they started a riot at Woodstock?
I remember the fires and watching it on Mtv.
That was a crazy scene.
You can't have that many people listening to Limp Bizkit and now expect something bad to happen.
Did you like Korn or Limp Bizkit more?
Korn seemed like the better band.
Limp Bizkit seemed more like the popular main stream band.
Korn fans were also a little strange.
All the kids I knew who liked Korn were loners.
I know those kids loved their Korn shirts.
