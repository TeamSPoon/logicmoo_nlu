Have you seen any good horror movies lately?
I don't think I have, there was that new one, god, what's it called,
Oh I think I know what you are talking about. Um the one with the video tape.
Right what is that series called. It was good, really scary.
Oh it's called Rings, I think the original was call the ring or something.
Yea that's it, but I am not sure what the original was about. When was the orginal released?
I think it was released like in 2009 or there abouts.
Do you think the original was more scary or the new one?
Would you want to see it again?
A part of me thinks I would but I honestly would rather see the new Gardians of The galaxy.
Honestly I don't know anything about that series.
OH it's not scary.
It's a marvel movie isn't it?
The gardians is but nut rings.
OH well duh, I was thinking that was a movie for kids.
