Hey, so did you see the latest Star Wars movie? The Force Awakens, I mean.
Yeah, of course. Like three times. Why?
Well, you remember that woman darth vader type? She led the stormtroopers.
Oh, you mean, Captain Phasma?
Yeah. That's her.
So what about her?
Well, I mean, I know she was the bad guy, but did you feel kind of bad for her? I mean, maybe it's sexist, but since she was a she, I don't know, I didn't want her to get hurt.
I mean, she was kind of a killer though, right?
I know. And she's wearing armor too. Is it weird that I felt sympathy for her?
Hmm, maybe. I mean, maybe you just have a thing for bad girls.
