Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just saw suicide squad, it's been on all the time on HBO
That's a really good movie p, I saw it in theaters.
I was hoping the joker would play a bigger par .
I know, me too.
I dont know why in the movie, they made it sound like Harley Quinn was more crazy than joker.
I dont either I think joker is the craziest.
Definitely. I guess they figured joker would be better trying to rescue Harley, then be apart of the Suicide Squad
Yea I guess so.
Did you hear they are coming out with a sequel?
No i didnt know that
I'm excited for it
I am now too.
Unfortunately it's not suppose to be released til 2019.
Wow that's a really long time
I know, it sucks.
I dont know why it takes them so long to come out with the next installment.
Me either, people don't want to wait that long.
No, but they will
That's true.
