Do you watch old movies?
Yes, The Sound of Music is one of my favorite old movies.
The Sound of Music is from 1965. I mean older ones.
Do you mean like Singing in the Rain?
Yes, that is old but I mean movies from the 1930s and 40s or even silents.
I like Casablanca.
What about lesser known movies? Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind are so overplayed.
I don't know a lot about old movies except maybe some Hitchcock.
Which Hitchcock movies do you like or have you seen?
I've seen Psycho, Vertigo, and The Birds
Those are in the late 50s or early 60s. Have you seen his earlier ones?
No, what are some of Hitcock's earlier ones?
My favorites are The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes, both were made in England not Hollywood.
Interesting. When were those films made?
The movies were made in the 1930s.
You know I just remembered I have seen an old movie from the 1930s.
The Wizard of Oz?
Yeah, I've seen that one too but I was thinking of King Kong.
Oh yes, I love King Kong.
I saw King Kong when I was a kid and loved it.
