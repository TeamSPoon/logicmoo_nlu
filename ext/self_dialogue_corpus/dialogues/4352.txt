What's the last best thriller movie you've seen?
I really liked Paranormal Activity.
Really? Nothing more recent?
It Follows and Babadook were pretty good too.
What did you think of Get Out?
Oh, that was pretty clever too. But not so much scary.
I saw one about a girl who gets chased by a blind guy
Oh yeah that one was good too. Filmed in Detroit?
Yeah. that's the one. The Shining is still the best overall.
I agree. It's a masterpiece.
