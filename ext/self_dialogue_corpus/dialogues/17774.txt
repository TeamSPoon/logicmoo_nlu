Hey what kind of music are you listening to these days?
Well I just discovered this artist, he's been around since like 2009 but his name is Watsky.
Watsky, that name sounds familiar. Oh, he was on the Hamilton Mixtape!
Yeah, he did that song 'An Open Letter,' that's actually how I discovered him.
Okay cool, how many albums does he have?
I think like four studio albums and a couple of mixtapes on the website Bandcamp.
Okay, so he's more underground?
I mean I guess so, I haven't really heard much of him until now. But his rhymes are so sick!
Yeah, what's your favorite song of his I should give a listen to?
Wow this is a hard one. Okay a really touching song is 'Tears to Diamonds.'
Interesting title.
Yeah it's actually pretty deep, all about Big Pharma.
Kind of like that Macklemore song, Drug Dealer? His drug dealer is a doctor.
Yes it's the same concept! Watsky has to take medication for his epilepsy, so he gets it.
Okay, he sounds like a really interesting guy!
Yes, another song kind of like that is Chemical Angel.
Okay, so he always makes really serious music!
Not at all! He is such a comedian, he's got these really funny songs.
Yeah?
Yeah check out Going Down and the Legend of Hardhead Ned for some laughs.
