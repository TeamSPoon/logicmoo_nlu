What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan?
In the prequels or in general?
In general.
Aside from the issues with the costume, I think he's a good character.
Cosume issues?
Why would he still be wearing Jedi robes twenty years later? Those are nomad robes. The Jedi outfit should have been different.
Oh, that's hillarious. I never noticed.  I think he did a bad job of keeping an eye on Luke.
I always thought he was just watching to make sure he didn't go nuts.
Well, in that case he did a good job.
But, he could have done more to train him.
