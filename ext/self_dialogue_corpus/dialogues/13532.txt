Here's a fun fact. Star Wars Episode I was the only prequel film to be shot on actual celluloid film.
Why is that?
Well, George Lucas switched to digital film-making after The Phantom Menace.
Oh, that reminds me, didn't they go back to film with Episode VII?
Yeah, The Force Awakens was made on film. Not that it really matters.
Why doesn't it?
Because, it was filmed on film, but then the CGI and other digital effects were put in digitally.
Oh, I didn't even think of that.
The final product is digital too, as all films are nowadays. So it really made no difference to film on celluloid to start with.
I guess they did it so they could say it wasn't digital like the prequels, even if it really was.
