Hey, how are you doing?
I'm doing good, you?
Good, did you have a good weekend?
Yeah, me and the wife went to see a movie.
Which one?
The new fast and furious one
Oh, The Fate of the Furious?
Yeah, it was awesome.
That's the one where Charlize Theron is the new bad guy, right?
Yeah, she's great in it.
It's one of my favorites of the series.
Mine too, what's your favorite part?
When they are being chased by the submarine through Russia.
Oh yeah, there's some great action scenes.
What about yours?
When Jason Statham's character takes on the entire plane while keeping an eye on the baby.
He's such a great actor in the movie.
Yeah, he kicks a lot of butt.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
You too, have a great day.
