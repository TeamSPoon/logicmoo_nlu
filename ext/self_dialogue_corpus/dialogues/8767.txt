Do you like rock bands with male or female lead singers?
I prefer them with female singers. Women like Lacey from Flyleaf Rock!
I like all rock music equally, although I will agree that Lacey has an amazing voice.
Do you prefer hard rock or soft rock?
I love really heavy rock. I love how bands like Rob Zombie pump me up.
Rob Zombie is so cool, I bet he would be great live at a concert especially with all the special effects hes known for.
I would love to go to one of his concerts but the price....maybe one day. Who is your favorite rock band?
I really love Evanescence. Nobody can even compare to her pure vocal talent.
I really enjoy Metallica. Enter Sandman is my all time favorite song ever.
Older rock is cool, the newer rock coming out is definitely different though, some of it is worth looking into.
