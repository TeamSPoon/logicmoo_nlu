I don't really mind football, Shirley, do you?
No, I don't dislike it, Jean. I enjoy the pageantry, the bands, and they sometimes have really good singers too.
Or really bad ones.
That's true, but you can enjoy the bad ones, too in a way.
I know, and I know I'm always affected by the national anthem, when it's sung in the stadium. It moves everybody, I think.
What I dislike, and this is just a minor complaint, is that we have to come so early.
Yes, they absolutely must tailgate.
And eat greasy food, and drink beer
But of course its better that people drink early. It gives them time to sober up.
Because the traffic is murder.
Yes, it's my least favorite thing about football.
My favorite thing is seeing your old friends from the section. Visiting with the neighbors, you know.
Yes, you get to see them again every year, all season.
You can catch up on what they did that summer. And see what's new.
Yes, that's always nice.
Then, if the 49ers win, everybody's in a good mood.
It kind of sets people up for a pleasant week.
Then, if they go to the playoffs, everybody's happy.
Or if the 49ers win the superbowl, the men say "we won."
As if they'd scored those touchdows themselves.
