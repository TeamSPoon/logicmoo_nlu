Hey NFL training camps begin at the end of this month are you excited
Absolutely I can't wait who do you think is going to win it all this year?
I know everyone hates them but I really think the Pats can do it again.
The Pats? No way cheating only gets you so far I like the Cowboys.
Really? What makes you think it's their year?
Their conference record was 13-3 last year they can only get better.
I guess Prescott is kind of like a young Brady or Romo.
Yes that's why I think they'll do it, he's young and strong.
What do you think about the Steelers? My cousin from Pittsburgh has been going off all summer about how they're going to dominate.
Roetglisberger doesn't seem too confident Dobbs might have to fill in.
Oh yeah Dobbs isn't very consistent might not be a great year after all.
You thinking about Super Bowl tickets? Vance has an awesome time there two years ago.
It might be cool to check out the new stadium in Minneapolis but it's going to be freezing.
I know might be worth it though.
Maybe I should plan on it might be worth it if Brady goes again, I'll keep an eye on it.
Really? He'll get hurt or caught doing something illegal again.
Aw come on a lot of players have been accused of much worse and got a slap on the wrist.
Yeah Roger Goodell isn't that consistent with his punishments.
Let's plan on an opening day party.
Definitely let's do it.
