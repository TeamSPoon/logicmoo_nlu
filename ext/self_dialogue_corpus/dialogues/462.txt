Do you like Colin Kaepernick?
The guy that plays football?
Yeah, him.
No, not really.
Really?  I think he was awesome with the 49ers.
Oh, he was a good quarterback.
But you don't like him?
I don't really like his politics I guess.
What do you mean?
I don't really have anything against him, I just believe that a lot of his beliefs are wrong.
Oh, like not standing for the national anthem?
Yeah, that stuff.
He has the right to feel how he feels though.
I understand that, but at the same time I have the right to disagree.
I hear you.
And I'm not sure if he chose the correct platform.
How do you mean?
He could have started foundations that fostered what he believed in. He didn't have to use the NFL as a voice.
It was an easy way to reach a lot of people.
He reached a lot of people that didn't want to hear it though.
