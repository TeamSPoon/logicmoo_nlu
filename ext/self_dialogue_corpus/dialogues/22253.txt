I just watched Enemy of the State again.
Yeah? Which one was that.
It was about how the government can monitor and track anyone.
Scarry stuff, especially these days.
Do you know the movie I'm talking about?
I don't think I've seen it....
I'm sure you have.
Who's in it.
Will Smith and Gene Hackman.
I have seen that. I love those actors.
I know. They're both so good.
Where you get it.
It's out on Netflix
Cool. I'm going to have to watch that again.
I'd reccomend it!
Don't see much of Hackman these days.
I know. Sad.
He must be getting up there in age.
Yeah, 70's probably.
That never stopped George Burns!
