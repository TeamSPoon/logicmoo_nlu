Do you like the Dark Knight movies?
I do but I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale as Batman.
Is it because you prefer another of the original Batmans?
No it's because he sounds like he's battling throat cancer. It's really annoying.
I guess that's true. I love how Christopher Nolan directed those movies though.
You're right, he did a terrific job. I loved the one with Bane the most.
Oh that was my favorite too. When he broke Batman's back I was in shock.
I was in even more shock at how long it took him to recover.
Well he is just human, so it made sense in reality.
True but I don't like watching my superhero's battle their weaknesses for too long.
