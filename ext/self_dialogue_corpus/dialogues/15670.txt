Remember that song by Toto, "Africa"?
Yes, kind of dull by my tastes.
I always thought they were singing, "I took the blame down in Africa."
Isn't that right? It sounds right.
No, it's actually "I bless the rains down in Africa."
I wish these singers would learn how to pronounce words.
Or stop screaming "Baby" too much, like Led Zeppelin.
And I always thought David Bowie was singing, "That mellow fat chick put my spine out of place." Not very nice language.
But isn't that exactly what he's singing? In "Suffragette City", I think it was.
No, it's actually "This mellow-thighed chick...", etcetera.
What? My mistaken lyrics make more sense. I still can't understand half of "Stairway To Heaven" either.
Or "Long Cool Woman" by the Hollies. I still can't get that right after almost fifty years.
"Just a five nine beautiful tall."  I looked it up one day. "Well I heard somebody shooting a gun".
Thank you. I thought it was, "When I heard something I shouldn't have known."
There's some company on the internet that prints wrong lyrics on beer bottle holders.
Aw, now why didn't I think of that? Or T-Shirts?
"There's A Bathroom On The Right". That's a good one.
What? What's that from?
Creedence Clearwater Revival's, "Bad Moon On The Rise".
Oh, I remember my little brother almost fifty years ago thinking that's what they were singing!
