What kind of music do you like?
I really like Country and Pop
Oh! I love Country too
Really? Who is your favorite singer
I really like Darius Rucker lately
Me too, have you heard his new song?
Which one?
Southern Style
Oh yea, I love that song! I also love his other new one, I told you
I think the title is "If I told you"
Oh you're right, it is. Its a great song
Who is your favorite female singer?
I really like Miranda Lambert, especially when I'm feeling spunky
I love her too. I can't believe her and Blake broke up
I know, I am sad about that
At least they are both still making great music
Very true but I miss Miranda's old work
I love her album, Kerosene
Me too! Such a great album, I belt out all of those songs in my car
Me too, we have the same taste in music!
