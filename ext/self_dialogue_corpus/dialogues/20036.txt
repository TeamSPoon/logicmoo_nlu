Did you happen to see Bruce Springsteen live last month?
No, where did he play?
The stadium in Foxboro.
Did you go?
Yes! It was amazing.
How long did he play?
About 4 hours in total.
Wow! How many songs is that?
I would guess almost 30 or 40.
He can play forever! I don't know how he does it.
Especially at that age!
What is your favorite album of his?
Probably Nebraska.
That was a good one. So you like his old stuff?
It's my favorite. I cannot get into his new music.
I agree. Too modern for me.
I know. I like the nostalgia of his old tunes.
My favorite album is probably Darkness on the Edge of Town.
That's an old album too!
I know - I can't get enough of it!
