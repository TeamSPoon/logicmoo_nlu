What did think about Han Solo's death in the The force awakens?
To be honest I freaked out.
Why didn't you like it?
Of course I didn't like it Han is my favorite scoundrel smuggler!
Yeah dumb question I guess. Though I feel really sad that they killed him off.
I do as well, but Harrison Ford stated that he wanted his character to die in Return of the Jedi.
Really? I wonder why.
Not sure but I have to say I was so happy to see him and Chewy together again.
Totally! And the millennium falcon flying around again gave me goose bumps!
Haha, yes that scene gave me some goose bumps as well.
