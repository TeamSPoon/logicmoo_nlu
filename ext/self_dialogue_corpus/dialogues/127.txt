Have you seen Dr. Strange yet?
Yes I have and I loved it. I especially love saying Benedict Cumberbatch's name.
Me too, it's a great name. And he's a great actor.
Yes and I was really please to see Rachel McAdams in another movie.
I loved her in The Notebook!
Me too! The majority of women do.
Yes and I loved the message of Dr. Strange. Tapping into your inner strength and energy.
Me too, I practice meditation myself to cultivate mindfulness.
So do I. I'd love to cultivate the type of powers he had, that's for sure.
That scene with Dormammu was hilarious, with the time loop. That would have driven anyone crazy.
