Hey, did you see that game last night?
Yeah, I can't believe how much the Bears came back
I know right? What a game
I thought they were done in the first quarter
Me too. How do you give up 3 interceptions in the first quarter?
I was pulling my hair out, I was throwing things at the tv
I know, I know. I was losing my mind too, But then they just turned it around.
Like two different teams, Like they learned how to play after the half
I don't know what they gave them in the locker room, but it worked.
Yeah, just as long as they don't get caught, I don't care what they give them if it makes them play like that
I think that was one of the best touchdowns I have ever seen
yeah, the guy rand the entire field, dodging guys left and right
Every time you thought he was ganna get tacked, he shook them off
The guy is like a greased pig
No one can touch him
I hope he stays on the team for a while
Yeah, they got to keep him
Superbowl, here we come.
thats what I'm sayin
Let's watch the next game here
