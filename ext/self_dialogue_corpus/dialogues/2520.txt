Who are the most famous players in the NFL from the University of Michigan?
That's easy! Tom Brady is the most famous Wolverine in the NFL.
True, but who else?
Can I list past or present players?
Both!
Okay, thanks. The next most famous player would be Desmond Howard.
The Heisman trophy winner?
Yes, he's famous for striking the Heisman pose.
Any other famous Wolverines in the NFL?
Yes, there's definitely more.
Like who?
Probably the most famous defensive player is Charles Woodson.
The cornerback?
Yes, and he also returned some punts.
He was a "two-way" player. Such players are rare today.
He's also the last player to win the Heisman who was neither a quarterback nor a running back.
Wow, he must be a great athlete!
I think so. Jabrill Peppers is the only other Wolverine with Charles' athleticism.
What makes Jabrill so special?
He, at one point, played 15 different positions.
