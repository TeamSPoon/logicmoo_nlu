I have to say Beauty and The Beast the animated version is still one of my all time favorites.
It is one of the best fairy tales I agree.
I liked their songs a lot plus the story is good.
My favorite character is Belle for sure.
What did you think of the live action version of it?
It was alright but I didn't like that they changed Gaston's song a little.
True. The original Gaston song is the best.
Emma Watson though does make a good Belle.
True but Paige OHara's voice was perfect for Belle too.
Either way i still like the Beast in the story too.
