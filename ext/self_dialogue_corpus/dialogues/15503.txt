Who is your favorite band on the 60's?
Besides the Beattles?
Do you like the Beattles the best?
The Beattles are in a class by themselves!  Of course I like them!
But I really like the Rolling Stones better.
Better? Or as well?  I would almost consider them in two different categories.
Such as?
Beattles: a great group.  Rolling Stones: a great band.
Ok.  I still put the Stones first.  And if you are going with groups, then what about the Supremes?
The Supremes, Hermann's Hermits, the Mamas and the Pappas, the list goes on. But you said band.
Okay, okay. Beattles you say are the greatest band.  I say the Rolling Stones.
And we didn't even touch the Beach Boys.
I can't take any band seriously that had Uncle Jesse as a member.
He played drums for them when they were old.  They did some great stuff.
But most of it is that how to stuff a wild bikini kind of songs. Like California Girls.
Because the lyrics to Satisfaction are so profound?
But the guitar playing . . .
. . . can't touch Jimi Hendrix.
I said band!
So you did.
