Are you into super hero movies at all?
I like some of them. Some are not as good.
Which ones do you consider good?
Well for one The Dark Knight was an amazing movie.
Yes I love that one as well. My husband is a huge Batman fan.
Mine as well. In fact I am too.
I think it is so sad that Heath Ledger died before the movie was even finished.
That was so horrible.
He was a tremendous actor in that movie.
He was amazing. You can tell he really absorbed that character.
I like how they did his make up and his Joker's clothes too.
I think the characters just meshed well together.
I agree. Definitely.
Christian Bale did a great job as Batman.
I think so too. Remember when he and Joker were facing off towards the end of the movie?
You mean where Batman was trying to save the people on the boat?
Yes that part!
I remember that.
It was also hilarious actually when Joker walked away from the hospital and the bomb didn't work right.
Right! Then he turned around with a goofy look on his face.
