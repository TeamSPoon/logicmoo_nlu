Have you heard any of Katy Perry's new music?
Not yet. Is it any good?
Did you like her older stuff?
Some of it. I thought "Firework" was great.
That song is good. If you like that you would probably like her new stuff.
As long as it's not like her earlier releases I'll be good.
Are you talking about "I Kissed a Girl"?
Yes, that song is probably the most annoying song ever.
I agree, It seemed like the radio played it every five minutes.
That's probably the main reason I find it so annoying now.
Every really popular song gets played too much, though.
That's true. Is she releasing a new album or are the songs just singles?
It's a new album. It's called "Witness".
That's cool. I'll definitely check it out.
There's a song called "Swish, Swish" on it with Nicki Minaj. It's pretty catchy.
I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan.
I think she's a good rapper. I don't like when she tries to sing.
Yeah, I agree. It's a bit too synthetic.
There's definitely some studio magic going on with her singing voice.
I don't blame her though. As long as she's making the music she likes it's no harm done to me.
