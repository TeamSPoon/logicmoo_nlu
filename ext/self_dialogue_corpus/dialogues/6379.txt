Did you see the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I did! What did you think about it?
I liked it! I thought the way they brought Will and Elizabeth back together was great!
Same! It's hard to believe the series has progressed to their children being old enough to have their own adventures.
Seriously, where has the time gone?
Also, what did you think about Barbosa having a daughter?
Wow! That totally surprised me.
Right? I couldn't believe it either.
Too bad there won't be another one in the series, but at least this last one was great.
I know. Well, onto bigger and better things I guess!
