Can you recommend a good comedy movie?
What about Tommy Boy?
Oh, that's a good one. Chris Farley was a hilarious actor.
Totally. He was such a great actor.
He and David Spade make a fantastic comedy team.
I know, Chris was larger then life and David Spade is so dry. They really played off each other.
I thought that really showed in Black Sheep.
Black Sheep was okay, not one of my favorites though.
Really? I thought it was super funny.
Yeah, I don't know. Just not one of my favorites.
