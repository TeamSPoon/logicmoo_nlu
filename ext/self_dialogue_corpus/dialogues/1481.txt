do you remember randall cunningham?
of course. randall was that dude.
i remember when he played for the eagles. he was a beast.
i know. do you remember when he played for the vikings?
awe man. that's when he had chris carter and all carter did was catch touch downs.
yeah. remember buddy ryan said that stupid stuff about carter?
i know right.
all he did was get cut and go to the vikings catching touch downs.
i remember that year when the vikes led the league in scoring.
randall was reincarnated.
i think that was bad coaching when they played the falcons.
what you mean?
in the n f c championship game.
what?
the falcons tied it up and the vikes had maybe forty seconds left and at least a time out or two.
oh yeah, and the coach told them to take a knee and go into overtime.
i think the vikes should have at least tried to get into field goal range.
the coach was scared.
then they messed around and lost to garbage behind atlanta.
and the broncos beat the crap out of the falcons in the super bowl.
