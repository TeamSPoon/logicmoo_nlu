When does Gleyber Torres get called up to the majors?
Probably 2018.
Really? You don't think he gets the call sooner with his performance?
There's not really a roster opening at the moment.
Oh come on, he's gotta be better than some of the bench guys.
He's in Double-A, it's not common to jump a guy up that quick to put him on the bench. It's a waste of money.
How will you know if it's a waste of money if he hasn't even played yet?
It's an accounting and management issue. He's a controllable asset and you don't want to start his service clock where he becomes more expensive unless he can contribute.
Huh. But you have to expect some roster moves in terms of injuries and moves across the duration of the season.
If they compete and he really does well, I can possibly see him getting a September call-up but I wouldn't pencil it in as likely.
The Yankees will need him in the playoffs.
Where is he going to play? They have Gregorius, Castro, Torreyes in the middle infield.
Like I said, things change over the course of the season.
Put it like this, would you rather have Torres for a whole extra year or for a few games off the bench in September.
I get your point, but it seems to me that you'd want all hands on deck for a playoff run.
You Yankees fans just want everybody on your team no matter what lol.
We want to win.
Yankees are actually back to building their team the right way with these young players. No need to rush everybody.
I guess  you're right. They've done a good job through trades and stuff.
I'd be more worried about pitching than adding another infielder to an embarrassment of riches.
