Did you like N Sync's performane at the VMAs in 2000?
I thought it was understated
In what manner
I think they are largely overrated
They were the most popular boy band of the 90s!
I dont know if I would say that.
Yes they were larger than New Kids on the Block!
I would agree with you there but I hated their sound
Most of their guys went on to do bigger things as well
Surprised they were able to break the mold
