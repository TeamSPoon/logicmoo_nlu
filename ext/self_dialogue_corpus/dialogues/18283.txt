Have you listened to Lars Ulrich's show on Apple Music?
No, I don't have Apple Music.
Sad! It's show featuring hard rock music which is uncommon these days now that everything is hip-hop or electronic.
Makes sense, he's the drummer for Metallica right?
I think so, yeah.
So what are some good bands he plays? Did you find any new music?
Yeah, have you heard of the band Royal Blood?
I saw a promo for them somewhere, but never listened to them.
Oh, they're pretty good. Heavy riffs.
Cool. What other bands do they sound like? What are their influences?
It's a blues rock sound, but it sounds contemporary not retro.
So not like the Black Keys or some Jack White project?
Not really. The riffs are kind of Led Zeppelin sounding, although the singer is no Robert Plant.
What do you mean by "He's no Robert Plant"?
Well, I don't think the Royal Blood vocalist has the range of Plant.
Oh, I see. How many good songs are on their latest album? Are they a two hits and the rest filler kind of things? Or all good?
I feel like there are four or five good songs which is not bad considering all the albums that come out with two good singles only.
Yeah, that's pretty good. It might be worth checking out.
The new album is called "How Did We Get So Dark" I think.
Ok, I
