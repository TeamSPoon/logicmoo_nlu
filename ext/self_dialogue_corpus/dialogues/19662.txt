I know you can visit YouTube and hear some of their music.
That would be fantastic! I will check some out now!
Sounds great!
What is your favorite song by them?
I would have to say Left Hand Free.
Great! I will listen to that one first.
Alt-J has been around since 2007.
How have I never heard of them?
Their album was not released in the US until 2012.
Ah, that makes a bit more sense. That is still five years ago.
True. The band is from Europe.
How many members are in the band?
There are four!
Are they all males?
Yes they are. Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Thom Sonny Green (drums) and Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals).
Perfect! I love boy bands!
Their song This Is All yours was an instant hit in the UK.
I will check that one out as well!
Great! I hope you enjoy it!
I will let you know what I think! Thank you for the suggestion!
