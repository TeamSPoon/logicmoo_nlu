I think that Michelle Williams is an underrated actress.
She's amazing and has done great things since Dawson's Creek.
I know, right? She does a lot of quiet indie films.
She is very good at finding her way in those movies.
I love her as a romantic lead in independent films.
I really want to watch her in Manchester by the Sea. I haven't seen it yet.
Oh, that's the one with Casey Affleck, right?
Yes! And Kyle Chandler as well.
That's on my must see list then!
She was also really great in the chick flick Me Without You.
I know! That one tends to slip through the cracks.
Yeah, not many people talk about it. But it's so fun.
I love it. I love Anna Friel in it as well.
It's nice to see a movie like that where the female leads are flawed and have a complicated friendship.
I know. It's so refreshing, if a bit sad.
The retro vibe of the movie is great as well.
Yeah, I love how it's set in England in the past.
It's funny when they try to go punk by wearing trash bags as dresses.
That's amazing. The style is so fun in that movie.
And it kind of has a happy ending. For Michelle's character anyway.
