Afternoon.
Hello.
How are you?
Doing great, you?
Yeah not bad.
Good.
We're supposed to talk about movies?
Yep that's right.
Okay.  What is your favorite movie would you say?
Oh, tough question.
Yeah sorry.
No worries, I would probably have to say Titanic.
Oh okay.
What about you?
Of all time?
Sure.
Ok.  I would say Citizen Kane.
Never saw that.
You should it's great.
Okay.
