Did you hear the new Mulan movie is coming out!
I know im so excited!
I wonder if they will still have that cute racoon?
I hope they still have that racoon, he was so awesome!
When is it coming out so we can see it together?
Looks like November 2nd, 2018
I cant wait!

She truly is a princess!
And can see ALL the colors of the WIND!
