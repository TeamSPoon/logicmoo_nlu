I am pumped for some NFL!
Me too! Next month can't come soon enough.
They are broadcasting 8 of the pre-season games.
Pre-season games mean nothing.
It is a chance to see the new rookies play.
True but the stars don't play.
They don't want to risk an injury before the season starts.
It makes evaluating teams really difficult.
Are you still  Steeler's fan?
Big Ben all the way! I have my towel ready.
The one thing about Steelers fans is you can find them all over the country.
A lot of cities have Steeler fan bars.
Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year?
I think the Giants have a good chance.
It is hard to stop Odell Beckham Jr.
Eli Manning still has a few good years left
Do you think he will retire and do pizza commercials with his brother?
The Mannings know how to make money.
I think the Patriots will make it to the Super Bowl again.
They seem unstoppable.
