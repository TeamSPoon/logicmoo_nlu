Did you ever watch Wild?
Is that the one with the blonde actress, Kirstin Dunst?
Yes that is the one.
What is it about?
It is where she plays a hiker.
Oh that sounds interesting.
Yes it is actually really well done.
Why do you say that.
It gives a great character development story.
What do you mean exactly?
Her life background, outside of hiking, is thoroughly discussed.
Ok so it tells her motivations and rewards for hiking.
You understand this subject well.
Yes I like hiking.
Yes we humans are complex and derive interesting satisfaction from hiking.
I like hiking a lot.
