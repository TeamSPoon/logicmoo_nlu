What is your favorite food and drink for a baseball game?
At the stadium, or at home?
Both. Amuse me.
Either way, beer is the go-to.
Duh? Do you know some parks serve wine?
Yeah, I love wine, but outside in 90 degrees during a baseball game out of a plastic cup is an awful idea.
Some parks even have sushi! That's a health hazard right there.
I love the craft foods and beer at ballparks, but they have their issues. Can you imagine eating a $15 lobster mac and cheese and having someone knock it down by accident?
That's why pizza is better. Simple game, simple people, simple food.
Where I disagree is on beer.
Of course you would. How so?
Well, first off, MLB parks shouldn't allow ONE company to sponsor their beer choices. Limited options are always a bad idea.
But, no one wants a 10% double IPA while watching baseball.
Actually, I do. And, all ballparks are surrounded by breweries. Having them on tap is great for everyone.
Sure, but most baseball fans at the games are rednecks who'll never drink the hops.
That's why ballparks need to allow craft beer in cans at the stadium, instead of just on tap. Plus these breweries make pilseners, lagers, and all other redneck styles.
Best food you've ever had at a ballpark?
Done with the beer discussion? Sure...I want to watch the game with a pretzel with cheese. Pizza is too greasy, and with a hot dog you have to walk around with ketchup and mustard on it until you get back to your seats.
I like pizza.
Yeah, but then your hands are greasy. hard to cheer on the team and give out high-fives when your hands are covered in pepperoni juice.
