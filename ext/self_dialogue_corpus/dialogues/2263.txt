Who is your favorite wide receiver currently in the league?
My favorite would have to be Odell Beckham Jr.
Really? I was expecting you to say someone else,
Who were you expecting me to say?
I don't know, maybe someone like Antonio Brown.
Antonio Brown might be the best right now, but he's not my favorite.
I just think Odell is too flashy.
That's exactly why I like him.
Okay, well, who is your second favorite?
Probably Julio Jones.
He's not better than Antonio Brown either.
Maybe not, but he's always good to me in fantasy football.
I guess those are okay players to have as your favorite.
What about you? Who is your favorite?
My favorite is obviously Antonio Brown.
Because he's the best?
Because he's the best!!
Okay, but, he's not very flashy.
He doesn't have to be flashy to be the best.
I guess so.
