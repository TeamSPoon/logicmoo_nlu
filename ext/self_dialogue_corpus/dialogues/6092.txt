Who is your favorite Disney sidekick?
What do you mean sidekick?
Well Mickey had Donald, Goofy and Minnie. Winnie the Pooh had Tigger, Eeyore, Rabbit and Piglet.
Out of those choices I think Tigger was the worst sidekick but still my favorite.
What do you mean worst?
Tigger never had a clear thought process to work with. He just did what he wanted when he wanted and never thought of the consequences.
You are right, he was always getting the group into trouble.
Yes but never intentionally.
Very true since he was just a happy go lucky kind of a guy.
Which is why I liked him! He just couldn't help himself.
