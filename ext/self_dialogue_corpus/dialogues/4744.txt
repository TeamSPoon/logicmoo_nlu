Would you like to go to a ball game?
Which sport?
Baseball.
Definitley not!
Why?
I never really cared for the sport.
But it's America's favorite pasttime.
Not mine.
Any reason in particular.
It's so boring.
Have you ever seen a game live?
No.
You should give it a try.
OK. I'll tag along.
I'll buy you a hotdog and a beer.
You had me at beer!
You're such a loser!
I know. Ha!
Let's go!
Let me grab my jacket.
