So, I'm thinking of doing a pet movie marathon.
Pet movies?
Yeah. Like, the movies where animals have voices dubbed over.
Oh, so like Babe.
Exactly. Or Homeward Bound.
I loved Homeward Bound as a kid. So much.
I did too. I even loved the sequel, but it was set where I grew up, so I may have a bias.
So the Homeward Bound movies are an automatic yes then.
Do you have any other ideas?
Maybe Milo and Otis?
That's a good one!
It's another "animals on an adventure" movie.
I had a couple more ideas, but they're not quite in the same category.
Well, what are they?
I was thinking Air Bud could be a good choice?
That's a little different. I think of it more as a sports movie.
It's so funny though. Have you watched it recently?
Not in a decade or so.
Then it's going on the list!
Alright, I'll look forward to it.
