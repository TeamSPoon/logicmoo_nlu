What is your favorite rock band of all time?
There are too many from which to select although at least 3 are my favorites.
I agree but The Eagles probably do it for me. So does Lynyrd Skynrnd and the Doobie Brothers
Why the Eagles as #1?
Because they were the first to turn country into country rock. Their melodies were incredible.
I agree I can listen to "Take it Easy" any time of the night or day. So cool.
I also think the band improved when they added Joe Walsh in 1977.
Oh, no doubt. He had such a great solo career before then and he added a harder version to the band.
He was a fantastic addition. You know Joe always is in the top 50 guitarists per Rolling Stone magazine.
His work on Hotel California was legendary for sure. Even better guitarist than the founders.
