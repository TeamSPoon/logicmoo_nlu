who do you think the best running backs are going to be next year
I have my eye on the new kid, Ezekiel Elliott
oh definitely. he had a crazy season last year. 1,631 yards and 15 TDs. that is like beyond all star quality
I'm also going to be watching Jordan Howard
He looks really good as well. He only found the end zone 6 times, but he did rush for 1,300+ yards. he is going to do good things for the bears if he stays with them
Of course I will also have my eye on Le'Veon Bell
I don't know what it is about him, but I really don't like his running style
He puts up huge numbers. he ranked in the top 5 last year, and only played three quarters of the season
he does put up big numbers, but the way he stutter steps and hits the hole so delayed is annoying. I think defenses will eventually figure him out
no way. he is a rock star. so long as he stays healthy he will have a great year
personally, i'm going to watching how DeMarco Murray continues to perform
I like Tennessee's quarterback, Mariota. If he continues to perform, that will only make Murray more dangerous
He's already extremely dangerous. he averaged 80 yards a game last year with about 4.4 yards per carry
no doubt. do you think LeGarrette Blount will repeat his performance again. surpisingly that old workhorse lead the league in TDs for RBs at 18!
holy cow. i didn't know he had that many. he really adjusted to New England well.
i personally think he might be a little too old to put up those kinds of numbers again
David Johnson will probably have another stellar year
I had him in one of my fantasy leagues. he just racked up points for me week after week
you are so luck. he had 16 TDs last year. that got you a ton of points
I know. I could count on him almost every week.
