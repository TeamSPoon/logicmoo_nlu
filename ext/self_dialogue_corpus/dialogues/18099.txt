Hey what do you think about the new Sam Hunt single?
He has a new song out?!
Yea, it's called "body like a back road".
Is it any good?
Its awesome! I wouldn't be surprised if he got an award for the song.
No way! It's that good? I need to hear it!
You should! I heard it's going to be the song for this 2017 summer.
Wow, I think I have actually heard this song on a pop station!
That's awesome! It's rare a country artist makes it on both country and pop stations.
Yea no kidding! I was trying to figure out who sang that "body like a backroad" song. Didn't know it was Sam Hunt.
Yea. He has a lot of other good songs as well.
I know! I am a huge fan. My favorite song of his is "house party"
That's my favorite song too!
I heard he is on tour right now. We should get tickets to his show if he comes to Arizona!
Yes, definitely! I am going to look right now.
Awesome let me know who he is on tour with.
He is coming to Arizona in August! He is coming with Mareen Morris and Chris Janson.
No way! I love their music too!
I am getting lawn seat tickets do you want one?
Yes for sure get me one too!
