Are you looking forward to football starting up again?
You know, I've lost interest lately. I just feel like the NFL is corrupt.
Really? There aren't any rivalries you like to follow, or certain games you want to watch?
I mean, I'll follow the Raiders' season halfheartedly.
I can't believe they're leaving Oakland!
Yeah, it's really disappointing. I don't think I can pretend to be a 49ers fan.
I don't blame you. I'm not an Oakland fan, but I'm sad to see them leaving, since I enjoyed going to a game or two every season.
So what's your favorite team?
I'm from Cleveland, so I'm a Browns fan.
Ouch. At least your baseball and basketball teams are doing well!
Yeah, but it would still be nice to have a decent football team.
On the bright side, it will be hard to do any worse than last year!
No kidding. I was prepared to go the whole season without a single win!
That would've been rough. The Raiders were looking so good last year...until Carr got injured!
Ah, yeah. I felt bad for the team and the fans, even though I'm not a Raiders fan. That was hard to watch.
So how are the Browns looking going into this season?
Hard to say. I've learned, as a Cleveland fan, to take it one day at a time! I really hope we can give Joe Thomas a good season for once, though!
He's a great offensive tackle.
He's one of the best!
Well, good luck to you and your Browns!
