I like the Minnesota Vikings.
Vikings sounds like a tough name.
They are based in Minneapolis.
They were established in 1960.
That's 57 years ago.
They play in U.S. Bank Stadium.
They used to be part of the Western conference.
Then they were part of the central division.
In 1970 they were in the NFC Central.
Now they are in the NFC north.
Their uniform is white and purple.
Sometimes it is Gold and purple.
Zygi Wilf is the owner.
He was born in Germany.
Mark Wilf is the president.
Rick Speilman is the General manager.
Mike Zimmer is the head coach.
He used to be defensive coordinator for other teams.
A good nick name is the Vikes.
They have 28 playoff appearances.
