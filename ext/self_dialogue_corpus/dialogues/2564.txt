Did you her, Terrell Davis is going to be in the Hall of Fame this year?
Really? Wow. He deserves it.
Yeah, i think that's a good call.
Where is the Hall of Fame located?
Oh, in Canton i believe.
Ohio?
Yes, in Ohio.
Have you ever been there?
No, i've always wanted to go tho.
Me too, that would be a cool trip.
Well, yeah but what else is there to do in Canton Ohio?
Haha, i'm sure there has to be SOMETHING there.
Well, Akron is near by.... didn't they make blimps?
Oh yeah, that's right.
So i guess we can hit the NFL Hall of Fame and possibly the Blimp Museum.
I'm not sure i could sell my wife on that one.
Haha, true, i guess we would have to research to see what else is there.
I would like to go to the Hall of Fame tho.
Me too, lets look into this.
Flights gotta be cheap to Akron.
