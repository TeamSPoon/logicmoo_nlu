Have you seen the movie Karate Kill?
I think so, is that the one where the guy's sister gets kidnapped?
Yea that's the one! It was pretty crazy huh?
Yea, it was kind of weird though.
Why did you think it was weird?
It was just kind low budget.
Yea that's true, but the fighting was so cool!
Yea the fighting was amazing.
I hope they come out with a part 2.
Yea, so do I!
