Aroldis Chapman on the DL with shoulder issues.
Not good news.
Yeah, but the Yankees at least have Betances to fill in as a reliable closer.
That's good, but this is really bad for Chappy.
He's only on the 10 day DL, it can't be too bad.
Not necessarily, they put him on the 10 day disabled list to hold for evaluation.
So it could be worse than that?
Yes. Anytime you hear shoulder injury it is a reason for pause.
It is being reported as shoulder soreness, not bad.
Well rotator cuff for a pitchers is very serious. Lot of guys never get well.
You're right, Scott Kazmir might be one of the only guys to salvage something after major shoulder issues.
Right, and he had to change his style and it took years to get it back.
Now I'm worried.
Well it could be managed, but shoulder is serious opposed to elbow issues or other injuries.
Let's hope it's minor and he gets through it.
For his sake I do hope so. The guy throws hard and anything that jeopardizes that can be career threatening.
Yep. You have to think it's somewhat unsurprising that he would eventually have an issue.
Reminds me a little bit of Wood and Prior.
But Chapman is a reliever so maybe he has a better chance of working through it.
Probably why they made him a reliever in the first place, they had to know the risk of throwing that hard would be best in small doses.
