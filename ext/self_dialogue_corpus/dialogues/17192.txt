Hey man, what do you think of Deftones?
Dude, I love them!
Yeah? What's your favorite Deftones album?
I would have to say Around The Fur. What about you?
I love ATF, and I really dig White Pony. What's your favorite song by them?
7 Words! Ever seen them live?
Oh yeah man, many times. What about you?
Yeah, a few times. First time was during Family Values.
Oh really? Me too! What venue?
New Orleans! What about yourself?
Haha me too! Excellent show! Wish they would have joined on the second year, too.
Yeah man, me too. So what do you think of their latest album?
I love it. I thnk it really shows growth and maturity. I think it is perfect.
Yeah man, can't scream all the time, haha.
Yeah no doubt. Whats your favorite song on Gore?
Hearts/Wires, but I really love Gore, too.
Me too! I really dig those two, and Pittura Infamante.
Man the whole album is just awesome.
Yeah it is! There really isn't a bad song on it. I like how they named the songs based on what you might could hear in the lyrics if you misinturpreted them.
Yeah at first I was like why did they name it this? But then once I understood the lyrics I was like oh man thats clever.
