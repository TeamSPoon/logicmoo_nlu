I am so excited to see what they will do with the new Avengers.
You know, this is one of the last ones Chris Evans will do.
I will miss him.
He really was the best Captain America.
I liked the way he looked so wholesome, like acted that way too.
In the movies he is poor too.
He would never make money from helping people.
Do you think some how they will bring Peggy Carter back in the film before he leaves?
I hope they have a happy ending for him.
I always thought it was a nice touch the way they made her marry Iron Man's dad.
I wished they would have really had more story in to that story line.
I like the way the Avengers all weave into one another's stories.
I like the way in the Captain movies Bucky came into play.
He was so pivotal to the plot in the Avengers too.
I hope he gets a happy ending too.
I hated the way they just left the Hulk out pretty much.
I think they were playing into what he has been up to.
I can not wait to see how the whole thing ends.
I hope they have more AntMan in this movie.
I think they will make more movies for him.
