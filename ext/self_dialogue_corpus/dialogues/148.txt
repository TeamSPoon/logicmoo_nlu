Why are the superman movies so bad?
I'm not sure, it has so much potential.
Superman is such a great character
Yea, which is why it might not do so well on the big screen, a lot of ways to screw it up.
The acting isnt too bad either, its just eveything else.
Yea, and the batman vs superman movie was atrocious
Batman movies are awesome too, I guess superman affects anything it touches.
The comics are good.
I think I will just stick to those.
Maybe they just need to get Dean Cain to play Superman again.
