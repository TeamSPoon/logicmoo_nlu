You ready for some football next month!?
Next month? I hate the preseason.
Really, why's that? At least it's football.
Yeah, but crappy!
That's true. None of the starters play too long.
But, don't get me wrong... we're getting close.
True. Who you rooting for this year?
I don't know, but I think the Pats are gonna win it all again.
Everyone seems to think that, but I feel like Brady is getting too old.
He's definitely getting up there.
He can say he'll play for however long, but Grandfather Time always win.
But he feels he's in the best shape of his life.
I heard him say that. We'll see.
He's definitely going to be better than Peyton.
Oh, definitely. That was sad to see.
Hopefully Brady goes with some grace.
Yeah. Watching Manning have to be dragged to a ring by his defense... sad.
Tell me about it. And then the HGH scandal...
Oh, yeah. I definitely believed that story.
Me too. But whatever, Brady proved he's better than Manning for sure with this last win.
