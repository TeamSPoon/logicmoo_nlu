Have you heard of 50 cent?
Yes of course.
Do you like his music.
He was one of my favorites a long time ago.
That changed?
Yes, he just stopped producing music really.
Yeah I guess you're right he hasn't produced an album for a long time.
Yeah so long I don't even remember his last album.
I wonder why did he just lose interest in rap?
I'm not sure but I imagine that's why.
