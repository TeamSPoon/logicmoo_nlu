I heard a song yesterday that reminded me of "Strawberry Fields Forever." Do you like that song?
Yes, I love that song. Are you a Beatles fan?
Yes, I am. My favorite album is Revolver.
Oh, I'm not really familiar with that album. What songs are on it?
"Taxman," "Eleanor Rigby." The latter is beautiful, one of the first ones to have strings. It's a pretty sad song actually.
Sadder than "Yesterday"?
Yes. "Eleanor Rigby" isn't a love song, it's about loneliness. There are more songs on that album you might know, like "Tomorrow Never Knows"
I have not heard that one, I am mostly familiar with their earlier pop songs from A Hard Days Night and Help.
You should really listen to their middle to late career work. It's cool to hear them experiment. White Album is also good, as is Sgt. Pepper.
Thanks. I will definitely check those out. I really like their ballads, too, so hopefully there are some good ones!
