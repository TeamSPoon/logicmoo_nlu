Did you see the Spurs beat the Rockets in game 6 the other night?
Are you kidding me? That was more like a beatdown and an embarassment.
Yeah! And the Spurs were the more injured team. They didn't have Leonard or Parker.
The Rockets should have taken game 6 easily, especially since they were at home.
No doubt. But James Harden pretty much quit on his team in my opinion.
Yeah. And the Rockets played with absolutely no effort. The whole team just quit.
Not the Spurs, though. They got pretty much all the rebounds and did all of the hustling.
Who is that guy who wears number 17 for the Spurs?
That is Jonathon Simmons. He had some monster slam dunks!
That man stepped up at the right time for Kawhi Leonard. The Spurs needed Simmons.
For sure. I hope Leonard will be back in time to play the Warriors. They'll need Leonard badly then.
Oh yeah! Because the Warriors are the best team in basketball right now. They haven't lost a playoff game this year!
Really? Who have they played so far?
First, they played the Trail Blazers, then the Jazz. And the Warriors swept them both!
I can see that, especially when you have Curry, Durant, and Green on the same team.
Don't forget Klay Thompson. He's just as good as the other three you mentioned.
And the Warriors have a great head coach in Steve Kerr. So do the Spurs, of course.
Yeah, and Gregg Popovich was Steve Kerr's coach many years ago when the Spurs won their first championship.
Wow! Has he been coaching that long?
Yes. For more than twenty years now, all with the Spurs.
