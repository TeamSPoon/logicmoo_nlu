So how do you think the Seahawks will do this year?
I don't know - I had so much hope last year but the season really disappointed.
Why do you say last season was a disappointment?
Well, they just lost too many games, haha.
Why do you think they lost so much?
The Seahawks' offense just wasn't getting the job done.
Do you think they have improved their offense for this season?
That remains to be seen - hopefully they've made some improvements.
What kind of improvements would be the most helpful?
Well, some people say that Seahawks' quarterback didn't perform up to his capabilities.
Why would they say that?
Well, the quarterback is the backbone of the offence, and the team was seen as simply not scoring enough.
But lack of scoring isn't all the quarterback's fault, is it?
No, not entirely, but he is the easiest to blame, haha.
Did you go to any Seahawks games last year?
No, I prefer to watch the games on TV.
You watch the games at home?
I will watch them at home, or sometimes at a bar when I feel like getting out.
Do you consider yourself a Seahawks fan?
Only when they are winning, haha.
