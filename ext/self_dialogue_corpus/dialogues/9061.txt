Do you like Rob Zombie?
Defintiely, he's a great heavy metal performer.
WHat are some of your favorite songs?
Well, one would have to be Superbeast.
Yeah, that's a good one. Did you know a version of that song is used in the soundtrack to the arcade game CarnEvil?
No, I did not. Another of my favorite Rob Zombie songs is Dragula.
The original or the Hot Rod Herman remix?
Either one, both are great.
What about LIving Dead Girl?
That one's okay, but I prefer Superbeast or Dragula, if given a choice.
