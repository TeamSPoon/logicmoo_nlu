Did you know the Death Star has its own music?
No? I didn't know John Williams wrote a theme for a space station, given it's inanimate.
No, there's music playing inside the death star during certain scenes.
Really?
Yeah, put on digital headphones and turn the volume up. You can definitely hear it.
Bluegrass, probably.
hahaha, no.
Glad to hear that it gives the employees something to do to keep them sane other than worry about their lives.
It's actually very slow and meditative.
Almost like a drone, changing pitch infrequently?
Yes, like that.
That's not music in the death star.
It's not?
Nope, sorry.
What is it, then?
It's the sound of machines humming at their frequencies.
Wouldn't it be higher-pitched?
No, look at the size of the Death Star. It's huge. The machines are huge.
Well, I feel stupid.
The force is not strong with you.
