What was your favorite horror movie?
Boy, I don't know. Maybe Nightmare on ELm Street.
Really, that is old.
Yes, but it's a classic horror.
That is true. Even the makeup and effects were pretty good.
Good concept. A killer in your sleep.
True. They shouldn't have made so many though.
You're right. They should have stopped at like three.
They got a little boring after so many.
Did you like Freddie Vs. Jason? That was a good movie.
