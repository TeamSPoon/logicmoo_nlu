Are you ready for another Cavs Warriors finals?
I am. It's exciting but it makes the games leading up to the Finals really boring.
I know. There hasn't been a competitive series that has involved those teams.
It's great for the league to have two really good teams, but it makes the playoffs worse until the finals.
And it'll probably be the same next year. I can't see Lebron declining anytime soon.
The guy never gets injured and never loses any of his athleticism.
How old is he?
He's going to be 33 by next year. Most NBA players start slowing down after 30.
The most impressive thing about Lebron is his durability.
The fact that he came into the league at 19 and simply has not stopped producing.
He's a machine. People are saying he could play like this until he's 40.
I think he'll retire the moment he notices himself slowing down.
I agree. He won't be able to mentally handle not being the best in the world.
The guy has believed he's better than his peers since the age of 16. He's not going to accept a smaller role.
So when do you think he'll retire
In five years. Probably 38 or 39.
That's it? We both agree he'll be every bit as good next year.
Yeah but he'll want to retire while he's on top.
Do you think we'll view Lebron as the greatest player ever.
It depends on these next five years. If he wins 2 more championships, I believe we have to.
