It's almost August! You know what that means!
Football!
Yeah man! You going to any of the games?
Yup, I got my cheese head ready for the Packers game. Can't wait till we play the Patriots
That'll be a tough game but do you think we have a chance?
Hope so. Rodgers is always good we just need to play strong.
Yeah, do you ever miss Farve though?
Of course man, he was one of the best.
Can't believe he's still playing though.
Wait didn't you hear he's coming back to Green Bay?
What? No way!
Yeah, I can't believe it either since he's like almost 50
Dang, that's a lot older than the other guys on the team
True, but that skill level though
You're right. I wonder how it's gonna go with Rodgers on the team
Dunno, will be great to find out though
Yup, that's why I can't wait till next month
They probably won't play much in the preseason though
You're right, but still it's so close
We should go to a game!
