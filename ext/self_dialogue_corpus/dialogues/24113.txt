I saw PUlp Fiction.
When?
When I was in college.
It is that old?
Yup.
Was it good?
It was awesome.
I remember people not so into it though.
It was a black comedy.
About black people?
No, just dark comedy.
I had never heard that term before.
I laughed hard at many places.
really.
There was one scence where the female character had ODed on heroin and has droopped to the ground.
That was funny?
No, the funny part was him shooting her up with a drug to counter act the heroin. With a huge needle.
You laughed at this?
I actually laughed out loud!
And the other audience members?
