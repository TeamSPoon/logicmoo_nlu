What do you think of the movie War Room?
War Room? I don't know if I've heard of that movie.
It's an old movie but you told me you were reading about it online one night when you couldn't sleep.
How long ago was that?
About 3 or 4 months ago.
Oh. The one I said I think it was going to be a different kind of movie?
Yes. You were excited about the reviews.
No I haven't seen it yet. But I do want to see it.
I know you will like it. It's talking about prayer.
Yes. A way that I never saw prayer acted out before.
It was very different from other religious movies. It was full of action.
Action? What kind of action?
Action in the sense that the character wasn't just talking but they showed how to pray.
Were they doing a lot of praying?
Not a lot. But they showed how to pray through situations.
So it wasn't just telling but also showing?
Oh Yes!!! One of the main characters was a praying woman.
Hearing you really make me want to see it.
I tell you, you won't reget it and it will help you through some situations you are facing.
I'm going to get it tomorow. I saw it in Walmart. Thanks
