Which Michael Myers Halloween movie is your favorite?
I like Halloween part 1
That is a classic. Do you like part 2 as well?
It's pretty good. I like it, but not as much as part 1.
Do you like part 3?
Michael Myers is not in that one.
Really? That is strange.
I know. But, part 4 and 5 are good.
Is there a sixth one?
Yes and Donald Pleasence is in it.
