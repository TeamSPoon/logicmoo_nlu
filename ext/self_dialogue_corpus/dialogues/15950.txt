Hey do you like the Beatles?
Of course, that's like asking if I like food!
Yeah, good one!
Why do you ask?
I just like to know what people's favorite Beatles album is.
Hmmm. I'd have to think about that.
Mine's Rubber Soul.
Ah good one! Some of there more trippy songs on that album!
Definitely. Do you know what yours is?
Now that I think about it, I'm gonna go with the white album.
A classic. Good choice!
Thanks!
Have you heard of the grey album?
No, I'm pretty sure it's not by the Beatles though!
It's not.
Who's it by?
It's actially a mashup of the Beatles white album and Jay-Z's black album.
That's a crazy combination!
It is, you should check it out though!
I definitely will. I;m always looking for original music.
