Were you ever into the Paranormal Activities movies?
I've watched a lot of them, but I don't know if I was a fan.
Didn't they scare you?
Not really.  I mean, they had a scare factor, but the believability wasn't there.
Oh, they freaked me out!  I couldn't sleep.
I didn't have a problem sleeping.  They were just another movie.
You were never scared that your house might be haunted?
No.  I mean, it was just a movie.
But there are things that you can't see!
The believability just wasn't there for me.
