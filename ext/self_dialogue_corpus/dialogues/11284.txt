What's your favorite Beatles' song?
Tough call. I think it's a toss-up between Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da and Hello, Goodbye.
I think I was expecting something like Yesterday, but Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da?
Yeah, it's a really happy, catchy song.  I especially like the mistake when the names get switched.
Maybe I should listen to it again, I don't think I remember it that well.
You should, it's a good song.  What about you, what's your favorite?
No. It's Baby, You're a Rich Man.
Really?  Not All You Need Is Love?
I really like All You Need Is Love, but Baby, You're a Rich Man is just a weird, fun song.
Yeah, I guess it is.  It suits you.
