Who do you think is the greatest coach in NFL history?
I would say Bill Bellichek. He constantly wins in the free agent era.
Bellichek is great, but what about Noll, Walsh, Lombardi?
Maybe it would be more appropriate to look at each era.
Who's the greatest coach in the 60's?
Of course, Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls and had a dominant Packers team for many years.
How about the 70's?
You'd have to go with Chuck Noll.  Winning four Super Bowls in 10 years is awesome.  He helped put the team together with shrewd drafting.
How about the 80's?
No doubt - Bill Walsh.  The man was a genius.  He built the 49er's from the ground up and he drafted two hall of fame quarterbacks, Montana and Young.  He also drafted the greatest wide receiver in jerry Rice.
How about the 90's?
I'd say Jimmy Johnson even though his Cowboys time was short lived.  He built that team from the ground up and they dominated for so many years because of the way he drafted.
Who's the most underrated coach in history?
That's a tie between Bud Grant and Marv Levy.
I agree, they both made it to 4 Super Bowls but didn't win any.
If they would have won even one Super Bowl, their legacy would be so much different.
Yeah Levy made the Super bowl three years in a row and lost them all.
Bud coached the Vikings during the 70's and 80's, they had one of the greatest defenses in history - the Purple People Eaters!
Come on man! No one even compares with the Steel Curtain / Pittsburgh Steelers defense in the 70's!
What about the 85 Bears defense?
