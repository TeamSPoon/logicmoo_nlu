You know in Bambi when his mum dies, did you cry?
You bet I did, that was arguably the saddest moment in any Disney film ever.
Thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Don't worry I think everyone cries when they watch Bambi.
At least Bambi has happy life in the end?
Really. Do you not remember who the villain was in Bambi.
The villain? I can't really think who it was?
The villain was mankind.
Crikey mate, that was deep.
Yeah I saw it in a Buzzfeed quiz.
