Have you ever been to a hockey game in person?
I have been to a few and they were great. What about you?
I have never been to a game live.
Would you like to?
I love sports, but I'm not that big of a fan of hockey. I'm open to going, I guess.
There is nothing like it. Most sports are better live than on TV and hockey definitely fits that description.
What is it about it that makes it so good?
How fast-paced it is and the crowds are alwasy amazing.
Where do you recommend I sit at a game?
Anywhere is good, but if you pay the big bucks, try to be in one of the first few rows.
Why the first few rows?
You would be right by the "boards" and see some really cool, up-close action.
Is it as violent as I think it is?
It can be at times, but I like the speed of the game live.
Would it be a good idea to bring my young son (8 years old) to a game?
Yes, the games are family-friendly for the most part.
I would hate to bring my son if there is a lot of yelling and bad language.
You run that risk at any game you go to, depending on where you sit.
Thanks for the advice. I will probably take my son to a game next season as a surprise.
You won't be disappointed. Let me know if you need anything.
