The only time I can handle Mariah Carey is during Christmas with that song playing on the radio.
Not a fan? Didn't see Glitter?
I'm not and I did not, no, haha.
You gotta admit though she's got a fantastic voice. Like, her range and pitch is crazy.
I'll give you that. But I just don't like the music she does. It just doesn't resonate with me.
Do you like Christina Aguilera? She's similar in talent, I think.
Yeah! I can actually dig her music. It's more fun and dancey than Mariah's kind of... maudlin sentimentality...
I see that, sure. I remember her music video to 'Fighter'-
Oh man, that was bad ass! With the spider thing? She was a spider or something?
Yeah I remember that came out around the same time as Britney's 'Stronger.' I get them confused...
Holy crap and Destiny's Child came out with 'Survivor,' too.
I'm sensing a pattern...
It's not ripping anyone off if they all become successful, right?
Well they all had different melodies. Just same theme or message or whatever.
Yeah no it wasn't plagiarism or anything. Wasn't Survivor the first time Beyonce tried to rap?
I think so. Jay-Z influenced her?
Maybe, haha. Eh, she didn't do too bad.
Nah, that was a decent song.
I saw this thing years ago with Rihanna saying she was influenced by Destiny's Child as a little girl.
Ahhh I feel old, now.
