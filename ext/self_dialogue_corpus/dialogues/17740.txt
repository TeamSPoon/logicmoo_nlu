There should be a place where we can learn new music and listen before we buy.
Why would we need to be in a place? We can do that from our phones.
How is that the same thing? I mean people being together learning about new sounds.
You mean you wish record shops were still a place to go? You want to flip through albums?
Maybe I'm too old to know where this goes on. There might be kids doing it.
Yes, they share music with each other. They listen to the same radio stations.
I meant a common ground to be fed music and enjoy it like a good steak.
You want to go to a jukebox diner? I'll give you all of my quarters.
I don't know what I mean exactly, but I guess MTV showed us new music all at the same time.
Yes, but those artists went through a lot to finally be shown on MTV. But I guess I understand more.
I wonder if anyone else feels that's missing? How can I share music, if I'm not an artist?
You can have a YouTube channel and showcase songs you'd like to share with others.
That is an excellent idea. But how will I find new music? Who will share with me?
I guess you could ask viewers for music suggestions. That would be a start.
Would you be the first person to suggest some good music?
Sure. Let's see. I'd suggest Solange's last album.
Awesome. Do you have a song you'd suggest first? I've always liked her.
I'd say "Cranes In The Sky" is my favorite. She's a talented songwriter.
Well that's for the first insert. I will definitely listen. She's deep.
She is. She's a Cancer, you know. She did it her way. Proud of her work.
