Can you believe they made a Bay Watch movie?
I'm still in shock.
That has got to be so bad.
But it has  Dwayne Johnson in it!
You just made my point.
You don't like the Rock?
Never have.
He's the highest paid actor in Hollywood.
Hell has frozen over!
He's not that bad.
To each his own.
How about Zac Effron.
He's ok, I guess.
Not my favorite, but not bad.
So, I take it you won't be rushing to the theater.
I'll probable give it a shot when it comes out on DVD.
Me too.
Don't wanna get robbed at the box office.
I hear you there!
We should go watch something, though.
