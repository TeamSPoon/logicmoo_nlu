Do you like ensemble cast films?
Can you give me an example?
Well the one I have in mind is not that good
This should be interesting
The movie is He's just not that into you.
OK I am embrassed to say that I Have seen that film.
How did you feel about it?
To be honest, it was not that bad.
So do you like the ensemble films.
Yes I think it is good.
I think it makes the actors better.
And the actresses too.
Sorry I meant that under the umbrella of Hollywood.
Well back to the topic, yes they are cool to see.
I mean we see them in animated films pretty much.
Yeah its hard to think thats how it is.
I think the people acting in the film want to look better so its better acting.
Sometimes its a bit too much though.
They all want to compete to be the lead star.
And competition usually brings good things to the viewer
