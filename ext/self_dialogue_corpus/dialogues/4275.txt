Do you like to watch Alfred Hitchcock movies?
I have only seen a few of them.
I have seen a great many that he directed.  He is the master of suspenseful theater.
What is your favorite Alfred Hitchcock thriller?
I don't have a favorite, but I really like "North by Northwest."
Is that the one starring Cary Grant?
Yes.  It stars Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.  Cary Grant is a victim of mistaken identity, and Eva Marie Saint is mixed up with some bad guys.
I think I have seen that.  Don't they end up at Mt. Rushmore?
Yes, the scenery is spectacular.  I read that the producers were denied access to Mt. Rushmore because of the negative connotations of the movie chase, so they had to film it on a movie lot.
It looked pretty realistic.  They did a good job for the time period.
