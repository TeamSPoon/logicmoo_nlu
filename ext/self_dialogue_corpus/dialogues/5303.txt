Did you prefer the first monsters inc or the second one?
Do you mean Monsters University?
Yes, that's the one.
Well, I actually liked the second one better.
Not a lot of people think that because Boo isn't in it.
Oh I know, I remember when Monsters University came out and everyone was confused because she wasn't in it.
Yeah, I can say the same. It made more sense when we found out it was a prequel.
Good point. I was glad that some of the originals characters were in it though.
I agree.  It would be Monsters Inc. without John Goodman.
Or Billy Crystal.
