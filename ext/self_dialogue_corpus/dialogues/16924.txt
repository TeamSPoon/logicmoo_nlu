Hey if you started a band what kind of music would you sing?
Thats really difficult. I'd think I would do rock.
Really? You don't seem like the rock type.
Well, I don't think I am either but since I like rock music I'd try to sing that.
That is still an interesting choice. Do you think you would do will?
Honestly? Not at all, but to be honest I don't think I'd do well singing any genre of music.
Why do you say that?
Well I just don't have a sining voice.
That's not true, everyone has a singing voice.
I personally think it's something you are born with honestly.
Nah, Every singer ever has had thousands of hours practicing and perfecting their singing voice.
Ok Mr.Singer what about you? What genre of music would you sing?
I'd probably go for R&B.
What? That doesn't seem like something you'd try to sing. What made you pick that?
I say R&B because it's pretty popular and I think it woulf be fun to sing.
Do you think you would be good at it?
Probably not at fisrt but with enough time I think I'd get it down.
I'd be the first in line to hear what you sound like.
Oh you'd be a fan?
No, I'd just want to hear what you sounded like.
