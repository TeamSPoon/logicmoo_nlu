Hey! The NFL season starts in September!
I can't wait! Who are you following this year?
I'm  a lifelong Browns fan.
Aww man they never perform well! Why are you a fan of them?
I like to stay loyal to the home team.
Do they have any good players this year?
Yeah. They have a couple. What about Joe Thomas?
He goes to the Pro Bowl every year. He's gotta be good to make it there.
Who else do they have?
Well there's also Joe Haden.
How far do you expect them to go this year?
I'll admit they would be lucky to win five games.
Who do you think they may win against?
It depends which team shows up to play. Possibly the Bengals.
Oh yeah, the Bengals. Ohio really doesn't have much for a football team. Do they?
No we're not known for good NFL football. Who do you follow?
I tend to follow a couple teams. One is the Patriots.
Why because they won the Super Bowl?
Well, I do like my teams to win. They had to work to get there.
I like my teams to win also, but I don't like to jump ship just because they're struggling.
