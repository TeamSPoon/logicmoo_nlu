Do you like French movies?
Oh Indeed I do, I have watched a few.
Which one is your favorite?
I would have to say Amelie.
What is it about?
This girl grows up very neglected and starts to find the meaning of love and helping others as an adult.
Oh wow! Sounds like a very touching story. What other movies do you recommend?
If you want to have a good laugh watch the movie Ruby & Quentin.
Oh really? What is it about?
Oh, this odd couple of inmates escape together but one of them is not very bright and makes you laugh a lot.
Who starts in the movie?
The amazing Jean Reno and Gérard Depardieu.
Ohh I have to see it then. Where does the movie take Place?
I´m not sure if it´s in Paris, I don´t remember, but it´s definitely in France so you will enjoy this as well.
Sounds perfect. Since you know a lot about this types of movies, which other one have you seen?
This one is a little strange but is called Grégoire Moulin contre l'humanité
Oh wow!, It does, what is it about?
This poor guy just had a bad day, but it was like the Murphy Law when everything but everything went wrong.
Oh I can´t imagine, poor guy, did he have a happy ending?
You could say that, you need to watch it though so you can understand.
