Hi there, I am gettin really excited at for the upcoming season!
Me too! Go RAMS.
Oh, man. I like the Rams but I am a Packer fan!
Okay, nice. Rogers is one of the best Quarterbacks of all time so I watch the Packers too.
Yeah, I was not always a Packer fan but I have been since 1991.
Who did you like before that?
I was an Oakland fan. But it was because I was raised that way.
Okay, got it! My dad raised me a Steelers fan and I switched when I was in highschool too.
yep, exactly!
I just love football season in general, man.
Agreed! I want to see the Patriots line up this year and see if we can see any change up in the solid program they have.
Yeah, I have not heard about much. I also wanna see where Tony Romo goes this year.
Oh, I heard he might be going to the Broncos actually.
What! Oh wow that would be crazy.
I used to love the Broncos when they had Manning.
oh, yeah the good old days!
I know it, the rules have changed so much and the regulations are such that it feels like a different game sometimes.
Right, the game we grew up on has evolved so much.
The best part is that the players are safer now days.
I agree with that! I like knowing less concussion on the field!!
