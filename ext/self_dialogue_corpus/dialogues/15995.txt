Do you like Dawes?
I've never heard of them.
They're a rock group out of California, really good stuff.
Oh yeah, do they have any songs I might heard of?
Maybe, they had a song of a commercial a few years ago.
What for?
Can't remember the commercial, but the song was When My Time Comes
That sounds a little familiar, the song that is.
It's a really good tune.
I'll check them out then.
You should, you'd like them.
You usually like good stuff.
Yes I do. Their song Things Happen is also excellent.
I'll add it to the list.
I saw them in concert last year, great show.
You sound like a big fan then.
Well, they're good, can't deny it.
That's high praise.
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
Thanks buddy.
