Did you cry when Mufasa died in The Lion King?
Of course I did, I think everyone did! That was the most tragic scene in movie history next to Bambi.
You know I've never actually seen Bambi.
You've never seen Bambi?! I thought every child was required to be traumatized by that movie.
No for some reason that one got by me. I really want to see The Lion King the musical.
Oh I know, it's been running for a while with a lot of success.
I loved that James Earl Jones played an African king the same way he did in Coming to America.
Oh I know, that was really fitting. He has the voice for it.
That's for sure. I think there's a Frozen musical isn't there?
Yes I've seen it and it's amazing. Just be prepared to have the songs in your head again for a while.
