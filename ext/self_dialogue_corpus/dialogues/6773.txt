Did you hear Disney is making a live action film about Cruella De Vil?
Cruella De Vil? She's the one from 101 Dalmations, right?
Yeah. She's the one who wanted to make a fur coat out the puppies!
Yikes, now I remember! I hated her!
Me too! I still think a movie about her backstory will be interesting though.
Have they already finished casting?
I think so. I read that Emma Stone will be playing Cruella in the film.
Emma Stone? That's a surprising choice.
I think so too, but she's a great actress.
You're right, I bet she'll do great.
