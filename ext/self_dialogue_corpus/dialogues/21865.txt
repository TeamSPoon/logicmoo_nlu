Are you at all into war movies?
Yeah I am, why?
Well I was going to recommend a great movie I just saw.
What is the name of it?
It's called, A Bridge Too Far.
I've never heard of it.
Well, that's probably because it is a really old movie.
Is it any good?
Yes, its awesome. If you like war movies, you will love it.
What is it about?
Its about a bunch of allied forces in Germany that try to take control of a bridge and hold it against German attackers.
That actually sounds pretty intense.
Oh, it is. There are some really great war scenes in it.
It sounds like it. I might have to check that one out.
You won't regret it.
Is it anything like saving private Ryan?
Well, somewhat. The fight scenes aren't as deadly, but in some ways more realistic.
Interesting, sounds more technical.
It definitely is, its a strategic type of movie.
I love strategy, so I will probably love it.
