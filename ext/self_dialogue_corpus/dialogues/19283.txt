Are you still in a band?
Yes, a Led Zeppelin tribute band
That's cool. I liked them.
It's great music. I love paying it every night. It took me 5 years to master Stairway to Heaven
Do you think we have anyone as talented coming up now
No, I think we haven't seen a good stadium rock band this decade
Some say Kings of Leon are good
They're okay but they just never fully broke through
Sex is On Fire did well
I thought that would push them to another level
I think people are buying more soft rock
Lots of bands have had one hit wonders
No consistency. The greats aren't producing anymore either
Nope. I'd kill for another great U2 album, a great Springsteen album
They do covers now
Bruce does but he's an awesome live entertainer
Now he can still fill a stadium
Yep that's what we need but I don't see replacements coming up
There's a lot of pop at festivals now
It's mostly pop and indie
