What do you think is the scariest movie you've ever seen?
I'd have to say "It." that movie really messed me up.
That was scary. What part do you think was the scariest?
Probably when he came up out of the drain in the shower.
Oh yeah, that was really creepy.
I was scared to shower for years after I saw that.
I think the scariest parts were the flashes where they'd see him watching them, but then he'd be gone so fast.
Tell me about it.I thought I saw clowns everywhere for a month after I first saw it.
Did you know they're remaking it?
I heard that, I kind of want to see it, but I'm still pretty scared of it. I don't know what I'll do.
