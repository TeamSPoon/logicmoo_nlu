Have you ever seen the Star Wars Series?
Ya I love them.
I do too now. I just binge watched the entire series and am blown away.
You had never seen them before?
No. I just seen the new one The Force Awakens.
What did you think of it?
I enjoyed it. It was weird to have so many new characters, but I also like that they brought back the old ones too, although there were a few disappointing moments.
Ya I don't want to give anything away to anyone listening.
Ya me either. I really like John Boyega in it.
Oh ya, me too. He is one of my favorites.
