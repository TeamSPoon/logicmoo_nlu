Hey, what did you think about Antman?
I thought it was really good.
I thought it was just ok, turning tiny is a really weird power to have.
Yea, but he's still super strong, and he's basically invisible.
Yea that's true, but it's just not very super in my opinion.
Well I'd love to have that superpower.
Paul Rudd was really good in it though.
Yea, Paul Rudd is really funny.
I can't wait to see him in the Infinity Wars Saga.
Yea, Infinity Wars is going to be epic.
