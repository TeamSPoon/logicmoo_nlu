What did you think about The Force Awakens?
I liked it a lot. I really got me excited about the Star Wars universe again after being very disappointed in the prequels.
Did you see it in the theaters when it came out?
Yes, it came out around Christmas time so I took a younger relative to see it as part of a Christmas gift. We had a lot of fun.
Did you think the story was too similar to A New Hope? That's a major complaint.
That didn't bother me too much honestly. Stars Wars is already a pretty simple and basic story and that's the charm of it.
So who's the better villain, Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?
Well we've only seen Kylo Ren in one movie so far so it's not something I can compare yet. They're both good in their own ways though and one isn't better than the other.
It was great to see Han Solo again after all these years.
It was awesome seeing Harrison Ford really get back into that role. He really nailed all the Han Solo mannerisms and really seemed to enjoy playing him again.
