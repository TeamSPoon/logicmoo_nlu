Hi, what are you up to?
Oh, just listening to some really weird music.
Like what?
Mr. Bungle, it's got to be the strangest thing I've ever heard.
Is it any good?
Some of the stuff is awful, but some of it is genius.
That's interesting, what do they sound like?
Some songs are very different from others.
Like how?
Some songs are funky circus music, and have heavy metal portions.
Wow that's hard to keep track of.
Definitely, they're very hard to keep track of and very different from anyone else.
What does some of their other stuff sound like?
There's actually a whole album dedicated to like 60's pop, but with their spin on it.
That's very different from circus funk.
Yes, very. The singer does all kinds of really strange stuff, like screaming and sound effects.
Very odd. Are they any good at least?
A ton of people hate it I'm sure, and it's actually pretty scary to listen to the first time.
Oh, that's weird. I'm not sure I'd like them.
I'll find some of their gentler songs to recommend at least, maybe you'll like those.
