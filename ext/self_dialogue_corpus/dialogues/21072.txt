What is the best Vince Vaughn movie?
Wedding Crashers
I think Couples Retreat was better.
No way.
It was funnier for the most part
Thats not true at all.
Alot of people would agree with me.
No, he played a role in Wedding Crashers that only he could have played.
Yeah but it was cheeky.
No it was honest and he really played the part well.
I mean it was funny but not on the level of Couples.
I think Couples was more of an ensemble cast to start.
It was but he was the driver of it.
I would say Jason Bateman was.
He was good in that movie too.
Yeah he plays the same role in all of his movies.
Definitely typecasted
He carried that over into TV as well.
You could say that but I do not believe that.
He was a child actor who made it so lets give him credit.
