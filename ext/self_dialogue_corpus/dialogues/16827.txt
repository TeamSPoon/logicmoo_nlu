It's a shame that musicians need to also be business people more than ever these days.
What do you mean?
Well, so much creative energy is lost when a musician needs to focus so much on promotion.
Don't they have other people to do that?
The few at the top do. The rest of us need to spend a lot of time promoting ourselves.
That isn't much different from the past.
Well, it is different because the technology and knowledge needed to do so now is very complicated.
What is so complicated?
One must become familiar with how to use many social media platforms, build web sites, and then make sure they are found.
Lots of people do that.
Perhaps, but it has gotten over my head. Have you ever watched a video about maximizing SEOs?
No. What's SEO?
SEO refers to Search Engine Optimization.
Is that so difficult?
You wouldn't think so, but once you delve into it a bit the complexity becomes overwhelming.
How so?
There are tricky strategies, discovering that you need to spend lots of money paying for placement and ads, and it still remains a large risk.
Well, that's what people need to do for anything these days.
For a musician or artist, this is very draining in terms of creative energy and time, making it hard to focus on one's music.
I guess that's just how it is if you want to try to make a living as a musician these days.
