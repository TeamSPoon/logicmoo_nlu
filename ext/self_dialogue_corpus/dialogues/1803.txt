Who do you think will win the 2018 Super Bowl?
The Patriots are the favorite right now before the season.
Do you think they will be able to repeat?
It's hard to say.  The NFL anything can happen.
I think the Falcons will win it this year.
It's hard to make win after taking such a brutal lose last year in the Super Bowl.
I think that lose will motivate them this year.
Maybe, but rarely does the losing Super Bowl team make it back.
The Buffalo Bills did.
Yeah, but the Bills also lost 4 straight Super Bowls.
What about the Carolina Panthers?
What about them?
Do you think this is the year they win the Super Bowl?
Highly doubt it.  They have a good team but I don't know about Cam Newton.
What don't you like about Cam Newton?
I don't know if is good enough a leader yet to get them back to the Super Bowl.
He got them their 2 years ago.
Yeah, but they also weren't very good last year.
So your going with the Patriots to win it this year?
If I was betting money, the Patriots are who I would bet on.
