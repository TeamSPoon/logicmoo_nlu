What do you think about the music artist Drake?
Eew. I think he is horrible!
Why? I figured you would like him because he is super popular.
I do usually like popular music but the artist has to have some talent.
So what exactly don't you like.
All of his songs sound the same and the lyrics are horrible. Shall I give more reasons?
Go ahead. I'm curious.
He is completely tone deaf. Have you actually heard him before?
Yes, but I didn't pay much attention. Is he from America?
I'm not sure but I think so.
He could be Jamaican, it seems like a lot of rappers are.
That's possible, but I don't so.  I think he is from California.
Really?
Yes, I so a picture of him at NBA games with the Kardashians.
That doesn't mean he is from California.
I get it, I am stereotyping, its just because I hate his music.
Well, the good thing is, that rappers come and go quickly.
I sure hope so because I'm about to give up listening to the radio.
Ha! Stay positive, you love music way to much to sop listening to the radio.
This is true. I'm sure the next new artist I will love.
