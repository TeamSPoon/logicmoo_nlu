Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
Yes, I think she is fantastic.
Me, too. What is your favorite of her songs?
I think my favorite Lady Gaga song is "Love Game", because it is so fun. How about you?
I like "Alejandro", because of the music video. Are there any Lady Gaga songs you don't like?
I'm not very fond of "The Edge of Glory". It sounds kind of generic to me.
Really? I liked "The Edge of Glory" a lot--I found it inspirational.
Personally, I found "Born This Way" more inspirational than "The Edge of Glory".
I can see that. "Born This Way" is great for encouraging people to be themselves.
I agree. That's why I like it a lot.
