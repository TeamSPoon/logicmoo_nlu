what is your favorite music style?
I think pop.
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I really adore miley cyrus.
Do you like her new malibu song?
I do , i think it is a new direction for her.
I agree a bit more relaxed miley.
Ya it is not so much focused on partying. I think she is growing up.
Probably her fans are as well.
I know I am, I still love her older stuff .
I loved her wrecking ball song.
Such a controversy on the video.
I did not think it was that big a deal, I also liked the video.
I thought it though simple in aesthetics was very well shoot. Very beautiful lighting.
Ya, she looked gorgeous in that video.
Did you know her real name is karma?
It is? I had no clue.
I think a lot of musicians go by an alias.
Karma sounds more like an alias thana real name.
It is unique. Weird to think  her stage name is more normal.
