Hey, have you seen Pulp Fiction?
That's a classic, of course.
It's pretty violent.
I know but I like gory movies.
It has some type of coolness to it.
I liked the scene where they went to the diner.
John Travolta had some good dance moves there.
He was in Grease.
He's a very macho actor.
He kind of acted like a lackey in Pulp Fiction.
He was more of a jock in Grease.
He's a very versatile actor.
Samuel L Jackson is as well.
People still recite that bible verse he said to the kid in the beginning.
Which verse did he say?
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance...
Oh, that was a pretty cool line.
It was a cool opening scene.
Honestly, there weren't too many scenes in the movie.
It was very detailed though.
