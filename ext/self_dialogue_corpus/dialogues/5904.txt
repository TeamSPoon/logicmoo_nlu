Have you seen the Queen of Katwe yet from Disney?
No but I heard it was really good.
Yeah it was a different kind of movie for them.
I think it was based on a true story too.
I think it was. I still haven't seen Finding Dory yet.
Oh me neither but I heard it will make you cry.
I heard the same thing. Finding Nemo definitely did.
That's a classic. My kids wanted a clown fish after seeing it.
Oh that's cute. Ellen Degeneres did a good job of playing Dory.
Yes she's hilarious, I love her in anything she does.
