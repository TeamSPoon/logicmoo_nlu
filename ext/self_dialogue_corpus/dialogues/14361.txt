One of the teams you have to look out for next year is the Timberwolves.
They are such a young and exciting team.
They really are and I absolutely love Karl Anthony Townes.
This guy is a beast and a future All-star
He is putting up crazy numbers and on top of that they have Wiggins, Lavine and Rubio.
A very nice offensive lineup to say the least
Where they need to grow is in their defensive intensity.
Yeah if they want to make the playoffs next year they have to play better on that end
You would think with Coach Thibodeau they would be better already.
I know right. That is his calling card, but it hasn't happened yet
Well that's the next step in their maturity process
They have to start slowing other teams down.
I think they also need a couple of guys who can shoot the three
Yeah that would really open this offense even moe
They are already hard to defend this makes them more dangerous
Yeah this would make them unguardable.
I'm so looking forward to what they bring to the table next year
I would like to see them play even faster
For sure. If they can keep this core together. We could be seeing a championship in five years
I agree. Almost all of the pieces are there.
