Do you know of any new movie releases coming up?
I have heard of a few but they are probably the same ones you know.
A recent one I know is Guardian of the Galaxy.
Yeah I have heard of that one, it was released in May.
Yeah it was May 5, 2017.
Yeah I knew it was somewhere around there.
There is also a Toy Sory 4!
No way! I love those movies.
Me too and it just released June 6.
We have got to see it!
