I just watched Star Wars Episode I for the first time.
For the first time?  Did you like it?
The special effects are a bit outdated, but overall it was a good story.
I liked the story as well, especially learning about the Force.
I found the Chewbacca character to be most interesting.  It's not often you see talking animals outside of cartoons.
To be fair, he's an alien more than he's an animal.
I guess you're right.  I just think it's interesting that he speaks his own unique language that only one person can understand.
That is kind of funny.  It's the same way with the droids.
What do you mean?
Some characters seem to be able to understand the beeping sounds they make as communication.
