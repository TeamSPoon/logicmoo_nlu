Did you like Superman Returns?
It was a good movie
Lex Luther was kind of like the Joker in it
Luthe's plan might have worked if it wasn't for superman
The kryptonite in the fake island must have been less strong
Yeah, superman was still able to lift it into space. In the other movie, a kryptonite necklace almost drowned him
Superman always wins
He gets beat up but always wins
He really cares about other people
He deon't have a weakness besides kryptonite
