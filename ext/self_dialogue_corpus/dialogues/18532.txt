You know who's an epic country singer?
Who?
Kenny Chesney.
Oh yeah I love him.  He's a different kind of country.
Yeah, so many good songs though.
Like You Had Me From Hello.
Or Old Blue Chair.
That's one of my favorites.  That and Keg in the Closet.
Another great one.  I liked I go back.
Yeah that's deep with good lyrics.
What about Summertime?
I love that.  Especially on a warm day.
Great song to play right on the way to a summer vacation.
Yeah I agree, like it's time to be warm and enjoy life for a while.
Another great song was the Good Stuff.
Talk about great lyrics.  That's one of the top ones for me.
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
You know what I didn't like?  She thinks my tractors sexy.
Me either.  It's just some goofy country song not like his other stuff.
Yeah, I know.  He is good in concert though.
