Are you watching the Stanley Cup playoffs?
Ive tuned in every once in awhile
Man you are missing some good stuff if you arent focused.
Nah, I catch the highlights
Well the world has turned on Ovi
Why?
A capitals beat writer went off about how hes a cancer
Well the team should address that
Thats the thing, he said theyre all complicit in it
I dont think thats true.
Yeah well you never know, hes a great player
A selfish one if you ask me
He plays his heart out.
Yeah on his shifts, and he eats alot of ice time
Not following your logic
Maybe if he gave some others a chance hed be more well rested
He left it on the ice in game 7
Well hes got a great goalie i dont understand
Hes the Iverson of the NHL
Thats a great comparison
