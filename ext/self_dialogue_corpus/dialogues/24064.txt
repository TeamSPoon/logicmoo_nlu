Are you pumped about the Black Panther movie?
Wow, yes!
Did you see the new trailer?
I have not got to yet.
It makes it look as if it will be a really good film.
I like the version of Africa they show.
The Technologically advanced world he comes from you mean?
Yep, and he is a prince too!
I think it will really open the whole Marvel world up a lot.
I wish they would make a Luke Cage movie.
Maybe one day they will take all the Marvel heroes from the series and make a movie for them.
There has been a movie made for a few of then.
I remember the one about the Punisher.
I know it bombed, but I never saw it.
It had aspects of magic, I do not think it would fit well in the new Marvel Universe.
Still, I think Black Panther will be a really action packed movie.
I like the actor they have for the lead role.
Chadwick Boseman? He seems like he is fit for the role.
It also has Lupita Nyong'o.
I think she is really a beautiful and talented actress.
