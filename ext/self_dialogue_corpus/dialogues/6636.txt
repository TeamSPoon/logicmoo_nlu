I was looking at a list the other day and you would be absolutely shocked at the number of Disney films that were live action from the 1950s until now.
Really? That's not what I think of when I think of Disney.
I know! You usually think of the animated classics that they've made and rightfully so! I think almost everyone I know has seen Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Yeah and those movies were made way before anyone our age was born.
But because they're classics we've seen them. I bet there are lots of Disney films you didn't remember were DIsney, like The Parent Trap!
The one with Lindsay Lohan?
No! The one with Hayley Mills. Come on you remember, its the exact same story. The LIndsay Lohan one is remake.
That's the girl that plays Polyanna! I loved that movie. It's the one about an orphan in a small town and she's really cheerful and everyone grows to love her.
Yeah I remember. Anyways, there are about 50 more live action movies that Disney has made.
Well maybe we should go rewatch some of those ones.
