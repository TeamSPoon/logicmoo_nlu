Hey!  How have you been?
Great!  It's been a while.
Yes, it has.  What have you been up to?
Actually, I have been watching movies lately.
Really?  What kinds of movies have you been watching?
Recently, I have been watching thrillers.
Sounds interesting.  Any reason?
They seem to always keep me on the edge of my seat.
Me too!  I am always trying to guess what will happen next.
What is your favorite way to watch thrillers?
