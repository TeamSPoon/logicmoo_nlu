Hey?
What are you doing right now?
Just betting online for the football games.
What website are you using?
BetOnline.com
Oh, wow.
It's pretty dope, huh?
Yeah, but it feels to me a little suspicious....
Really?
Yeah......
How so?
I don't know. It feels like gambling in football is a little too awkward
Dude, if they can gamble in poker, tennis, and horses, I'm pretty sure football's part of the list, too.
Okay, makes sense.
But don't you think they rig some games?
WHAT??!?! How can these games be rigged?
You never know, man.
What do you mean?
Behind the scenes, some billionaire eccentric may decide this team should win or lose, depending on how much money he gives.
Hmmmm, tell me more.
