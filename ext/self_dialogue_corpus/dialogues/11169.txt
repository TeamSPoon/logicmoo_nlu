What did you think of the red carpet fashion at the Met Gala this year?
There were so many beautiful gowns. It's hard to choose which one I liked the best.
I thought Kate Hudson looked gorgeous as always in her long white Stella McCartney gown.
I agree, I loved that it was simple and clean.
I liked that it was sleeveless on one side.
Giselle Bundchen stunned in Stella McCartney as well!
Definitely, her pewter embroidered Stella McCartney gown was to die for.
My favorite part of that gown was the very low cut of the back.
That was my favorite part too.
The glass bead embroidery on that dress was amazing. It must have taken forever to create.
I thought the grey Tom Ford tuxedo that Tom Brady wore to match was beautiful as well.
The color and cut of that tuxedo jacket were impeccable. It was a perfect match.
They did a good job keeping her makeup subtle so that it didn't overpower her gown.
The whole outfit was a home run.
It was, and the high pony was a great choice.
I loved that she paired the high pony with diamond drop earrings.
I wish I could find out who makes the marble print box clutch that Giselle was carrying.
I'm not sure who made it either.
There were a lot of people on the red carpet who pushed boundaries and went with some very risky fashion choices.
I know, oftentimes red carpet fashion is better when it's simple elegance rather than when it looks like someone is trying to hard to push the envelope.
