Do you enjoy listening to Eminem these days?
I do actually.
Why though?
Well as he's matured so have I.
His music used to be a bit childish didn't it?
Yes but that's what my teenage self needed something to connect with.
He did do that quite well.
It feels like as he's matured so have I and it feels great to have a rapper I can connect with my whole life.
At least up to this point.
Yeah good point.
I'm just happy he's still making music after all these years, so many stop or take long breaks but he really hasn't.
He's had a break or two here and there but it wasn't for long stretches and he always comes back.
Can you imagine 80 year old Eminem still rapping?
That would be awesome.
He would be rapping about his cane and them kids on his lawn.
I can picture it now.
I'm so glad he exists though, rap would be dull without him.
He carried the music genre through the years, just not sure who is going to take the torch.
I don't know if anyone can step up at this point.
I don't think so either sadly.
