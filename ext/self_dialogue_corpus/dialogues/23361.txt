Let's talk about movies
Sounds good to me
Have you seen fifty shade of grey?
Just the beginning
It didn't live up to the hype
I'm suprised they aired it on regular tv
They did?
Yup, that's where I saw the beginning. It was around 7 too
I would be really mad if I walked in and my kids were watching that on tv
Same here, I still can't believe it's on tv
That's not right, they shouldn't have done that.
Even if they don't show anything, the way they talk
Yup exactly.
It's just crazy.
I dont love movies like that anyway, just wanted to watch it because of the book
They are never as good as the books
Nope and this wasn't an exception
I believe it
They need to find a better way to do book movies
I dont think it's possible
