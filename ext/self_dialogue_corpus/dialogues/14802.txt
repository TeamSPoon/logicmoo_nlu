Did you see Bad Moms?
Oh my gosh, yes it was hilarious!
I know!  I couldn't stop laughing.
Mila was the best!
Really? I loved Kristin Bell.
I just think the whole concept was perfect.
I know, it's so hard being a mom.
Yes, they really touched on that.
It was the greatest moms night out movie
I went with my friends too!
