What is your favorite Beatles song?
I've always liked "Imagine."
Well, that's just John Lennon, but I guess it counts.
Oh, you want my favorite with all of them?  It's probably "Something", which is a great love song.
Did you know that Frank Sinatra said it's the most beautiful love song ever written?
No, i didn't know that.
Yeah, I read it somewhere?
Who's Frank Sinatra?
You're kidding, right?
Yeah, I'm kidding.  What's your favorite Beatles song?
I love the whole Abbey Road album.
Come on, choose a song.
To tell you the truth, I've always just loved Penny Lane.  It's such a perfectly written little slice of life.
It's a definite picture story, that's true.  What others do you like?
I like their more simple tunes, like "I Will" or "Blackbird".
They're both on The White Album, right?
Yes, they are.  But I also really like "Lady Madonna" and "Hey Jude", so there you go.
It's hard to pick a favorite, really.
Yes, it is.
I guess it just depends on the mood you're in.
