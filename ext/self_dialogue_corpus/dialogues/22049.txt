What did you think about Joss Whedon ending Firefly with Serenity?
I thought it was the best he could with the cirucmstances, good film but I wish we could have gotten more.
Yeah bittersweet for sure, but overall I thought it was a fitting ending.
It's just a shame it had to close off some character arcs, making any kind of reunion a bit of a stretch.
Yeah character deaths added some real finality to the series as a whole.
Though I guess it could always come back with that universe.
Can't imagine it capturing the same vibe without that original Serenity crew though.
Yeah it would be kind of a husk of its former self.
Though on the bright side I guess if anyone can do it it's Joss Whedon.
True, I'd have complete faith in him if he ever chose to dive back in.
It's crazy that in a world with reboots, remakes, and revivals we haven't gotten anything else.
Yeah even a second movie, though I'm not sure how well Serenity did.
I can't imagine it did very well at the Box Office, seems like it was made for fans and for fans only.
Yeah it relied heavily on knowledge of the show, was not good standalone.
Yeah doomed to kind of fail in the money department, but succeeded in a lot of ways.
Seeing the Serenity ship with a higher hollywood budget was moving.
Definitely was, if anything it's almost delightful that the show was cancelled just for that alone.
The tone of the movie was kind of jarring.
Yeah you can tell it didn't have some of the same vibes as the show, but that's due to the length.
Yeah movies need to fit a lot of story into two hours.
