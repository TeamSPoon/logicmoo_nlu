I just recently watched Lucy with Scarlett Johannssen. Have you seen that?
Yes it's one of my favorite movies now. Brilliantly done.
Do you agree that the smarter you get the less compassion you'll have?
Well that's what they demonstrated in the movie but I do believe it would be true to some degree.
She's such a great actress. I love her as Natasha Romanov or Black Widow.
That's definitely where she's making her mark, in the Avengers Franchise.
I love Marvel as a whole. Black Panther is coming out next year.
I hope Storm will make an appearance, since that's his wife.
I think I heard she was going to but I think the part will be played by someone other than Halle Berry.
Right I think she'd be a little too old to be T'Challa's wife.
She does look young though, I don't know. She could play it I think.
She hasn't really been in anything noteworthy as of late.
I loved her in Monster's Ball. She won the oscar for that one.
Right she was the first African American woman to win for best actress.
And you could see how happy and proud she was during her speech.
I was about to cry right along with her. Do you remember when she was in Boomerang?
With Eddie Murphy and Tommy Davidson? Of course, I saw it again not too long ago.
That was a hilarious movie. She's come a long way since then.
I love going back to look at 90s films every now and then just to relive my teenage years.
Mid 90s was the best time for movies that were relevant to mainstream culture and ideas in my opinion.
