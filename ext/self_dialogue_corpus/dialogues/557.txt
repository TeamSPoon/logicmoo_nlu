So then the wonderlic test is kinda useless
Uh... why?
Because people who score very high like Fitzpartick isn't all that good. And Gore who scored the second lowest is very good
Or, you're not using the test results correctly.
How so?
Well, the NFl separates the positions and averages the scores out by the positions
Oh. Then what happens?
Well you get an average score for the each positions.
Are the QBs highest?
Well, Offensive tackles score the highest.
That's so weird.
How so?
Tackles don't really need high IQs
Oh contraire.They DO need more intelligence than other positions. They have to make tackle, blocking decision.
There you go again with decision.
Well, the decisions are pretty difficult to make under stress and ina blink of a second, if you miss the block, the ball carrier goes down
And the play is over...
Exactly. What's really surprising is that running backs have the lowest scores.
Haha, well That DOES NOT suprise me.
How so?
