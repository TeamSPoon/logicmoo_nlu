Have you seen any movies made out of Stephen King books?
yes, a bunch of them.
I think my favorite was The Shawshank Redemption.
Yes, that was a great movie.
I must have watched it at least twenty times or more.
Yea the character Andy was such a good role.
Yea and Morgan Freeman was great in the movie too.
Another good one was The Green Mile.
Definitely, Tom Hanks played a great part.
Yea, there were a lot of good actors in that one too.
Did you like the new Shining or the old one better.
The old one of course. That is a classic.
Yes, Jack Nicholson was the best. He played such a great nut.
Yes and I think the hotel seemed creepier too.
Yea, me too. Those twins were creepy.
Yes, they were. Sometimes newer versions just don't have the same affect.
Did you like the movie Misery?
Oh yes, Kathy Bates played a great role.
Yes, she was definitely made for that role.
I also loved the movie It, wondering how the remake will be.
