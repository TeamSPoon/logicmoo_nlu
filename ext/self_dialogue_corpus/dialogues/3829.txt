What's your favorite thriller?
Actually, my favorite thriller is a series: the first three "Bourne" movies.
Why are those your favorite?
They're very economical and stylish - nothing is wasted, every scene is well constructed, and the action feels visceral
Did you see the fourth and fifth Bourne movies?
Yes - I was disappointed in both.
I saw the fourth and thought that it was just average and generic.
Exactly - it looked like every other thriller, and didn't continue the intensity and stylishness of the original series.
What about the 5th Bourne film?
It seems like the franchise is played out.  Many of the locales and set pieces were the same, and both Bourne and Matt Damon look tired.  Time to retire the series.
