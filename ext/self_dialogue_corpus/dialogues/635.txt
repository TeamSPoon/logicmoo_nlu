Do you like NFL football?
Yes, football season is my favorite time of year.
Mine too. I get more excited every year.
Do you do fantasy football?
No, I have never really got into it.
I have never played,but was invited to this season.
I just don't think I would want to keep up with it
Yeah, that is my concern. I don't want to get so involved that I worry more about it than my own team.
I could see how that could happen.
Some of my buddies are totally taken by it all. I want to become obsessed.
Maybe you should look into it. Just set yourself some boundaries.
That could work. I will look into it more.
Cool, it could make the game more fun.
Yes, it could offer some extra incentives.
Maybe so. I just don't want to lose much either.
Yeah, football is life.
Exactly, not fantasy.
I hear you.
Just remember your love for the game.
Couldn't forget it if I tried.
