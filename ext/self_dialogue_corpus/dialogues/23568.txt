Want to talk about movies?
Of course, that sounds good.
Do you like any particular movies?
Not really I love them all.
Me too
One of the movies I love is Constantine.
That's a really good one.
It's so crypic, but it's so good
It has really good acting.
It does, the actor they cast is perfect for the role
I also like national treaure
I love those movies
I've learned so much from those novies
They are really interesting
And Nicolas cage acts perfectly
Yes he does
I wish they would make another one
Me too
Maybe they ran out of secrets
That's a possibility
