What Disney movie has made you the saddest?
Probably The Lion King. I saw it when I was really little.
Me too. It was definitely sad when Mufasa died!
I felt so bad for poor, sweet Simba.
It wasn't all sad though, it was funny when he was with Timon and Pumbaa.
They were so hilarious. I love "Hakuna Matata," too.
My favorite scene is when Simba sings "I Just Can't Wait to be King."
He is being sort of obnoxious during that song, but it is adorable!
And Zazu's bickering at him makes it even funnier.
Even though it is a sad movie, I still love a lot of it, and it definitely has funny parts!
