I saw Star Wars at the theater in 1977!
Wow, you must be pretty old.
It was a great, eye opening movie.
Who was your favorite actor or actress?
I loved Alec Guinness.  He gave a dignified performance.
Who's he?
He was a great British actor.
Did you like anyone else?
I've loved Harrison Ford ever since he was in American Graffiti.
I never saw that.
