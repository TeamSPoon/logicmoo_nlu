Seeing people like Neville and Luna develop in Dumbledore's army during the fifth movie is the best.
Yes, I love seeing all the minor characters in the army like Cho, Padma and Seamus.
Cho seems like a really sweet character.
It seems like Harry's really grown up when he finally kisses Cho.
I still like seeing Neville and Luna getting more confident platonically than the romantic relationships.
Everyone who watches the movie probably cheers for Neville as he gets stronger.
And when he kills the snake in the end of The Deathly Hallows..
Oh, that part is awesome.
You see him and Luna talking together in the end of the Deathly Hallows.
Maybe they get together.
