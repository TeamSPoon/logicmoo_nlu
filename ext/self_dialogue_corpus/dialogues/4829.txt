Did you see the score last night between the Diamondbacks and the Padres?
Yes!  The Padres were decimated.
10-1
I know it was insane.
It makes me wonder what the padres will do to the coaching staff?
Not just the coaching staff but the players.
Well the coaches are usually the first to go and then the players at the end of the season.
Very true, but I think both groups will have some heads will roll
Well we will have to see at the end of the season
Indeed we will
Getting off the depressing topic of Padres, did you see the tribute to Jeter?
Yes, they retired his number at Yankee Stadium
He very much deserves it
I agree he does
He has been such an influence on so many players coming up in the organization.
Not only in that specific organization but in the world of baseball
Very true
It is so important to remember the greats and make sure that they are honored correctly.  20 years in baseball is a long time.
Yes a very long time.
I hope I can get a job like that someday where I can be apart of a team for that long.
