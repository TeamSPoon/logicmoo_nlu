Did you hear about the Star Wars movie?
The one about Han Solo?
No, I mean The Last Jedi.
That's the sequel to The Force Awakens, right?
Yeah, it is.
I hear it will be even better than The Force Awakens but I don't know if I believe that.
I think it will do better than the Han Solo movie at least.
I agree, I don't think the Han Solo movie will perform well.
They don't know what people want to see.
I hope they do well on The Last Jedi.
