Are you a metal fan?
Yeah, I love it. How about you?
I think I'm into it, but I'm not sure.
Well, what sort of stuff do you like?
I really like Godsmack and Soundgarden.
Okay, those bands are sort of metal. Godsmack is, but Soundgarden is more alternative.
Oh, okay. Well, what kinds of metal do you like?
I'm really into Anthrax and Megadeth.
Are those 1980s bands?
Yes, they are. They're classics!
That's cool. So what's the difference between Anthrax and Godsmack?
Not a big difference! They both play something like metal, but Anthrax is so much more exciting and skilled.
Okay, I'll have to listen to them sometime.
Definitely. Are there any other metal bands you're into?
I think that's it. Do you have any other recommendations?
Well, Metallica is a really well liked band from the same era.
I've heard of them, of course. Didn't Megadeth's singer used to play for them?
Yes. His name is Dave Mustaine.
What happened there?
Let's not get too into that. It's a long story.
