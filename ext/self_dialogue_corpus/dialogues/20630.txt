You like sports movies?
Yes,I'm  a big fan if they're done right.
I have an old one for you. North Dallas Forty.
Oh wow,with Nick Nolte!
Yes,and Mac Davis.
That was so good.
That's my all time favorite sports movie.
Everyone in that movie was great.
They all played the parts well.
Tom Landry was tough.
He was tough.
All that stuff with pain killers,injections and just playing hurt.
Pretty much still the same today I bet.
I think Nick Nolte played Golden Richards.
I think your right.
I remember when he played for the Cowboys.
Yea he was a decent receiver.
Yes he was.
He didn't fit the Landry way according to the movie though.
No he didn't. Bad boy in his eyes.
