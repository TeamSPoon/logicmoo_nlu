Have you seen A Christmas Carol from Disney?
The CGI version they came out with.
Yes it was so good. I love that story and they did it justice.
Jim Carrey really got into it. I loved the way they got his facial expressions down.
Yes it was a really cute movie. So was Polar Bear Express.
Oh Tom Hanks was wonderful in that.
Aren't they coming out with a part 2?
I think I've heard rumors of it but I'm not really sure. I'm waiting for Incredibles 2.
Oh I'm going to be first in line for that one, me and my kids.
And you know they're going to out do themselves for making us wait so long.
