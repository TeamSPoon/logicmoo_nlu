Hey John how are you?
I'm great Deb, what are you doing today?
I am seeing the new Shymalan film, I forget the name.
Oh, the film 'Split'?
Yes that is the one! My friends said it was scary!
I actually saw it the other day, I love how it ended.
Oh did you? Was it as scary as they say?
I definitely do not want to ruin anything, but there are scary moments.
I heard the girls are bad at acting, was it distracting?
No, not at all. I think all the girls did a great job. The lead actor was wonderful too.
James McAvoy! That is one of the reasons I want to see the film.
Haha! I get it, he is a truly awesome actor. Portrayed demented quite well.
Now you have me more excited than ever to see the film!
I am free for the next few hours, we can grab lunch or see the film if you want!
You wouldn't mind seeing it again?
Not at all, I love rewatching movies, especially in good company.
That is so kind of you to say, let me clear my schedule!
This will be awesome! I never knew you liked horror films.
I like them in good company.
You got me there.
