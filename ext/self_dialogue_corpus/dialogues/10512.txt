Hey bud! What have you been up to?
Oh nothing much, just slaving away at work.
I hear you there. Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Not really. I guess I'll just stay at home and watch movies.
Yeah, that's one of my favorite ways to unwind too. What are you going to watch?
I have no clue. I'm hoping to find a series to binge on.
Do you have Hulu or Netflix?
I have both.
I have been watching a really good series on Hulu if you're interested.
Heck yes!
It's called the Handmaid's Tale.
I think I have heard of that.
It's a book too. There is an old movie based on the book as well.
What's it about?
It's about a world where fertile women are gathered up and used to reproduce, regardless of their wants and needs.
Sounds creepy!
It really is disturbing! What do you say we get together and watch the movie Sunday? I haven't seen it yet.
Sounds like a plan!
Cool. Why don't you come over to my house around 2 pm?
Great! I'll bring the popcorn!
