Any new albums releases on your radar this week?
Hmm, not that I'm aware of.
That's actually kind of rare this year; it seems like there's been at least one album every week that I've wanted to check out.
I know. It's been kind of hard to keep up with.
What has grabbed your attention the most over the last few months?
I'm still listening to that new Elder album a lot.
Man, you really love that album.
It's just kind of a sweet spot of good riffs, solid songwriting, and not too repetitive. I can't get enough of it.
What's your biggest disappointment so far this year?
It pains me to say this, but I can't get into the new Fleet Foxes album.
Really? I know you liked their first two albums a lot.
Yeah, and I was looking forward to their new one so much.
I've heard it a few times; it definitely seems like a grower.
I heard that before I listened to it. I've probably gotten through it 7-8 times and it's just not grabbing me.
That's too bad.
I know. Maybe I'll come back to it in a few months and it'll hit me the right way.
It's funny how some albums do that.
Like I couldn't get into Radiohead for years.
Really? I thought they were kind of universal.
Yeah, I guess they just took me a minute for some reason.
