I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie to come out!
Really? I thought the last one was terrible!
You didn't like seeing Leia and Luke and Han again?
Oh, no, I meant the most recent one.
Rogue One?
Yeah, that one! It was awful.
Okay, first off, that's a prequel, so the next movie won't have to do with that one.
Oh, that explains why none of the normal characters were in it.
Yeah yeah, no, this next one's going to be about Rey and Luke. Didn't you see the trailer?
I guess I just wasn't paying that much attention since I disliked Rogue One so much.
I thought Rogue One was fantastic myself; why didn't you like it?
I just thought there was way too much death, it was so sad at the end.
I mean, it kinda had to happen that way so that the rest of the series could play out the way it did, but I guess I thought the craftsmanship was good.
It did have a nice tone, but couldn't they have let just one person survive?
I guess it wasn't really that kind of film. This was more of a war movie than anything Star Wars has done before, so.
I'm just used to the old style where it's more light and fun.
Well, I don't think the new one will have as much death in it.
Do you know when it comes out?
Sometime in December, I think.
Okay, then I'll wait for reviews and see if it sounds like it's worth the ticket.
