Let's talk about music, who is your favorite pop artist?
Ed sheeran has been dominating a lot of my listening more recently.
I really liked the shape of you his more recent hit.
One of my favorites, in fact the whole of Sheeran's X album are among my favorites.
I discovered him after his I see fire track at the end of the hobbit movie.
That is a great song but most of his work is also really good including his earlier work.
What songs would you suggest from his earlier career?
His Plus (+) album released in 2011 is a great start.
I did not know The A Team was on that album, I love that song.
If you enjoy Ed Sheeran you should really explore his five independently released EPs as well
