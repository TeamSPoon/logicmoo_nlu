I just heard that the Foo Fighters are touring again.
Oh really? Are they coming to our area?
Yeah, they sure are. They'll be here in August.
We totally have to go. I've been a fan of them since The Colour and the Shape came out.
Me too. I heard Pat Smear is going to be touring with them again.
That's totally awesome. I think he's fantastic.
All the guys are, really.
That's true. They seem so genuine.
They certainly haven't let fame go to their heads.
No, not at all. I heard that Dave even drives his kids to school in a mini van!
