Did you see Moana?
Yes. My kids make me watch it at least a couple times a week.
Who is your favorite character?
That chicken. Hei hei. He is hillarious.
I love him too. I love the grandma, how she just encourages Moana to live her life.
Yeah that is great. Did you know the girl who played Moana had to hug her mom after every grandma scene because it mafe her realize how amazing her mom was?
No I hadn't heard that. I did read her and Maui never acted together in the same room All parts were recorded seperatly.
Wow really? That is nuts!
Yeah I know. I couldn't believe it.
That must have been hard.
Yeah I imagine so. Especially for the songs.
If I hear my kids sing that shiny song one more time...
Right? That song is creepy.
It is. I love all the other songs except that one.
Me too. It really is a super cute movie.
Yeah I think it is one of my favorite movies for kids.
Yeah Disney really did a good job.
I agree. It is so pretty there too.
It is. I think they should make a Moana resort.
That would be amazing. ;
