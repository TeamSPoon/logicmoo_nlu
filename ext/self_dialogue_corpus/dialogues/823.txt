Have you seen the movie Concussion?
No I haven't.
It stars Will smith and it's about the NFL.
Oh cool. Is Will smith a football player?
No actually he's an African doctor.
Interesting. Can you give me a rundown of the plot?
Are you planning on watching the movie?
Probably not.
Okay. This movie actually got a lot of anti-press from the NFL because it's an anti football movie.
Wow. That's crazy.
Yeah. Will smith is a doctor that tries to expose to the world the major head injuries caused by football.
That's a pretty heavy movie, typical of Will Smith.
It follows a lot of true story NFL players that had mental problems or even ones who died from their head injuries.
So that's why the movie's called concussion.
Precisely. I highly reccommend it.
Awesome. I'll have to check it out.
Yeah I think it scored like 90% on rotten tomatoes, and I know you care about high ratings.
I just hope I don't stop watching football after watching concussion.
Me too, and I haven't even watched the movie yet.
