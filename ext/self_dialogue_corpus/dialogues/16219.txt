What do you think of the Dubstep genre?
Honestly, at first I didn't like it, but then it kind of grew on me.
Yea me too. But I'm particular with the type of Dubstep I like.
What kind do you like?
I need my Dubstep to be a dirty, filthy Dubstep.
I don't understand what you mean.
Have you heard of Excision or Downlink?
Yea, they are a bass heavy Dubstep.
Well all Dubstep is bass heavy, but yea, they are more than most.
So that's dirty Dubstep?
More or less, I want to feel like I need to take a shower after I listen to it.
Hahaha that's great! I like them too, but I like a more mellow style as well.
Like who?
Datsik is really good.
I like them too, but they are much more mellow than Excision.
Yea, to each their own.
I agree, who else do you like?
Bassnectar is another one my favorites.
Oh me too! What's your favorite song by them?
Hard to say, but I would have to go with Timestretch.
