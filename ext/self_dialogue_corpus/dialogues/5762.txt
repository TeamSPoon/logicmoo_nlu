Wasnt Maleficent based on a Disney character?
Of course it was
Wasnt it Snow White?
No it was Sleeping Beauty
Oh ok, Angelina Jolie as a villain was bizarre
It was and I thought the movie was a little boring.
Really? I didnt think it was bad
The box office numbers supported my belief.
Yeah usually Disney movies with stars always work out
I just dont think people really wanted to see her in it.
