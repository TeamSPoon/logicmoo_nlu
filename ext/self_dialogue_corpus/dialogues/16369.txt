Did you see that Keifer Southerland music video?
No. He's a musician now?
Not really!
What was it?
I don't remeber the song but it was country.
Holy cow!
Yeah. It was bad.
I'm gonna have to look that up.
If you're in need of a laugh.
Always!
I've heard of musicians becoming actors, but not so much the other way around.

Justin Timberlake.
He's actually not so bad at acting.
Yeah, I was suprised.
Did you see that Pirates movie with Jack's dad.
Oh, yeah. The second one?
I think so.
What of it.
Sparrows dad was played by Mick Jagger.
