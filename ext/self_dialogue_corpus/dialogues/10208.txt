So, you know what's really a good action movie?  Hot Fuzz.
Really?  Don't think I've seen that one.
Yeah, I mean, for the first two actions, it's played up like a mystery/horror film with comedic elements, but then it Act III it goes into over-the-top Michael Bay style action.
Oh, not Michael Bay!  Getting tired of the Transformers movies.
No, no, this was made back when his biggest things were Bad Boys 2 and Point Break.  So, they movie does a lot of send up of those films.
Oh, that sounds fun.
Oh, yeah, there's a scene for instance where the main character and bad guy are fighting in a replica model of the village, so they shoot it like something out of a Godzilla movie.
Hahaha.
Another good one is how mainly of the lines they exchanged with characters previously in the film and respoken later one to give them extra meaning.
Oh, yeah, like a neat little call-back/
