I wish there was more rap groups these days.
There's a few, I think.
Oh really? Name five of them.
Well, Migos are pretty popular.
I said five. That's only one.
Wu-Tang Clan are also still a thing.
Wait, really? I honestly didn't know that.
Yeah, but they haven't put out an album in years.
Oh. Thanks for disappointing me.
Sorry about that.
