Can you believe some of the weird names that NFL players have?
Yeah, what's up with Forest Lamp?
That sounds like a decoration, not a person, and I think it's odd that someone named Lamp went to the Chargers
There was a player named Taco who went to the Dallas Cowboys in the draft, too
A guy named Taco in a place where Tex-Mex was born seems like a pretty good fit
I can understand some names that sound ethnic, like Ndamukong, but Taco is strange
I think Solomon Thomas has a pretty cool first name that commands respect
Yeah, it sounds kind of biblical in a way, and for a big guy like that to command respect is definitely a plus
The 49ers defense needs to win back people's respect, and they probably couldn't do that with a bunch of players named Taco and Budda
Then again, Budda Baker is supposed to be a pretty talented athlete
I suppose it's easier to forgive weird names when the people sporting them are enormously talented
I just wish people would stop naming their kids Deshaun and Lesean so I don't get so confused when they end up on the same team
At least if they're on the Eagles like McCoy and Jackson, they'll end up traded away before long
Yeah, what is it with the Eagles and trading their best players away?
Maybe they're building up their roster for the future and compiling draft picks like the Browns
I think the Browns lucked out with all those draft picks and still ended up with Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers
Do you think Peppers is as overrated as people say?
No, I think people just say that because he plays at several different positions so there's less information to go off of
This could be the eve of the Browns' rise to greatness after years of being the punchline to everyone's jokes
Sure, but they're going to need to pick up some more strangely-named players first
