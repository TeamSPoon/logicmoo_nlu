Can you recommend me an album from the beatles
Oh, are you just starting to get into them?
Yeah. I know John Lennon's songs, but I want to listen to more of the original beatles music. Got any recommendations?
Are you a fan of 50's rock or more groovy 60s music
I would say I'm a fan of 60s stuff
Well then i have to recommend Abbey Road. Thats the album with the famous street crossing picture
What famous songs are on the album
Well Come Together and Something is featured in the beginning
Oh I've heard Something before, and I really liked it
Then the rest of the album should suit you
