Who do you think is a better quarterback, Manning or Brady?
I'm from Indiana so Peyton Manning.
You think he is better than Tom Brady?
I think Brady is a great quarterback but Peyton is my man.
Why do you think Peyton is better?
Peyton is more of a football robot than Tom.
If your team was down 6 with the final possession.  Who do you want leading your drive to win?
I hate to say it but Tom Brady.
Really, why Tom over Peyton.
Peyton is great but he isn't clutch.
I think that's why Brady is better than Manning.
I will give you that.
Do you think Peyton needed more help in Indianapolis?
The Colts defense was always ranked high, but we weren't that good.
You had Dwight Freeney who was a beast.
He's about all we ever had on the defense.
You also had Bob Sanders.
Who was always hurt.
If I was going to learn football from a player, I'd want Peyton Manning to teach me.
Peyton is a football robot.
