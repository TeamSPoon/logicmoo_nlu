Who is the greatest Super Bowl Championship team of all time?
Easy, Da Bears
You mean the 1985 Chicago Bears?
Yep, that's them
Why do you say that?
Think about the players on that team: Payton, McMahon, The Fridge
Oh yeah, and Richard Dent and Mike Singletary
Yeah, them too.
Yeah, Walter Payton was a pretty spectacular running back
Yeah, he was awesome. One of the greatest.
Did you know he never scored a touchdown in the super bowl?
Yeah, I heard about that. One of Mike Ditka's biggest regrets.
Yeah, he played for years on horrible Bears teams and finally won one at the end of his career.
Whatever happened to him?
He passed away. Was sick with some liver disease.
Man, that's too bad.
Yeah, he was only 45 when he passed
Wow, that young!
Yeah, RIP Sweetness
Yes, RIP Sweetness.
