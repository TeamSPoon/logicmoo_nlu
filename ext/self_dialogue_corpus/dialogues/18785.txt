Have you heard the soundtrack to Priscilla Queen of Desert?
Oh my god! I love that movie. It has the best music!
I know right...all you have to say is Shake Your Groove Thing!
That and I Will Survive!!!
Wasn't there a song by the Village People?
Go West. I love them. I remember when YMCA came out. It was the best song.
Yeah, I'm so uncoordinated. I couldn't do the letters.
Ha! All I have to say is " I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine!"
Who sang that?
Patti Page. That reminds me, didn't she sing "I Love The Nightlife?"
No, that was Alicia Bridges. I don't know if she sang anything else.
Oh, I don't recall that name. I don't know either.
What about ABBA's Mama Mia?
That is great 70's band! They did a ton of great songs.
I know. I love them too. They are so 70's.
Yeah, retro is cool.
Yep, Can't Help Lovin That Man!
Who was that?
Trudy Richards.
I need to go back and watch that movie just to hear the music!!
