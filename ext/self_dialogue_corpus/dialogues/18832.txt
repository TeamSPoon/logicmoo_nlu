It's interesting how different styles of music cycle in and out in popularity in different incarnations.
Do you like k-pop?
Some of it is very catchy but I can only listen to so much.
I think so too.
Sometimes, after I listen to a kpop song, I like to listen to a grunge band.
Kind of like cleansing the palette.
Precisely.  There is only so much electronic synthesized pop one can take.
Have you ever heard African acapella songs in four part harmony?
Yes, they are pretty amazing.
I wish I could sing like that.  Can you sing?
I can, but I don't think I am good at it.
I used to sing in a chorus when I was younger, but I really stopped singing when I got a very shy roommate.
Did they tell you not to sing?
No, but I just felt self-conscious.
That's too bad.
I don't know if it is age, but since I stopped singing, I've lost my vocal range.
Did you have a wide range?
I was no Mariah Carey, that's for sure.
It's amazing when people have a wide range and can sing well.
I wish I had that ability.
