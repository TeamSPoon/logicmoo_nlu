Did you ever see Panic Room?
A long time ago, I did.
Seems like it's one of the last films I've seen with Jodie Foster.
She hasn't been in much lately.
I always thought the idea was kind of weird.  The room wouldn't really protect you.
Short-term maybe, but they could eventually wait you out.
Right, you're locked in.  Even with supplies, what are you going to do?
Yeah, it's not like a fallout shelter.
Anyway, I would never have one in my house.  I've got too much stuff!
It would also be very costly to put one in!
