What's your favorite kind of music?
I actually like a lot of punk and pop-punk.
Really?
Yeah, I don't dress like a punk anymore though!
How did you get into that kind of stuff?
Teenage angst, I'd guess you say.
True!
I grew up in a small town in Kentucky and always felt like an outsider.
How so?
Everyone there is super conservative, and I wanted something different.
Was there a stong punk community there?
Actually there was. I used to go to shows of local bands every weekend.
What's your favorite band?
I don't know if I could pick just one?
Well what's your favorite to see live?
Maybe The Jealous Sound, I've seen then three times!
That's awesome! I feel like the more times you see a band live the better the shows seem.
I totally agree.
You should send me some of your favorite songs, I don;t know a lot of that kind of music.
Yeah, I definitely will!
