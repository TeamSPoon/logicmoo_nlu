Have you ever noticed that newly released movies often copy each other?
I'm not sure I'm following you.
Like when a bunch of apocalypse movies came out at once. 2012 came out around the same time as The Road.
Yeah, ok. I see what you're getting at.
Wasn't San Andreas out around then, too?
No, that was definitely more recent. But I think that Ice Age movie was around 2009.
Ice Age: The Meltdown?
I think that's the one I'm thinking of. I think they've done like three or four Ice Age movies by now.
Can you really consider Ice Age movies to be apocalyptical though? I mean, they're animated...
Yeah, but they're still about major world changes.
But they're not about the end of the world and that's what true apocalypse movies are supposed to be about.
But to the animals living during that time, it sure seemed like the end of the world.
But they aren't people!!
Does it matter? Apocalypses are apocalypses, no matter which life forms are around to witness them.
So you think that if bacteria witnessed a cataclysmic event, assuming there were no humans around to see it, it would still qualify as an apocalypse movie?
Do you honestly think that Hollywood would make a movie about a bacterium's End of Days?
Actually, it might be better than some of the drek they're putting out these days. I might not mind a movie about a bacterium.
At least it would raise viewers' IQ slightly. People would then know the difference between bacteria and a bacterium.
Please. No grammar police today. It's my day off. But yeah, I'd love to see a blockbuster about microorganisms.
Maybe they could get John Cusack to play a cute smallpox virus or something.
