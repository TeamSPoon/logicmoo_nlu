I’m bored. Do you want to do something tonight?
Sure. What do you feel like doing?
Well, the film festival is in town. And I’m in the mood for seeing a movie. How does that sound?
I could go for a movie.  What’s playing?
Attack from Planet Q’ is playing at the Odeon theatre.
What’s that about?
It’s a sci-fi about aliens who invade China. It takes place along the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty.
Who’s in it?
It’s starring Will Smith. He plays a palace guard who uncovers an alien plot to kill the Emperor.
What do the critics say about it?
The critics say it’s frightening and entertaining. It won ‘Best Film’ at the Cannes Film Festival.
OK. Let’s see that. What time does it start?
Show times are at 6:45 and 8:30.
Why don’t we catch the 8:30 so that we can have a bite to eat before we go?
How about Chinese food?
That is a fitting choice based on the film!
Absolutely. I was inspired by our movie choice.
Chinese sounds great. Do you want to drive?
Yes, it will be faster if I do.
Sounds good. I'll grab my coat and wallet.
