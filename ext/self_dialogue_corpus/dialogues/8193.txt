How do you like Taylor Swift?
she's great. I like her music very much
for example?
well she has 2 different stages of style, when she was younger she was a country style music girl, now she's a pop star. I like both Fearless and 1989
Are there any specific songs you like to mention?
overall, I feel those 2 albums' songs are all great, I couldn listen to them all day, like Clean, Fearless, etc.
how come you get to know Taylor Swift?
It was from her ultra popular music video "You Belong With Me".
Oh that one, It struck me that those 2 girls in the video were both Taylor Swift
haha, I was totally surprised too, I wouldn't know if I didn't pay too much attention
