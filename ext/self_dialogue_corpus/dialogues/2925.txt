Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
I think the Patriots have a good chance to win again.
Yes, as long as they have Tom Brady and Bill Belicheck, they have a chance.
Who else do you think will contend for a championship?
I really like the Dallas Cowboys as well.
Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliott were amazing in their rookie years.
The Cowboys are in a tough division.
Yes, the NFC East will be very competitive this year with the New York Giants.
Are you a fan of the Giants or Odell Beckham Jr?
I am a big fan of the Giants and Odell.
How do you think the Giants will do this year?
They have a good chance of winning with the wide receiver group they have put together.
The Giants must be more consistent if they want to contend.
Eli Manning will have to have good form if they want to win.
Do you believe the Raiders will do well this year?
I think the Raiders have a great chance of winning.
How will Carr bounce back from injury?
Carr seems like a hard worker who will come back strong.
How will Marshawn Lynch fit into the Raiders team?
Lynch will be solid, but he is not the player he once was with the Seahawks.
