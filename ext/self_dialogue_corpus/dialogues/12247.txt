Have you heard that they are making a new movie about Han Solo when he was younger?
That is crazy. I wonder what will happen in that movie.
Maybe they will show how Han first met Chewie.
They could also show how Han won the Millennium Falcon for the first time.
How funny would it be if they had him making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs?
Ha, that would be funny. I just hope they stay true to his rogue like character.
Definitely. They need to go back to the Han who shot Greedo first instead of the Han that George Lucas tried to sanitize.
I heard Donald Glover is in the movie playing a young Lando Calrissian.
That should be good. Woody Harrelson is in it too.
I never thought I would see him in the Star Wars universe, but I guess anything is possible now.
