So what kind of movies do you like other than action and comedy?  Do you like horror?
No, but I do like thrillers.  Over the past few years I saw a couple of good ones.
Which ones were they?
I think The Perfect Guy was good.  It was about a guy who seemed perfect but he was a bad man.
Oh yeah one of my friends saw that and he said it was really good!
Yes it was, and there was a lot of action and suspense and what not.
That's cool.  So the guy, was he a sociopath?
According to the movie he was "bipolar deteriorating into psychosis", which could cause people to be prejudiced towards people with issues.
That's too bad, my friend is a psychologist and said the same thing.
Aside from that the movie was great though.
How about the other movie?
The other one was No Good Deed, which starred Idris Alba as the bad guy.
He's such a great actor, Idris Albe.
Yes he is, and he was what they called a "malignant narcissist".  He killed a lot of people.
Well at least it's a thriller so he gets beaten in the end, right?
Yes of course.  That's one of the differences between a thriller and horror I think.
Did you notice anything original about that movie?
Well one thing I've never seen before was how they had his point of view sometimes and how they portrayed it.
Really, what was it like?
Basically while the other person says something critical or nasty to him it sounds really loud and causes him a lot of pain.
