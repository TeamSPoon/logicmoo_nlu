Are you a fan of jazz music?
Me? No, not really.
Yes, I would've said the same thing if you asked me a week ago.
Really? What changed?
Well, my boyfriend is a big fan of jazz. The traditional, old fashioned kind. Like big band.
Like Benny Goodman? Glenn Miller? People like that?
Exactly. He really loves that kind of music. I've always kind of shied away from it.
To be honest, it gives me a headache.
Last week was my boyfriend's birthday. I told him I'd take him anywhere he wanted to go and he picked this jazz club down by the beach.
That was nice of you. And he had a great time?
He loved it. That was no surprise. What was unexpected was the fact that I had such a good time.
What made the difference?
I think it was hearing the music live. It sounded so vibrant and clear. I think I had heard too many old recordings that weren't great quality.
That makes sense. That can definitely influence your feelings.
I was really caught off guard by how beautiful the music sounded. So emotional, so stirring.
That's exciting. So now you're as big a fan as your boyfriend?
I don't know if I would go that far. At least not yet. But I'm definitely a fan.
The way you're talking kind of makes me want to hear the music the way you did.
It's really a thrilling experience. You and I should go sometime.
I'd love it. Maybe I'll be converted, too.
