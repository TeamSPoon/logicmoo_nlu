Do you think they'll do another Batman soon?
Probably not.
Why?
They're coming out with Justice League.
That should be interesting.
I like who they got for Aquaman.
Yeah, they really changed that character up.
I don't know if it will be good, but I don't know how they would have done it otherwise.
Bolndie in some orange tights.
Now that would have been a laugh!
