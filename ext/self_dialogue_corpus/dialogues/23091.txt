What's your favourite Jim Carrey movie?
I can't narrow it down. The Mask was my favourite as a kid, even though it scared me.
That was so good! And even as an adult there are some parts of it that creep me out.
Liar Liar was so good too. The scene where he beat himself up was so good.
I remember that! He really doesn't need any supporting actors to make a movie work.
And the way he interacted with his son in that was so heartwarming. Like, I can't relate to the whole broken family thing and not having a dad you can count on, but the performances made me feel that firsthand.
I got you. That's one of the marks of a really good actor is making you feel things you otherwise wouldn't feel.
Yeah. What about you?
I know it's not a good choice, but his role as The Riddler is one of my favourites.
Why not a good choice?
Well I just know he didn't get much screen time and a lot of people don't like the job he did.
Yeah, I feel like that's one of his forgotten roles.
But I love it for some reason. I wanted to watch that movie again and again as a kid and I had such a crush on him in it.
That's a weird character to have a crush on!
I know, I don't know what it was about it.
The thing I fall in love with is how he uses his face. It's like a whole genre of comedy.
Yeah, like in Dumb and Dumber. I especially liked his improvisation in that with "the most annoying sound in the world".
And don't forget Ace Ventura!
He used more than his face as Ace Ventura.
Too true. I think that's the movie he used the most of his body in for comedic value.
