Are you a country music fan?
Not really but I am open. I guess it depends on if it's old school or newschool.
What about Blake Shelton?
He's definitely a very talented man and he seems really nice.Would I buy his album? Probably not
I don't like country either but I can appreciate some singers old and new and see why they are loved.
That's pretty much how I feel.
Patsy Cline was an incredible singer but she also was very articulate and not what I call "twangy".
I guess that's part of what I don't like about Country music...the dreaded "twang"
I used to refer to Garth Brooks as Barf Brooks in his hay day.
Ha Ha that's a cheap shot!
However I watched a concert on t.v. and he was very impressive. The man knows how to put on a show and he sang very well.
That's surprising coming out of you.
I have a new respect for him.
Now the kind of country I can't stand is the someone shot my dog today and stole my girlfriend too.
Such mindless crap and the same 4 notes played over and over.
Yet country music has the biggest following
I know. It's kind of scary if you think about it.
How so?
The intelligence level of the people who are entertained by such simplistic ramblings are the people influencing our country.
That's pretty harsh but I can see your point
