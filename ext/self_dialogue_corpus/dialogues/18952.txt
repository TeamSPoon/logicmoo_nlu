I am into classic rock mostly but I will listen to many different kinds of music.
What are are your favorite bands?
I am middle age and I grew up in the 80s so many 80s songs still appeal to me.
They say whatever music played when you were a teenager you will like all your life.
I think that is true.
What bands do you like most?
I like U2, the police, and aerosmith.
Oh, is that all.
To be honest even when I was young I liked alot of music from the 60s and 70s.
There is something about that you like?
I like the psychedelic edge of the 60s music/
Oh, really how so?
These artists must have been dropping acid when they wrote these songs
There is just something bizarre about these kinds of songs
It really comes out in the music.
I like the Beetles later music but not the early stuff.
Me too the early stuff is just too mom and pop.
