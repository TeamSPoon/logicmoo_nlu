Do you know of any Disney movies coming out in 2017.
Yeah, actually. I think I can name a few.
What movies are coming out.
Well, I know that there's Cars 3, Lou, and Coco.
Cars 3! I hope we get more of the backstory about where all of the humans went.
Yeah! Why do the cars have doors and seats if there are no humans?
It really doesn't make sense. What could have killed off all the humans, but not the Cars?
I don't think it was nuclear war because that'd probably destroy the cars.
Yeah, it's kind of dark for a kids movie when you think about it.
Very dark! Although, I think that level of inference is beyond the abilities of most of the young kids watching it.
