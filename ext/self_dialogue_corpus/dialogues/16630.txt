Did you hear about Chris Cornell?
Yes, what a sad day for music, huh?
Incredibly sad. He had the voice of an angel.
For sure, not to mention his writing skills.
I know. He went deep and wasn't afraid to say the dark things we all think.
He was a superb frontman.
I agree. Every project he worked on was a thing of beauty.
I listen to Sound garden and think it can't get better.
I know, then I listen to Temple of the Dog and think the same thing.
Yep. And the Audioslave comes along.
And it blows us all away with the collaboration with Brad Wilks and Tom Morello.
They were insane. Just so perfect.
I remember hearing Cochise for the first time and knowing immediately that it was Chris.
Yeah his voice wasn't hard to distinguish.
And he was so passionate when he sang.
Totally. You felt every word he was saying.
Such a shame to lose so many amazing musicians.
Itsukasa heartbreaking. They are the soundtracks to our lives.
For sure. And the grunge Era was profound for us as teens.
Yeah his music helped me get through a lot as a teenager.
