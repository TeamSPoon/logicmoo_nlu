Like any classic rock bands in particular?
Well my tastes are pretty broad.
Yeah I'd say mine are eclectic too. Who are some favorites?
Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Prince...
You've got good taste.
Thanks. Yeah Led Zeppelin is a big favorite.
Soo massively talented.
I can never get tired of them!
What do you like about them?
They're all so talented musically.
You must have a favorite.
Robert Plant's singing is out of this world.
I completely agree. He can hit the high notes so well.
He's tremendously popular. And the others?
Jimmy Page is masterful on the guitar.  He's a contender.
Ha ha okay.  What about the others.
They're greats too. Together they're an incomparable ensemble.
And your favorite songs?
Stairway to Heaven all the way.
With them, that's just a gateway to their music.
