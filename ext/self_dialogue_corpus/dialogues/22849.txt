What's your favorite war movie?
I liked Platoon.
That was a good one.  Harsh Vietnam movie.
Often forgotten because of it's age.  All Quiet on the Western Front.
Yes!  That was a good movie.
Both of those were best picture.
Both were grim and dark too.
Yeah, I prefer a dark and disgusting war movie.
Me too.  A lot of the old WW2 stuff was full of propaganda.
Both of us being Vets we understand but some other people don't.
I know what you mean.  How about Hamburger Hill?
That was pretty awesome.  Of course Saving Private Ryan.
Yes, and as far as special effects goes that might be one of the best.
Highway robbery that didn't win best picture.
I agree.  What about Zero Dark Thirty.
Very good movie.  I love the title too.
Yeah, people don't get it like we do.
It just sets a certain tone for the film.
And it was a pretty grim film.
Yeah I know but a good one.
