I can't wait for the new Star Wars!
Me neither.
When does it come out?
I think in Novevember.
Thats waaay too long!
Yeah. I wonder if they be able to have Princess Leia.
I don't think so.
Why not? They had her in Rouge One.
Yeah, but when Carrie Fisher died her estate said they couldn't use her image.
Yeah, but they pobably have footage for the film before she passed.
Probably true.
And, if they do, Disney owns it.
Yeah, I don't think the estate could argue that point...
Anyway, no Solo.
I don't know. They might ghost him in like Yoda or Kenobi.
Yeah, but they were Jedi.
Sad.
Agreed. Don't know why they killed off the best character.
Best? That's debatable.
Agree to disagree?
