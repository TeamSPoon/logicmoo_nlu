Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love my Pats!
Really?  Me too!
Pats all the way this year!
Just like every year!
Yea buddy!
People hate on us all the time for liking the Pats
Yea but they're just jealous
I agree.  Pure jealousy
And they keep trying to say that we cheat
Like with the deflated ball?
Yea, man!
Pure jealousy again!
I totally agree!
Yea there will always be haters
Yea, that's just how it goes
Good talk man!
Agreed!
