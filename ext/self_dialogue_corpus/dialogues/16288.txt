So, what's been good, friend?
In Music, you mean?
Yeah. What have you been listening to.
Man, you know what? I cannot stop listening to Nile lately.
What is Nile, precious?
Do you like heavy music?
Like Slipknot?
Sort of. Imagine if Slipknot wasn't idiot rap metal and pretty singing like Celine Dion, but good.
Well, what do they do?
All their songs are about ancient Egypt.
That's cool. I love that place!
Yeah, there's all these gods and curses and sand demons and pyramids and stuff.
But what sort of music is it?
It is relentlessly brutal death metal. But the music is like Egyptian scales mixed with modern  minor keys and stuff like that.
So, it's like authentic?
Yeah, they even use old timey Egyptian instruments.
That's a cool gimmick.
It's more than a gimmick. The guy who orchestrates it, Karl Sanders, he's like a straight up Egyptologist.
Oh,he has a degree?
I don't know about that, but he walks around wearing like the eye of Ra or something, so that's probably the same thing.
