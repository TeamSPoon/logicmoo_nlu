Have you seen Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?
I saw it when it came out in theaters.
Who was your favorite character?
I liked K-2SO best!
I thought he was great, especially since Alan Tudyk was his voice actor.
Do you think he is going to be in more Star Wars movies?
I don't think he would fit in the sequel to The Force Awakens since it is so far in the future.
The Force Awakens has BB-8 though, and he is an awesome little droid.
I loved when BB-8 got away with the map, like R2-D2 escaping with Leia's recording in A New Hope.
That was a great throwback to the first movie!
