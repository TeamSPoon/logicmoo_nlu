Can you believe how long Star Wars has existed?
I'm actually not a fan, so I really don't know much about it.
Are you serious? It's one of the most storied film franchises in history!
I know it has status, but it's just not for me. Anyways, how long's it been around?
Well, the first film came out in 1977.
40 years? Really?
It's crazy, isn't it?
It's insane that a franchise could have such longevity.
It's even more impressive that they're still pumping out quality movies.
Wow. That's unbelievable.
