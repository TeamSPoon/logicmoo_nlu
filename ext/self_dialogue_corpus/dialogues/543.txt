How about those Lions?
Hard to say, at least they started to focus on their offensive line.
Maybe Stafford will get a chance to really show what he's got.
Do you think there are enough receiver options for him?
The Lions always have enough receiving options.
They had an awful lot of drops last year.
That's true, do you think that has something to do with Stafford?
I am not sure but I think he is really good.
Do you think he is worth being the highest paid QB in the NFL?
That is a tough question, he is definitely worth a lot of money.
Tom Brady is worth a lot of money but he takes a lower salary for the team.
Yeah, at some point people just have enough money and want to win.
What team do you think is going to be the biggest challenge in the division?
It always seems to be the Packers by the time it's all said and done.
Aaron Rodgers is pretty great.
Yeah, even with the slow start last year he managed to turn it around, like usual.
The Bears have the highest paid backup QB in the league now.
Haha, yeah, that makes them a force to be reckoned with!
The RB is always an issue for the Lions, I wonder if they finally figured it out.
Tion Green seems like the usual kind of pick up, but here's to hoping!
