What kind of music do you like?
I'm into a lot of indie stuff.
Oh cool. You ever heard of Maps and Atlases?
No. Would I like them?
They're definitely an indie band.
What genre are they?
Well, they're pretty experimental.
So like math rock?
You could call it that.
You wouldn't?
They're more like alternative folk I guess.
That sounds pretty cool.
It is. Like I said, they're hard to pin down.
Maybe I can just give them a listen?
You definitely should. Their last one is called Beware and Be Grateful.
Last one?
Yeah, they haven't done much since 2012. But what they had was solid.
Cool. I'll give it a listen.
Come over sometime and I'll let you borrow the album.
Sweet!
