So, one thing I like about music is songs with really interesting lyrics.
Really?  Like what?
Well, I like music that tells a story, or expresses some kind of emotion I really like.. besides something vapid like falling in love.
Oh, you don't like love songs?
Ahhh.. they're not usually my job of tea.
Well, what are some examples of lyrics you like?
Well, for instance, the Three Doors Down "Kryptonite."  I really like the opening verse, "I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind. I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time. I wanted the world float to the dark side of the moon.  I feel there's nothing I can do..."
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Yeah, it just really speaks to the sense of helplessness one can feel sometimes, watching the world and the way it's going.  Or at least, that's how I interpret it.
Well, I like more upbeat, encouraging songs.
Like what?
Well, you're gonna laugh at this, but like "You're the Best" by Joe Esposito.
Why does that sound familiar.
It was on the Karate Kid.
Oh, man, hahaha.
I knew it, I knew it.
No, no, I'm not laughing at you.  Well, okay maybe a little bit.
Yeah, yeah, I'm a bit stuck in the 80s.
Hey, they were a decent time for music.
Yeah, I think so.
