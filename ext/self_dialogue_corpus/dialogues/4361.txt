Ever scene the original Alien?
That was good.  All of them have been good.
The best part though was the chest buster scene.
Yeah, because no one expected it at the time.
It was great to see such a strong female hero in the 80's as well.
Yes Segordney Weiver did a great job.
The alien is creepy the way it moves around too.
Almost unbeatable.
All the movies were great.
Except Alien vs Preditor.
