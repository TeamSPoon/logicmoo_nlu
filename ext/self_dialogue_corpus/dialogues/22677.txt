Are you a Hitchcock fan by any chance?
Alfred Hitchcock? Yeah I love his movies.
Yay, me too. I've been hoping for someone to watch his movies with.
What's your favourite?
I gotta say the Birds.
Oh, a classic, good choice.
You know it was filmed in Bodega Bay. I've been there!
No, that's cool.
I also really like Rope.
I'm not familiar with that one.
Oh, well Jimmy Stewart is in it, it's a really good one. It also has some really long takes, some of the scenes are like 10 minutes long.
That's amazing.
It really is. That's half the reason I like it right there.
Jimmy Stewart was in more than one HItchcock film as I recall.
Yeah, like Rear Window.
That's one of my favourites.
It's probably the most famous, too.
It was so entertaining considering it took place in such a confined space.
That seems to be a theme in a lot of Hitchcock films.
I hadn't noticed that.
