Who do would you say is your favorite pop artist?
It would be a tie between Britney Spears and Fergie.
I like Britney a lot, but I can't stand Fergie anymore.
Really? Why don't you like Fergie?
It just feels like she's not trying anymore.
I agree, she was better with The Black Eyed Peas, but I still think she's a strong singer.
Well, that's the probelm, she's a strong singer, but her songs are straight up rubbish anymore.
Why do you say that?
Take M.I.L.F Money for example,  that song didn't make any damn sense. The lyrics and the style were all over the place.
Ok, you have a point with ONE song, but I still don't think she's all bad.
