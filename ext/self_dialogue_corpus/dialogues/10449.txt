Are you into music at all?
Of course! Who isn't?
Yeah, good point!
Why do you ask?
Just wondering if you watched the Voice at all this past season.
I caught most of it.
Who was your favorite singer?
From the finale or altogether?
Any singer!
Tsoul was definitely my fave. I was so sad when he didn't make the finale.
Oh my god, me too!
He has such natural talent.
Definitely. And there isn't enough soul music out there these days anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
Do you think that's why he didn't make the cut?
I've never thought about it, but it makes sense.
I think that's what happened. But we need a soul music revival these days!
I totally agree. We need music with passion
Let;s check out his website- maybe he's touring!
Good idea!
