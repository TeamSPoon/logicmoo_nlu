Are we at a point where steroids may have been better for the game?
No way how can you say that?
Scoring was better back then
And the pitching was terrible.
There were great pitchers still available.
But people want to see scoring.
They do but they can solve that.
How?
Analytics is turning lineups into hit machines
I dont see it happening yet
It will turn eventually
I cant see that ever happening.
They will get better and learn to adjust
So you think this is just temporary?
Yes, a sub 3 ERA will not be the norm.
I just think when people hit homers more fans come out
Yeah but what were they worth knowing everyone was juicing?
I think people can forget about that.
Tell that to Rafael Palmeiro
Thats a different case. He juiced from day one.
