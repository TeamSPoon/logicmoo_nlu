What did you think of the new Dead Pool movie?
Well it's not so new anymore, but I thought it was great.
Yea it was so funny!
The fighting was cool too.
They really nailed it, I think it's by far the best superhero movie.
Well it certainly is the best fit. Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool.
Wouldn't it be amazing if they did a Deadpool and Wolverine crossover.
Yea Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds in the same movie would be epic.
I wonder who would win in a fight?
Well, in the end they would be on the same side. You know how these movies go.
Yea that's true. Theyd start out enemies, but then in the end work together.
Yea, I really hope they cross Deadpool over into the other marvel movies.
It isn't likely due to studio licensing contracts.
Well, that's dumb. They should find a way to make it happen.
Yea, people would pay a lot more money to watch Deadpool with other superheroes.
Yea, they should bring that teenage girl superhero and collassus with them too. They were great.
Yea they were. Deadpool had a really tight budget, and they still did that good.
Really? That's amazing.
Yea, it was also the first rated R superhero movie.
Well, it paid off, because they made a ton of money.
