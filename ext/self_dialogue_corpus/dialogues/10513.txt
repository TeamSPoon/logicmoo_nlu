Since Twin Peaks is being revived, I decided to go back and watch the Twin Peaks movie, Fire Walk with Me.
Oh. I remember that vaguely. When did that come out?
1992. Not a lot of people saw it. Many people hated it because the tone was quite different than the show.
In what way?
Well, it's very dark. It doesn't have as much quirky charm as the show Twin Peaks.
What's it about?
It focuses on the time period immediately before Laura Palmer death. You get to see what her life was like and the issues she was dealing with.
Who stars in it?
David Bowie makes a small, but memorable, appearance. Also Chris Issak, Keifer Sutherland, David Duchovny as a transgendered FBI agent, Harry Dean Stanton, Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Grace Zabriskie and more people. It has a big cast.
It sounds interesting. Did it get any awards?
Oh no. Absolutely not. It did not have any mainstream success. It received many poor reviews, but it's one of my favorite movies.
Well, it must be somewhat bad to receive so many bad reviews, right?
Obviously, I don't think so. I think people went in the theater with certain expectations, and when they were not met, they were upset.
So, what kind of issues was Laura dealing with in the movie.
Well, mostly she is coping with abuse.
From her father?
Yes, but in the movie she is uncertain about who is abusing her. This is because of combination of factors. Most certainly one of them is denial.
Do you recommend that I watch it before I watch the new episodes of Twin Peaks?
Yes. If you are fan of Twin Peaks, you should definitely consider this must-see material.
Okay. Well, I consider myself a fan of the Twin Peak world, strange as it may be. I will check it out.
