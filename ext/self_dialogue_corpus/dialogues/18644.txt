Ugh, I can tell my friend used my pandora last.
How?
It's still on the Steven Universe soundtrack station.
Is that so bad?
I just never really got into it, despite her efforts to get me interested. Except for one song.
Which one?
The cookie cat song.
Oh yeah, I remember that. Still gets stuck in my head.
Yeah, mine too and not in a great way.
I like the theme song more than anything.
I don't mind it except for Steven's voice.
Not a fan?
Not especially.
How come?
I just can't stand the qualities of his voice, it's so aggravating. Especially when he was going through his voice change.
Really? He's one of my favourites.
Garnet is my favourite. her personality, her singing, everything.
Makes sense, you know her voice actor is a professional singer right?
Yeah. Never heard any of her stuff apart from that series though.
Me neither, I just know she's supposed to be good.
