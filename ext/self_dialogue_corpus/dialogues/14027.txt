If you could only listen to one Lady Gaga song for the rest of time, what would it be?
Bad Romance. It's got a very catchy beat.
The lyrics of Bad Romance are fun too.
Her songs are fun in general, but there's something about Bad Romance I just want to dance to whenever I hear it.
Did you know she is the first artist to have two songs pass 7 million downloads?
Wow, that is amazing. What songs?
Poker Face and Just Dance.
Those are great songs. I love Poker Face.
Have you heard The Cure?
That's her most recent single. I didn't like it as much as some others, but it's still pretty good!
