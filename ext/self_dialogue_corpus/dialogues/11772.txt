Okay, guess this one. "Help! I need somebody. Help! Not just anybody."
"Help!" by The Beatles.
You got it. Do you like this song?
I'm a huge Beatles fan and this is one of my favorite early Beatles songs.
I know, such a great Lennon and McCartney collaboration.
Yes, and it's all about how we're not all really completely independent.
Yes, it's about how we need each other. Humans are social animals.
Exactly, I respect that. There's a lot of egotism in contemporary music.
Right, I like that the Beatles were able to right a song that's about self-doubt and needing others.
I wonder if that type of song will crop up again eventually. Hip hop is currently dominant and the boast is such a staple of the form.
