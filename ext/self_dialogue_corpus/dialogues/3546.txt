Do you think Nightmare on Elm Street is the best horror film
Yes because it was not all about the gore
Sure that was a huge part of it
Yeah but it incorporated psychological elements
Yeah you are right about that too
I think it played on your head as well
So that would be the worst kind of horror?
I think so
Yeah but Freddy was a scary character too
He was frightening to look at.
