what are your thoughts on the song free as a bird?
I liked how chill this song felt. Very laid back sound.
That is true. you almost felt like you were soaring along.
Originally it was recorded in 1977 by John Lennon.
That is right. They ended up releasing it in 1995.
Ya  it was a huge deal that it was being put out.
I do recall all the hype. Well worth it.
Agreed it is such a beautiful song.
It would have been a shame for it to remain hidden away.
I wonder how many others there are tucked away somewhere..  they should release anything and everything.
