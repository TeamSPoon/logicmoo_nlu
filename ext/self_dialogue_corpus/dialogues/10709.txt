Where do you think they filmed Fast and the Furious?
California
It must have been hard to shoot it
Yeah. Closing down all of those streets must have been tough.
I agree. It's a complicated project.
Did you enjoy the races?
Yes
What was your favorite part?
The story Dom told about his dad.
That was sad. It told a lot about his character though.
