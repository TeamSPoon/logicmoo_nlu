Let's have a conversation on football
Like about the game?
A serious conversation. I'm against football.
Why's that?
Football is an extremely dangerous sport, yet kids grow up wanting to be the next Peyton Manning.
That's why they wear protective gear. Sure it's a rough sport but that's the fun of it
Did you know that more than 20% of NFL players report head trauma injuries?
That's pretty high but it's a toll that they pay for the sport.
Okay. So the problem is, why don't people know how dangerous it is? There should be parental advisories
I think people should just choose to play what they want.
They can choose, as long as they have knowledge.
Knowledge of what?
Consequences.
That's fair. I agree with you on that.
This way, parents can sign up their kids for little league football after the kid knows they can get a concussion.
This reminds me of a movie recently.
Which movie?
Concussion. It stars Will Smith.
I'll have to check it out.
Please do. It's quite relevant.
