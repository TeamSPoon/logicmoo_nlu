Do you think Harrison Ford wishes he played more roles in Star Wars
You mean besides Hans Solo
No, I mean like in more than 4 films.
No I think he had quite a career after he did the first 3.
But Hans was a great character for him
He was but the tension he had with Carrie Fisher on screen was odd
I did not sense that besides the romantic feelings.
It felt like it was out of place.
Lucas didnt really write those kinds of films.
Yeah and unfortunately that was on display
