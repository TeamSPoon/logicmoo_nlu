I did, it is very different, but it is really good.
I agree that it was pretty different.
Yea, there was very little rap.
I agree, it was more like neo-soul.
Right, it was a good effort.

I agree, Killer Mike and El-P are very talented.
I agree, they sound really good together.
Did you listen to the new Tribe Called Quest album?

You are probably right, but I still liked it.
Me too, but I will not revisit it like I do their other albums.
