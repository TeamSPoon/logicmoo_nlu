What do you think of kylo ren?
I think he seems like a very dark character as he should be.
Ya, I can't believe he killed Han considering the relationship there.
Interesting how star wars films deal with the father /son relationship.
Ya, it makes you wonder a little about george lucas's relationship with his father.
Probably troubled. I think star wars is so universal, most themes relate to life so deeply.
That is true and for sure part of the movie franchise's appeal to the masses.
Do you think rae and kylo are related?
I am thinking yes probably brother and sister. Like maybe she was hidden away like lea was seperated from luke.
Ya something around those lines would make sense for the movies.
