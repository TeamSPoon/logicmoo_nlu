How did country music become pop music?
That's a good question! It's a bit strange that artists like Taylor Swift have become so huge.
Yes, I agree. Why has this phenomena occurred?
In the 1950s, the "Nashville Sound" tried to dampen down country music a bit.
How did they do that?
Well, the "Honkey Tonk" of the 1940s was too raw to become popular. So, the smoothed everything out.
And, that worked well enough to turn country music into pop music.
It did! And, I think you see that same pattern today.
What do you mean?
Well, Taylor Swift was a lot more country music when she started. And, she's gradually become more and more pop music.
