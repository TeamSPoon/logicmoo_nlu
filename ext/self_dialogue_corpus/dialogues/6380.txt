Hi, are you a fan of the Pixar Disney movies?
Yes, I love them! They are so emotional.
Yeah some of them have such tear-jerking moments. It's quite emotional for a kids movie.
I saw "Inside Out" recently and I was bawling my eyes out.
Were you crying at the part with the imaginary friend, Bing Bong?
Oh, don't even bring that up. You are going to make me cry right now!
I teared up at that part. The more emotional part was when Riley came home from running away.
It's such a powerful movie.
Yes, I really hope they make a sequel.
That would be great. The teaser about puberty at the end was great.
