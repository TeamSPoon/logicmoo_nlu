What is your favorite type of horror film?
I really enjoy psychological thrillers, what about you?
I like suspenseful horror films.
I really dont enjoy those, they make my anxiety pretty bad. Does that affect you ?
Not really, I find that when I watch movies I like to shut my brain off and fully immerse myself.
That makes sense, I wish I could do that!
I'm sure you can, it just takes practice. A small glass of wine doesnt hurt either. Whats your favorite psycho thriller?
I think silence of the lambs. It's interesting and slightly difficult to follow but worth it.
I've heard everyone say great things but i've actually never watched!
Wow! You must, it's a classic.
