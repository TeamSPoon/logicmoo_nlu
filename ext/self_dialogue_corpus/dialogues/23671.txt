What kind of movies are your favorite?
I think I'd have to say horror.
You mean scary or thrillers?
Scary ones of course.
Who is your favorite scary character?
I love Freddie.
Do you actually mean Freddy Krueger?
Yes. I think he's great.
Wow, you like a killer. That's funny.
Well not only can he scare you, he can also make you laugh.
I didn't think they were funny.
No not the movies. He did have so many great one liners in the movies.
I don't remember any.
Can't think of all of them off the top of my head, but he did.
He was a creepy dude.
That was sort of neat how it all linked together with the kids parents.
Yes, it was.
They did some good special effects in those movies.
I wonder how long it took to do his face makeup.
Do you think it could've been a mask?
