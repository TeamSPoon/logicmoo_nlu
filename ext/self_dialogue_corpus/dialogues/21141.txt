Have  you  seen  Daddy's  home ?
Who all is  in it ?
The main star  is  Mark  Wahlberg  .
Is there anyone he  fights  with ?
He  has some  issues   with  Will  Ferrell
What  are  they  fighting  about ?
Will  marries    Marks  ex-wife  and  adopts  his  kids
And  I take it  Mark is the  bad  guy ?
He is   to  some point  but  its  more  funny pranks  he  pulls  to  try and  win his  family back
Does he get them back
No, He  actually helps  Will  become  a better step dad
Is  there  a  huge  twist  anywhere in it ?
The  twist  I  really like is when you find out  that one  kids  bully is  a girl
Why is  the  girl a  bully
She has  a  crush on  Wills   son  and is  very young
Does it have  a  happy  ending
It  ends well but leaves it open for  a part  two
How  do they  do that  ?
Well  Mark  falls in love  and it winds up his  exwife has a  jealous  husband  just  like how the movie  starts
So its one of those  films   that goes  full  circle ?
