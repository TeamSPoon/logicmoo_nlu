Do you think Rey will always be good?
I sure hope so! She has a lot of potential!
And that potential can be used for good or for evil!
Pretty much what happened to Anakin!
What happened to him again?
He was the chosen one, but chose the dark side
Why would he do that?
He wanted to avenge Padme's death
Who made him join the dark side?
Darth Sidious did, he offered him the power!
