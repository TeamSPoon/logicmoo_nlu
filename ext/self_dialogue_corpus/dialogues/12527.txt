Do you think Kylo Ren can be forgiven for killing Han Solo?
He slayed his father. It seems like he's made his choice.
Yeah, but he felt conflicted about it. Maybe he'll turn out to be a good guy.
He seems to have taken a side in the conflict decisively, though.
But he was just being manipulated by Snoke.
And Darth Vader was just being manipulated by Palpatine.
Darth Vader died in redemption.
He only saw redemption in death, so maybe that's what will happen to Kylo Ren.
I could see him sacrificing himself to make up for it.
That would leave the Solo family with no surviving members, though.
