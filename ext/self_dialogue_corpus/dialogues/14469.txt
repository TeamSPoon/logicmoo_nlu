DId you see the cavs game?
yeah they blew the celtics out!
biggest loss in lebron james history which is crazy
Yeah seems like a collision course with the warriors is bound to happen
Yep and also I read that Isaiah Thomas is out the rest of the playoffs
Yep something to do with his kneee
Yeah makes tonight's game not as interesting anymore
Yep I might just go outside insetaed of watching
yep gotta wait for that finals rematch
Who do you think wins?
If if was a betting man id say the warriors but I really want the cavs to win
I also want the cavs to win and they are on a tear!
yeah they are!
I think it comes down to game 7 and who wants it more between these 2 teams
Yeah I just think that the cavs are a little better and more of a team than the warriors
Yeah i can see that. Most of them have been playing together for a while
Lets just hope zaza pachulia doesn't hurt anyone else!
I hope he doesn't the warriors always get lucky with injuries to the other team!
Yep the year they won all pg's they played against missed most games in the playoffs
Yeah that is just unfair.
