The most glorious feeling in the world is the feeling you get on Sunday morning in September.
Are you a church-goer?
Church is great and all, but that's not what I'm talking about.
What are you alking about?
The sun rises on a field of green, coveed with cold, crisp morning dew.
That is nice.  Nature...
That's not what I'm talking about.
What?
The smell of fresh cut grass, and a wide open field, quietly waiting for the violence of the day.
Now you've lost me...
A line of cars filled with painted faces, coolers full of refreshments, and RVs stocked with bar-b-que.
The county fair?
A parking lot filled with people, anticipating the excitement about to unfold, and the smell of sunscreen and muscle cream in the air.
A sporting event?
Not just a sporting event...THE SPORTING EVENT!
The Olympics?
And the growing creshendo of voices, enthusiatically calling, "Let the game begin!"
Football!
Not just football...NFL football!  My "raison d'Ãªtre!"
A chill just went down my spine!
