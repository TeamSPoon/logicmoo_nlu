What movie do you want to see most the rest of the year?
I dont really have anything specific I want to see
How about the newest Thor?
Not really I think thats the weakest in the MCU.
I loved it and his character.
I Just dont see it being relatable.
How about Guardians of the Galaxy?
Well I already saw that cause it came out.
Yeah forgot about that.
I think Baywatch might be funny.
The Rock is so boring as an actor.
Did you like Fate of the Furious?
No I think it sort of ran its course.
That franchise is never going away.
It will if people stop going.
People will never stop going.
Vin Diesel is a campy actor.
Hes your typical meathead. Hollywood loves those types.
At what point do we  stop watching those kinds of movies?
Never. People always love those sorts.
