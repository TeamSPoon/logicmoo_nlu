Were you a Twilight fan?
No I wasn't!
I'm not either, but I've seen the movies.
What did you think of them?  I saw just one.
I admittedly watched them for laughs, but now I'm left with so many thoughts and questions.  Which one did you see?
I saw the last one.  Breaking Dawn Part II.
That was a weird one.  It didn't have to be in two parts.
Definitely not.  But it's the trend that movies like Hunger Games and even Harry Potter are doing.
It's a money grab.
I couldn't stand Jacob in that movie.
Yea, they ran out of things for him to do.
The whole movie, he was just really angry and snotty.
He kept interfering in everything the main characters were doing.
By the way, how do they explain why the werewolves in this movie always have clothes on after transformation.
Good question.  All their jean shorts disappear when they turn into wolves, but they're back when they become human?
Admittedly, the action scenes in this movie were okay.
I agree.  It was really violent for a children's movie.
Especially when the sex scenes were toned down.  Why violence but draw the line at sex.
There were way more inconsistencies in this movie than I can keep track of.
It was definitely better than the other Twilight movies, but that isn't saying too much.
