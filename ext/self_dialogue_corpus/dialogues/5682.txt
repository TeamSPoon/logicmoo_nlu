Seen any good Disney movies recently?
Yeah I saw Pocohantas.
Oh that movie is wonderful. I miss that movie.
Me too. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid.
Is that your favorite disney movie?
Yes for sure.
I miss Toy Story 2.
That movie is also amazing. I love Tim Allen in that.
Tim is hilarious.
I also think Tom Hanks does a great job.
