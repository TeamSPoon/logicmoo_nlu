I can't believe it's been twenty years since Hercules came out in theaters.
I know, it seems like time has flown by since then. I remember seeing it when it came out.
Me, too. I liked Danny DeVito's character in it, the satyr.
I think my favorite part was when the little kid is in trouble and his friend says, "Someone call IXII!"
Oh, yeah! Except wasn't that not really kids, but a trap by Hades?
True. It was his two little sidekicks, Pain and Panic.
Right. That was when Hercules was still trying to get some fame.
Yes, trying to defeat the Hydra.
Before he went from "zero to hero."
Nice. I like that song!
