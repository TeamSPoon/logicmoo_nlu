Are you going to watch movies tonight?
I want to, but I've seen all the new ones. Do you have any recommendations?
Have you ever seen the movie "Drive"?
No. Is it a new one?
It's kind of old. It came out in 2011.
I don't know if I've seen that one. Who's in it?
It stars Ryan Gosling as a getaway driver for robberies and he also is a stunt driver in Hollywood.
That's interesting. I don't think I saw that. How is the plot?
It's a typical plot. The driver falls in love with a girl and has to protect her and her family from some mafioso guys.
It's a simple I idea, but I like those kinds of plots. Is the acting good?
It has a pretty decent cast, and they do a pretty good job. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are the mafioso guys.
Albert Brooks? That's different.
Yeah. The movie has a very unique feel to it.
How so?
The music score is more dramatic and has a retro/European feel to it rather than the typical stuff.
That could be good or not. I would have to hear it to appreciate it.
Exactly. The characters are not the typical tough guys or action heros. They seem more like real people, which makes it a better movie.
That sounds good.
Also, the tenderness and shyness of the main character toward the female love interest is unique and feels genuine.
It sounds like a really interesting movie.
