Are there any good movies out in theaters right now??
I recently just say Guardians of the Galaxy 2! It was so good.
I'll have to go see that. I recently saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean.
What did you think of it??
I wasn't a huge fan of this one, this is probably the last of the series.
It wouldn't surprise me either. Have you been to the Alamo Drafthouse??
Not yet, I've heard great things about it though.
It's so awesome, you can order dinner and drinks as you watch the movie.
That sounds amazing! What a great idea.
It's a great way to enjoy the movies, a little bit pricier though.
Well, it is dinner, drinks, and a movie all in one.
You're so right. Did you see they added Moana to Netflix??
Yes! I haven't had time to re-watch it yet.
I've already played it twice since it's been added!!
You're do love your animations, and it's a great one.
That little chicken is hilarious.
You know Trolls was recently added as well, right??
Of course! I've already played it, but it's not my favorite.
It was pretty cute and colorful though.
This is true, probably geared more towards the younger kids.
