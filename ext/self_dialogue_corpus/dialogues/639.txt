Are you ready for the pre-season game?
For sure.
I am too man.Cam going to kill it this year.
Dude you still keep hope alive don't you.
Ah yes!
Those Panthers slipping though.
No, No, No that's your team.
Don't be talking about my Patriots.
Ya'll going down hard this season.
Why do you say that?
Tom Brady is going to choke on the field.
Brady never chokes.
We can make a bet if you want to.
That's not a problem.
How about $100 if they make it to the Super Bowl.
That's a deal.
If they win, what should we bet?
$250 if they win.
That's a solid bet dude.
Okay then, it will be like taking money from a baby!
