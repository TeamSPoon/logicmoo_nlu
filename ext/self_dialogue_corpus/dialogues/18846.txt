What do you think of King of Limbs?
Is that a band?
No, no. I mean the album by Radiohead.
When did it come out?
They put it out in 2007.
Oh, right. I was really excited when it came out. I'm a huge fan. But it left me dissapointed.
Really?
Yeah, I didn't love it.
Why's that?
It was jarring. It wasn't the band that I recognized.
I get that. But I was listening to it recently and was really digging it.
But it can't hold up with their other stuff, can it?
No it really can. Some of the tunes on there are every bit as good as their best songs.
Now you have me excited. Which songs should I listen to again?
I would say you should listen to "Seperator" first.
Okay. Then what?
Well, then after that you'll know that you were wrong before, and want to listen to the whole album.
We'll see about that.
We will. Tell me when you listen to it.
I will. Thanks for the recommendation.
