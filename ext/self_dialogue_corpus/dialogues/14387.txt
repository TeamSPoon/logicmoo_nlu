What do you think of Westbrook?
He is good
I agree. It's too bad there is a lot of negativity there.
No, it's not. He will grow out of it.
Yeah, I guess. I was sad about the split with Kevin Durant.
Same here. They were great friends.
I hope the Spurs get Leonard back.
I don't think he will be back this year.
How do you feel about the draft?
Ball will go second I think.
I think that Fultz guy will go first.
What team do you think will get better?
The Timberwolves will hopefully get better.
Wiggins is really good.
I'm a big Suns fan, so hopefully they draft someone good.
I'm sure they will.
Who is your pick next year?
I think the Spurs will win it all.
That would be cool. They haven't won it in awhile.
Well, if Pachulia is in the league, anything can happen.
