What's going on?
I don't know, everyone is gathered by the screen.
Is that a movie trailer?
I guess it is, what is it for?
I can't see from here.
Oh, I see it. It's the trailer for the Wonder Woman movie.
She's finally getting a movie?!
Yeah, looks like it.
Wow, I didn't think it would ever happen.
You excited for it? It looks pretty good.
I've been excited for it for years!
Really?
I never thought she would get one!
Well, it certainly has taken a long time.
The longest. Even Spiderman got his movies.
Then he got reboots of those movies.
Ugh, I know. How stupid.
For real, they all sucked too.
They really did. I'm excited!
Me too!
