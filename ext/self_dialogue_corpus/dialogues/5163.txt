Every time I watch The Fox and The Hound I cry.
I cry every time I watch Bambi.
They are both such sad Disney movies.
Let's talk about some happy movies.
Okay. Alice in Wonderland always manages to lift my spirits.
I like when the White Rabbit is running late. That scene always makes me laugh.
I like when the Flowers call Alice a weed, and she is so offended.
I know. The way the Flower says it so matter of factly is what makes it so funny.
My other favorite part has got to be the mad tea party.
The Mad Hatter is so funny. He is my favorite character.
