Do you like Fall Out Boy?
Yeah! Their album From Under The Cork Tree is my favorite.
Me too! What is your favorite track from the album?
I think that Dance, Dance is the best.
Really? My favorite is Sugar We're Going Down
I love that one too. Good choice.
I heard they have a new song coming out called Champion
I just heard about that too. What do you think it will sound like?
It will probably have lots of guitar and heavy drums.
I hope the lyrics in the song are good too!
