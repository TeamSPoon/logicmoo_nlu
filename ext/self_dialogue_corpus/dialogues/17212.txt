This album seems pretty good, despite it's instrumentals being mediocre.
I don't know, This beat seems really good to me!
Well, I researched them on some of their collabs. It appears that Green has some sort of hearing issue.
Oh really, who's Green?
He's the drum player of alt-J.
His drum skills are pretty meticulous!
Yeah, it appears despite that he can't hear, he overcame that obstacle with his drum playing!
Hmm, I might start to like this band more now!
How? What's getting you into this?
I actually used to play the drums when I was little, but stopped due to studies and other priorities.
Hmmm, maybe this can be a breakthrough for you!
Nahh, I wouldn't say for sure, I do like this music a little more now!  This is Indie-Pop, right?
Yeah! Say, about instruments, what do you think about the lead guitarist's choice of music?
Ummm, not much of a guitar fan. (shrugs)
Well, I think he played that solo at the interlude pretty well.
What the hell's an interlude?
It's sort of like a beginning, but short song to an album that introduces the mood and kind of shows what the purpose of the album is meant for.
meh, I don't care as much.
Well, let's talk about something else now, then.
Okay, how about what to buy for your girlfriend this coming Valentine's Day? Like a black full length fox fur coat? Or maybe a full length coyote or lynx fur coat?
