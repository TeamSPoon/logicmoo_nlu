do you like rap music
no I do not
why
there is too much nasty language in that music
there is some that does not have that
I did used to listen way back in the 80's
really who did you listen to
I listened to Run DMC
who else
The Beastie Boys
what is your favorite Beastie Boys song
I think no sleep til Brooklyn
wow that is an old one
yes 80's it is considered the birth of rap before it became talking with a beat
I like all kinds of rap, I dont mind the lyrics
you should mind the lyrics, the lyrics say something about who you are
what do you mesn
if you listen to songs with violent lyrics and cursing every other word, thats self explainitary
I do not agree
listen to some old rap it is great and has a better message
