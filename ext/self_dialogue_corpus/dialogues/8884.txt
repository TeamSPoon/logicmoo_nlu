So, let's talk some more rock music trivia.
Oh, you never get tired of this, do you?
No, I just find there's so many neat little factoids out there, it's fun to talk about.
Okay, what do you got?
Well, you know the song "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynard Skynard?
Of course, everyone knows that one!
Well, there's a part in the beginning where the guy says, "Turn it up!"
Okay, yeah, I remember that.
Well, that's actually the singer talking to the sound engineer to turn up the music, but they thought it sounded so cool they actually left it in the song.
Really?  That's pretty neat.
