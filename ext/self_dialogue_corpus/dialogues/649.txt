I'm thinking of volunteering at the Superbowl this year.
You'd be great. You're a real NFL aficionado.
True, I hope to God the Vikings make it this year.
Don't hold your breath on that one. Just enjoy volunteering for its own sake.
I don't know where they'll put me. I'd love to be one who takes visitors around and show them our city.
Pray that the weather isn't terrible. You just never know with Minnesota.
True, it could be 20 below zero, or have 3 feet of snow or be 50 degrees and sunny.
Or you could have all three of those things in the course of three days. Weather here is unpredictable.
I wonder who will play the half time show this year.
I seem to recall hearing that someone was signed but for the life of me I can;t remember who.
I'm so excited for the first game of the season. I can't wait to get in the new stadium.
It looks great on TV so in person it must be really nice.
I want to see those expensive suites,
My cousins buy season tickets and when they had an open house for the new stadium my cousin was walking along the side of the building and randomly tried to open a side door.
What happened?
It opened. He walked right in and slipped into one of the fancy suites where the beautiful people were having a party.
They didn't kick him out?
Nope, he blended right in.
They make you go through metal detectors but don't lock the side doors?
I know, right? A couple weeks later was when those protesters got in and climbed into the rafters. They better up security.
