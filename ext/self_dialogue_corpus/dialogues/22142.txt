Have you seen any Will Ferrell movies?
Who hasn't, he is a great actor.
Step Brothers is my favorite.
Mine too, that movie is just so funny.
I tease my boys that they will be just like them.
That's funny, a lot of kids stay home longer now.
Yea, the part when they are showing the music video and the boat crashes is funny.
Yes and then when they get home and argue with the father.
That was great. Another good one is Anchorman.
Yes. Ron Burgundy is a great character.
All of those actors just work so well together.
Yes, I liked the second one too.
Yea, it was funny, but I think the first was better.
Did you see The Other Guys?
Yes, another great movie.
Mark Wahlberg is great in that with him.
Yea, he is a good actor too.
Weird how Will Ferrell has done so many good movies and seems to look and act the same like forever.
Yes, he deserves so many awards for his characters.
Yes he also produces movies too, he's very smart.
