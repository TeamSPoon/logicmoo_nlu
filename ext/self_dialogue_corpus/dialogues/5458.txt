Did you see the new Cars 3 movie?
Yes, I saw it last weekend.  It was Awesome!
I know, I loved it too!
Cruz Ramirez is my new favorite character.
I like Cruz too, but Lightning McQueen is still my favorite!
The demolition derby scene was the best part of the movie.
I agree, I could watch that scene over and over.
Which Disney Cars movie is your favorite?
Well I liked Cars 3 better than Cars 2, but in my opinion, the first Cars movie is the best one of all.
Yes, me too!  Nothing compares to the first Disney Cars movie.
