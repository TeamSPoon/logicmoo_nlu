Did you ever see Death Proof?
What is that?
It's a Tarentino film.  A guy is using a car to kill people.
Oh, he's chasing them down in that black car, right?
Yeah!  That's the one.
Sure, I've seen it, but it's been a while.
What's your favorite part?
I like the whole second half.  You know when the girls are chasing the guy down.
Yeah I was freaking out when that girl was on the hood!
Did you know she is a stunt woman in real life?
