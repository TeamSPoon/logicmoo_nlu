Do you like Pop Music?
I do. I think I like Brittney Spears the most.
Really?? I loved her in the 90s, but not so much now.
Yea, I hate to admit it, but I like her old stuff and her new stuff.
Yea. She does have some good new songs. Oh, and she is pretty.
True. But what about Justin Bieber? You like him?
His music is okay, but I don't like him as a person.
Yea. I'm kind of the same way, but I also don't like his music.
Yea, I just wish he was a better role model.
You're telling me!!! He is too much like a spoiled rich kid.
