Do you prefer superhero movies with DC or Marvel?
That is a tough one it depends on what characters.
I agree, I love Batman when it comes to DC and Superman of course.
Yes and I love the X-Men movies when it comes to Marvel.
It is a tough call, but I am really looking forward to finally seeing Wonderwoman.
I haven't see it yet either but heard they did a good job on depicting her character.
Who is your favorite Marvel character?
I am a big fan of the X-Men and have to say Professor X or Rogue.
I really like Storm and Wolverine.
Have you seen Logan?
