What rap music have you been listening to lately?
I have been hearing a lot of Stevie Stone.
I have never heard of him.
His Level Up album is quite decent.
What is your favorite song on it?
I like the song "Another Level".
Should I check it out?
Oh definitely, it has a great sound.
I will go ahead and buy the album if I like it.
Awesome!
