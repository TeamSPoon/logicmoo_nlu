Yea, I agree that the Seahawks have been trending downward, but they are still really good.
Yea, they still have Russell Wilson.
Would you want to count on him?
Yea, I think so. He has proven enough.
Yea, he seems to improvise a lot, but he is very good at it.
Yea, when their play breaks down, he's great at making things happen.
Yea, well he is a former baseball player. He is quick.
Yea, thats the beauty of having a mobile quarterback.
Yea, the only bad part is that it could potentially expose them to injury.
Yea, it could, but he has been fairly lucky so far.
Yea, I agree. Thats the good part.
Yea, its nice.
Yea, I do not even know who their backup is though if he were to get injured.
Me either. Thats a scary thought.
Yea, it absolutely is. They better hope that doesn't become reality.
Yea, I hope not. He's a good player.
Yea and they need him to win.
Its the Russell and defense show in Seattle usually.
Yea, thats how they win. Its refreshing.
Yea, we'll see if they are able to keep doing it.
