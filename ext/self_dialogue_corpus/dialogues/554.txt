Have you ever been to an NFL game?
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes, a few. Why haven't you gone?
I hate crowds, I hate drunk rednecks yelling, I hate the lack of space, the body heat...
Geez, quit hating.
...the cheap beer, the anti-craft beer culture, the fact that they get fined when they score a touchdown, the parking...
Okay, I get it.
So what was your experience like?
We had really good seats in the 30 yard line, about halfway in the bottom section.
Great view?
Spectacular!
So, big question: how much were the tickets?
$150 each.
See, that's another reason why I don't go. I like not going bankrupt watching a bunch of spoiled children play a game.
Where do you watch the NFL then?
Rarely will I go to a bar. Usually at my home or a friends'. Small and quiet.
Yeah, the stadiums are nothing like that.
Plus don't they take about an hour to leave?
Depends, but yeah.
I love watching NFL games, but I love peace and quiet more.
