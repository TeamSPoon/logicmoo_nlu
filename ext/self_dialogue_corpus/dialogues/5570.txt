Did you hear that Moana is on Netflix now?
No I didn't! That's exciting!
I agree, I've been wanting to see it.
Even better, we can watch it at home now!
Would you like to watch it together tonight?
Yes, I would enjoy that. I've heard the music is very good.
It is, Moana's song sounds good.
I want to hear the song the crab sings.
Oh yeah, I think it's called Shiny.
This is gonna be so fun!
