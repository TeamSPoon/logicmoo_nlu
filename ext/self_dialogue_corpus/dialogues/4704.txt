Did you see the cubs game?
Oh yeah, It was great.
Did you see how they won the world series.
Yes, I was very happy that they won.
I think It was about time right.
I think so I mean It's been long over due.
I was at home when I flipped the TV and saw they were playing.
This was so cool I started watching and felt glad they would win.
That is nice I am so happy they won!
Well it's about time they won.
I know it took forever for them to win.
I can't believe it started to rain and it went into overtime.
What a world series.
I thought for sure the Indians would take it.
I know right I thought the same thing.
good thing they did not win.
Yeah, Go cubs you earned that victory.
Yes it was a well deserved trophy.
I love baseball season in the summer.
I like baseball quite a bit myself.
