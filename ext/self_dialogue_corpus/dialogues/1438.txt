Yea, I would never count out Brady.
Yea, didn't they sign a top flight CB this year too.
Yea, I forget his name, but I think they signed the best one on the market.
I don't know how they do it, but they just find ways to keep winning.
Yea, they have been one franchise that has consistently won.
Yea, they sure have the recipe for success.
Yea, them a green bay to a lesser extent seem to have found the winning formula.
Yea, well the key is that you have to build through the draft.
I agree. Ask the redskins how it goes when you don't.
Yea, they would tell you a whole story. They have enough experience.
Yea, some of these general managers need to realize that you cannot build through free agency.
I agree. That is for patching specific needs.
The draft is where you need to build your team.
I agree and when some teams start to realize that, they may see more success.
Well, this one is directed right at you Washington.
Yea, I do not know what they are doing.
Me either, but Cleveland better start taking advantage of their picks because they have a lot of them.
Yea, maybe its finally the time to start turning it around.
That or they will re-draft Brady Quinn or something.
Yea, they haven't been the best in the draft.
