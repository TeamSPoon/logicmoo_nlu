Taylor Swift has won so many awards.
I know. Isn't it insane?
Yes. She is very talented.
I wish her and Kanye West would get over their arguments.
I agree. I think they just both need to move on.
Yeah, but it does seem like Kanye is always getting into an argument with someone.
It's hard to like his music when he acts the way he does.
I agree, and it's disappointing because his last album was pretty good.
Oh, you mean The Life of Pablo?
Yeah, that's it.
I haven't heard much of that one, but I did like his album Yeezus.
I think that's the one he's most recognized for.
I don't know. It seems like to me like he only has a few popular singles here and there.
I guess you're right. His music isn't really played on the radio.
Exactly. I can only remember Gold Digger being played on the radio and that was a long time ago.
It's been over a decade since it was released.
Wow, time really does fly by.
It sure does.
I used to love Gold Digger when I was younger, but I'm not so sure I would like it now.
I don't know how I feel about it now either.
