There are some songs and albums so beautifully recorded, I can't think of any way they could be improved.
Like what?
Well, like "Riders On The Storm" by the Doors. The sound levels and rain effects are just perfect, nothing to tweek.
The Beatles and lots of other people thought "Pet Sounds" by the Beach Boys was amazing, perfect.
My sister loves the way Phoebe Snow's albums sound.
Like on "Two-Fisted Love", "Poetry Man", and "Solid Ground". Those were very well done.
Oh, and Jethro Tull's "Living In The Past". The violins in the back.
I noticed that the sound levels on Jethro Tull's stuff is exactly the same volume as classical music.
How do you mean?
Well, I noticed it years ago, when I was running a Jethro Tull CD through a graphics equalizer.
You weren't making a bootleg tape, were you?
No, just recording it to a cassette for my own use, in the car.
So the sound waves, the recording levels, were similar to classical music?
Yes. Extremely quiet, very low, even for the "louder" songs, like "Aqualung". I had to turn up the sound quite a bit.
I remember Jethro Tull had some of the earliest CDs, with all kinds of defective quality, mis-printings.
Wrong labels, and tracks running together, I think I remember.
I recall buying a Steve Miller CD in 1990, and it was actually some kind of Japanese rap or something in the package.
All of the B52 albums I own have very, very loud sound levels!
Oh, that's right. I remember trying to copy "Revolution Earth", and the sound level indicators going up into the red.
Probably a lot less tape hiss if you start with a really, really loud original signal!
