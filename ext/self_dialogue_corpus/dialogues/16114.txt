You like the blues?
Love the blues.
B B King,Clapton. They are great.
Sad to see BB King pass though.
Yes it was.
ERIC Clapton is maybe the best guitarist still.
He is outstanding.
Ever see him live?
Yes I have. Great show.
I love Layla!
One of my favorites too.
He sometimes plays it slow and sometimes fast.
Depends on the night I guess.
Or it depends on the tour.
That could be also.
How about Cocaine.
Wow,does that rock live.
A pure classic from him.
I've heard him play,that for over ten minutes at times.
Pure guitar solos and riffs.
