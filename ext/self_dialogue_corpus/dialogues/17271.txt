Who is the greatest artist of all time in your opinion
The Beatles hands down
The Beatles? why do you thik that
What do you mean why because they were the greatest band ever and I thik the highest selling band i think to date they have sold over a billion records
So have Michael Jackson
no Michael Jacksn only sold 750 million
well he is still the greatest artist of all time when you think of the best you think of michael not the beatles
I think A lot of people would disagree
because your talking about album sales what else did they do
They started it They were the first band that really took off and was loved all around the world
idk about around the world maybe overseas where they was from i dont really care for much of there music but i like john lennon tho he was the best one out the group
So why are you saying michael jackson is the best artist then what are your reasons
Well for starters there was nobod bigger than him and his fame never really dies like the beatles He was a stand out artist and unique there was never another like him
I agree with that but i still think the beatles changed the world and music
Maybe for that time period yes but its not lasting like michael is his music lives on in the artist today everybody wanted to be like him no mater whatkind of music they liked
okay the same with the beatles
name one artist of today that said they beatles inspired them to do what they do
The Foo Fighters
I said of today
They are of today they are still coming out with music
