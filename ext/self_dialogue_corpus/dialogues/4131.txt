Did you know Kristen Stewart was in Panic Room?
I didn't know that.  I'm not a fan of hers though.
Do you remember the movie?
I have seen it.   I can kind of tell you what it's about.
I guess you wouldn't have known her enough to spot her.
No, it was before Twilight and everything.
Yeah, it was early in her career.
Who else was in that movie?
I think it was Jodie Foster.
Okay, that sounds right.
