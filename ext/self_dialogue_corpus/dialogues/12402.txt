If you watched all of the movies, which order would you view them?
Ah, that's a highly debated question.  I guess I would go chronologically.
Really?  Interesting.
Yeah.  I think I would want to see the rise and fall of Anakin before I watched the stories of his children.
See, now I'm more apt to go in order of release.
Really?
Yes.  So, I would stars with Star Wars, then Empire Strikes Back, then Return of the Jedi, then I would...
I get it.  Then you would move on to Episodes 1, 2, and 3.
Exactly.  And then I'd finish with The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
Well, luckily there is no wrong way to watch the series.
