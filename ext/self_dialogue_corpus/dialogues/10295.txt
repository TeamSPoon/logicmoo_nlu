What was the weakest Action movies of all time?
Weakest?
Yeah. The most lame action movie.
That's hard to say because if the action is weak, then it is no longer considered an action movie.
Good point.
However, if I had to choose just one, I would choose "The Last Action Hero"
Was that the one with Arnold?
Yah. Pump me up.
Why that movie?
It had seriously lame action scenes, totally unbelievable villians, and yet it still had the guts to put the word "Action" in the title!
