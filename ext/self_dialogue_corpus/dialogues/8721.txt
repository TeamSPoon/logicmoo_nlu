My favorite grunge band was Nirvana.
Mine, too.  My husband and my song is "Smells Like Teen Spirit."
You know that's a deodorant, right?  How'd that happen.
We were dating, he was at my apartment and the video came on MTV.  He was like: "Boom. This is our song."
That's kinda crazy, but cool.  What's your favorite album.
Nevermind, but I have them all.  Kobain's voice was so edgy and angsty.
I miss Curt Kobain.  Wonder what he'd be doing now.
I wonder.  Don't really follow the other band members.
Classic rock is the best!
When did 1991 become 'classic'?  Dude, we're old!
