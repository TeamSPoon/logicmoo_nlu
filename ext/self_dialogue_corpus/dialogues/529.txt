How do the Colts look this year.
Well, It depends on what you think Luck will do.
I think Luck has a big year.
I do too. I bet they win the division.
I want more than the division.
What do you mean?
I want them in the Super Bowl.
They have the talent.
I think they are due.
I miss Peyton Manning still.
Well, who wouldn't?
It's a shame he didn't retire a Colt.
I agree with that.
But, I understand the reasoning.
Lets hope Luck brings a trophy home.
I think they win twelve games this year.
I think that's a possibility.
I worry about the defense.
I think it'll be alright.
Let's get season tickets!
