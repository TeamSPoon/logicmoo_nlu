Are you a Marvel fan or DC?
I like both but I prefer Marvel.
Same here. What's your favorite Marvel movie?
I would have to say Captain America: Civil War.
Oh really? Mine too! I loved how they introduced Black Panther, and I can't wait for that movie.
Me neither. Did you know T'Challa has the highest IQ of all the Marvel Universe except Reed Richards?
Wow, and that's a big deal because he's super smart.
I know, and he's richer than Tony Stark.
Right, I did know that. That battle scene at the airport at the end of the movie was epic.
Yes it was! That's my favorite part. I must have rewound that part at least 3 times the first time I watched it.
