What is your opinion of the Washington Redskins?
I don't have much of an opinion on them.
How about an opinion on Kirk Cousins?
Could have played better this season.
It is never good to have less touchdowns and more interceptions.
Exactly I wonder if the Redskins will give him another chance.
They should give him another season.
Yeah I mean he did put up more then 20 touchdowns the past two years.
Even if he did that again while lowering his interceptions that would be great progress.
He must be wanting to do that.
Hopefully he works really hard this offseason.
I am sure he will put in a lot of effort this offseason.
I hope he does especially if he gets traded to a team in need of a Quarterback.
Yeah if the Redskins snub him he can get his revenge with a great season somewhere else.
I would love to see that next year.
To be honest I will watch Redskins games when I can.
Same here I usually try to watch as many games as I can.
We are both big football fans.
Well maybe the Redskins will win the Superbowl next year.
If they do that will be great for the city of Washington!
