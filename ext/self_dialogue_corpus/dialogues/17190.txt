Aerosmith was a great rock band once in a while ago.
Yeah they went through too many vocal changes.
Steven Tyler has always been their singer.
But his voice changed considerably in the 90s.
Crazy was a great song from that era
Yeah he had his daughter Liv in the video.
He featured her as much as he could.
Do you think it was on purpose?
Absolutely but who wouldnt do that?
You are probably right.
I liked the song Pink they had as well.
I dont know about that.
It was light hearted.
Yeah but it lacked lyrical punch
Not all songs can be operatic like you want.
I am not saying that, I just wish it was a bit fuller.
OK I see what you are saying.
But their songs from the 70s were not that bad either.
Yeah they were true classic rock
Once they collaborated with Run DMC they went with a more popular sound
