The Sound of Music was on the other night.  I love that movie.
I saw it.  It's on every year around Easter, and I usually watch it again.
Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria, and Christopher Plummer makes a great Captain von Trapp.
Yes, I think the casting was perfect.  Even the children were cast well.
I'm a big fan of Charmian Carr as Liesl, the oldest daughter.
My favorite child character is probably Kim Karath as Gretl.
Oh, yes, she was adorable.  I read that Julie Andrews had to jump in and save her in the scene where the boat tipped over and the children fell in because she couldn't swim.
I didn't know that.  I really like all of the scenes with the children in them.
Yes, the scenes with the children were always good.  I love it when Maria teaches them to sing.
Yes, I like that too.  What is your favorite scene?
My favorite is probably when Maria is walking down the aisle to get married.  The church is beautiful and the perspective from above is stunning.
Yes, her wedding gown is gorgeous.
I also like the scene in the gazebo where Liesl is dancing with Rofle.
That is one of the best scenes in the movie.  "I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen," is an awesome song.
I really love all the songs in the movie, but that one is one of my favorites.
I really like the scene where Captain von Trapp and Maria dance a folk dance in the courtyard.
Yes, I think that is the first moment when they are aware that they have feelings for each other.
And the children seem to be in favor of the match.
The ending scene when they are climbing the mountain into Switzerland is pretty moving.
Yes, I think the real life von Trapp family had to escape Austria in a similar fashion.
