Have you seen the newest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Deadmen Tell Not Tales? I haven't seen it yet, but I want to! Have you seen it?
Yes! It was amazing! Although when is Johnny Depp not amazing?
That's good to hear! Sometimes when they have so many sequels, the movies start lacking story lines and action. I'm always unsure about seeing them.
No! It did seem a bit long, but there was tons of action in the movie!
Is it all the same actors/characters?
Yes! All of those and some new ones, but most importantly . . . Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom!
Yes, they are the most important ones . . . so handsome. Both of them!
Plus some of the favorites like Barbossa and Captain Salazar are in the movie and the special effects are out of this world!
It really is amazing how they are able to create the ghost pirates. They're so creepy and realistic. Gives me shivers down my spine!
Yes! It really pulls you in and makes you feel like you''re there! Swashbuckling pirates looting, killing, and taking over the sea!
Do you know when the movie came out? I'm wondering if I should just wait and buy it on dvd to add to my collection.
I think it came out toward the end of May. Honestly, I'd still go see it in the theaters and then buy it on dvd when its available. The theater experience is like no other!
Yes, I suppose you do get more of the surround sound and quality picture in the theaters.
The critics didn't rate it that highly, but what do they know? lol
Right. Usually if they don't like a movie, I like it! lol
Exactly! I think the ending left it open to another sequel too!
No way! Wow! I wonder how many of these they're going to make?!
I would say that as long as it's selling and they can come up with a story line. Pirates of the Caribbean is huge at Disney World!
Very true and Johnny Depp has always done such a good job acting. If anyone could keep a movie going, it would be him for sure. I think I'll go see the movie tomorrow night! Thanks for the recommendation.
