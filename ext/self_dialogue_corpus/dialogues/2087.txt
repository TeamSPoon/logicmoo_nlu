I am simply dying to see these receivers get on the field for some football.
Honestly we are being spoiled rotten by the talent of receivers.
I would say we are in the midst of some of the best receiver play in recent history.
Definitely. You have Green, Beckham, Jones, Hopkins and so much more.
Who do you think is the best receiver in the league?
I definitely think it's a close call between Green and Julio. I would give the edge to Julio.
Does Julio get that edge over Green because of their playoff run?
To be honest yeah. Julio was completely unstoppable the entire playoffs.
That one catch in the Superbowl was freakish.
A man of his size shouldn't be able to do half the things that he does.
At his current pace he will be a Hall of Famer in no time.
He deserves it. He's a good guy and an even better player.
So you don't think DeAndre Hopkins is worthy of being number one?
I think it's just because they had Osweiler, so I can't give it to him despite it being out of his control.
I'm just playing devil's advocate. I believe Julio is the number one guy.
Yeah, I know. Also he's not that good with yards after the catch.
I believe after his huge season 2 or 3 years ago he said he needed to work on that.
He showed this season that he still needs to work on it.
He is too big to be so easy to take down. He could easily be the best if he fixes that.
That and gets an actual quarterback who gives him the ball endlessly.
