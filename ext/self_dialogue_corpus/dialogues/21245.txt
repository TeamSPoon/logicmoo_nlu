So, what would you say is one of your all time favorite horror films?
Shoot.. I think it'd be a tie between Evil Dead 2 and Nightmare on Elm Street 3.
What do you like about those movies?
Oh, well, Evil Dead 2 is one of the few movies I've ever seen that could combine horror and comedy os successfully without being too ridiculous.
Yeah, that did a pretty of it.
I mean, the way Ash throws off those one liners "Swallow this" was just awesome.
Course, you know my favorite.
Oh, yeah, "Groovy!"
Yeah, that's the one.
And let's not forgot one of the coolest things of all time, The chainsaw hand!
Oh, that is a classic!
Yeah, I know!  He has to cut off his own hand when it gets possessed, so, he's just, "Well, let's replace this with something."
Yeah, and he puts a chainsaw on it.
Oh, and speaking of possessed hands, the scene where his hand goes crazy and starts smashing plats over his head is funny as well.
Ah, that's a classic moment of cinema.
Oh, yeah.  You put this film on and you have an instant party movie.
I have to admit though, I didn't really like the ending at the time.
Oh yeah?
I mean, I was like, "Ahh, we went through all that, just for THAT to happen?"
You know, it's funny, I actually felt the same way about the first movie..
