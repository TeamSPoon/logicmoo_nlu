Did you ever seen "night of the living dead" ?
Oh, yeah.  That's a classic.
I got scared watching it as a child.
I didn't see it until I was an adult.
I snuck into the living room where my parents were watching it.
It would be pretty scarry for a kid.
It was.  I had nightmares for a long time after that.
Really, was it the zombie's climbing out of their graves like in Thriller?
Exactly, I still don't watch horror movies because of it.
Wow, I can't get enough of them.
