Have you watched any movies lately?
Well, last night I watched Howl's Moving Castle for the first time.
Howl's Moving Castle? I've never heard of it.
It's a Ghibli Studios animated movie.
Animated movie? So, it's for kids?
It would be good for kids, but also very entertaining for adults.
Okay. What's it about?
It's about a wizard, a cursed girl, a fire demon, a magical castle, and learning to love yourself and others.
Wow - that sounds pretty deep!
It is, but it's also a lot of fun.
So, are there any famous people behind the voices?
Absolutely! Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer, Billy Crystal, and Lauren Bacall are the voices of the main characters.
So, it's in English even though it's a Japanese movie?
Ghibli studios has made several movies with English-speaking viewers in mind.
So, no subtitles or delayed speech?
Nope. There are a couple of images of Japanese writing that has translation at the bottom of the screen, but otherwise, it looks like it was created in English from the start.
Fire demons and wizards sounds a little dark.
It does have some dark themes in it, but it is a colorful, fun, well-rounded movie.
Sounds fun - I'll check it out. What did you think of it?
I loved it! Let me know what you think when you see it!
