Did you like Clint Eastwoods spaghetti movies?
Oh I loved them all.
He sure had a lot of them.
He did and they are classics.
A fistful of dollars might have been the first one.
Could have been.
Came out in 1964 I think.
For a few dollars more came out the following year.
Can you name more?
Sure. Hang em high,high plains drifter,the good the bad the ugly.
There is still a lot more.
I know,incredible.
How about pale rider?
Another good one.
I think the unforgivin was his best.
His best spaghetti western?
Yes,but it still ranks up there with all of his movies.
I have to agree.
How about two mules for sister Sara.
Wow,yet another one.
