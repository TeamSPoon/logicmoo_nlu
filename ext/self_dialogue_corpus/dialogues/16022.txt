Have you heard of the band called Lucius?
No, I haven't who are they?
They're an indie pop group.  I think they came from New York.  Two women are the main singers and then there are two men playing the instruments.
Would I have heard them on the radio anytime?
No, I don't think so.  They have a few albums by now though.  Good Grief was really good.
Where did you hear of them?
I went to a Tegan and Sara concert and Lucius opened for them.  I was completely blown away.
I absolutely love Tegan and Sara.
You might like Lucius then.  They have some songs that are of a similar vibe.
Are they like Tegan and Sara's old stuff or their new pop stuff?
Sort of like a mixture.  Some of their songs have quite a pop vibe to them.
I'll have to check them out I guess.  They sound interesting.
I'm actually going to a concert of theirs in Louisville next month.  Do you want to come?
Yeah that sounds great!  Who else with be there?
I think K-Flay and Bleachers.
I love Bleachers!  I saw them live in Columbus about a year ago and they were amazing live.
Oh yeah was that the concert they did with Chvrches?
Yes that's the one.  Speaking of Chvrches I keep waiting for them to come out with a new cd.
Leave a Trace is definitely my favorite song by them.
I really liked The Mother We Share.  The lead singer has such a nice voice.
