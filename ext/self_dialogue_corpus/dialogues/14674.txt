Who's your top 5 NBA players right now?
I got LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook
What about Harden? He's the MVP and he can't make your top 5?
First, he's not the MVP, it's Westbrook. Second, his stats are inflated because of the system.
He's getting triple doubles left and right and he led his team to the third seed. It doesn't matter the system those are MVP credentials.
Are you kidding me the Rockets just let him the hog the ball every possession. It's easy to get stats like that.
You are crazy trying to tell me that Harden isn't the MVP because he's a ball hog then turn around and say the ultimate ball hog, Westbrook, is the MVP!
Westbrook has to do it because his team sucks, there's no one else who they can rely on to get a shot on offense.
What about Kanter and Olidipo
Olidipo is inconsistent at best and Kanter doesn't even start.
Who does Harden have then?
Gordon, Lou Williams, Ariza, Ryan Anderson
Ok fine but Harden beats Westbrook in win shares, points per game and is more efficient on offense.
Westbrook is averaging a triple double and Harden is not. Case closed.
Look Harden's the MVP because he's the best player in a contender and Westbrook is the best player on an average team.
The MVP should be the best player on any team, Not the best player on the top teams, it's not very fair.
You sound crazy, you shouldn't even be allowed to talk about basketball.
Really? Ok who is your top 5 then?
LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook
That's the same as mine. I hate you.
