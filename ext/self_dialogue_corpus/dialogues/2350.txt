Which running backs will have great seasons in the NFL in 2017?
I think Marshawn Lynch will have a resurgence.
What makes you say that?
New team and new scenery.
But he is getting pretty old, right?
Yes, but he has somewhat low mileage considering.
That is debatable, but I think I see your point.
Who do you believe will have a great season?
Watch out for Eddy Lacy this year.
We will see, he needs to stay healthy.
Yes he does, but I think that if Jamaal Charles stays healthy, he will be great.
He has always been great.
But again, he needs to stay healthy.
I agree - that is the only thing that will prevent him from success.
He used to have the most yards per rush attempt in NFL history.
Yes he was a beast coming into the league.
It's a shame what has happened to his knees.
Yes, but hopefully he can return to prominence.
It's tough to come back from those injuries.
Yes it is.
