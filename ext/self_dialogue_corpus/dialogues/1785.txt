Do you know anything about NFL records?
Some. Which ones in particular?
Well, I'm just wondering where the current quarterbacks stand with some of the passing records.
Oh, well I can tell you that both Drew Brees and Tom Brady are in the top five for passing yards.
Who is the leader?
Peyton Manning followed by Brett Favre.
Oh ok. What about passing touchdown?
That looks pretty similar. Manning, Favre, Brees, and Brady in that order.
Could Brees or Brady catch up?
It would probably take at least two more seasons, but I think they could.
Brady has the most wins though right?
He has the most career wins overall with 208, and Roethlisberger is the closest active quarterback, but he only has 136.
Wow, that is impressive.
It is. Brady also has the most regular season wins, playoff wins, and the second highest win percentage.
Who has a higher win percentage than him?
Otto Graham, but he only played five years. He has a 61-16 record.
So he has as many wins as Brady has losses?
Exactly.
Ok, so that's impressive, but of the quarterbacks with more years, Brady is the leader.
Yes, that is definitely true.
