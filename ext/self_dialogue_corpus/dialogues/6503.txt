Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?
The one with Lindsay Lohan and Dennis Quaid?
No, the original one with Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, and Hailey Mills.
I didn't know there was another version.  How is it?
I liked it better than the remake, but then in most cases, the originals tend to be better.
That's true.  So what was your favorite part of the movie?
I think the camping trip where they got rid of the fianc√©e.  Putting honey on Vicky so that the bear licked her feet was really funny.
Honey on her feet?  That's kind of mean, isn't it?
I guess so, but it was really funny.  I just really liked the whole thing.
I guess maybe I'll have to watch it because the part you described to me sounds really funny.  Mean, but funny.
