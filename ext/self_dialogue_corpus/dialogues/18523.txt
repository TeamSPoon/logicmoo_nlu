I was at a Native American Festival in Moundville State Park in Alabama several years ago.
Oh?  Was someone selling music there?
Actually someone was demonstrating the flute.  He played one made of Rivercane.
Wow!  A flute made of cane?  Is that kind of like a fishing pole.
More or less.  It is indeed a type of bamboo.
Music from a plant!  That's cool.
It is indeed.  They sound great, but I think I like wood flutes the best.
Wood?  What kind?
Traditional flutes were cedar, but most any wood can be used for a flute that produces beautiful music.
That's great.
