Who is your favorite character from Star War?
My favorite would be Yoda because of his intelligence and the way he talks. What is yours?
My favorite is Darth Vader because of his power and I love James Earl Jones.
Yeah Vader is pretty cool did you watch Rogue One? The movie was pretty sweet!
Yes! My eyes lit up when Vader first came on the screen.
My favorite character from the movie was K-2SO he was funny.
He was real funny, I loved it when Jyn shot the other droid and he asked her if she knew she didn't shoot him.
That was priceless.
Are  you ready or the next one to come out?
I an hardly wait, I think its the last Jedi right? The last one with Carrie fisher, may she rest in peace.
