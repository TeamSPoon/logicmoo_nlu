Did you know that Bambi is coming out on Blu Ray?
Yes I heard that today actually.
I saw an interview with the men who had played Thumper and Bambi not that long ago.
Really? That is cool. What did they say?
They were only 4 and 5 when they did the film and it took 3 years for them to make it.
Wow that is a long time.
Yes they had to do voice work every once in a while whenever changes were made.
Well then it is good that they were so young as their voices could not have changed much.
Yes , they also said that kids still mail them pictures of Bambi and Thumper.
Wow, that is really sweet. Must make them feel so great!
