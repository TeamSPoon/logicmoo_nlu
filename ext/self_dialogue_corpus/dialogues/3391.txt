I just saw Rosemary's Baby at film class.
Cool.  Who's in it?
A young Mia Farrell and John Cassavetes.
Neat.  What's it about?
Cassavetes has the devil impregnate Mia.
Crazy.  How's the acting?
Great.  Ruth Gordon's in it.
From Harold and Maude?
Yes, she plays a cool but evil neighbor.
Sounds spooky to me.
