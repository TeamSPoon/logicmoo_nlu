I think it's crazy that more people our age don't like Taylor Swift.
I know right? Just because we're almost 30 doesn't mean she doesn't rock!
I know! It's so crazy that people tend to think it's childish or something that I think she's amazing.
Yeah, her song "Mean" makes me cry.
Oh my gosh, I listen to that song almost every morning, I love it.
Do you like her new stuff as well as her older stuff?
I actually like both the same.
I do too. I like her country phase and her new darker stuff as well.
So do I!
What's your favorite song by her?
Honestly, I like the remix of Bad Blood.
Really? I like the original better. I think the rapper messed it up.
I completely disagree! I think it is so much better with the rap. It's way more catchy.
Well, agree to disagree! I also really like the song, where in the music video she is all crazy and stabs portraits of her ex lovers. What's that song again?
Oh, you're talking about Blank Space! I love that song too!
It's just so cool and it's like she doesn't care how she is perceived.
Yeah, I think her music videos have largely influenced me to like her more. They're so intense and she always has great acting in them.
I agree. I also like how much she seems to care about being a good role model for young girls
I do too! That's one of the best things about her, that she always has strong messages in her songs and really cares about being a positive influence.
I know, but it must be a lot of pressure on her not to mess up or ever do anything the public may perceive as "bad"
