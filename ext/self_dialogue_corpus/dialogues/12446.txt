Who is the most mysterious person in Star Wars?
I think Boba Fett
Why do you say that?
Maybe I don't know the plot inside and out but I dont know his background!
Doesn't he have a kid or something too?
Yeah I wonder what his name is and what he is up to now!
Who else is mysterious?
I would like to know more about Darth Maul
What about him?
How he got such a cool lightsaber!
