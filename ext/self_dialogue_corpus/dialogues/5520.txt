Did you see Snow White & the Huntsman?
Yes, I thought it was good.
Charlize Theron did a great job playing the mean queen.
I know, she was great in that movie.
My favorite character had to be the huntsman though.  I love Chris Hemsworth.
Isn't he the guy who played Thor?
Yes, that's him.  And Kristen Stewart plays Snow White.
Isn't she the girl from the vampire movies?
Yes that's here.  There are some good scenes with the Huntsman protecting snow white in the forest.
Yes, I will have to watch that movie again sometime.
