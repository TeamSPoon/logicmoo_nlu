I watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time since I was a kid the other day.
Did it hold up?
Honestly it was ever better.
What about it.
Well, you know how when you're a kid, everything feels larger than life?
Yeah, sure.
Well, I think my impression of that movie was that all of this big, magical stuff was happening. But I didn't really process what it was.
So you can see it more clearly now?
Exactly. And, like, the actual story is fabulous and heartbreaking. It's even better than what I remembered.
Hmm. Maybe I'll watch it as an adult.
Were there any movies that changed a lot for you from when you were a kid.
Now that you mention it, a couple of years ago I rewatched the live action Hundred and One Dalmatians.
Yeah? What was different.
Well, the puppies seemed more adorable. I guess I think puppies are cuter now.
Anything else?
Yeah. Did you know that Hugh Laurie is in that movie?
What? Really?
Yeah. He's one of Cruella DeVille's henchman.
Wow, I'll have to check that out.
It's pretty hilarious.
