Does your son have a favorite movie?
Yes, he loves Moana. Maui is his favorite character.
Does he already have an action figure of Maui? I saw one in the store yesterday that might be perfect.
Nothing yet.
Perfect! I think I found a birthday present for him then.
I know he'll love it.
Oh, what about the movie? Do you guys have a copy?
No, we can stream it from Netflix now, but I don't know how long that will last.
Okay. Maybe I'll grab a blu-ray copy and tuck that in the bag.
That would be amazing! I know he'd love the gift.
