Alright wannabe smart guy. Tell me how Debussy 'employed" a musical device called pentatonic scales in his creative process.
Estampes, The girl with a flaxen hair, la mer, etc
Those are names of the pieces that use the scales?
Yep.
That doesn't answer HOW he used them,
Um. how am I supposed to answer that? he used it well?
No, you idiot, you have discuss how he was using the scales.
Um... That's not very easy, I woudl have to dig up his scores.
Well, dig up his scores then
No.
Fine,. whatever. So those pieces used pentatonic scales. What about the Empress of Pagodas?
That's Ravel, not Debussy.
Wait, what?
Maurice Ravel compose the "empress of the pagodas"
What kinda of name if Maurice?
He's french
Ah, yes, there it is again.
Yep.
Ok fine. So Debussy uszed a lot of different scales?
yes, as did many others.
