Have you ever seen Open Water?
Yea! That movie freaked me out.
Me too! It was based on a true story.
Yea, but didn't they survive in real life?
I'm not sure. At least one of them did.
Still, That's crazy to get left out in shark infested water like that.
I know, I didn't blame the girl for giving up at the end.
I would have done it much sooner.
Could you imagine being out in the Ocean at night all alone, just waiting to get eaten?
No, that's literally my worst nightmare.
