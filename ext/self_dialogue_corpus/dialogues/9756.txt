What are you listening to?
Oh, I'm listening to Public Enemy's discography again.
How long does that take?
Well they have 13 studio albums, so...
Nice. Where are you at right now?
About halfway through It Takes A Nation. It's probably one of my least favourite of their albums but it gets good around that last 3 or so songs.
How so?
It's just when it really seems to pick up and you can feel more energy in it. The rest of the album doesn't excite me and sounds basically the same.
I hear ya. I know some albums like that, from people like Ice Cube mainly.
I'm glad you can relate.
