What did you think of the Force Awakens?
I really liked the story line and the Rey was my favorite character.
Ya I thought she was awesome. I liked how it seems she know about the Force.
Ya I think there is more to her story we don't know about.
Ya same here. I can't wait to find out if she is related to Luke or someone else.
I wonder what they will do about Leia's character?
ya it's sad that Carrie Fisher died.
Ya I wonder if they will address that in the next movie. I forget what it is called.
I think it's called The Last Jedi.
That's right. I wonder if that person is Rey.
