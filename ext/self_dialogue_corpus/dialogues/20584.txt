Do you like movie musicals?
It depends on the type of music and who's in it.
Yea,it makes a big difference.
Like John Travolta in grease.
Yes,with Olivia Newton John too.
That's for sure.
How about Saturday Night Fever.
I loved that one too. Absolutely loved The Bee Gees music soundtrack.
Was that really considered a musical like Grease?
You know,probably not.
I guess not,but the music was fantastic.
Was it ever.
How about the all time best?
What would that be?
The Wizard Of Oz!
You know you're right.
Sometimes I don't think of that as a musical but it's a classic musical.
Probably the best.
Did you know they weren't going to keep Over The Rainbow in the movie at first.
Really? Smart move to keep it in huh.
