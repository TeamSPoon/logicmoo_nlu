Hey have you seen Hidden Figures yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
it is the one about the smart women in the space program.
I remember, it looks fantastic. I also am excited about the newest movies coming out.
What other movies are you talking about?
The Fate of the Furious is one of them
Oh yes, Vin Diesel, he does an outstanding job in that one.
The entire team acts like a family, I like watching the fast cars too.
Yes the cars are beautiful.
Another good one is Alien Covenant.
Is that the one after Prometheus?
I think so.
It loos scary to me!
Oh yes, very action packed too.  I think it has a surprise ending.
Well, as soon as I can I will go down to the theater and check one of them out.
We can go together this Friday if you want to.
Sounds great!
After work  I will call you.

See you then!
