Do you like the traditional Disney Princess movies or the more current ones?
Are you referring to "Snow White" and "Cinderella" when you say traditional?
Yes, I think the "Snow White" movie from 1937 would qualify as traditional.
I did not know how old that movie was.
I like the updated versions of some of the Disney Princess movies, like the second part to "Cinderella".
I agree. The sequel versions reflect more of today's values for female characters.
I like how the princesses involve many different girls from different places.
I think that is what helps to sell so many tickets to these movies.
I would like to see a "super-hero" princess for Disney's next princess movie.
I do not think "princess" and "super-hero" go together.
