If you could see one legendary rapper live, who would it be?
Snoop Dogg?
Really?
Yes
I thought you would have picked Eminem
I love him. But, I think Snoop Dogg is the best of all time
I like his stuff too.
Maybe they could do a show together
That would be awesome
I would pay extra to see them perform together.
