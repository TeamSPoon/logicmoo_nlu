What do you think about Christmas music?
Honestly? I love it. What's your favorite song?
I think it has to be Judy Garland's version of "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"
That is a great one. It has a hint of sadness to it, don't you think?
I totally agree. What is your favorite Christmas song?
Carol of the Bells by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  It's just so beautiful
I love that one! I have to say that I love any version of that song. What do you think about the Transiberian Orchestra?
Amazing! I love them. I saw them live.
How was the concert?
It started out a little dull, but they totally made it up for it later on with an excellent and LOUD stage presence. Lots of pyrotechnics.
That's great! What's your favorite song of theirs?
It has to be the one with the kids. I can't think of the name.
Christmas Canon
Yes, that's it! Unfortunately, when we saw them, they didn't have any children's choir. It must have only been for the recording.
That's a bummer. I like the Wizards in Winter Song.
I like that one too. I liked the video a few years back with the Christmas lights synchronized to that song.
That was great. Christmas Eve/Sarajevo is a good one too.
That is a good one. I love how they put a spin on older songs.
Yes, me too! I feel like that's why everyone loves them so much.
That's probably true!
