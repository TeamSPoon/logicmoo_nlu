Do you like Lil Dicky?
Is he a white rapper?
Yes from PA.
I think I may have heard of him.
He raps about saving money and stuff.
Oh ok yes I know who you are talking about.
Yeah he is pretty good
I think he flows really well
Thats one of his strong points in my opinion.
I would go see him live if he came around.
