Hey, I'm listening to some great Warren G!
Oh I love Regulate!  That was an amazing album.
Yeah it really was.  I love the music he produces.
He's triple platinum, isn't he?
Oh yeah, definitely.  Did you know he was originally in a group with Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg?
Yeah I heard that.  They're all three great.
Yeah they have great music.  What did that group put out?
I'm not sure.  I know Regulate got famous when it was on that Above The Rim soundtrack.
Oh yeah, I remember that movie.
Then he put out the Regulate...G Funk Era record and it went platinum.
Did you know he's actually Dr. Dre's step brother?
Oh no way!  That's crazy.
Yeah, I didn't know that either until I looked him up.
Is he still making music?
I don't think so but I'm not sure.
I think he did some beats on the Chronic.
The Dr. Dre album? That was an awesome album.
I know!  It had the best beats, too.
Warren G always did have amazing beats.
Yeah that's one of the things that made him so great.
