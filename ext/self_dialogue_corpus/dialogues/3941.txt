What is your favorite thriller movie?
Taken
Liam Neason?
Yea, he did awesome in that film!
He was memed so he did for sure!
Yea and when he just delivers that classic line about his "particular set of skills" you just get this huge grin on your face
I know just what you mean!  I did the same thing!
The sequal isn't too bad either
Yea I like both of the movies actually
Same here!
