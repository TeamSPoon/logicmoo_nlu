Did you hear Remy Martin and Nicki Minaj going at it back and forth?
Yeah Remy's Shether record was fire!
I agree she went all the way in on that song.
She had a lot of personal jabs at Nicki that hit hard.
What was the name of Nicki's reply back with Drake?
I think it was called No Frauds.
Yeah i wasn't feeling it as much as Shether.
It kind of sounded like a commercial song with a diss verse added in.
I don't think she could go diss track for track against Remy.
I agree, i think Nicki clearly lost the battle for sure.
