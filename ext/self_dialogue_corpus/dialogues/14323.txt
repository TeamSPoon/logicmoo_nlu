Did you see game 2 between the Spurs and Warriors.
Yep, I feel kinda bad for the poor Spurs.
I know right. They were blown out by 36 points.
Yep, it was pretty sad.
Well, what can you do when the star player is injured?
The bench players have to pick up the slack.
Who on the Spurs bench can do that?
The only player with a lot of playoff experience is Manu.
Yes, but Manu is 39 years old. He can only do so much.
That's true. I guess the other players will have to step it up.
One of the Spurs' rookie players named Murray is coming along.
I saw him. He played pretty decent.
That's correct. He gave them a decent 8 points and also 6 assists.
He also had 6 rebounds too.
Yep, I think the Spurs will continue to give him more playing time.
I think so. They are probably looking ahead to the future.
On the Warriors side, Curry scored 29 points.
Yes, he hit a sizzling 6 three pointers.
Do the Spurs even stand a chance against this team?
I don't think so. It will be very difficult for the Spurs to beat the Warriors without Kawhi.
