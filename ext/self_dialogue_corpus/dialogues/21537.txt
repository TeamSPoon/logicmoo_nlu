What is you most favorite movie?
I think my most favorite is The Breakfast Club?
Why the Breakfast Club?
Because it came out during a time when I was the same age dealing with the same crap in my high school.
Who did you mostly identify with? Were you the brain, the beauty, the beefcake, the brawn or the basketcase?
I was a bit of the all of them I believe which is why I loved the movie.
So do you think it was designed that way?
I never thought about it but probably.
I think I identified with the beauty more than the others.
I loved the way that Molly Ringwald played that character.
Yes she I think it was one of her better roles.
I think in the whole cast it was one of their better roles of all times. I wouldn't say highlight of their careers but definitely one of them.
And the teacher, did you have a jerk teacher like him?
I had several but there was one that his part could have been written or exactly
What grade was that?
It was my ninth grade English teacher. He was such a jerk who was so egotistical and condescending.
I had one like that too but it was a woman.
I enjoyed the role the janitor played as well.
His roll was fantastic, much more than comic relief.
See now you know why it is my favorite movie.
