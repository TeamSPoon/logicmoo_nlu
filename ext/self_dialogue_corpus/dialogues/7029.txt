I can't believe they finally made a sequel to Finding Nemo!
They did? What's it about?
It's called Finding Dory. So they're gonna focus on her.
Was that the blue fish in the movie?
Yeah, the one who keeps forgetting things.
Do you remember who did her voice?
I think she was voiced by Ellen Degeneres.
Ellen is so funny. Do you think it'll be good?
Yeah, I'm really excited about it. I loved the first one.
Me too, as do my kids!
