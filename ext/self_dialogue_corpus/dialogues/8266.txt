I was doing some research on pop music and found out that a cartoon had a number 1 song on the Billboard chart.
What song is that?
It was called Sugar Sugar.
Who was it by?
The Archies.
You mean the characters that are in the TV series Riverdale?
Actually, this was back in the days when the Archies had a cartoon TV series.
When was this?
In the 1960s.
I didn't know this.
