What is a funny movie we can watch?
How about Easy A?
Perfect. Emma Stone is so great in that movie.
I know. I love her parents in the movie too.
Right? They're like the cool, funny, parents that everyone wishes they had.
I bet that Stanley Tucci would make a really great dad.
I loved him in the Julie Julia Project, he was such a caring husband to Julia.
He's such a good actor, you feel like you're there with him.
I'm really surprised he hasn't gotten more starring roles.
Me too. I feel like he would be an excellent leading man.
