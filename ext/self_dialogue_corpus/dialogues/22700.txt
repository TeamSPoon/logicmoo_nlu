You like war movies, right?
Yeah, I like war movies in general, why?
Have you seen Apocalypse Now?
Yes, a long time ago, why?
What do you think of that movie?
Well, I think it is a great movie on many levels.
What do you mean on many levels?
Well, for starters, it was a commentary on US conduct of the Vietnam War.
Of course, but why else did you like it?
Well, I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, on which the movie's story line was based, and I appreciate the parallels.
I guess it helps to like the book on which a movie is based.
Yes it does. Apocalypse Now also had some great actors in it.
Were there any famous actors in it?
Of course there was Marlon Brando in a superb performance, and also Martin Sheen in the lead role.
Any other actors that you recall?
Robert Duvall also had a memorable part, and an unforgettable line.
What line was that?
He said "I love the smell of napalm in the morning."
That is pretty messed up, but funny perhaps in a movie.
Yeah, it is kind of an iconic line. I'm sure you can find a clip on Youtube.
