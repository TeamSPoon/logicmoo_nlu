Hey so good to see you!
Yeah you too. What are you up to this summer?
I'm going to Newport Folk Fest later this summer. You?
No way! Me too!
That's awesome, have you ever been there before?
I did once. I think 2011? It was awesome.
That was a good year! I've gone every year since I can remember.
Awesome. What was your favorite performer that year?
Definitely Pete Seeger.
I agree, that was amazing. It was probably our last opportunity to see him live.
I know. I grew up listening to him.
Me too! I was so sad when he died.
I'm really looking forward to it this year though.
Yeah me too. I'm glad they're keeping Pete Seeger's tradition going.
What do you mean?
He founded the music festival! You didn't know that?
I didn't. I don't know how I didn't!
Yeah it's a big part f his legacy.
Now I'm even more excited to go.
Looking forward to seeing you there!
