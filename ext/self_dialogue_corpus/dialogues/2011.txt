Hey, will you be watching some NFL games this season?
Yes. I will be glued infront of the tv, rooting for the Jets.
Hopefully 2017 will be better for them than last year.
I know they did not do to good last year; ended the season 5-11.
Don't feel so bad, my team did bad to.
What team is that?
New Orlean Saints. They ended the season 7-9.
They did better than my team.
I heard the Jets snagged a good draft pick this year; the player went to LSU.
Oh, yeah. Your talking about Jamal Adams.
That's the player. I hear good things about him.
So did I. Did you know George Adams is his Father?
The George Adams that played for the New York Giants in 1985?
That's right. Get out of here.
I'm serious, and what is crazier is that they were both first-round picks.
Like father like son, ha ha.
I guess we will see what he can do.
Hopefully a lot, because my Jets need all the help they can get.
Agreed. And remember you said that.
There is no denying it. Good luck this season.
