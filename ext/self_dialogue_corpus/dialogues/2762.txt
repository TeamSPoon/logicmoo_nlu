You know, with these NFL rule changes and protections, I think it's time to see more of the run-option in playbooks.
I've heard announcers talk about that and, I hate to profess my ignorance, but what is the run-option? Isn't it just the QB sneak?
No, the run-option is all about creating a traditional handoff play, but the QB decides after the hike to actually hand off or run.
Ok, and that's different how?
The sneak is a designed play like the draw or scramble because the play is designed to go either way defending on the action taken.
Why? How does the QB choose?
Well, the QB reads the outside rush and, if they bite on the run and move to stop the RB, he keeps it, if they move to sack him then he hands it off.
It sounds like every play should be the option, I have no idea how to defend against it.
Well, it rests on discipline of the defensive team. Rex Ryan wrote the book on defending the option.
Ryan, is he the Bills Coach?
Yeah, and before that he was the Jets coach, great defensive mind.
How did he defend against it?
Usually, you don't commit the rush until the handoff is complete or not. If the defender is patient, they can stuff it for a loss every play.
So why did Tebow beat him on that awesome Jets game?
Well, with most rushes, you only have to guard against the outside run, a QB normally doesn't run up the middle
Because they can't churn up yards there I'm guessing
That, and you can take more hits, less chance to slide.
That make sense, so Tebow was able to beat it because the threat was in all directions and that's just tough to defend.
Ryan almost won that game, they did shut down that offense pretty solidly with his awesome coverage and safeties
It was pretty raucaus and a good defensive match.
