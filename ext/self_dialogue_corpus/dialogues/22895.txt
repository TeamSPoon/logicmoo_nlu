Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I watched the original Blair Witch Project the other night.
Oh I love that movie!  It scared me so much.
Yeah, me too.  I couldn't stand being out in the woods like that.
I've been scared to camp ever since I saw it!
Yeah, and the way they made it so realistic was genuinely creepy.
It was, and that was before reality tv got popular.
Yeah it seems like it was a precursor to it.  I wonder if it had an influence.
I don't know.  Was it based on a true story?
It said so in the movie, but I'm not sure if that was real or not.
I don't know.  I guess we could look it up.
Yeah.  Did you see any of the sequels?
No, I didn't know there were sequels.
Yeah, there were several.  I think the latest just came out last fall.
Oh, how were they?
Not so great.  The second one was pretty lame and I heard the third was bad too.
You haven't seen the third?
No, but I'm still going to check it out.  Sometimes reviews are wrong.
Yeah that's definitely true.  Maybe we can watch it together.
Yeah, we could do that.
