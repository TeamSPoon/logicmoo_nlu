What was your favorite band in college.
I loved the British band Erasure.
Really? That is unusual.
Well the music was great. You could dance to it and sing to it and it was rarely depressing.
They didn't get played to much on the radio here.
No they didn't. Chains of Love was the hit here.
I think it came out in 1987?
That is about right. We danced to it in high school and that was the first time I heard them.
I thought that was their first song.
Yes, after I heard it I went and got the cassette tape.
I never heard the whole album.
It is absolutely fantastic. Not a bad song among the bunch.
What music genre are they?
I think synth-pop maybe? The only instrument used is really a synthesizer and a lot of computer generated sound.
Wow. Did not know that.
Andy Bell is a fantastic singer. He has such a vocal range.
Vince Clarke sure can play a mean computer.
Ha ha. Yes he can. He creates wonderful melodies.
I will have to try and listen to them.
Yes, they are coming out with a new album,but you should hear the earlier ones.
