Whenever I watch 101 Dalmatians, I end up wanting to get another dog.
I know! Me too!
And I get so angry at CruElla. Who could be that mean to animals?
She's a classic Disney villain, isn't she?
Yeah, she has to be one of the worst with her stupid fur coat.
She's a terrible person with even worse fashion sense.
Could you imagine having that many dogs though?
Imagine the dog hair getting on everything!
I think owning over a hundred of any animal is a bit crazy.
You've got that right.
