I re-watched Lilo and Stitch today, before I let the kids watch it.  Now I can't stop crying.
Oh my goodness.  Just hearing the name of the movie makes my eyes tear up.
Yeah it does.  With the "leave me alone to die" and the photograph...
And the doll! And Jumba telling Stitch he can't be good!
I think it's extra touching, because the storyline is so real.
I agree. The real threat isn't the aliens or dragons or monsters, it's being separated from your family.
Have you decided if you will let your kids watch it?
I haven't decided yet.  The kids would be fine, but I am worried I'll start crying my eyes out in front of them.
Fun fact that might cheer you up.  When Stitch shocks everyone with what he licks on his cage, it's the Disney logo he licks.
Hilarious!  Now I'm laughing through my tears.
