Do you think Peter wants to be Spiderman?
I think the town needed him.
There were some super hero bad guys
He should find the spider and get it to bite other people and train them
It does seem like other people would find out about how he got his powers and try to get bitten
That might have been a more boring story line
I think it helped Peter be more confident
Peter is very confident with his powers. He could not shoot a web once and might have died.
It seemed like some kind of a mental thing when he lost his powers for a second.
He would not live long with all the stunts
