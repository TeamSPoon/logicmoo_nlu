Have you ever seen One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest?
Yes I have. I loved it.
Jack Nicholson is my favorite actor.
He's one of mine too.
Awesome movie. Really funny yet really sad.
Hard to believe the stuff they did to the mentally ill back then.
It was crazy. I believe it was based on the year 1963.
Yea I remember Jack Nicholson pretended to announce the World Series.
Oh god,that was a riot.
He had all the nuts going.
Hahahahah,yes he did.
Remember The chief?
Yes,the huge no talking Indian.
He was a monster.
Yes he was.
It was a riot watching him play basketball.
It was so funny.
It was,but really sad too.
Hard to believe what they did to the mentally ill back then.
It was very sad to see.
