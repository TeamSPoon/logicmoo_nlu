Have you seen the new Wonder Woman yet?
Not yet. But I really want to. Have you?
I saw it on opening night. IT WAS AWESOME!!!
I've heard good things about it. Who plays Wonder Woman?
Her name is Gal Gadot. She did  a great job. Whoever did the casting nailed it.
I've never heard of her before. Has she been in anything else?
She was in some of the fast and furious movies.
I've never watched those either. I can't believe they are still making new Fast and Furious Movies. They sound lame.
I saw the 1st one a loooong time ago. It wasn't my thing. But anyways Gal Gadot was awesome as Wonder Woman.
How were the fight scenes?
They were really good! Made me feel empowered as a woman because she was kickin so much butt.
Nice. Who directed it?
Patty Jenkins. I believe Wonder Woman is the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman.
Wow! That is pretty amazing. Isn't Chris Pines in it too?
Yeah he's in it and so is Robin Wright.
Who is Robin Wright?
You know her! Jenny from Forrest Gump!
oh yeah! She plays Claire on House of Cards. She's a good actress.
Yeah she is. I kinda wish she had a bigger part in Wonder Woman.
Well...I can;t wait to watch it!
