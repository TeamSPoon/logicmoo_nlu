So are you still a big football fan?
Yes! I am counting down the days until the NFL returns.
I am actually looking forward to it myself this year.
I did not think you cared for the NFL that much?
I used to not care for it at all, until I moved to Nashville. Now I actually look forward to going to watch the Titans play.
Cool, now we can talk a lot more during the season!
We sure can! I am really excited about Marcus Mariota.
I do not blame you, he is a really good young player.
If you could start a franchise with any player in the league right now, who would it be?
To be honest, it might be Dak prescott if I had to pick one guy.
Really? You would take him over guys like Arron Rodgers,Andrew Luck, or even a great receiver like Antonio Brown?
I would for a couple of reasons actually. The first being his uncanny composure when he is on the field.
You can just tell he never panics. I will give you that one.
The other reason is because he can control the game with both his arms and his legs.
He does have great mobility. However so does Luck and Rodgers as well.
Yea, but he is so much younger than them; so that is why I would pick him if I were starting a new franchise.
You actually make some pretty good points about Prescott.
I have always enjoyed watching him, even when he was at Mississippi State.
I do not think anybody thought he could come in and steal Tony Romo's job though!
I hate that Romo lost his job, but I am really happy for Prescott.
