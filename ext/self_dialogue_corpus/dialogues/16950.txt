have you ever heard of "Old Crowe Medicine Show"
What kind of music do they play?
Modern Indie bluegrass
I am not sure if I would like them. I am not a fan of bluegrass and gospel music.
They aren't gospel by any means. Have you ever heard that song O brother where art thou?
Yes, I really like that sound, do they sing that?
No, but their music sounds very similiar.
What are one of their songs that you would recommend I listen to first?
Theuir song "Wagon Wheel" is decent.
I thought Darius Rucker sang that?
He does a good cover of it, but they done the original modern take.
So I listened to it, and I really like their style, very upbeat.
You should listen to their Song " Cocaine Gonna Kill My Hunny Dead"
That doesn't sound very upbeat, at least in topic.
Oh but it is! It is a comedy
Ok I listened  to it, and you were right, But now its an earworm, I cannot stop singing the chorus!
It is catchy, that is for certain.
What is the name of this cd?
Olde Crowe Medicine Show, Wagon Wheel
I wonder if they have mp3 I can dowload?
