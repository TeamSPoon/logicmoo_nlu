I love that movie Hocus Pocus!
Isn't Bette Midler in that movie?
Yeah, but Sarah Jessica Parker was so funny!
Who was the 3rd witch in that movie?
Wasn't she in My Big Fat Greek Wedding?
Hmmm, I think her name was Kathy Najimy.
Yeah, they were so funny as witches. I can't believe that was 1993!
You're kidding me. I just watched it this past Halloween. Timeless.
Yeah, I love that little town that they live in. It looks like a great place to grow up.
No doubt, but still a small town. Can you believe the little sister was Thora Birch?
No really? She was in that movie Ghost World, right?
Oh yeah, now that you mention it. That was her. I don't remember much of it only it was weird.
Yeah, also early Scarlett Johansen.
Really, I guess so.
Back to Hocus Pocus....isn't the best scene when all the little kids are out trick or treating and the witches can't figure out what is going on?
Or the scene in the cemetery...when there is the big chase.
You know Thackery the brother is on NCIS?
You know, now that you mention it. I can see that.
I may have to watch it again this Halloween.
Yeah, makes for a good tradition! Like Trick or treating!
