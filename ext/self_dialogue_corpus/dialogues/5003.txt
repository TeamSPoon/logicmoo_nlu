Did you see the game between the Cardinals and the Marlins the other night on ESPN?
No, I missed it. Did Ichiro play?
No, but he is still playing for the Marlins.
Didn't he play for the Seattle Mariners for a long time?
Yes, he did for about about 12 years.
There was one season that he got an enormous number of base hits, if I recall correctly.
You're probably thinking about 2004, when he got 262 hits, breaking George Sisler's single-season hit record.
Did he play in the minors before coming into the big leagues?
No, but he played professionally in Japan for about a decade before coming here to the states.
Did he really? So he's played for about a quarter century then.
Yes, and he's 43 years old, and still in amazing shape.
That's crazy, especially when most baseball players retire well before they're 40.
By the way, there are many seasons in which Ichiro got an enormous amount of hits.
Do you think he will be in the hall of fame at Cooperstown one day?
Without a doubt, he will be, and most likely in the first year he's eligible.
Sounds like, if he got many hits per season over many seasons, he would have racked up a whole lot of career hits.
Yes. In fact, when you count his hits in Japan with his hits here in America, he actually has more than Pete Rose.
And Pete Rose is the all-time career hits leader here in America.
That's correct, but they never really talk about his hits in Japan that much.
I still find it incredible the amount of hits total he has as a pro.
