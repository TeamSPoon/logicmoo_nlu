Do you like action movies?
Well, I'm more into fighting movies than action movies.
What about The Expendables, did you like that?
Yea it was ok. I like action movies,I just like fighting movies more.
What's the difference?
Well an action movie would be like The Predator. A fighting movie would be like Kickboxer.
Oh ok, but there is a lot of overlap there.
Yea there is, I just like when a movie is centered around fighting.
Oh like Never Back Down?
Yea I really liked that movie. I mean the story was horrible, but the fight scenes were great.
Very true, what other fight movies do you like?
Every movie in the Undisputed series is amazing.
Oh I saw Undisputed 2, that was really good.
Yea, again, the stories are always really bad, but man the fighting was top notch.
The main guy in that movie was really good.
Yea, that's Michael Jai White. He is a legit fighter.
Do you like Chuck Norris?
Yea Chuck Norris is great even after all these years.
Do you think he could beat Bruce Lee?
We'll never know.
