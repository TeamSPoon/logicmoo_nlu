winnie the pooh is one of the best movies
he is such a cute bear, did you know the writer made that about his own stuffed animals
he was, he was always finding honey pots
I wonder why bears love honey so much
because it tastes so good!
I like tigger, he was so crazy jumping around
and little roo, he was always following tigger
i know and poor rabbit with his garden always getting ruined
i know, rabbit was a boy i always though rabbit was an old lady
so did i , then my mom said rabbit was a boy
