Do you think the Cowboys can win the Super Bowl this year?
I think it's more likely they'l win in a couple years.
Why is that?
Well I think the odds of Dak doing as good as his rookie season are low.
Yeah you see QBs have sophomore slumps a lot.
I think Zeke will be just as good this year though.
Yeah I think Elliot could have the most rushing yards in the league.
I don't know about that, don't forget about Bell.
Yeah Bell will probably have more all-purpose yards.
Yeah, but if Cowboys really rely on the run then who knows.
What about Jason WItten, is he getting too old?
Yeah, he obviously isn't the same player he used to be.
Yeah, but he is still an effective run and pass blocker.
Yeah, but he certainly can't catch well anymore.
You also got to worry about the Cowboys' defense.
Yeah, they did a good job of drafting a lot of young talent though.
Yeah but those guys are going to need time to develop.
That's what I'm saying that they need a couple more years.
Yeah hopefully they win one soon.
They need to win one while they have the extra cap room from having a low paid QB.
