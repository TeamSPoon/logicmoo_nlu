What about horror movies?
I like some of them.
I could not agree more.
And then there's Stuart Gordon.
Which ones did he do?
All the Lovecraft ones.
Hp Lovecraft, the writer? He mad eadaptations?
Yeah, he did the Re-Animator movies.
All three of them? Wow! What else.
Well, he did more Lovecraft stuff, Dagon is my favorite, probably.
Which is Dagon?
It's about the guy from Re-animator, the act,or Jeffrey Combs, not the character
What does he do?
He gets stranded on this island after his boat sinks and everyone else on it dies.
Oh wow that sounds traumatic.
It's just the beginning. It turn out this God has turned all the people on the island into monsters.
What sort of monsters?
Sickly demon sea monsters with gills and claws and stuff.
Wow sounds like I'd like it a lot.
Yes, as Lovecraft adaptations go, it's a combination of some stuff, but excellent horror movie in my opinion.
