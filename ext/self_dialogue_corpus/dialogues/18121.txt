do you like nirvana
who doesn't like nirvana?
they changed the whole soundscape of music
they drove away the glam metal
who needs glam metal anyway
the 90s were dark and nirvana personified it
well, alice were darker
yeah, nirvana were kinda in the middle
the 90s were as dark as nirvana
but not as dark as alice in chains, i think
what about pearl jam
they werent as interesting as nirvana
pearl jam were more political though
nirvana was more punk
they broke their guitars and stuff a lot
yeah, they were destructive which was interesting
i guess i get your point
it was during our age of chaos
yeah, and things are still bad today
that is true
