Have you seen the new Disney Cars 3 movie that just came out it is really amazingly done?
No not yet but I want to I heard great things about it.
Yes the animation if so realistic it looks like real cars.
Yes I saw the paint jobs on some of the cars from the trailer and they look fantastic rich with detail.
Yes there done very well. The story is great as well & there's is a lot of familiar voice actors in the film.
Disney and Pixar are really doing some amazing work, they keep pushing the boundaries between reality and imagination.
Yeah I know at times in the film until you see the faces on the cars it looks like the real things in action.
Its great I know. With Disney you can never go wrong.
You really need to check it out when you get a chance nothing beats the big screen experience.
Definitely probably this weekend been seeing commercials for it and got great reviews.
