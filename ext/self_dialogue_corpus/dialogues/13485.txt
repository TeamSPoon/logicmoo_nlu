Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
It's a tie, between Yoda and Vader.
Interesting, opposite sides.
That's what makes them so good.  They are both so powerful and have such interesting back stories.
You know who I always loved?  Han, I bet he has a good back story.
Yeah I bet you're right.  He has all types of things he's done being a smuggler and all.
And how about his escapes from bounty hunters?
I like him and Chewy as a team.  It will be great to finally see how they met.
Yeah, and the Lando Han relationship.  Would be great to know what happened.
Like how Han got the Falcon.
