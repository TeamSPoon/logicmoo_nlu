have you ever done a star wars marathon?
in one day?! no man, that's too much!
it's pretty hard core, i can't lie. you have to basically not eat and sleep
but is it worth it?
oh yeah! watching in the proper order is always worth it
what's the best movie, though?
the force awakens, honestly
wow, poser
hey! it was good. you can't blame me for liking something more modern
i guess, but c'mon. what bout revenge?
