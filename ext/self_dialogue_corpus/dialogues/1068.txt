Hey, do you watch NFL football?
Of course! What's your favorite time?
Mine is the Detroit Lions!
Seriously? Why, they're not very good.
Sure, but I like going to Ford Field, it's one of the best in the NFL.
I'm not sure about that.  Part of the fun is watching a winning team.
That's true, but the Lions have been doing better lately.
That's funny. I heard someone say that the Lions may be the only Michigan team to go to the playoffs this coming year.
Well, I've been watching the Lions since they played in the Plontiac Silverdome.
The Pontiac Silverdome? Is that even still around?
Sadly, no.
What happened to it?
Once the Lions left Auburn Hills for Detroit, the Silverdome became a ghost town.
Well, that's fine, Ford Field is a lot better, anyways.
I like the new home of the Lions.  Ford Field is near a lot of other stuff.
Well, hopefully, the Lions will make it even better by winning.
You're absolutely right!
Go Lions!
Go Honolulu Blue!
I hope they win something this year!
