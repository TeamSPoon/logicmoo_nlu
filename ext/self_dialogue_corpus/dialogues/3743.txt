Have you seen gone girl?
Yes that movie was great, kept me on the edge of my seat.
I agree, all the way through I was asking myself if he did it or not.
I know, I totally didn’t see the twist coming at the end.
Yes, that was an insane ending. Speaking of Ben Affleck, did you see the accountant?
No I have not, I wasent sure what to make of that, didn’t seem to blow up at the movie theatre.
Yes I could see why, it wasent amazing but it was a good thriller with a bit of action thrown in.
Interesting, Ben seems to be doing some good movies lately so I should probabally give the accountant a try.
I think you would like it, it’s got a good plot and his acting is up to par.
Cool, I will add that one to my list of movies to watch.
