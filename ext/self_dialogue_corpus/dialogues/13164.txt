Hey, whose your favorite Jedi character.
I'd have to say Mace Windu.
Really, nay particular reasons?
Well, first he is a badass character, tough and battle ready.
Basically, a tough guy's kind of Jedi, any other reason's
Well, he also is the only Jedi Master able to go toe to toe with Palpatine and survive.
Well, until Anakin turns on him and slices his arm off.
Yeah, but Palpatine couldn't defeat him by himself, he needed Anakin to distract and injure him.
Really, you don't think he was faking weakness to force Anakin to his side?
Would you take that chance with a comabt as skilled and determined as Mace WIndu?
