My heart has been hurting this week. I have been thinking of Toby Mac's song When Love Broke Though.
I heard what happened. I'm sorry you had to go through that. But if that is song that you are thinking of. It's a great song to help you heal.
Yes. It speaks of how we have to Jesus break through us.
If you have not seen the video it also speaks of race tensions. The video itself is a very powerful video.
The lyrics really sooth my heart. It tells me there is hope and that I don't have to be alone.
Sometimes we have to be broken in order to be fixed.
Right now I feel broken and alone.
Allow those words to sooth you. And as you meditate on them pray and ask God to show you where He should heal and restore you.
When you are rejected it is hard to see the future. The only thing you see is the rejection and pain.
But that is where you learn to see how you can be healed and move on. I understand it is hard, but if you take one moment at a time you will get through.
Each step is so painful.
That is one less step you have to take. Look at the journey ahead.
I have to get past what I see and move on I know.
know that you have hope and that each day it gets you closer to that hope.
It's hard to think that anyone would want me after what I have done.
Jesus does. He will meet you where you are. He will show you the way. But you have to forgive yourself and then start to know that you are worth something.
My heart is wounded.
And it will heal. But you have to know that this is a song that speaks the truth.
It does give me hope.
Allow those words to bath you in hope. And know that one day it will be in the past and you will get through this.
