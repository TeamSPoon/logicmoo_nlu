Are you familiar with Amon Amarth?
Who or what is that?
It's a Swedish melodic death metal band with viking themed lyrics.
Melodic death metal. Can you even listen to that?
Indeed you can, even though it has growling vocals it has some incredible instrumental parts.
Can you even make out the lyrics through the growling?
Of course you can, you just need to listen and get used to the singer.
So do you have any songs or albums you can recommend from them?
The first album I heard was Versus The World and it's still one of my favorites.
Have they released a lot of albums?
They have 10 full length albums released over the last 20 years.
That's actually really impressive.
It is indeed, and that's not even mentioning that they are an incredible live band.
Have you been to any concerts with them?
Yeah I had the fortune of seeing them a couple of times and they blew me away with their performance.
So would you say they sound better live or in studio?
They are much better live at least in my opinion.
Really? I'm not used to bands actually being able to perform the music they make in a studio and making it sound better.
Strange, that's quite opposite of my experience when it comes to live bands.
That makes me look at the metal genre with a newfound respect.
