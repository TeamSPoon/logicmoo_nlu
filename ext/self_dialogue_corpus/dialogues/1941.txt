It's always disappointing when star players from college wipe out in the NFL
Yeah, I agree. There's so much pressure
Johnny Manzeil turned out to be a dud
So did Tim Tebow
He brought a lot of publicity to the teams though
Like the NFL needs more money
True. More talent less hype would be nice
RGIII is another college star who didn't do so well
I'm glad Cam turned out pretty great
True. He was worth the hype
David Carr was a pretty bad one
Oh he's one of the biggest duds
Along with Tim Couch.
Charles Rogers was also a bad choice
He was a good choice just turned out to not be a NFL player
The Lions did not get their money's worth on that deal
Did you know Terry Bradshaw was bad his first year out<
I didn't that's crazy.
Yep. He turned into a decent QB
Oh for sure
