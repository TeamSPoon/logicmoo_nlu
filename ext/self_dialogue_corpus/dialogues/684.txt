Another lame football season.
Yea, I miss the days when my team was relevant.
It's tough being a Redskins fan.
Yea, our team sucks.
I miss the days of Riggins.
Joe Theisman was great.
That injury he had was horrific.
Ugliest injury I ever saw on tv.
It's up there with Sid Vicious the wrestler.
Norv Turner ruined this francise.
Remember the 91 season?
Yea, that was perfect.
Superbowl was a cakewalk.
How bout the NFC Championship?
Ha, had to play the mighty Lions who we'd beaten 45-0 already.
How did we squeak by that one?
And they fumble right out the gate!
Those were the days.
It won't be that way this year.
Yea, gonna be a long year.
