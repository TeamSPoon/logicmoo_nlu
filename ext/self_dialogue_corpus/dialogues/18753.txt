Who is your favorite new band that you've discovered?
Um, probably Andrew Belle
I haven't heard of him
He's really good.  Kind of mellow but the music is also pretty interesting.
Where did you hear of him?
He came on my husband's Pandora and he shared a track with me.
That's cool.  Does he remind you of anyone?
Um, hard to say.  I can't think of anyone to make a comparison with... maybe Coldplay?
Cool.  I've been pretty into Paperwhite lately
I've heard of them.  They are pretty upbeat.
Yeah their station plays some good stuff.
Who is your favorite band of all time?
I like Toad the Wet Sprocket and Tracy Chapman.
They are both great.  Very different from eachother though.
Yeah my musical taste is kind of a wide variety
Mine too.. the only thing I haven't gotten into is country
Me too.  The only country I really like is more bluegrass
Something like Allison Krauss?
Yes, exactly.  I don't really like any of the pop country.
Me neither.
