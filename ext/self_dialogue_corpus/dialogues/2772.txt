So what's going on in the NFL?
It seems to be the same every summer, guys see these NBA contracts and all of a sudden they think that their underpaid.
I know right? When does it stop?
It is always the same type guys too, the free agents or the rookies that just signed big contracts saying they could have gotten more if they played basketball.
I think they should just go play basketball.  They thought making a 53 man roster was hard.  Try 15.
Makes me feel like they don't want to share with their teammates.
Makes me wonder if there is a point where you don't think about money and what that dollar amoutn is.
I have seen guys get guaranteed rookie contracts of more than ten million a year think that they are underpaid. And they haven't even played a single down.
Really is hard to believe.
Basic differences don't seem to mean anything. I mean 15 players versus 53, 82 games vs. 16.  What don't they understand?
Exactly, there are just more opportunities for a team to make money during a long basketball season and less people to share it with.
But that NBA money sure is unbelievable.
I know.  Those guys are killing it. But the NFL players get paid pretty well compared to how it used to be.
I know Jim Thorpe used to play for $250 a game.
I lot of guys that got drafted in the early years never even signed.
Your'e right. I know of a number one pick that took a job selling foam rubber instead of playing football.
Could you imagine that today?
Yeah I can just hear some saying "No, thanks for the offer but I would rather go work at the plant."
Not going to happen.
Definitely not.
