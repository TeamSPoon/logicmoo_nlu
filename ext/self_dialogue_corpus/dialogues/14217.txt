Do you think Lady Gaga is our generation's Madonna?
Well, I don't know enough about Madonna to say, really. Do you think so?
Yes, I think she is our generations Madonna.
Why's that?
She's changed looks, she is a dynamic performer, she writes songs that show artistry and controversy.
I've seen her dress in some really bizarre stuff that I'm not sure Madonna had ever dressed in. I was thinking she was a bit more artsy than Madonna.
That might be true.
But point taken, she's a popular, creative, and dynamic women musician/performer who retains an independent streak.
Yes, and she's big enough to play the Super Bowl Halftime Show.
That's a pretty significant gig. I guess she's way more popular than I realize.
