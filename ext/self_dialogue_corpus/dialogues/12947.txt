What is your favorite weapon in star wars?
The lightsaber of course!
What color would your be if you had one?
I want a green one, like Yoda.
I wonder if that is allowed! I wish I had a red one
Are you from the dark side?
No, but I just like the color!
Well you better kill Darth Maul or someone on the Dark Side and take theirs then
I dont think I can do that, but I can hope!
If you can't get Maul's then try getting Vader's!
