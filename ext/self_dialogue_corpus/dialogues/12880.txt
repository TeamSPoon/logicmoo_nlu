Do you like the first star wars?
Yes I love that movie because it was neat seeing little anakin.
Yeah I love when they show the innocent side of him.
Little did he know then that he would end up as Vader.
I know right?
It is funny how they have all these prequels now.
I wish it was in actual order.
But then again it makes it interesting the way they have done it.
I had a nice time talking to you.
Same!
