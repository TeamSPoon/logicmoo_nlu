One of my favorite scary movies from the '80s is Poltergeist.
I saw it when I was kid, and it scared me.
Yes, it might not be appropriate for children.
Does it scare you as an adult?
Not really, but it's awfully creepy in certain parts.
Tell me about the plot.  I've forgotten what it's about exactly.
It's about a family who moves into a house that's been built over a graveyard.
Oh, I remember now.  The ghosts of the people from the graveyard haunt the house.
That's right.  They focus on the little girl.
Her name is Carol Anne, isn't it?
Yes,  the girl who plays her is very affecting.
Who else is in the movie?
JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are the parents.
Are they convincing?
Yes, they have a lot of chemistry, too.
I like it when the actors seem to click.
The movie was really well-known in the '80s and still holds up.
I know it has a big following.
It's worthy of a following.  It's genuinely interesting and just scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.
That's the best kind of horror movie.
