It looks like all the clothes are going to have holes in them again this summer.
Oh you mean all the eyelet. There's eyelet every summer.
Yes and I hate it. I always think people are evaluating my underwear.
It's meant to be cooling. In fact it is cooling.
Not if you wear a camisole and slip underneath, it's not.
So don't.
Pardon me if I'm shy.
Marcie, nobody wants to see our stuff, we're old. Besides, everybody else will be in shorts and crop tops.
That's true, Elise. Don't mind me.
Get yourself a nice eyelet blouse, and let the breezes blow.
Hmm. Maybe a little eyelet around the top or bottom. Just to be airy.
That's the spirit. Summer is for breezy fashions.
Okay. Come shopping with me?
What do you mean? You're supposed to shop from your computer.
Oh. I never have.
It's great. Your big airy bedroom is your dressing room, and they usually pay for shippping whatever you return.
Really?
Really. It's the greatest fashion advance since eyelet.
Maybe I'll try it.
Do that. It's so cool.
