Who is your favorite actor?
I would have to say my favorite actor is currently Leonardo Decaprio.
He is a good choice. I am happy he has recently finally gotten the recognition he deserves.
Yes I was happy he finally won an Oscar. He was great in The Revenant.
He deserved it for how hard he worked for that movie.
What is your all time favorite movie that Decaprio starred in.
There are just so many I have to think about it for a little. What is your favorite?
I thought Inception was a great movie. However, Shutter Island was also a great one.
Those are both excellent choices. I remember some other well known people starred in Inception.
You are correct Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page were also in the movie.
I love both of them! I remember Decaprio and Levitt were a good pair in that movie.
They definitely complimented eachother and it made the movie fantastic.
Would you say Leonardo Decaprio will go down as one of the best actors of all time?
That is a hard question to answer. I'd say as of right now he is about there but it could change in the future.
You are right there are so many great actors and actresses we don't know what will happen.
Exactly who is to say if we will still feel the same about Decaprio twenty years from now.
Maybe we will have a new favorite actor by then.
I am sure my favorite will still be Decaprio!
Yes I wouldn't be surprised if he is still making great movies in 2037.
It is definitely possible he will be!
