The Rockets are going to win the Finals this year.
There is no chance of that.
Why do you say that?
Because the Spurs exist.
They are going to flip this series and come back.
Even if they do they have to beat the Warriors.
I think Durant is going to go down again and leave the window open for the Rockets.
Even if that does happen the Warriors would still beat the Rockets.
No way their bench is too weak.
OK, lets say I agree.  What about the Cavs?
Well I think Lebron is wearing down.
What tells you that? He has been the most dominant player in the playoffs clearly.
Maybe, OK now I am just getting depressed.
I didn't mean to do that but speaking of worn down have you seen Harden lately.
Hey hey! Never doubt the beard.
I am doubting the beard.  He looks exhausted.
Yeah his usage is way too high.
Exactly.
OK so maybe I'm over confident.
Maybe, you are 100% over confident.  No chance they win.
