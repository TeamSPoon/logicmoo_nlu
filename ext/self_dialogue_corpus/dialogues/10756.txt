Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes, I've seen all of them except the 8th one.
The one that's out in theaters now?
Right, I haven't seen that one yet.
Which one -- of the ones you've seen -- is your favorite?
I probably enjoyed the 1st one the most, but I liked them all. Some were better than others, though.
Which one did you like the least?
I think the second one is probably my least favorite.
Yeah, I agree. I can't even really remember the second one very much.
It's the one where Brian teams up with Roman Pearce as undercover cops. Vin Deisel and Michelle Rodriquez aren't in it.
