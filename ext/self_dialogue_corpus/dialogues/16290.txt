You know who I'm a big fan of?
Who is that?
Rihanna. She's come out with some pretty good songs in the last few years.
Right I know her music!
I think one of my favorite songs of hers that I can think of is "Umbrella".
I remember a few years ago when that was popular.
I used to have it on my mp3 player and would listen to it when I went walking.
Didn't Jay Z sing that song with her?
You're right I think he did.
I thought so. It was pretty good.
Did you know she also appeared on the movie "Home"?
Yes I did! Which voice did she do again.
She was the girl in the movie, I think her name was Tip.
Right. The alien's friend.
It was such a cute movie, she did a great job.
I agree. My kids watched it over and over.
Did you know they have it on Netflix?
Yes! Which is why they watched it over and over.
Rihanna is a great artist. I need to download more of her music.
Make sure you download the whole album titled "Good Girl Gone Bad."
