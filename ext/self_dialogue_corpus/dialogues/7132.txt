I wish I was a cat so I could spend my night playing jazz piano.
Like the Aristocats?
Yeah doesn't everybody want to be a cat.
Yes, because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's hat.
Everybody's picking up on that feline beat.
Because everything else is obsolete.
Haha, it seems we are already on our way to becoming Aristocats.
Yeah I'd be a tomcat and you'd be a scaredy cat.
Ha ha you're so funny. Anyways I'd definitely be Scat Cat.
Well I'll be Toulouse then.
