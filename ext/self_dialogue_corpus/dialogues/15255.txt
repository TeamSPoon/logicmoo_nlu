I've decided to give Hip-Hop music a try.
Good choice! It's a great genre.
Yeah, I know a lot of people like it, but I've never really given it a shot.
As you know, I'm big into Hip Hop.
That's why I came to talk with you. Can you recommend something for me?
Absolutely. So you've never listened to any Hip Hop music in the past?
I've seen a few Snoop Dogg videos, maybe heard some Tupac. Maybe a Jay-Z song or something.
But nothing really stuck with you?
That's right. I couldn't tell you the name of any of the songs.
OK, I'd actually tell you to go in another direction.
What do you mean?
Well, all those artists you mentioned are very commercial, mainstream artists.
Yeah, if I know their names, they must be!
But that's only one small part of hip hop music. I think you'd connect with more conscious, activist Hip Hop music.
I could see that. I was turned off by the materialism exhibited by guys like Jay Z and Snoop Dogg.
Try the album Blackstar. It's by a couple of MCs named Talib Kweli and Mos Def.
Mos Def the actor?
He was an MC way before he was an actor. Music is what made him famous.
I liked him in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I'll try the album.
Start off with the song 'Re:Definition'. You won't be sorry!
