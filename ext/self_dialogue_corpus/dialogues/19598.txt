That sounds like Queensryche.
It is. It's Silent Lucidity.
What do you know about music like that?
I like old school music, dad. Y'all had such good music back then.
If I had a time machine this would be one of my stops.﻿
You would leave this time? Would you ever come back?
I don't know. The first time I heard this song it sounded so much like a Pink Floyd song I thought Floyd had released a new album.
I love this song.
So do I.
It's timeless.
They are the best band that ever came out of Seattle﻿.
They're from Seattle? I didn't know that.
Yeah, they are from Seattle. This song is a true musical masterpiece..
A timeless piece of candy for the mind, body, and senses.
And arguably one of the Top 10 rock songs ever written and performed.﻿
I agree.﻿
Back when music was music. Not this crap now a days!
I don't know. The music today isn't so bad.
Yes it is. I've always loved Queensryche, and Silent Lucidity is one of my fave song of theirs.
I can see why.
