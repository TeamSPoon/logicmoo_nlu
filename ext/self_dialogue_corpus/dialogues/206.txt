What do you think about the hob goblin?
He told us a lot about the other goblin
The other goblin and him both got more aggressive with the drugs
The drugs didn't make that much sense
They may have added quick reflexes to match up to spiderman
Yes, but his main weapons were that he could fly and had bombs
I guess Spiderman was a little better than both of the goblins
It made me sad that the bomb messed up Harry's face
Harry died from his glider just like his dad
The goblin transformation was the root of the problem
