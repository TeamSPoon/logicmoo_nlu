Did you watch the NFL draft this year?
Yeah, but only the first couple of nights.
Me too. Who do you think had the best draft?
I think a lot of teams did well, but I think the 49ers scored pretty well.
I think so too, especially after gaining all those picks after barely moving down in the first.
Cleveland seemed to have neverending picks, but who knows what they will do with them?
I think that Myles Garrett was a great pick for Cleveland, but they need a lot more help than just one guy.
That's true, there are too many teams that are more complete than them for it to matter now.
I think Denver is just a few new people away from another Super Bowl.
What Denver really needs is a quarterback, but I don't know who will step up.
I think that they should've traded for someone, but John Elway is all in with the guys he has already.
That could be their downfall, like last year.
They do have Paxton Lynch, who seems very young but promising. I think if anyone can help him, it's Elway.
Oh for sure Elway has a way with quarterbacks since he has so much experience of his own.
I do think he should really step aside and let his coach make some decisions though because he might be getting too emotional.
Yeah, I don't know much about the new coach, but I do know that he has a successful background and should make for an interesting coach in Denver.
With that Denver defense it has to be a coach's dream job. Von Miller is crazy talented.
Von is one of the top talents in the league, but he needs an offense to keep him off the field more.
Denver defense helped them limp through so many games last season.
I can't wait to see their new players start to make an impact!
