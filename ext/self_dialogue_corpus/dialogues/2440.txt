All I know is that I am expecting a great year for football.
Yea, there should be lots of excitement.
I agree. Lots of teams could really make some noise.
Yea, what do you think about the Steelers?
They really have a team, but they can't seem to get over the hump.
Yea, well they always get so far, but never far enough.
Yea, it seems like they stop short every year.
Yea, they do, but the definitely have some playmakers. They should win.
Yea, as long as those playmakers can actually stay on the field.
Yea, Bell sure has a hard time doing that it seems.
Yea, they have a strong passing game though and they are really good.
Yea, Big Ben has always been a talent when he is on the field.
Yea, when he is on the field is an accurate statement. He has to prove that he can be more.
Yea, well he takes a lot of hits.
Yea, they have to do a better job of protecting him. Thats for sure.
I agree! Thats something that they have been unable to do.
Yea, they have. Its tough to win without protecting the quarterback.
Yea, well if they can start to do that, they can win.
Yea, that is really important.
I agree, but they still may not be better than the Patriots.
