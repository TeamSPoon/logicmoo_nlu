So you seen any good Disney movies lately?
Naw.  I'm not a fan of cartoon movies.
You mean animated movies.  They are a lot better then cartoons.  I love em.
Well, all the same I prefer real people to animation that's all.
All right.  You know Disney doesn't just do animation though.
Good point.  I really like the Chronicles of Naria series.
Excellent fantasy series, agreed.  How about serious movies like Remember the Titans.
Great movie. Or I guess, some of those old comedy's like Parent trap.
They actually did a remake of that not too long ago.
That was back in the late 90's with Lindsay Lohan.  I remember that one.
