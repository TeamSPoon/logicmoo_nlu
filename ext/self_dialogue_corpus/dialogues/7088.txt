hey did you watch the new finding nemo movie?
no i didnt even know a new one came out
yeah it was called finding dory
oh, wow that sounds crazy awesome
Yeah i didnt get a chance to catch it but i was just glad to hear a sequel had come out
good point, didnt the first one come out a while back?
yeah it did, so most of the people who watched it were probably people in their twenties
that sounds about right, the first one was so good
yeah, i liked nemo and how much he tried despite his small fin
he was surely a trooper, i wonder if the new one lived up to the hype.
