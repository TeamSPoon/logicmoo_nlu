Have you seen any good horror flicks lately?
It's been a while actually. How about you?
I did just see A Serbian Film, directed by Srdjan Spasojevic. That was really intense.
Oh, yeah? How so?
Well it was really grotesque and difficult to watch.
Aren't all horror films like that?
Yeah, but this was one was more like Salo.
Is that the movie based on the Marquis de Sade novel?
Exactly, and anything written by him is going to be a difficult watch.
Sounds like not something I'd want to watch.
