What is the last movie you watched?
That would have to be Moana.
Is that one of the recent Disney movies?
Yes, that's right.
What did you think of it?
It was fun. Some of the songs were enjoyable too.
Only some of them?
Yeah - I mean, that's how it is with musicals, for me. I like some of the songs, but not all.
I liked the South Pacific type ones.
Yeah! Those were fun - plus, the folklore of the area.
Yeah, I didn't realize that the Hawaiian Islands were named after various deities or incidents.
It kind of makes it more fun.
And I did like Maui, in Moana.
He was awesome! The "tortured soul" type.
Did you know he was voiced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson?
No way! That's too cool.
One other thing: did you realize that "Moana" means "deep water"?
I didn't, but that's really fitting! What language is it?
Maori or Hawaiian.
Wow, that will definitely help me enjoy this movie more!
