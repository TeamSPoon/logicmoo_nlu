Did you ever see Gone Girl?
Is that the thriller about the girl who gets kidnapped?
It is! It is based on a book.
That movie was so scary I heard. People felt that way because it seemed so real.
Neil Patrick Harris & Tyler Perry were particularly excellent in the film.
Ben Affleck was one of the stars too, right?
Yes, he was the leading man of the film and the one who is accused of kidnapping.
Did he actually kidnap her though?
It is more complicated than that.
I guess I will have to see it to find out!
