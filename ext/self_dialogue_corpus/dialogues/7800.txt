What is the best Hermoine line from the Harry Potter films?
I think I loved every single thing she said in those movies.
She was always the voice of reason.
My favorite bit is in the beginning where hermione goes I'm going to bed before you get us killed or worse expelled cracks me up every time.
She gets so corrupted by the end of the films.
By the end, she is brewing illegal potions and doing all sorts of things she should not be.
I loved when she punched Draco!
That was gold. She just loses her usual cool, and bam!
He looks so lost. Like he did not believe she would.
She had to deal with so much, and be called a "Mud-blood".
