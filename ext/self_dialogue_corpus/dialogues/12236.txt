Do you like the Star Wars movies?
They are pretty epic
What do you think are the oddest creatures?
The flying bug that was Anakin's slave master was silly
He should not have been able to fly
The cantina band were odd
There was a green creature in Jaba's palace that sang who was funny looking
The Ewoks were very strange
The tentacle creatures in Rogue One was scary
Jabba's monster was also scary
