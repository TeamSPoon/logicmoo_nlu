I watched a great movie last night.
What was it called?
It was called Why Him?
Oh I missed that one.
You have to watch it.
Why do you say that?
It was really great.
It received lackluster reviews.
The reveiwers are lame people.
Please explain more.
The movie was extremely funny and modern.
Oh so maybe it offended people.
Yes I think so.
Was it entirely slapstick?
No there was great wit.
Ok I appreciate that.
Yes it combined many elements of good comedy.
What do you mean?
There was visual as well as intellectual humor.
Ok thank you for the solid recommendation.
