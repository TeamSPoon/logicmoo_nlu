I think retiring was a stupid thing for Garth Brooks to do.
Who is Garth Brooks?
Seriously?
Seriously.
He used to be one of the biggest country music singers in the world.
Well, that explains why I've never heard of him.
You never listen to country music?
Not if I can help it.
Have you ever given it a chance?
Nope. Why should I? It's all the same.
You know, some country music has crossed over into pop?
And I probably don't listen to that either.
Glad to see you have an open mind.
Hey, country music is all about losing your love, losing your truck, missing your train.
And you know this how? Considering you've never listened to it.
Because that's what it's alway been about.
Oh, I see. So because that's what country was fifty years, that's what it will always be.
Tell me I'm wrong.
So, Country is all about trucks and trains? And rock is all about the Beatles and Motown, right?
No!
