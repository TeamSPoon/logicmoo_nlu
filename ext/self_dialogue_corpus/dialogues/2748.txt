How do you like the Colts this year?
Kind of mixed on them to be honest.
Really?  Seems like they could break out.
To me, they've been a disappointment as of late.
I remember thinking a few years ago that they would be perennial contenders.
Right, but Andrew Luck is a bit overrated.
It seems like everyone slotted him to be the best thing since white bread.
They did, but he's arguably not even a top ten QB in the league.
Maybe they just gave him too much credit to fast.
He's got some good receivers though.
Yep.  I love me some TY Hilton.
That dude is a jitterbug for sure.
And they have speed on the opposite side too.
Yeah, that guy who played at Miami.
Phillip Dorsett is his name.  Arguably the fastest pair of receivers in the league.
Isn't their defense suspect though?
It's not the greatest.  I think they signed a lot of free agents this year.
I do like Vontae Davis though.
Yeah, a bit of a down year last year, but a good player.
They stole that guy from Miami.
