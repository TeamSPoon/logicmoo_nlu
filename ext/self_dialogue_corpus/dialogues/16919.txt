You know a genre I recently came across that I absolutely enjoy?
What is it?
A capella!
Oh I love A capella! I listen to it all the time.
Nice. I watched an A capella concert at my college and it was amazing.
My college has a lot too. It's really unique and straight up impressive.
Yeah so seeing it live was amazing.
Have you heard of Pentatonix?
No what's that.
I'll give you a hint. Pentatonix, Pentatones.
Oh, it's an a capella group?
The best a capella group. Look them up sometime. They're professionals and really famous,
I didn't realize there were famous a capella groups.
It's a whole culture. Pentatonix actually does covers of major songs.
Do you think their covers are better than the originals?
Some are worse, but some hit it out of the park.
Wow, I should check them out.
Yeah. When I first found out about them, I couldn't stop watching their videos.
Oh no. If I watch them, I won't be able to appreciate my college's a capella group anymore!
That could happen!
