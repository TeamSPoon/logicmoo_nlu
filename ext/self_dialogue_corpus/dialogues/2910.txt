The NFL season is almost here!
I can't wait. Should be a good year.
I have the Raiders to win it all.
No way, my money is on the Patriots.
The Patriots run is over. They got away from what made them great.
How do you figure that.
Their bread and butter was taking third stringers from another team and making them a star.
They have done that plenty of times.
Yeah, but this year they went and signed star players during free agency. Messed up their mojo.
Maybe, but Brady is still their.
Brady is a product of the system. He is good but their are alot of players that would be good in that system.
Well how are you picking the Raiders?
Dude, they were almost there last year until Carr broke his leg.
Yeah, him going down hurt them.
And they added players on offense that only makes them better.
Beastmode is washed up. He has been out a year and didn't do anything his last year in Seattle because he was hurt.
He has a year of rest and my personal oppinion is the last year in Seattle had more to do with not handing him the ball at the 1 yard line than injuries.
We shall see. I will say after the Patriots, the Raiders probably have the best shot.
The Raiders play the Pats in Mexico this year. That could be for the AFC.
Should be a good game.
