The Super Bowl is such a fascinating phenomenom. It's like a holiday but not.
What do you mean? Isn't it a way of life?
There are so many interesting fact about the viewers of the Super Bowl. It would totally blow your mind.
Really like what?
Did you know we Americans eat approximately 1.25 billion chicken wings on Super Bowl weekend?
That is a lot of wings. I can honestly say I've done my part.
Well then you need about 50 million cases of beer on Super Bowl weekend, which is a tab of more than $10.8 billion to wash all that chicken down!
Ahhh beer and chicken wings.....
Yep, I've done my part on that front too. Love the beer. It makes the game better even if my favorite teams aren't playing.
Did you know the average Super Bowl-watching party has at least 17 guests?
That's a good amount of people to feed and water.
Speaking of water...During Super Bowl halftime, there are an estimated 90 million toilet flushes.
Ha! That's from all the beer!
Well it's the equivalent  to 180 million gallons of water flowing at once, or 3.5 minutes of flowing water on the Niagara Falls!
Holy cow! That's a lot toilet flushing!
Well, I didn't even mention the pizza! There is more pizza is sold on Super Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year!
I would have never thought that, but it makes sense. I've done my share of that too.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites...along with the chicken wings, beer and nachos!
Yeah well that explains why antacid sales increase by 20% the day after the Super Bowl!
I imagine there are quite a few struggling with hang overs too.
