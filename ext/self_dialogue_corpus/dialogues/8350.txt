Who are you listening to in regards to pop music?
Bruno Mars has been getting a lot of hits in my playlist
Oh, I loved Uptown funk
Yeah it had a real nice beat!
I loved how retro it sounded, his new direction is really great
You should listen to That's What I Like
What does it sound like
It has a 70s vibe to it
Cool, I prefer some of the old fashioned stuff
Me too, it's some of his best work
