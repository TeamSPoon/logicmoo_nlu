Probably Joni Mitchell, she's got an amazing voice.
So you like folk music? I'm fond of Simon and Garfunkel.
Oh, I like them quite a bit. Pity they're not always on the best of terms.
Yeah. I think they're one of the greatest American duos.

Probably America, just a beautiful tune.
I hum that tune all the time.
It's incredibly catchy, no? What's yours?
I like Sounds of Silence a lot.
