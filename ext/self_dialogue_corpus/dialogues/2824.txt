Are you ready for some NFL football?
I love both college and NFL. Football season is my favorite time of the year.
Which Florida team will have the best record this year?
I think it will be Tampa Bay. They have a strong offense.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are stacked with running backs though.
I know they just drafted Leonard Fournette.
They still have Chris Ivory and T.J. Yeldon too.
They will be able to run the ball no question.
Tampa Bay has running backs amd receivers though.
Winston is a good quarterback. He will continue to develop.
I can't wait to draft Mike Evans in fantasy this year. That guy always puts up points.
He is a top 3 receiver. You better grab him quick.
The Miami Dolphins will strugglr again this season.
It seems like every year they have a glimpse of hope and then fade off again.
The state of Florida has 3 NFL teams and they can't even get one to make the playoffs.
Tampa Bay may have a chance this year.
I hope so. I watch all their games.
They have tough rivals in the Saints and Falcons.
The Falcons choked big time in the Superbowl.
At least they made it to the Superbowl.
