Does Adam Sandler still make movies at all?
The last one I saw him in came out a few years ago, I think it was called Blended.
Who else was in that movie?
Drew Barrymore - she's in a lot of Adam Sandler movies.
I hadn't noticed. What other movies are they in together?
She played Julia on The Wedding Singer.
That's right! I loved that movie, especially when they're on the plane with Billy Idol.
My favorite part is where the old lady raps Rapper's Delight.
The Wedding Singer has a lot of good music in it.
It really showcases Adam Sandler's musical skills.
