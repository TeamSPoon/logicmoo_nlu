What is a good, heavy rock band to listen to?
Do you like Metallica? They're pretty awesome.
Yeah but I don't like their newer stuff. They're a completely different band these day than from their early days.
That's for sure. After The Black album, they completely changed their sound.
Yeah, they went from a metal band to more of a hard rock band. Nothing they do now sounds like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets.
I guess when musicians get older it's difficult to maintain the same intensity as when they were younger and angrier.
Their newer album, Hardwired sounds a little like their early albums. It reminds me of Kill 'Em All.
I've heard a couple song off of that album and yeah, it's better than most of their post-Black album music.
I think when Jason Newsted left the band is when they really went downhill. Maybe even after Cliff Burton died.
I'd almost agree about them changing after Cliff Burton died but And Justice For All was a pretty heavy album. That was the last good album from Metallica though.
