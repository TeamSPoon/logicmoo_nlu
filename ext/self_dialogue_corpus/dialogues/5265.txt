Did Fantasia make any sense to you?
No, but I don't think it was supposed to?
How do you mean?
Well, it was sort of just music and imagery right? There was no narrative.
No, there definitely was not. I was not expecting that.
Well, it's still art isn't it?
I suppose. It was pretty bold for the 1940s. No kid could have sat through that.
No, but it was still stimulating.
And beautiful. The animation was really quite good.
Yeah, they were sort of interpretive vignettes eh?
