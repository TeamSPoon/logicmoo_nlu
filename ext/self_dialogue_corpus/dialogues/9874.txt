You've seriously never heard of Public Enemy?
No man, I don't think so.
They're like one of the most popular rap groups of all time!
Oh, rap is young people music.
Almost a third of their studio albums are older than me, that's not exactly young.
You really like them?
Yeah I mean, I have their song Can't Truss It stuck in my head right now.
You should introduce me to them sometime.
Yeah definitely. I think we can skip their album It Takes a Nation but a couple of my favourite albums of theirs are Yo Bum Rush the Show and Fear of a Black Planet.
Sounds good!
