Whose your favorite teacher at Hogwart's
Oh definitely Professor McGonagal. I love her.
She's mine too! She's so proper and elegant. I love Maggie Smith in all her movies.
Me too, she's such a cute older lady. I like Dumbledore too but he's a little more distant.
That's true. Other than the teachers I'm fond of Hagrid.
Oh so am I. He's such a sweet soul.
He really is, and always there for the kids when they need him.
He's definitely an ally. Loved him ever since he swept Harry away to Hogwart's.
Oh that was such a pivotal moment. Changed Harry's life forever.
I was just glad to see him get away from the Dursleys. They were awful people.
