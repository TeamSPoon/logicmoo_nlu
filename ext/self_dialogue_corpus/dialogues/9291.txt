Which do you prefer? East coast hip hop or West Coast hip hop?
I live on the East coast so I want to say East coast, even though I'm not sure I know what the difference is.
There's a difference in terms of rapping style. It's always been a topic of discussion and feud over which is better.
Give me some examples of artists from each coast.
Some East coast rappers are Jay Z from Brooklyn, and Nas from Queens
And on the west coast there's Snoop Dogg.
Exactly! Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. One of the biggest rivalries that best shows the East vs West feud was the rivalry between Tupac and Bigge
Tupac was from the west and Biggie from the East right?
That's right.
It's hard to choose sides when both coasts have such great talent!
