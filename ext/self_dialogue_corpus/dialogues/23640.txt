Bronx Tale is a great movie. Have you ever seen that?
Yes. That's with De Niro, right?
Yes. We had it on the other day. My daughter couldn't believe the racism in it back then.
Yes, that movie covered both the mafia and racism.
It was done very good.
I liked the head guy. What was his name?
Do you mean the mob boss?
Yes. He's a good actor.
Sonny was the character.  I think that was Chazz Palminteri.
Yeah, thats who it was.
He was a likeable mafia boss.
That was a very good movie. I forgot about that.
Of course, Joe Pesci had to be in it. He's in so many mafia movies.
Yes, he is. He fits the role.
I can't remember what year that movie came out.
It was in the nineties I know. I was already married.
Doesn't seem that old.
If they rereleased it, no one would ever know.
No they wouldn't. Same stuff still goes on now.
Yes, sad but true.
