I cannot believe you are listening to that Barry Manilow music again.
What can I say, his music was the soundtrack to my youth. He has an impressive play list.
I have to admit when I hear those songs played back to back he did stack up an large amount of hits.
He really did. I think he is very under appreciated.
Do you have a favorite song or do you simply love all of them?
Boy that is a hard one. I loved Weekend In New England and Somewhere in the Night.
Those were pretty. I preferred Elton John and Neil Diamond from that time period.
They have great tunes too. I loved some of their songs.
Music is so different now. I wonder if a song like Forever in Blue Jeans would be a hit these days.
I don't know. The three of them have created some classics for sure.
I think Elton John has done a decent job of staying on top of trends. I think he has a few more hits in him.
He may, I would love to see him do a duet with someone more current.
I really like his duet with Celine. Now there is a woman who can hit a note.
That is a fact. I can live without ever hearing My Heart Will Go On again, but man, can she belt out a song.
I do have several of her albums. They are pretty timeless if you ask me.
I agree 100%. A person who can sing with that kind of tone and range will never go out of style.
She still has a beautiful voice. I don't like her quite as much as Lady Gaga but she is close.
Lady Gaga is much better to dance to or do a workout to. I love the beats in her music.
Yes, but some of her songs, once played, keep repeating in my brain over and over.
She sure does know how to create a hook. I will never tire of her music.
