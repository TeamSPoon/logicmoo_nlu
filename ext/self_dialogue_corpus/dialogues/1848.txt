Who do you think is the best wide receiver in the NFL right now?
Antonio Brown is the best.
Are you sure? He is good but is he the best?
Statistically yes, he gets open all the time
Don't you think Roethlisberger has a lot to do with that?
Of course but it is part of the game, a great QB usually makes great WR
I wonder how good he would be if he was on the Jets.
Considering they have no QB, I would say awful
You are making my case for me by saying that.
A WR cant throw to themselves so a QB is a necessity.
What about Randy Moss? He got open on many teams regardless of who the QB was
Did you forget about his time with the Raiders?
He had one great year with over 1000 yds and 8 TDs with the Raiders
But his second year was awful. Especially considering how much they gave up to get him
So do you think Moss is worse than Brown?
Not a chance, Moss was better but Brown is great in his own way
Yeah it is hard to compare them both since the size comparison is different.
Plus Moss played until he was 35 years old
True, Brown could come close is statistics when it is all said and done
Unlikely, Moss was too good early in his career.
