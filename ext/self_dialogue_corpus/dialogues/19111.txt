What kind of music do you like listening to?
Mostly rock, but sometimes I like listening to classical.
Do you buy a lot of music?
No, I usually listen to it on the radio.
Do you stream music at all?
Yeah, once in a while?
Do you use a particular app to stream music?
Not really. I just get whatever is available.
I use Pandora a lot when I want to listen to radio.
I've tried Pandora. It's pretty good.
Spotify is pretty good too.
I haven't tried that yet, but I'm planning to.
You can find a lot of music on YouTube and Google Play Music. Google Play Music you have to subscribe to.
Is it expensive?
You only have to pay if you want to get the ad-free version.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. It's probably worth paying for that.
Who is your favorite group?
I don't have one favorite, but my top groups are ACDC and The Who.
Do you listen to other genres of music besides rock and classical?
I listen to country sometimes.
