I think Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift was a horrid movie.
Really? I thought the movie was pretty good. Why didn't you like it?
The acting was pathetic and it just really didn't fit in with the other two. I mean come on Paul and Vin were nowhere in it and their interation made the ones before.
Well, I guess you have a point, but I thought the change of scenery was pretty cool and the cultural shift intrigued me.
The change in scenery doesn't excuse that kids horrible accent and just all around bad acting skills.
Well, which one did you like the most?
I really think the original Fast and Furious was the best out of all of them. You got the whole feeling of Paul Walker and his loyalty first to the police and then to Vin
Oh ya! Isn't that when the term Busta came into play? During that movie?
Yes! It Did! When they were at the party Dom was like Busta id the only one that kept me outta cuffs! That was great!
I really should watch the first one again it's been so long!
