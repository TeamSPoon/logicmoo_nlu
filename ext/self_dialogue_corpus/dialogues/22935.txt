Hey, have you heard of the movie called, "The Great Wall"?
Umm, no. I'd never heard of it. Who are the actors?
Oh really? It is Matt Damon and that one guy from game of thrones show.
Which guy?
Dude name is Pedro Pascal. It is that one guy where his eyes were pulled out or something in game of thrones.
Ooooh that guy! Yea I remember him now.
Anyways, that movie the great wall. I mean I hear people saying it was bad. I wasn't that bad. Considering Matt Damon got paid alot for this movie.
I see. I never heard of the movie. Is it an American movie?
Yea kind a. Matt is the main character in the movie. It was interesting to see chinese and american action together.
How was the action?
It is part ninja action and some good sparta actions.
Hahaha that sounds interesting. Maybe I should watch it. Where did you find this movie?
Oh my boyfriend showed it to me last night. I was pretty skeptical but I stayed awake the entire time watching it.
Oh that is interesting, you usually fall asleep when you watch action movies hahaha.
I know right? Even my boyfriend thought it was suprising. He on the other hand fell asleep while I watch the entire ending.
It must be that great. Was there any romance in it?
There was a little with Matt Damon and the chinese girl which is the only main female character in the movie.
