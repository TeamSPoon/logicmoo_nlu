I saw the new Beauty in The Beast movie last night.
Oh ya, and how was it?
It was amazing you should really see it.
I'm not sure, is there a lot of singing in it?
Yes but it is all very good.  And Emma Watson is beautiful in it.
Oh she is beautiful.
And it has gotten great reviews.
71% on rotten tomatoes!
And it is Disney.  They rarely make a bad movie.
You are right about that.
