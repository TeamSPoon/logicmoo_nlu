What was your favorite Beatles album?
Wow, how do you choose?
You could make pretty much an argument for any album.
Yeah, their catalog is so huge.
So what would you choose?
Probably the White album.
I was thinking the same thing really.
You could make a great case for Sgt. Pepper though.  That was pretty influential.
When you're the Beatles, everything you do is influential.
Not sure they'll ever be matched.
