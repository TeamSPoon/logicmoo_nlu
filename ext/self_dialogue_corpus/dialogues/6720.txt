Have you heard about the movie Gigantic?
No, what is it?
It's basically Disney's version of Jack and the Beanstalk.
Oh!  Well, at least that's original.  I've never seen that as a movie before.
Yeah, it comes out next year.
Depending on how it looks, I might actually see this one.
I wish Disney still did animated cartoons instead of that Pixar looking stuff.
I feel the same way.  They don't make em like they used to.
You'd think it would cost less to do it the older way.  I hear people all the time wishing they would go back to that.
I wish Disney had a channel on tv where it just showed the 90s cartoons they did.
