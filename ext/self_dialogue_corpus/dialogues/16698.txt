I love concerts. When was the last time you went to see something live?
I think it was a few months ago.
Wow, it has been a while. Who did you see?
I saw a band called Old Dominion downtown. Have you heard of them?
I think so. They have a song on country radio, right?
Yeah, they had one big hit last year.
That's cool. I went to see a jazz band at a local bar a last night.
What bar?
A new bar opened in downtown called Regressive, and they have live music every Thursday night.
That sounds fun. Do you have to pay to get in.
No cover charge. The band's pianist was the best I've ever seen.
Did they have a saxophone too?
I don't remember seeing a saxophone, but they did have a trumpet.
Did you know that I can play the trumpet?
Really! Would you be able to show me a song?
Absolutely. What is your favorite jazz song?
I'm not sure that I know any songs by name. Play me your favorite.
My favorite artist is Sidney Bechet, so I'll play you one of those songs.
Never heard of them. Why is Sidney your favorite?
The music is classic, original jazz from before it was popular.
