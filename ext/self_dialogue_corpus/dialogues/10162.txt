Guess what action movie we watched last night.
I don't know. There's so many.
Your favorite one, Die Hard.
With Bruce Willis. Yes a favorite.
That movie is just great. It will never be boring no matter how many times you watch it.
I love it. John McClain, a classic character.
Did you like the second one too.
Is that the one in the airport?
Yes.
Yeah, that one was great too.
