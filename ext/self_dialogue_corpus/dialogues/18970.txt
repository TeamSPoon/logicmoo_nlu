Do you listen to Casting Crowns?
Of course! I love Christian music.
They are so great. Everytime I hear a new song, I get excited.
Me too! I have the Until the Whole World hears album.
I really enjoy that album. I have their Thrive album.
I like that album too. I have been listening to them since 2006.
That's cool. I know they started in 1999.
Yeah but I didn't find out about them until later.
The song called Lifesong is my favorite. It really touched my heart.
I know what you mean. I love that song.
Mark Hall has a great voice. He put the band together.
That is pretty cool. They all have an amazing voice.
Yes! I have always wanted to go to their concert.
Me too! We should find one coming up soon.
That's a great idea!
They formed in Daytona, Florida.
Yeah! Our home state!
They moved to Georgia which is pretty cool too.
That's a beautiful place to live. Let's find some tour tickets!
Yes! Let's do that!
