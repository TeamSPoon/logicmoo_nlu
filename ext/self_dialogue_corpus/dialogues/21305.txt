Did you see the Disney movie Moana?
No I haven't yet, but I want to.
It is the cutest movie. I just love it.
Is that about the Hawaiian girl?
Yes, I have watched it at least 30 times.
Is it that good?
I think so.  It is absolutely the best one I have seen in a very long time.
Well maybe I'll watch it tonight.
Remember what my favorite animated movie of all time was?
Yes I remember, it was A Bug's Life, right?
Yes, but Moana passed that up now.
Wow, you really liked A bug's Life, you watched it over and over.
I know, but Moana is the best now. Some movie had to be better sooner or later.
True, but it's been years.
I know. Promise me you'll watch it.
Ok I'll watch it tonight.
But you have to watch it at least three times.
3 times? Why?
Not all the same night.  But 3 times will show you how good an idea it was, whoever thought of it.
Ok, i sure will, I understand what your saying.
