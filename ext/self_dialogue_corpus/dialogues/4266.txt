Have you ever watched the bourne movies
Nah  i have not
They are pretty cool
What are they about
They are sort of like james bond but more thriller than cheesy
That sounds cool
I wish that they had more multi media for the universe though
What do you mean
Well their is movies but other types of things would be nice
I guess
