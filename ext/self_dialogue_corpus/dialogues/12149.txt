I just saw Return of the Jedi.
Which version did you see?
The 1997 version.
Did you notice any differences?
The song in Jabba's palace was changed.
Wow.  What else?
Nine new members were added to the band!
It's a blur.  What else?
They got rid of Ewok Celebration at the end.
No way!  That was my favorite song in the movie.
