Did you know that Disney is making more live action movies?
Yes, I heard that.  Do you know which ones?
I don't know all of them, but I read that they are remaking The Little Mermaid and Mulan, a couple of my favorites.
I am looking forward to seeing those.
Yes, I saw the remake of Cinderella a couple of years ago with Lily James.  She made such a perfect Cinderella.
I saw it too.  The computer generated special effects were stunning.
Yes, I thought so too.  The scenes with the pumpkin coach and mice footmen were spectacular.
I really enjoyed watching Cinderella magically change into the ballgown. It looked so real.
Yes, that was beautiful.  I'm excited to see how the new ones turn out.
So am I.  I expect they will be very well done like most Disney movies.
