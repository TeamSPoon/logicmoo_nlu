I am very happy that blink-182 is still around.
Yeah same, Matt Skiba has done a great job filling in for Tom DeLonge.
The deluxe edition of California was even better than California itself.
Agreed, the collection of songs on there were really strong.
Especially so, and when stacked up against the original CD it's one of their best albums.
I completely agree with you, the deluxe edition tracks have a harder edge.
Yeah they contrast really well with the brighter songs on the original release.
Do you think we'll get another album with Skiba?
They've found themselves in immense success with him, I can't imagine they wouldn't.
I'm really curious to see what Tom puts out with Angels and Airwaves as a response to blink's newfound success.
