You know what movie I watched the other day?  Bram Stoker's Dracula.
Oh, I haven't seen it in a while.  I remember liking Gary Oldman in it.
Of course!  He's outstanding in it.
When he was old dracula, that makeup was amazing looking!
Yes, and his accent is pretty good, too.
He can play anything, and I'd believe it.
You know who's really bad in the movie?  Keanu Reeves.
Oh man, he's a terrible actor.
I wonder why Coppola cast him in it?
I don't know.  He ruined the scenes he was in, but it's still a good film.
