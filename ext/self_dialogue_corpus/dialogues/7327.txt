Have you seen the new live action Beauty and The Beast?
I haven't and have little interest, wouldn't want to potientialy tarnish the original one.
Why do you like the classic film so much?
What is there not to like? It has classic songs, great characters, even Angela Lansbury did one of the voices, you can't beat that.
Hmm maybe I need to watch it again.
If you watch it with the right mindset, you will realize that while the story may seem silly, it's relevant in real life.
In what way would it be relevant?
We'll look at the fact that Belle falls in love with The Beast, goes to show that there's more to loving someone than outwardly appearance.
Well I suppose that would be a good lesson to learn.
It really is and something a lot of us could learn from, here's to you Beauty and The Beast!
