I always love watching The Breakfast Club.
Me too. It's so funny how worked up Mr. Vernon gets.
I know. I love when he and Bender are going back and forth.
It makes me laugh every time.
One of my favorite parts is when Allison knows all of Brian's information, and he is so freaked out.
Haha. My favorite part is when Claire gives Allison a makeover.
I know, and it's so sweet how Andrew says he can now see her face.
I thought it was nice that the most unlikely couples got together.
Me too, but I felt bad that Brian didn't have anybody.
Yeah, but I think it's nice that he realized he doesn't have to be perfect.
That's true. He was able to write the essay at the end in only a few lines on who they were.
Have you seen any other movies with the 'Brat Pack'?
No, but I have seen The Outsiders with Emilio Estevez.
You know what?
What?
I never knew that Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen were brothers until recently.
Really? They look alike.
I just never realized it.
They both starred in Young Guns.
I know. I love that movie.
