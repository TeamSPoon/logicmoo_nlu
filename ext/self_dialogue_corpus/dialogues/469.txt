What NFL team is gonna win it all next year?
I think this is the Vikings year.
Really?
Yes, I love their team.
They have not been good since Culpepper
Don't forget Carter and Moss.
They had a good team back then
They still do
So you are a big Minnesota fan?
Yes
Who else do you like?
I like the Packers
They are from Green Bay right?
Yes
I like their team
I miss Brett Favre though
He was great
Yeah, he might be the best quarterback ever.
I agree
I think Tom Brady could give him a run for his money though
