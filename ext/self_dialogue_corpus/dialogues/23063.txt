What's your favorite comedy?
My favorite comedy is Deadpool.
Deadpool is not a comedy.
Oh I beg to differ.
It's a comic book movie. Not a comedy.
Then why is it funnier than ninety percent of the supposed comedies that have come out in the past ten years?
I have to admit it is hilarious.
Would you admit it's funnier than "We're the millers"?
Yeah I can agree to that.
And "We're the Millers" is a comedy, yes?
I see your point. But it's still considered a comic book movie.
Movies can share genres.
I mean primarily.
Primarily, yes it is a comic book movie but it's also a comedy.
So I think I see where you're going with this.
Yep. Deadpool is my favorite comedy.
So do you consider the other comic book movies comedies? They all have humor in them.
They're funny sometimes but nothing like Deadpool. Spiderman may come close.
Spiderman is always funny but I doubt it will be as funny as Deadpool.
We'll see when it comes out.
