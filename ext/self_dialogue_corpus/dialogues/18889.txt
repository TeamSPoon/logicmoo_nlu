Did your parents ever make you take music lessons.
Yes they did.
What did you learn to play.
Well I wanted guitar lessons but my mom made me take flute lessons
Yea, guitar lessons would have been better. I took Piano lessons.
Can you still play?
I can play one song. Evening Chimes.
I can play Yankee Doodle Dandy on the flute but that is it.
I did not care for piano lessons when I was young.
Or flute lessons.
I really wish I had taken it more seriously, maybe I would be able to play like Liberace now.
Myabe but I doubt it, he was one of a kind.
That's true.
He could really play piano.
Yes he was quite a showman.
And the outfits he wore were outrageous!
Yea similar to some of those fancy Elvis outfits.
Yes you are right.
Maybe I should take piano lessons again.
Maybe you should!
