Did you hear about the rap artist Prodigy?
Yeah i heard that he passed away.
Sad day for all Mobb Deep fans.
How did he die anyway?
Some people say it was due to sickle cell but i read online that he might have choked on an egg.
That's so crazy if that was the case.
I have a friend that got to watch him perform the night of his death.
I heard about that show, i even seen online footage of it.
He announced that he had a new album coming out soo  that he's been working on.
I wonder if they will release it to the public now that he died.
Oh i am sure they will, they wont pass up the chance to make some money off of him.
I still got a couple Mobb Deep c.ds in my car.
I know right, i was listening to Hell on Earth yesterday.
That is probably one of my favorites next to Murda Musik.
The music industry been losing a lot of artist recently.
I still can't believe Prince is dead. He is a freaking legend!
True story. Prince made classic that will stand the test of time.
You could go back and listen to a Prince album and still find some hidden gems.
Musicians need to start taking better care of their health.
Ah, it's the sex, drugs, and rock n roll lifestyle.
