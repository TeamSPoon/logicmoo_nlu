Can anyone stop the Rangers right now?
Heck no! This team is on fire at the moment.
They beat the Tigers last night 5-3. 10 wins in a row!
They are smoking hot! DId you see how far Gallo's home run traveled?
Yeah 445 feet. He crushed that ball!
I didn't think that ball was ever coming down.
Mike Napoli also hit a home run last night as well.
Yeah they are getting great production from their main guys.
They also got a good outing from Nick Martinez
Yeah he only gave up 1 unearned run over 5 innings.
Great hitting and good pitching is definitely a formula for success.
I agree. Though they did struggle a little bit to close out that game
Matt Bush was definitely making me nervous. I didn't know if he was going to survive.
He definitely had some tense moments out there
Yeah it was a good win though, but keep in mind Detroit didn't have Cabrera or Martinez in the lineup.
Yeah, but that's not the Rangers fault. You got to perform against whomever is out there.
Yep, you are right. At the end of the day a win is a win.
It sure is. Now it's going to be interesting to see if they can keep this streak going.
I think they will they have A.J. Girffin starting tomorrow. He's been a stud.
Yeah he is 4-0 trying to stay undefeated.
