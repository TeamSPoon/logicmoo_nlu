So, have you ever heard of pop punk ?
No.  It sounds a little stupid though.
Yeah, I know it 'sounds' stupid, but it was kind of the music of my time.  It doesn't sound too bad when you realize that some people call it 'emo'.
Yeah, I remember emo.
Most people think emo was just 'Dashboard Confessional', but pretty much all the bands of that time were 'emo' or 'pop punk'.
I remember liking 'Hot Hot Heat' and a couple other songs from that time period.
Yeah, it wasn't bad time period.  It just got crippled with the label emo.
I kind of wish that had got more into what real punk was you know, rebellion.
You know that isn't fair.  People think punk was about rebellion, but it really wasn't.
What about Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten with their antics.
They were just musicians.  Most of the punks were just hard working stiffs like you and me.
I find that hard to believe.  How did they work with those haircuts ?
Honestly, most of those particular fans would grow a mohawk for months and shave it off for work the next week.
Bunch of posers, then?
Pretty much.  You find the odd real one, but the vast majority were just wearing costumes.
I mean looking back on it most of the punks in high school were just losers looking for attention.
Yep.
So you liked pop punk or emo a lot then ?
Yep.  It had the punk sound and I like that with less of the pretense.
Word.
