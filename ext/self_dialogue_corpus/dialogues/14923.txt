What is your favorite comedy movie that is also sci fi?
Without a doubt, Galaxy Quest.
I love that movie! Its hilarious.
I really love how it basically makes fun of Star Trek.
Its so odd how they have the guy who plays Snape in Harry Potter.
You mean Alan Rickman?
Yeah, hes an amazing actor.
He really is, he plays so many different roles very well.
Do you remember the quote he says?
By Grapthar's hammer, you shall be avenged.
