Have you seen Dr. Strange yet?
Yeah, I saw it when it was in the theater.
What did you think?
I'm not a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch.
Neither am I, but I thought he did a good job in this movie.
The special effects were really great.
Yeah, I loved the part where all the buildings are moving.
And what did you think of the big action sequence at the end?
Honestly, I'm kind of over destroying cities as the big finale to movies.
It has been done. Although turning back time to fix it was a little different.
I thought the best part was Strange's characterization.
Yeah, just blowing things up isn't enough to make a movie good.
I thought this movie did a good job of establishing who he was as a person.
He started off as kind of a jerk.
Yeah, but he got better.
What do you think of it compared to other Marvel movies?
I liked it better than Age of Ultron but not as well as the first Avengers movie.
But it's still better than the DC movies.
Much better. It was a fun movie to watch!
Yeah, I'm glad I got a chance to see it.
