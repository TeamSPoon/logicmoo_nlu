I think the rap game will suffer once Eminem dies.
He hasnt really been doing much lately.
Yeah but he can still kill a guest appearance
I think they have already moved on
Future is the new supreme ruler
I like Childish Gambino
He is only doing one more album
He doesnt tour much either
He has other options
Yeah the acting part is crap though
