How did you feel about moana?
I liked that she was a modern day girl but the story was still in the past.
Yea, she didn't even have a love interest in the movie.
I wish the pig was the main sidekick instead of Hei Hei.
I agree. I loved the music in it. I think Lin Manuel Miranda did really good with the songs.
Yea. Did you hear he was going to be in the new Mary poppins movie.
Yea. I wonder if he is helping with the soundtrack again or just acting.
I heard that he's helping with that soundtrack and acting.
I think he signed a deal with Disney to work on multiple soundtracks in the future.
I guess kind of like Phil Collins did Tarzan and brother bear.
