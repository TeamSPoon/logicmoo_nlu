You know I think that makes sense as a reason for Rapunzel's hair being gold...
So that there would be a color scheme?
Yea, I think disney does that a lot.
I think so too.
Like in "Brave," it is turquoise and orange with maybe some greens.
In "The Princess and the Frog," the color scheme is greens, blues golds and maybe purples and browns for Facillier.
With villains, I think you know something truely evil is happening based on how much green is in the frame.
I've read an article about that.
Apparently, the most evil scenes in Disney movies are the greenest.
Like "Be Prepared" in "The Lion King."
