Hey, how do you feel about punk rock music?
You mean like Sex Pistols and Hawk Nelson?
Um, I mean like Reagan Youth, Dead Kennedys and The Dicks.
I've never heard of those. Are they good?
I think so.
Why is it a thing for punk bands to be named after presidents?
I don't know, but they must be on to something. They're both good.
What's Reagan Youth like?
Well they have a younger sound, and a more consistent sound across their albums I think. They actually only put out 2 albums.
And The Dicks?
They have a more reckless, messy sound. There's actually only one song of there's I really like.
What's it called?
Hate the Police. Their song Lifetime Problems is pretty good too, if you like evil laughs.
Oh okay, good to know. I'll give them both a listen.
Both songs or both artists?
I meant both songs, but I'll give both artists a listen too. What was the third artist you mentioned?
Dead Kennedys?
Yeah!
They're pretty popular in the Punk crowd. They did my favourite cover of "I Fought the Law" where they switched up the lyrics a bit to be from the perspective of Dan White.
Very interesting!
