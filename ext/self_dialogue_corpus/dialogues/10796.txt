What do you think of the latest Fast & Furious film?
It's ok but it's getting a little ridiculous now.
What do you mean?
They keep going more over the top with the action.
Oh, it's getting too unrealistic?
Basically, yes, but it's getting too far away from its roots.
You mean the car racing stuff?
Yes, they went away from car racing and focus on heists more now.
Yeah, I liked the first film the best because it was just simple and fun.
Agreed, it used to be about fast, cool cars instead of all this other stuff.
