So i see Houston has to face New England in the third game of the pre-season.
Yes, i'm not looking forward to seeing that game.
Why not?
Well, New england crushed it last season, i don't see why they wouldnt do it again this year.
Hopefully that dynasty will get crushed.
Yes, i'd like to see the Texans take a stab at it.
They got some good draft picks this year, ya never know.
True. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
What day is the Texans / New England?
The 24th. They have to face The Jags and the Bengals first.
Jacksonville will be no problem. They have low stats for years now.
True. They got a couple of good draft pics as well, maybe they could up their stats.
I wouldnt hold my breathe.
I hear ya. Now the Bengals my be a bit of a challenge.
Yeah, but they too didnt do well last year either.
Better than Jacksonville.
Most teams did! LOL!
Anyway, My fingers will be crossed for Houston.
Yeah, we'll see. I think Denver has a shot.
Eww, really? Denver?
