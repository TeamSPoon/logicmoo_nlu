So, are you still a really big NFL fan?
Yes, it is pretty much the only sport that I follow very closely these days.
I thought so. Me and a friend was having a debate at work the other day and I thought about you.
What was the debate about exactly?
We were debating who the best NFL team of all time was.
That is debate that I am sure has taken place millions of times in offices all over the country.
I love talking about the NFL whenever there is down time at work.
So who did you say the best team ever was?
I strongly believe that the 2007 New England Patriot were the best team ever.
Are you serious about that?
Yes I am serious! They got all the way to 18-0 and had Tom Brady and Randy Moss together.
That is true, however, they did not win the Superbowl!
I understand that; but you can not let that undermine what a wonderful season that they had.
They did have a great year, but you can not put them in front of any other team that won the Superbowl in my opinion!
I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one!
So who did your friend have as the best team ever?
He said it was the 1972 Miami Dolphins.
I am not sure if I agree with that one either, but he is way closer than you are!
Hey! Who would you say is the best team ever?
I think I would have to go with the 1985 Chicago Bears.
