What's a blackout?
Excuse me?
Your NFL team is still he Panther's right?
Yes they sure are.
Well sometimes they say they are having a blackout.
Oh, my bad.
Oh now you know what I mean.
Yes it's when they wear the black Jerseys to away games.
Ah, it make since now.
We look really good when we have a black out.
So what's that dab thing ya'll got going around.
Oh you know the dance.
Everybody I see is doing that crazy move.
That's how we dab on them.
It's becoming popular all over.
Yes I love seeing the little kids do it on Facebook.
The Panthers really know how to put on a show.
We in the Carolina's baby. That's our southern charm.
I know that's right.
Win or lose I'm a Panther's fan til I die!
