The Beatles' music is just timeless.
Oh I totally agree with that.
They're relevant even today.
What do you think was their most powerful song?
"I Want to Hold Your Hand."
What makes you choose that one?
It was probably the start of Beatles-mania in the U.S.  It was the first number 1 hit in the U.S.
I did not know that.  But I do really love that song too.
During their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, they played that song, and the rest is history.
That was over 50 years ago, but still so good.
