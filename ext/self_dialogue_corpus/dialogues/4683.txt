Hey are you here I am at Wrigley field?
Shame I won't be making it to the game today.
Awww you won't?
Nah I can't my boss will not let me off early
Are you gonna be able to catch the game at all?
Yeah I will try to watch it in the office
Your boss won't mind that?
Sure he won't as he always does.
Bave a good time and let's talk about the players while we wait.
Rodgers is who is on my mind he is awful its like he cannot hit anything five feet in front of eyes.
I know right? Its like he is a bat or something
I think a bat would be giving him to much credit.
You see carter stats though?
They are almost high enough he will beat the records from like the 50s.
The records are that old geeze.
Most of the new players are nowhere near as good as the old ones.
I would not go quite as far as that some of them are quite good.
But they are not as good precisely.
Let's agree to disagree but I gotta go the games about to start
Well have a good one hopefully I see you on the tube.
