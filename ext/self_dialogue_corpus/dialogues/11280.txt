Did you see the Beatles Cirque show?
I haven't, no. Did you like it?
I haven't seen it either, but I bought the soundtrack.
Was it as good as the soundtrack to Across the Universe?
Yeah, it's really good. But it's hard to compare to the originals.
Well the originals are so good.
Do you have any favorite Beatles tracks?
Norwegian Wood is my all-time favorite.
I liked Sergio Mendes's cover of that one too.
I didn't even know that he covered it!
