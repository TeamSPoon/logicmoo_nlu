Have you been keeping up on the latest rock music?
Yes, I wouldn't miss it for the world. You?
I have been listening to the new song by Metallica!
What's it called?
It's called 'Now that We're Dead' and it's fantastic!
I'll have to check it out. I really like the latest by the Foo Fighters.
They have a new one? What do they call it?
It's called 'Run' and it has some interesting vocals.
I really need to update my playlist and include that.
Me too, I'll have to see the latest rock hits.
