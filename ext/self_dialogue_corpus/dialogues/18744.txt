What is your favorite boy band of all time?
I love Nsync. I always had a huge crush on Lance.
Did you know that he's gay?
Sure, but he's so dreamy.
My parents let me listen to Nysnc but not Spice Girls.
Why? Digital Getdown was definitely not great for a kid to listen to.
I think my mom just didn't like the message of "if you want to be my lover, you gotta get with my friends".
That's actually a better message than a lot of boy bands had sometimes!
Right. I always thought so.
Personally, I prefer the Backstreet Boys.
Seriously? Mmmbop wasn't any better than Tearin Up My Heart.
Are you kidding me? Mmmbop was by Hanson, not BSB.
Well then, who did Quit Playing Games?
That was BSB. I think Nick Carter was the lead on that one.
Wasn't his little brother famous too?
Sure, his name is Aaron. He did some song about candy that was popular, I think.
Nineties music was the best. I feel old but I can barely remember it.
I'll never forget it, Imagine how our parents feel!
True. Their idea of a boyband was The Beatles and Herman's Hermits.
Yup, and The Temptations!
