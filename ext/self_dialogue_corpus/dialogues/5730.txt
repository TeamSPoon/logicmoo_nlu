I have pictures to show you of my kids Trick or Treating last weekend.
Oh how cute. MaryAnn looks adorable. What's her costume character?
She wanted to be Princess Jasmine from the Disney movie Aladdin.
Her costume is beautiful.
Thanks, I made the costume for her.
Wow, it's nice. Was it hard to make?
No, not at all. The Disney website had costume ideas and directions on what to get to make the costume.
How long did it take to make it?
About 45 minutes. MaryAnn loves it so much she wants to keep it to play dress-up in.
I didn't see Aladdin, but the costume is beautiful.
