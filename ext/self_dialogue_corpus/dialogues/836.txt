What do you think are some up and coming teams this year in the NFL?
Up and coming teams. Tampa Bay and Tennessee come to mind.
I could see those two teams. Tampa was in the playoff hunt last year.
And they are playing in the NFC South. Seems like a different team wins that division every year.
It seems that way because it's pretty much true.
Tampa could win that division this year. They have a lot of talent on offense.
Yes, Jameis Winston and Mike Evans will continue to put up big numbers.
I could see them as a 10-6 or 11-5 team.
11 and 5 might be stretching it. But yes, I definitely could see 10 and 6.
Tennessee also may be up and coming. They are playing in the AFC South.
The AFC South is definitely the weakest division in football.
By a mile. I believe Mariotta will be back in the lineup to start the season.
9 and 7 might win that division.
9 and 7 could. Tennessee could easily go 9 and 7.
Houston is kind of fading out. They have another quarterback this year, don't they.
I think so. They change quarterbacks like I change socks.
Indianapolis is always in the hunt in the AFC South.
Luck has ran into a lot of bad luck recently. Not sure what's wrong with him.
He might not be as good as advertised. He's a good quarterback but not elite.
Not from his past few seasons he's not. He's still young and can turn it around.
