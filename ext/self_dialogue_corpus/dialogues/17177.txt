Have you ever listened to much 80s country?
Yea, I guess so.  You mean like Eddie Rabbit?
Yea, Eddie Rabbit, Don Williams, Mandrell, those are the folks.
Sure, why do you ask?
I have this thing about 80s country, I grew up listening to it because of my parents, and I'm hooked on some of it.
I like a few songs here and there, but I'm not a fan.
Yea, the problem I think is the production value, it all sounds kind of weird.
Weird? How?
Well it kind of a strange blend of 80s production techniques and weird arrangement choices.
Give me an example.
Have you ever heard Luckenbach Texas from Waylon?
"back to the basics of love?"
Yea, that's the one.  I think it's a fantastic song, but the production is horrible.
Yea, I like that song, but what do you mean?
Listen to the guitar in the intro, it sounds so sterile and processed.  It's just the opposite of country as far as I'm concerned.
Hmm, I'll have to give it another listen. What are your favorite 80s country songs?
Man, hard to narrow it down...Queen of Hearts, 7 year ache, Luckenbach, the outlaws
good tunes, yea maybe I'll hit youtube and go down that rabbit hole
I recommend it, but pack a lunch, you'll be a while
you got it
