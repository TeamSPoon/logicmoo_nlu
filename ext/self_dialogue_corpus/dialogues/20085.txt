Have you seen the movie The Intern?
Is that the one with Google?
No, no this has Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro.
Oh yes I loved that movie! What was your favorite part?
I really loved that it showed a woman in charge of a booming business.
I know that seemed very refreshing.
I also think that Ann Hathaway did a great job of capturing a woman in a high stress situation like that and balancing her home life and being a mother.
I completely agree! That was also a refreshing touch.
Yeah you really don't see a lot of movies with woman who run businesses and have families.
Absolutely. Not to mention this movie was so funny!
I know they did such a great job mixing in drama with comedy.
Yeah well you know I am a big fan of Adam DeVine so I knew this movie would have a great funny undertone.
Yeah he did do a great job and I am glad he is branching out and doing so many movies.
Yeah did you see that other movie he was in, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates?
Yeah I did but I have to say I was kind of disappointed. They made it seem like it was going to be so funny and it fell short for me.
I guess I agree. I just loved the cast so I would probably watch it again.
Well I won't be watching that with you but if you would want to watch The Intern later today I would be into that.
Okay yeah that sounds great. Or I know two movie passes if you want to see something else?
Yes! Lets go see that knew Alien movie. I haven't seen a great SiFy movie in a long time.
Same here. Lets go there is a showing a 3PM today.
