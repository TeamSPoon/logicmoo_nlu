What kind of movies have you watched lately?
Some comedy ones , thriller and action.
Any good ones that I didn't see?
We went to see the Great Wall with Matt Damon.
I'll probably wait for the DVD. Was it good?
Yes. Matt Damon is a good actor.
William Dafoe was in that too, right?
Yes.
So Damon fought with warriors to save the Great Wall?
He joined the warriors to fight beasts.
I thought they were just fighting other people.
No. Fantasy type stuff in this movie.
Was it a long movie?
No. Just like an hour and fourty minutes.
That's not bad. So many movies now are over two hours.
Yeah. It's not bad if they are interesting, but some could be shorter.
Have you seen any good comedies at home?
No. We did just watch Suicide Squad the other night though.
Yes, I saw that a while ago.
I liked it. Will Smith was good.
