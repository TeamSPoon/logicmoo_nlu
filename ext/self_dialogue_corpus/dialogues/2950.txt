Do you know when the Saints first game is for the season.
Yes it is on September 11
Is it away or home?
Its an away game against the Vikings.
Wonder whos broadcasting it ?
I am pretty sure ESPN has it and it starts at 710 pm.
I know they play the Patriots at home on September 17th i think its an early afternoon game.
Yes its an 100 pm game
They dont have it very easy in theyre first four games.
No 3 are away game and the one home game is the Patriots
Tom Brady and Drew Brees i dont really like eigther one of them as quarterbacks.
I agree neigther one can take a hit without whining about it.
They play the Packers on October 22 thats gonna be a hard game for them to.
They didnt do very well last year.
I know i was so disappointed they didnt even make it to the playoffs.
Maybe this will be their year its time for a superbowl win.
I wish but doubt it. They are up against some hard competition.
I think i might go see the Patriots game since it is at home.
Why Thought you didnt like the Patriots.
I dont but i can Boo Brady and hope we win.
