I really miss getting to watch Troy Polamalu
he was a total raging beast on the field
at 5'10" and 207 lbs, he has got to be one of the scarier strong safeties to have ever played in the NFL
no doubt, but the funny thing is, is how pretty his hair was
didn't he do hair commercials?
I believe that he did
I'm sure offenses have nightmares about those luscious locks even to this day
you would be scared too if you thought that a severe hit highlight of you would end up in a conditioner commercial
ha ha ha touche!
who do you think is the big defensive player is going to be next season
I'd say Von Miller at outside linebacker for the broncos has a shot
he is a class act
yeah, he is also hilarious. did you see that commercial where he imitates a Justin Beiber video?
Oh man. that was hilarious, i did a total double take
did you know he gave every player in the AFC west a gift last year?
I didn't know that, what did he give them.
he gave them a personalized bottle of wine, and a thank you note
wow, what a nice guy
in fact, Von Miller autographed each bottle as well
they need more players like him in the NFL!
