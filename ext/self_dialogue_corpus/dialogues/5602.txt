Tron was such a disappointing movie.
They put huge marketing dollars behind it too.
I think Jeff Bridges was the only big name actor they used.
Even he had a tough time with the acting.
Thats kind of crazy he has such a good career.
I think the visual effects were boring as well.
The story all in all was a bit weak.
I think that the whole digital world concept is tired.
Yeah I would agree with you on that.
And it didnt have a plot beyond what they had written. No development of any characters.
