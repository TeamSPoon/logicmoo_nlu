How about Dem' Boys?
Exactly, how about Dem' Boys.
Dak and Zeke taking them to the promised land this year?
Yes sir, I believe they will.
Have you noticed that Jerry Jones has become hands off?
Yes I have, that's why they are finally good again.
Garrett is a really good coach isn't he?
Yes he is. The first legit head coach since Parcells.
Parcells never had a quarterback.
That is correct, he didn't have one and Jones was on the sidelines all the time.
You would think Jones would have learned earlier how not to be Steinbrenner.
You would think that but he didn't.
Lee is one heck of a player also.
He's my favorite NFL linebacker at the moment.
The Cowboys are finally seeing some ROI on the Jerry dome.
Yes they are, and it's about time that America's team was back on top.
Have you been to a game in Arlington?
No, but the place looks big.
The Jerry Dome is huge and home to the largest TV in the world.
Forget a sophomore slump. Dak and Zeke are getting it done this year.
