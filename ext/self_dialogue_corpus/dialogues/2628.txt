Will you be following the NFL football games this year?
Yes absolutely. I love pro football.
Which one is your favorite team?
I've been following the San Francisco 49ers for a while now.
They've historically been a strong team, but not lately.
They did win five Super Bowl championships way back you know.
When was that?
In the eighties, on through the mid-nineties. Kind of a golden age.
Their coach Bill Walsh did good by them.  He made one particular game play popular.
Offense or defense? He was a great coach.
On offense. It was called the West Coast offense.
That was a good development.  Passing instead of running was good for football.
Weren't there a lot of Hall of Famers on the 49ers?
That's true. Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young.
Those guys were great. How is the team now?
They moved their home, so they're headquartered elsewhere.
Okay, what else?
They hired a couple of coaches to replace Jim Harbaugh.
How are they playing?
Right now they need to find some legs to stand on. They're ranked really low.
