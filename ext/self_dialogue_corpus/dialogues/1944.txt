The chargers are moving
They are? to where?
To LA
What? I thought the rams were in LA
They are going to both play in LA, and they are going to the same stadium
That's crazy. They leave San Diego to share a stadium?
It's going to be a nice stadium
Yeah, but why leave SD
They wanted a new stadium and SD wouldn't pay
That sucks, so no more football in SD
I guess not
That makes me sad
Why is that?
I liked the chargers as a San Diego team, made them feel special
But now they might get more attention
not under the rams shadow
you think
yeah, i do. the rams will take all the attention
what we ganna do?
I'm ganna go blog, its all I can do.
