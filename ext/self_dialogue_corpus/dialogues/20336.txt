Hey. What are you up to tonight?
I am not sure. Do you want to go to the movies?
I would like go to the movies but it is so expensive.
I know what you mean.
A ticket, food, and a drink can cost almost $25.
Well, we could save that money and stay in.
Great idea! How about we rent a couple of movies on Red Box?
That is a great idea! We could get a pizza too.
Pizza sounds great. I am hungry.
Do you have specific movies on your mind?
I want to rent Beauty and the Beast for sure.
That movie does look good but I am not sure how I feel about Emma Watson playing Belle.
I think she is a great choice! She is perfect for the role of Belle.
Alright, well I think I will pick out Fifty Shades Darker.
Alright. I will go pick them up. Do you want to go with me?
No thanks. Hey, can you pick up some chips to go with the pizza?
Sure. We will still be saving money by watching movies from Red Box instead of going to a movie theater.
Plus we don't have to get all dressed up. I am comfortable in my pajamas.
Well, I will be right back.
Don't keep me waiting too long!
