When does baseball season typically start?
Usually around April 1st, give or take a few days.
How long does baseball season last?
Around 6 months or so, with a month of playoff afterward.
Do teams have a training camp like in other sports?
Yes. They call it "spring training", and it's about a month or so.
Between all those, it sounds like they're playing eight months out of the year.
Indeed. The regular season alone is 162 games.
That's a lot of games to not include the other parts of the season.
A team that makes the playoffs can play from 1 to 22 games.
What about in spring training?
Teams will play about 40-45 games each spring training.
Wow! That's almost 230 games a year, which is a ton of baseball!
Indeed, and I didn't even mention that some players will play elsewhere around the world in the winter also.
That's crazy! That probably almost 300 baseball games a year one player could play.
Thankfully, baseball is a non-contact sport that also isn't too physically demanding.
That's for sure. I've seen some players on defense not have to move an inch during an inning.
That's especially true if their pitcher strikes out a lot of batters.
Is that why you'll see baseball players play well into their 40s?
That is indeed true, and players can play 20-25 years as a pro.
