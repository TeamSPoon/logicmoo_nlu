Is there any movie you saw with your parents but instantly regretted?
Yeah, Titanic for me.
Why's that?
Well, it was my first topless scene and I was 13. My dad said I was very annoying on the way home.
Ha, nice job.
Thanks. You?
American Pie. The apple pie scene was pretty bad.
The webcam scene is far worse.
True. But at least he put a note on the apple pie at home.
Ha, I'd love to see that.
