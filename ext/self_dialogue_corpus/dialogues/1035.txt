I'm looking forward to Sunday. It's time to renew the rivalry with Tom Brady.
It sure is time. It's good to have tom Brady back!
That's very true now that the NFL's two best quarterbacks get to go head to head.
They are not the two best quaterbacks this year. Maybe in 2006 they were hot.
That's funny being that your team couldn't even beat Seattle.
No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees.
That's classic coming from a guy who's team is twelth in the league with quarterback ratings.
My guy at least won a Super Bowl in the past five years.
They had to do something to make up for getting discount double slammed.
Your jealousy and your teams inadequacy is so obvoius.
Who's jealousy? You can't keep up with a conversation about elite quarterbacks.
You can't honestly consider Flacco elite.
How on earth is he not an eilte quarterback?
Manning, Brady, and Rodgers, those are the elite three.
Maybe if your head they are the top three. Regardless, Joe Flacco is still top tier.
Okay, believe what you want.
Well, why don't you think Joe Flacco's top tier?
Joe Flacco sucks. There's no way he has earned a place in quarterback history.
The same can be said about Rodgers.
Now there is a biasis opinion.
