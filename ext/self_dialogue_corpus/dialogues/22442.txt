Those are three great cast members.
I agree. They all have been in lots of movies.
Yea, especially Samuel L. Jackson.
Yea, he has been in a ton. When is he gonna stop?
Would you stop if you were him?
Well, not if I were making money.
Yea, and he sure is.
Thats right so he isn't gonna stop.
How many movies do you think he has been in?
I have no idea, but its a lot.
This one seems good too.
Yea, I'm gonna have to see it for Samuel Jackson.
I think you will like it.
Yea, anything with those cast members has to be good.
I agree. Or at least they should be.
Yea, you never know, but it should be a can't miss.
I wonder if it will be a unique movie.
It should be.
I don't think Jackson likes to copy off others.
He sure doesn't
