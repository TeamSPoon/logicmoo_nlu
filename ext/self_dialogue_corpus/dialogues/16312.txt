How do you feel about modern folk music?
I think that's an oxymoron.
How so?
Well, there's no such thing anymore.
Why not?
Folk music is specific in its definition.
What is its official definition?
It's music that originates organically and passed down through the generations. It's never written down and can't be used for profit.
And why is that no longer applicable?
Now, all music is written down. Folk singers are millionaires.
But they sound folky.
Sort of, I guess. It's just slow pop music, a whiney voice, and usually a ukelele.
Yeah, why do they all play that?
It was the poor person's guitar back in the nineteenth-century.
You like to ruin things don't you?
Yeah, but it's a conversation worth happening. Folk music now is nothing like it was back in the day.
So when I go to a folk festival...?
It's going to be a bunch of rich white women whining on a uke. Sounds horrible but true.
Ha, I'll prove you wrong.
Fine, there might be a guy on a ukelele too.
