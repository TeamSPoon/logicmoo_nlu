Seen any good comedies lately?
It's been a bit, but I've seen a couple that made me laugh a lot, like Dodgeball.
I remember that one!  "If you can dodge a wretch, you can dodge a ball!"
Yeah, Billy Bob Thornton really made that film!
Any others?
Well, I saw Trainwreck and Masterminds, neither of which I cared to much for.
Oh, you gonna jump on the anti-Amy Schumer bandwagon?
No, no... I mean, I like some of her standup, but for some reason this film didn't really do it for me.
Masterminds... what was that about?
This guy who works as a armored car guard is convinced by a girl he liked to rob the place.
