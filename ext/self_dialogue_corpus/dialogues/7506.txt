What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I love them all, but I think my favorite would have to be "Half-Blood Prince."
Oh yeah, I love that one too.  I especially like the romance between Ron and Lavender Brown.
Me too!  All the kids are growing up and really starting to notice the opposite sex in that one.
The relationship between Ron and Lavender is kind of the spark that gets Ron and Hermione together.
And then there's Harry and Ginny--they get together in this one too.
There really is a lot that goes on in "Half-Blood Prince."
Yep.  You find out about the horcruxes, you're introduced to Professor Slughorn . . .
Malfoy joins the death eaters and Dumbledore dies at the end . . .
Yes, it's really an emotional roller coaster.  There's humor, passion, terror, and finally grief all rolled into one great movie!
