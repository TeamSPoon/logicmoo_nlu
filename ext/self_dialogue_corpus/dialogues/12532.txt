Do you think Rey is a Skywalker?
You mean Luke's daughter?
No, Leia's daughter with Han Solo.
Wouldn't that make her a Solo?
Well, half Skywalker anyway.
Maybe she was conceived by the force, like Anakin was.
I hope they don't go down that road again.
I thought it was cool.
Not me, young Anakin was just too much for me.
So I guess you don't want a prequel for Rey?
