What do you think about Lady Gaga's new album?!
I like it, it's definitely way different than her earlier album.
I agree that it's different, this one sounds like she grew up a little bit.
It has a lot of country influences in it.
It sure does, that's probably why I'm not a huge fan of it. I'm not a huge country fan.
Really?? I prefer her new sound actually.
Not me. I love her older albums, Bad Romance and Born This Way is too good.
I like those songs as well, her dance stuff is very catchy.
My favorite aspect of Lady Gaga is her music videos actually.
I totally agree with that one hundred percent, she's a visionary when it comes to that.
