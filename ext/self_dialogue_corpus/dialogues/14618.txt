Are you going to watch the Spurs and Rockets game?
Yeah. Did you see that Kawhi Leonard is injured?
Yeah. It will be tough for San Antonio to win without him.
Agreed but the Spurs are tough.
James Harden will have to have a good game for Houston to win.
True, they will be eliminated if they lose.
Harden needs to get help from his teammates.
I think Eric Gordon will come up big for Houston tonight.
Who is going to step for San Antonio?
I think Danny Green will make some big shots.
He's had a good series.
I think LaMarcus Aldridge will have to carry the team, though.
Agreed. He signed a big contract and needs to step up.
Who do you think wins?
This is tough but I can't see the Spurs winning without Leonard.
Agreed, it could be a blowout.
I disagree. I think it will be a close game.
I think it will be 107-90 Houston.
I think the Spurs will win in overtime.
I hope it is a close game!
