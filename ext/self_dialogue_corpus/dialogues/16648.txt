What kinds of music do you listen to?
I listen to a little classical and a little jazz.
I like jazz. It have really endured over the decades.
That's right. It has been around at least since the middle of last century.
There's lots of good jazz songs on the web, too. Did you ever hear of Dizzy Gilespie?
Of course. He's that jazz trumpet player, and I think you always see him with his cheeks puffed out.
He was a great at trumpet. I also like jazz piano.
Piano, trumpet, and stand-up bass: it seems like those are some classic jazz instruments.
You also sometimes hear flute and clarinet, I believe.
Do you know any other good jazz musicians.
Well, there's Louis Armstrong. Most people consider him to be very influential in jazz.
Didn't he also play trumpet?
He did indeed.
Do you know any famous jazz groups?
There was Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers.
Were they pretty big?
Yes, and Art Blakey in particular was a popular jazz musician.
What did he play?
He played drums.
Ah, yes. Where would jazz be without rhythm?
