Have you seen the new John Wick?
Is that the Chapter 2 sequel?? I have!
Yes that's it! What did you think?
I thought it was pretty great.  It definitely had more suspense than the first one.
Really? I thought they both had pretty equal amount of action.
I disagree! The second one is much better, with more thrilling adventures.
Ok we can agree to disagree then.
All right I guess you're right!
It comes out today on Blue-Ray!
I know! I already pre-ordered it!
Awesome, did you see Kong: Skull Island?
I did! It was definitely a great rendition of the old one.
I really enjoyed that the time setting was in the 1970s.
Me too, it was during the anti-Vietnam era so there were some references of that in the movie.
The Blue-Ray is going to be available tomorrow!
Are you going to pick one up??
Definitely, King Kong is my hero.
Haha I wouldn't say he's mine but he's pretty great.
You can borrow the movie if you'd like.
Sweet! Thanks friend.
