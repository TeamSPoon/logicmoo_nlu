Seen any good movies recently?
I saw a decent Richard Linklater movie the other day
Oh yeah, what's it called?
Everybody Wants Some
Hmmm, I must've missed that one.
Yeah, I don't think it did very well in the theaters
Any big stars in it?
Actually not really. A lot of unknown in the cast
What's it about?
Follows the lives of a college baseball team in 1980.
Okay, is it a comedy
Yes, definitely. It's very similar to Dazed and Confused.
Oh wait a minute, I think I remember hearing about this one.
Yeah, it's supposedly a loose sequel to Dazed and Confused
Where Dazed dealt with high school and this one deals with college.
Exactly.
So you recommend it?
Yeah I think so. Has some good scenes and lines.
Okay, do you think it's a good date movie?
Probably not. More for the male audience.
