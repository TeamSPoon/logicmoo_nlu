So who's your favorite Action movie star?
It's a four way tie. I can't decide between Arnold, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jackie Chan and Bruce Willis.
Okay, first off, I won't even dicuss Arnold. And Van Damme? Please. He's done. Jackie Chan and Bruce Willis, I'll give you.
Okay, who is your favorite action movie Star?
Bruce Lee. Hands down.
Oh good. Let's go with a guy who's been dead for forty years. Bruce Lee is so dead, even his son is dead.
Aren't you a big fan of Abbot and Costello?
Yeah. So?
So, you're a fan of comedians from sixty or seventy years ago but you dismiss my action star from forty years, ago. Hypocrite.
Okay. YOu got me there.
