Have you noticed that TV shows turned into movies are not doing very well these days?
I'm surprised Baywatch did so poorly.
I know, especially with having the Rock in it.
Not to mention Efron from the High School Musical movies. I thought they wold be a bigger draw.
I know. The TV series was so popular.
Maybe because too many other big movies came out at the same time.
Well, Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales opened on the same weekend as Baywatch.
That probably made a difference.
You know what else bombed?
What?
The Chips movie.
I didn't know a Chips movie came out. When was it released?
It came out in March.
I had no idea they even made that series into a movie.
It only made around twenty five million worldwide.
That's nothing!
It came out one week afetr Beauty and the Beast.
Well that could explain it.
Seems like timing could be really important as to how well a movie does.
Yes and both of these movies had bad timing.
