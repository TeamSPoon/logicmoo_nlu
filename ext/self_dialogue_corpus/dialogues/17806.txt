Hey, what good music have you been listening to lately?
I've been listening to a lot of old Snoop Dogg.  Things like Doggystyle and Tha Doggfather.
Oh wow, those were impeccable albums!  True classics.
Yeah, I know it.  I can't believe he's been around so long.
Yeah, I thought his Death Row albums were better than his No Limit albums.
True, but don't discount what he did with No Limit!  Those were some amazing beats.
Yeah, you're right.  Especially No Limit Top Dogg.  But I still thought his older stuff had a better, more classic sound.
Well it probably had more of his unique West coast sound, the one that Dre produced.
Yeah.  Did you know he released a reggae album?
No, are you serious?
Yeah, he called himself Snoop Lion.  He became rastafarian after a trip to Jamaica.
Wow, that's fascinating.  I never heard that.
Yup!  It was called Reincarnated.
I know he released Coolaid in 2016 which was a solo album.
I never heard anything off that one.  I haven't even heard of it actually.
Yeah, and Neva Left is his newest album which was just released a few months ago.
Wow, have you heard it?
I heard a few songs off it.  I wasn't overly impressed to be honest with you.
I think Beautiful was the last new song of his I heard that I really liked.
Yeah that was a great song for sure.
