Ever hear Buckwheat Catapillar?
Buckwheat Caterpillar? A band?
It's the guy's name, but he has a band. He spells it Catapillar.
No, never heard of him. Any good.
Sort of funny. He dresses up like a clown sort of, or maybe a caterpillar.
What kind of music.
One song I heard was like grunge/metal sort of. The other was a parody of Henry the Eighth.
Herman's Hermits! I like that song.
The parody is called Enema the Eighth.
Oh boy! Sounds like quite a song.
It's pretty funny.
Sort of like what Weird Al would do?
Yes, exactly like that! Except in a funny costume.
I'll have to check him out.
There are a few videos out there.
Does he tour?
I'm not sure. I did see a live video, but he was only playing in front of his house.
With his band?
No, he was just playing his guitar and singing. He has toy caterpillars behind him.
Was that the Henry the Eighth parody?
