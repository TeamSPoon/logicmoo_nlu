Hey, have you seen the movie As Good As It Gets?
With Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt?
Yes exactly!  That's the one.
Oh yeah, that is a great movie!  I love Jack Nicholson's character.
I know, he's hilarious.  He depicts obsessive compulsive disorder so accurately.
I know it!  Plus the movie has a lot of depth.
There really is a lot to learn from it.  It has valuable lessons about treating other people right.
Yes, and about mental illness as well.
That's true.  I like how the characters develop over the course of the movie.
Yeah, it's fascinating to watch.  The relationship with her neighbor is interesting, too.
The one with the dog?
Yes, that one.  The one who gets attacked.
Oh yeah.  I thought the main theme of the movie was compassion for others.
Yes, I could see that.  It was funny, too!
Yeah, they managed to work humor into it without ridiculing people.
Yes they did.  Some of the lines are so memorable.
I know it!  Jack Nicholson's character manages to be likable and hateful at the same time.
He really does.  As awful as he is, you can't help but feel compassion for him.
I know, what a well done movie.
It is!  I think I will watch it again soon.
