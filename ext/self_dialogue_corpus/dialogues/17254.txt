Do you like Bruno Mars?
I love Bruno Mars, actually.
He has so much style. His new songs are great.
Yes, I do enjoy his music. Every new thing he puts out is awesome.
I've liked him since the biginning. My wife actually made me buy her his first CD.
I would have guessed that if you'd buy the CD it had been because of your daughter.
I know. But my wife fell in love with the song "Just The Way You Are".
And how was the rest of the CD?
Well I must say that I had it in the car for a while and I heard it all the time. Every song had something interesting.
So you listened to it more that your wife did at the end?
You could say that. But I am not ashamed.
No body is saying that you should feel ashamed. It's just interesting to know that you are a devoted Bruno Mars fan.
Well, the guy has talent, and I am open to hear all the music that sound enjoyable to me.
Ok, ok... no need to get touchy.
Ha! all of this is just funny. Any way, you know that he is coming to town for a show soon.
Is he? You wouldn't miss it for the world I would assume.
I wouldn't. But talking to my wife yesterday we were thinking that you and Mary should come with us.
That sounds like a fun plan.
So we can count you in? It is next weekend.
Definitely. See you soon.
