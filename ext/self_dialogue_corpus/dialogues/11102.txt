Hey, Leslie, I have a question.
Shoot.
Since you are an aspiring fashion designer, my question is... What’s on the horizon for skirt/dress lengths?
Well, I think you should look for everything from full circle skirts to flowy midis and maxis to flippy, flirty miniskirts this spring.
So the maxi look is still in? We aren't over that yet?
Are you kidding me?  At least one maxi dress is should be in every woman's wardrobe.
You are so right.
It is a must-have look for those women who want to look fabulous without much effort.
Okay. We've got the dress part down how about the toe styles?
You mean like for shoes/boots: square, pointy, platform?
Exactly.
Square toes are out.
Thank-god. I personally never liked square toes on any type of shoe, pump, or boot.
That blocky shape is truly unflattering on the foot.
So, I take it pointy  toes will be making a come back.
They are but I hope  not at the extreme lengths of a few years back.
Those were just hideous.
You aren't kidding. I couldn't stand them myself.
You know, of all the shoe-toe shapes, my personal favorite is the almond.
Probably because it is  a gentle oval that makes legs look long and lean. It’s so sophisticated looking.
