I just re-watched The Lion King last night.
Oh, was it the original or one of the sequels?
The original. It just brings me back to my childhood.
Yeah, I have fond memories of that movie too.
Do you know they have a musical on Broadway for the Lion King?
No, but that sounds fantastic! Would you want to go see it?
Absolutely. It would be a big trip to get to New York City, but it would be a highlight.
I wonder how they represent all the characters like Simba since the characters are all animals.
Good question. They must do a great job. I hear it has been on Broadway for a while.
Well, let's plan to go!
