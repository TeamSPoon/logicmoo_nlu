Have you ever seen Psycho?
Yes that's a classic! Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense.
He really earned that title too. That movie was so scary for an old film.
I think it's because there was so much mystery and suspense rather than in your face gore.
Right, they don't do it right these days. That's the first movie I can remember with a twist at the end.
Probably the best twist in a movie in history.
I agree with that. And Anthony Perkins was born for that role.
I heard Alfred Hitchcock purposely chose someone who displayed feminine traits.
Right, so he could look convincing as a mama's boy.
I know the scene in the shower was and still is one of the scariest in movie history.
