Did you know that the Beatles recorded "All You Need Is Love" 50 years ago today?
Are you serious?! That's amazing. I love that song.
I love it, too. It's one of my favorites.
Is that on the Sgt. Pepper album?
No. Magical Mystery Tour.
Oh, right! Which was actually a soundtrack for that weird rockumentary.
Haha, yeah! The psychedelic bus trip...
There were some great songs on that album, though.
Of course! "The Fool on the Hill" and "Penny Lane" and the unforgettable title track.
"Strawberry Fields Forever," "Baby, You're a Rich Man," "Hello, Goodbye"... gosh, practically every song on that album was a hit!
