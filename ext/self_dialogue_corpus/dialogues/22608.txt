We should have a Harry Potter movie marathon!
That would be awesome.  I've heard you can watch them in about 20 hours.
Twenty hours if you didn't take any breaks.
No I think that includes some limited time in between.
Which one is your favorite?
That's hard.  I think most people like the later ones but I kind of enjoy the beginning.
They are definitely more feel good and light-hearted.
I don't know about that.  Chamber of Secrets isn't very lighthearted.
I guess not and Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty dark.
They wanted it to be darker to show that things were becoming more serious.  But I agree the first one really is more feel good.
I wish the later movies has more Quidditch in them.
Me too.  But I suppose there is only so many subjects you can pack into one movie.
My favorite is Half Blood Prince.  I really like the story line with Snape and Malfoy.
Malfoy's character certainly gets some more depth to it in Half Blood Prince.
I heard that the new movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, is going to have a sequel.
I think they are planning four more movies.
That's awesome.  I love Eddie Redmayne.
I'm just glad that the Harry Potter universe is continuing.
Yeah.  I was pretty bummed at the end of Deathly Hallows.
I was in a definite funk but this will keep them going for me.
