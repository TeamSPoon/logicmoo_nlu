Who's the youngest NFL player that you know of?
it's got to be Ezekiel Elliott if I am current on my players.
How old is he?
He's only 21.
That is pretty young.
Yeah he was the butt of a lot of jokes in the media.
Really? How so?
It wasn't anything bad, just poking fun at the guy about his age and being on the Cowboys.
What would people say?
I can't really all of them to be honest but the best one I'd say was a lion king reference.
The lion king?
Yeah, they joked about him being like simba except he took over as king as soon as he was born.
Doesn't sound very funny to me.
I'm bad at retelling jokes to be honest.
I would agree with you.
Why did you want to know who the youngest player was anyway?
Well I thought Amari Cooper was the youngest so I figured I'd ask you to confirm.
How old is cooper?
22 years old.
He's one year early.
