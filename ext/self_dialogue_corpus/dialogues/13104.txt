So I've seen some videos on youtube that talked about return of Anakin Skywalker in the Last Jedi
That doesn't make sense. Darth vader died.
Well, he turned into a Force Ghost, remeber?
Wait, oh yeah, you're right.
So Anakin shows up as Force Ghost in training of Rey.
I guess that could be kind cool to see.
Yeah. They even changed the end of the the return of Jedi to include footage of the new Anakin Skywalker.
Oh yeah I remember that. See, modenizing the old series is possible.
not really. That was jkust right at the end of the movie, remaking was pretty simple.
You know what still doesn't make sense? Anakin's age doesn't match the Darth Vader's when he dies in the original series.
