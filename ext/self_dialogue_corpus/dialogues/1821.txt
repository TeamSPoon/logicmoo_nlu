Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
I sure am. What are you most excited about?
I want to see how the Atlanta Falcons will be.
Why are they your favorite team?
They are not my favorite, but they blew a big lead in the Super Bowl last year and I want to see how they respond.
What happened to them in the Super Bowl?
They were leading 28-3 and lost to the Patriots.
The Patriots are my favorite team.
I enjoy watching them too especially Tom Brady.
He turns 40 next month, so it will be interesting how well he plays.
40 is an old age for a quarterback.
Yes and he signed a contract that will keep him active till he is 42.
Do you think he will break any records?
Maybe not this season, but I think he will break some records.
Who do you want to win the Super Bowl?
I want to see the Patriots repeat.
Are there any other teams you want to see?
I would like to see the LA Rams do better this year because that is my hometown.
I want to see the Jets play because they are my hometown team.
That is the one team I do not like to watch.
