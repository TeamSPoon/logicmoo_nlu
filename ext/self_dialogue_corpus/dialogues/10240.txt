Have you watched any good action films lately?
I seen Mad Max, finally.
Better late than never.What did you think?
I loved the fight scenes.
Charlize Theron does a good fight scene.
She was really something to watch. Her fight scenes were so real.
The whole thing was non stop, like no room to take the film easy.
I thought it could have done with a bit of a slow of pace at times.
Just to catch up after all the fighting?
Yes, and the car chases.
