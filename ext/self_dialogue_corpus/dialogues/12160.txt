Hey, are you much of a Star Wars fan?
I love Star Wars, it makes me think of growing up and watching them with my dad.
Yeah, takes me back too. Who is your favorite character?
Hans Solo, duh. He was a total stud.
Mine is R2D2. If I could have a droid, I would want it to be just like him.
Why's that?
Well, C3PO is cool, but he doesn't do well under pressure. R2D2 seems more loyal and collected.
That seems funny, to rate droids. Well, if we are picking droids then I think I would take BB8. Just his design itself is amazing.
Oh, BB8! I so want to buy that remote control toy of BB8 for my son. I think he would love it.
You can buy it for me, my birthday is coming up. Did my jedi mind trick work on you?
