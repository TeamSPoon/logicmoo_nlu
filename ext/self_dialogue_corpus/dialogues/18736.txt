Do you play any instruments?
Actually yes. I played trumpet in the jazz band in high school.
Trumpet?!
Yeah. Does it seem out of character?
Well, you're a quiet guy and trumpet is just so loud.
My girlfriend at the time played alto sax.
That makes a little more sense then. What sort of music did the jazz band play?
All sorts of things really. Mac the Knife, some Nat King Cole covers.
That does sounds all over the place.
There were some original compositions too.
Were you guys any good?
We were awful.
That's too bad! It sound like you had fun though.
We did. What about you? Do you play any instruments?
I tried to play the guitar for a couple years.
Did you manage to play any songs?
A lot of Smoke on the Water. You know, stuff that you play when you're first learning.
You must have driven your parents insane.
Probably. Let me know if you ever want to try a duet.
I doubt that'll happen!
