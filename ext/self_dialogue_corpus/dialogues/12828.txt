So, what was your favorite Star Wars movie?
I love the original Star Wars from 1977.
Wow, that's my favorite movie as well.
I love how it establishes the universe and sets the tone for everything to come.
I actually like the characters the best.
Who's your favorite character?
I love Darth Vader because he's so deliciously evil.
I'm a Han Solo man myself.
It's too bad he died in the new movies.
It felt like a fitting end of the character to me.
