When did the movie "Titanic" come out?
Oh, I want to say 1996-1997.
That sounds about right.
I'm sure there were other Titanic movies though.
No, that is the one I was thinking of.
Why are you asking?
No particular reason.  I just remember seeing it in the theatre and couldn't remember when it came out.
Oh, yeah.  I saw it in the theatre too.
I think everyone our age saw it in the theatre.
Yeah, everyone wanted to see Leonardo DiCaprio.
Pretty much.  It was too long though.
I don't remember it being long, but I know when it plays on TV I can't sit through it.
What was your favorite part?
I don't know if I had a favorite part.  I liked seeing how big the ship was though.
Yeah, that was really awesome.
They must have done a lot of research to recreate the whole ship.
Well, I'm sure it wasn't all recreated.
What did you mean?
I mean they used stages and stuff.  It's not like they recreated a boat.
Oh, I see what you are saying.
