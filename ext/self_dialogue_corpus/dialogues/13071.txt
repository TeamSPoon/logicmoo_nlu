So judging by your shirt, you must be a big Star Wars fan!
Actually I'm not.  My father gave me this shirt for Christmas and I wear it around the house.
Oh I see.  Have you seen any of the movies though?
Yes of course.  I've probably seen more of them than not.
Don't you also have a Star Wars key chain?
Yes I do.  It's a Star Wars Episode 1 key chain that my parents got me way back when Episode 1 came out.
Wow!  It lasted that long, eh?
Yes it did.  I never used it because I though it looked too good, so I put off actually using it for many years.
So, did you see Rogue One last year?
Yes, it was a very good movie and I look forward to seeing The Last Jedi when it finally comes out.  It's sad that Carrie Fisher passed on.
