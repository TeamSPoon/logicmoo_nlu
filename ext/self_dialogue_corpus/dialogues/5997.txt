Who do you think of all the Princess had the best movie?
Like Disney princess you mean?
Yep, like Belle and snow white.
I would have to go with Princess Leai.
She is not a Disney princess!
She is, now, Disney bought the rights to her films.
Well, then the cartoon ones.
I would have to go with Aurora.
From Sleeping Beauty?
Yep. She was tuff and sweet and I really liked the dance scene.
