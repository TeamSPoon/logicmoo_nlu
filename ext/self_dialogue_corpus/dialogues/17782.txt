Remember when we used to be obsessed with Disney music?
Remember when?! I still am!
What's your favorite Disney song to sing in the shower?
"You've Got a Friend in Me" from Toy Story.
Aw, that's such a cute song.
What's your favorite Disney song to sing in the shower?
"Colors of the Wind" from Pocahontas.
Good choice! I think I'd rather sing "Strangers Like Me" from Tarzan!
Ooh, that's another good one!
There's just so many great songs put out by Disney.
Right? "Part of Your World" is another great song! I think it's from The Little Mermaid.
I used to sing that to my little brother to get him to go to sleep all the time.
It does have a rather soothing feel to it.
I used to also sing "You'll be In My Heart" from Tarzan to him too.
That's adorable. That's a very heartfelt song.
It really is! So is "Go the Distance" from Hercules.
I'm not familiar with that one.
Really? You should go listen to it. It's pretty motivational.
I'll have to go check it out.
Make sure you do!
