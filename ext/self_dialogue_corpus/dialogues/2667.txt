I am in the mood for some good old fashioned football!
You will not have to wait much longer at this point.
It seems like it has been forever since the NFL has been on television!
Not really, every off season just feels that way for us true fans.
Speaking of the NFL, who do you think the best coach in the game is right now?
The question should be, who is the second best coach in the game right now?
What do you mean by that?
Well the best coach is obviously Bill Belichick.
That is what everyone says, but I see it differently.
Really? He has built a powerhouse in New England!
I know, but I think that might have a little something to do with Tom Brady!
Brady is great, but he has never won anything without Belichick.
Belichick has never won anything without Brady either!
I think we will just have to agree to disagree about this issue.
Do you want me to tell you who is really the best coach in the NFL at the moment?
I would be delighted to hear your opinion on the matter.
The answer is Pete Carroll. He is the best.
He is certainly a great coach, I can not argue that.
He has been great in college and in the pros's. Not even Belichick can say that!
Talk to me when Carroll wins a few more Superbowl's!
