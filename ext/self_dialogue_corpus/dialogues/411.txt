Do you like the old Superman movie, or the first Spiderman movie from 2002 better?
I prefer Spiderman, just because I saw it when I was young.
Did you see the old Superman?
Yes, but not in theaters. I loved it though.
How come you do not like newer superhero movies?
Too many effects and not enough craft.
I agree. The older films had a better craft and they were more innovative.
The James Franco Spiderman was really good. I wish they used more practical effects though.
Yeah, the green goblin character could have been cooler and looked excellent.
It was still good though.
