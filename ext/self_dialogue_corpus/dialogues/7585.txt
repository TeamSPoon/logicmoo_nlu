What's your favorite spell that they use in the Harry Potter movies?
I really like Lumos. I know that it's pretty practical, but I love how they can just have a quick light whenever they want. What about you?
Honestly, I like some of the Unforgivable Curses. I always thought Crucio was really interesting to use.
Really? The Unforgivable Curses have always scared me a little bit! Especially Avada Kedavra.
Yeah, I can see how they'd be scary. I think you really have to mean them to use them though.
That reminds me of how they always say the wizard doesn't choose the wand, but the wand chooses the wizard.
That makes me think of the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry is trying to find his first wand.
You're right. He goes through a few and none of them really agree with him, until one pops out of the shelf that seems to be drawn to him in a sense.
That's one of my favorite scenes in the entire series! I also like when they go to Gringotts for the first time.
Seeing how they have to get down to their vaults is crazy to me, but I love that goblins run the whole bank.
