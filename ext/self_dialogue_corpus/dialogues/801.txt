Can you believe the preseason is only a month away?
I know! I am so excited.
Do you think this will be the Packers year?
Man, I think every year is going to be the Packers year.
They keep making it to the playoffs, though. I'd be pretty happy.
Yeah, but at the same time, it's hard to watch them lose when they are so close.
That would suck. Hasn't it been like 7 seasons in a row that they have made the playoffs?
I think so. Patriots and Packers are on the same streak.
That is pretty crazy. Aaron Rodgers is pretty dominate.
Yeah, it's hard to tell what the problem is anymore. Everyone blames the coaching, but I don't know.
Yeah, it is hard to argue against anyone when they keep making it to the playoffs.
But the Patriots have won 2 in the past few years and the Packers win was like 7 years ago.
Still, I would rather be in that position than not making the playoffs at all!
I know. Being a Packers fan has spoiled me a little.
I am pretty excited to see what the Raiders can do.
Hopefully Carr is healthy. He was dominate there for awhile.
He really was. And now they have Lynch!
They are going to be a team to look out for.
I just hope they live up to the hype.
I really think they will. Good luck to both teams!
