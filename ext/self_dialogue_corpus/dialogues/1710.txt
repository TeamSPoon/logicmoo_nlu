The sports bar in town is playing the big game tonight. Do you want to go?
Sure. I am always up for some NFL football.
Cool. A bunch of the guys are coming.
Sounds good man.
What time are you meeting.
I plan to be there around 7.
That works for me. I will be there.
Good. You ready to see the Saints get spanked.
Whatever brother. We got this one.
I doubt that. But this is going to be fun to watch together.
It will be fun. I promise I won't get to out of control.
No worry man.
I know I am passionate about my team
I am too.
My girl may join us. Is that good with you?
I don't care.
She has friend.
Tell her to bring her.
I will.
See you at 7.
