Hi there, are you a fan of the director Peter Jackson?
Yes, I love Peter Jackson's work! What's your favorite movie he's directed?
Definitely the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they're some of my favorite movies ever.
Me too, those movies were truly epic.
I wasn't quite as keen about the series of Hobbit movies unfortunately.
Yeah, I feel the same way, they didn't quite capture the old magic.
I agree. The visuals and special effects were spectacular but it felt like they rehashed a lot of the Lord of the Rings material.
Yes, I don't think think that it quite lived up to expectations.
Have you seen any of his earlier work?
Not a whole lot, but I know he was really into campy gory, B-movie type films.
I've heard that too, I'm interested to check them out, they sound like they'd be entertaining to watch.
Do you like other fantasy films as well, like Harry Potter?
Definitely! The Harry Potter movies were pretty great.
I liked them too. Daniel Radcliffe has really branched out since the Potter days as well.
Yeah, he's went on to do some amazing work, but I think he'll always be best known for his work on the Harry Potter films.
That's probably true. It must be pretty crazy for those kids in the movies to watch themselves literally grow up on screen.
It must be! Speaking of the Harry Potter kids, have you seen Emma Watson as Belle in the new Beauty and the Beast remake?
Yes, I did, I thought that she was fantastic.
So did I! They really did a terrific job with the reboot.
They certainly did the original film justice. It was a great family movie.
