Hey the NFL preseason is coming up!
Yeah, when is the Hall of Fame Game?
Thursday August 3rd.
Who is playing in it?
Cardinals and Cowboys.
The should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Chicago Bears even if they are terrible. You?
My favorite team is the Detroit Lions so I understand what you mean.
I think you guys have a chance of making the playoffs again this year.
Yeah, but we never win. At least you guys have a Superbowl win.
Yeah but it was over 30 years ago. No recent success.
That's better than no success at all!
True, who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the Falcons win in a redemption story.
Really? I don't know if they'll make it again. The NFC is always competitive.
Yeah, but I think they'll be motivated from last year.
I think the Patriots could repeat, or maybe the Packers if they get a better defense.
I can't stand the Packers and I bet you can't either.
Nope, that's something we can both agree on.
Yeah, they always win the division.
