Hey, a great baseball movie to watch with your daughter is A League of Their Own.
I agree all the way.  That movie was funny and all about the girls.
Yeah, I bet she would love it.
Like the "There's no crying in baseball!"
That was really good.  Overall it was just a fun movie.
Of course Tom Hanks was outstanding as always.
Yeah, and the sibling rivalry in it is kind of fun too.
It's one of the better baseball movies out there.
What else was a good one?
The Natural.
Oh of course.  What about The Rookie?
Oh man that was good.
I love the line about if I report a 40 year old I'll be laughed at.  If I pass on your fastball I'll be fired.
Yeah, based on a true story too.
What about for love of the game?
I love that one.  Kevin Cosner at his best.
It was such a good game.  He was an actual pitcher I heard once too.
Yeah, nothing big but at least knew how to move.
The end when he retires it was one of those it's ok for guys to cry moments.
I agree.  Great movie.
