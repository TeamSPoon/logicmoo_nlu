Who was the best Batman?
Christian Bale and it wasnt even close.
I think Keaton killed the role as well.
But you think it was better than Bale?
They match up evenly.
No way, you could feel the passion with Bale.
His voice was a little irritating in the film.
Thats what made it so good.
Bale also had a strong supporting cast in all his Batman films.
Ok but I dont know if thats why he was good.
So switching gears who was the worse.
George Clooney I think.
Val Kilmer was pretty terrible too.
I think that era that made the Batmans look a bit cartoonish just ruined the franchise.
Yeah I would agree that was a low point.
Did you like Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face?
I could barely tell it was him.
How about Jim Carey?
He played a good Riddler
Well he has a background in comedy!
