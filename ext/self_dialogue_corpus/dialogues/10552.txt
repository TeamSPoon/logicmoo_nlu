Hey, how's it going?
I'm good, how about you?
Doing good, so, did you hear about that new Wonder Woman movie?
Yeah, DC movies usually are pretty bad though.
Not this one, it has been getting really good reviews.
Oh yeah? That is surprising.
Hard to believe that it is our first super hero movie that is all about a female.
Yeah, I guess when you put it like that it is.
Anyways, do you have Spotify and listen to any music?
Yeah, I like listening to Throwback Thursday. That's always fun.
Oh yeah, what is that?
They play old music centered around a theme.
That does sound pretty cool, I guess I'll give it a listen.
Are you going to see Wonder Woman in theaters?
Yeah, I think so. I just need to find someone to go with.
Movie tickets are kind of pricey these days, especially iMax ones.
Definitely, maybe it is better for it to just come out for rent.
Well, if you want to go with me then I'll go.
Thanks, yeah. We should go see the movie then.
Alright! Let's see if it meets all the hype!
