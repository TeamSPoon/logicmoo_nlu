I just saw The Empire Strikes Back.
That was my least favorite.
I agree.  Nothing much happens in the movie.
What was your favorite scene?
When they froze Han Solo.
Jabba was ruthless there.
I also liked the fighting in the snow.
Those white uniforms were cool.
I think the Yoda stuff was cool.
Yes, humorous but dramatic.
