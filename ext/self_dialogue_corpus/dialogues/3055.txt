Who is looking really good this year to go all the way?
I think the Cowboys have a good chance, but then there's always the Patriots as well.  Should be interesting.
How do you think Romo will do in broadcasting since he's now retired?
I think he will do great.
Do you think Romo will ever make it back into the NFL?
I don't know, man, I think as a player, no, but as a coach someday?  Maybe.
What do you think about Dak Prescott?
Dude, he's awesome.  I think he has potential to be one of the greats.
Did the Cowboys pick up some quality players in the draft this year?
I think they did, as they were definitely looking to fill holes in the defensive line.
What other teams do you think will do good this year?
As always, I think the Packers and Seahawks will be good.  Other than that, it's anyone's guess.
What about the Texans and their new quarterback?
I think he has potential but will just have to wait and see if he can produce.
Do you think JJ Watt will come back strong?
I sure hope so because the Texans definitely need him.
I wonder how many more seasons Tom Brady has left in him?
Man he's like the man of steel and indestructible.  I doubt he's going anywhere anytime soon.
Are you excited for the season to start?
Very excited!  I cannot wait to see what happens in the preseason.
