So, I heard you like The Beatles.
They're fine, yeah. Kinda grew up on them, my dad was a fan.
What's your favorite song, then?
Hey Jude.
Okay, you're not a real Beatles fan.
Who are you to say?
If your favorite Beatles song is Hey Jude then you don't even know The Beatles.
You're what I like to call a music snob, not worth my time.
What next, Here Comes The Sun?
That's a good song and you know it!
