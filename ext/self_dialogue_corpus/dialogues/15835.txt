Speaking of post rock, another group you might like is Mogwai.
Who are they? I've never heard of them.
They're a fairly old Scottish band, but they have some amazing songs.
Like which songs do you like?
Mogwai fear Satan is great, but so is the entire Young Team album.
Why did you like that song?
Well it has a beautiful flute solo, which is unique for a rock song. It's also fairly long and so to me is like a composition.
What other songs do you like in that album?
I personally also like Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home although not as much as the Mogwai fear Satan.
What about their other albums?
I can't say I like them as much, they're too experimental at some points.
Really, I like experimental rock music.
Well you might like it, but for me it gets too weird.
Oh maybe I'll like their newer albums.
If you like their experimental stuff, you might like their soundtrack album Atomic.
Oh it's a soundtrack album?
Yeah it's the most instrumental of their albums. It's also has a heavy drone influence.
Cool I'll listen to it then.
Well if you like a mix of post-rock and drone then you'll probably like it.
I sort of like drone, but not that much.
