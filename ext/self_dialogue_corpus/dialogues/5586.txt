Honey I Shrunk the kids was probably the funniest non animated Disney movie.
Yeah it spawned a series and alot of merch.
I think even Disney World made a ride based on it.
Rick Moranis did a great job as the father.
The way they made the spider huge was scary
It was good technology.
But the premise of the movie hasnt been since in forever
Yeah that kind of original content you mean right
Yeah like they havent written a movie like that
They will just give it time, they love their animate films too
