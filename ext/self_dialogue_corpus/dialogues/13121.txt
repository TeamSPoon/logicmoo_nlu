What part of Star Wars stick with you?
The first shot of X-wings diving toward the Death Star as that fanfare plays.
A good thought, the finale of Episode four.
Yes, another for me was the Victory Celbration at the end of four.
A down point for me was six. The Ewoks was to get an even younger audience involved.
True, that was dissapointing.
Whtn Episode One came out i was elated! Two was even better.
What did you like about two?
Well, just the city life...... it kinda reminded me of Washington DC in the 60's. Super large living spaces, large living room windows.
I thought that as well.
