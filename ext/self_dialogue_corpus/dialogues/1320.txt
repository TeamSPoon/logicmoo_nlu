Hey when does the NFL pre-season start this year?
I don't know, but I know it's in August.
Let me see if I will be able to find out the exact date; hold on. It starts up with the Hall of Fame game on August 3rd.
Oh, okay. Who is playing that game?
Looks like the Cowboys will be playing Arizona.
Ok. Hey, remember the Hall of Fame game between the Packers and Colts was canceled last year?
Yes, I do remember, it was supposedly because of field conditions.
Yeah, that was the reason. Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
Right. Who you going for this year?
I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Do you really think they have a chance for the superbowl?
Nothing is impossible, they just signed Sean Renfree as their quarterback.
Alright. Didn't he play for the Atlanta Falcons.
Yes, he was drafted by the Falcons in the 2013 NFL draft out of Duke.
Okay, well, we will have to see if he can make it happen.
Like I said anything is possible; who you rooting for?
Green Bay Packers.
No way.
Yes way. I am a loyal fan regardless of my team's performance.
That's cool. Well good luck and our teams will be seeing each other on Dec. 3rd at 1:00 pm. ET
