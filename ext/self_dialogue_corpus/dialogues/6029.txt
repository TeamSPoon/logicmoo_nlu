Did you know that Mickey or a symbol of Mickey is hidden in most all of Disney's films?
No I did not. Can you give me and example?
In Snow white when Dopey is on the floor surrounded by bubbles, the bubbles on the right side make and outline of Mickey's head and ears. The traditional Mickey symbol everyone recognises.
I never paid attention to that.
In Cinderella when she is scrubbing the floor the bubbles again make Mickey's head. And in the Loin King the symbol is on a bugs shell when Timon says that it looks like a good place to rustle up some grub.
On a bugs shell? In bubbles? But these are just symbols.
Yes but in Oliver and Company he is on a watch face and in The Rescuers he is on the clock face at the meeting.
I guess those are traditional symbols too since watches and clocks are great Mickey merchandising tools.
He is full size too as he appears in the crowd in both The Little Mermaid and The Goofy Movie.
It is like a game trying to find the hidden Mickeys!
