The Descendants was a good movie I like the music
So did I , I liked to sing along
my little sister knows all of the dances
the costumes were also really nice
they were nice, I liked how the bad guys kids lived with the heros
It was sad that they were outcasts like that though
I know but in the end it all worked out
it did , it made you think about the "bad guys" and why they were that way
I liked it when they drove that car through that barrier into the good world
that part was neat, Disney is imaginative
