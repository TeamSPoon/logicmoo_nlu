What is your favorite moment in all of 'Star Wars' history?
I'd have to say that my favorite, single shot has to be when Luke is standing at his Uncle's house, looking out into the horizon.
That was a really powerful scene.  Luke looking out into Tatooine's two suns, as John Williams' score started to play.
I think it's impossible not to think about John Williams when thinking about Star Wars.
I couldn't agree more.  They go together so well.
What was your favorite scene of all time?
Mine was in 'A New Hope,' when Han flies in and saves Luke at the end.
I was so excited when I first watched that scene.  Han's character evolved the most in the whole franchise.
Yea.  He starts out a scoundrel, ends up becoming a true hero.
That made his loss all the more depressing.  I was so sad when he died in 'The Force Awakens.'
