I went to go see Despicable me last night
Oh ya? I want to see that
Its was just a great as the others before it
Did you see it in 3d?
I didnt, 3d makes me feel car sick
I have heard that before, I have been ok with it
we saw 47 meters down last week
Can you imagine that in 3d? That would be so scary
That would be too real for me.
Cars 3 is out now as well
Now that would be fun in 3d
My kids would get a kick out of that
There are some really great movies this summer
I agree, theres transformers as well
I saw that last week as well, it really was fantastic
I need to start going with you
I would love that, lets set a movie niht
How about every other friday night?
sounds great
see you later
