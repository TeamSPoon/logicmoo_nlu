It felt like the music in this album was so graceful!
It felt like the waves were actually hitting me!
With all of the beats and the guitar playing, heck yeah!
Hmmm, you think we can pull a stunt like this?
Well, we have some connections that can help us.
Like who?
Platinum Records, Golden Albums, Silver songs, etc.
Now that I think of it, we actually can!
It's not gonna be hard, man!
We just gotta practice our skills! Your bass guitar, and my drum skills will be second to none!
Well, we also need to find someone who can sing, play piano, and finally add some beats!
Nahh, I wouldn't say for sure. This is Indie-Pop, right?
Yeah, it is! What, do you think we need more?
Not really, I think 5's a good number.
We could use more, though!
For like rock, or something like Punk, maybe. Not Indie-Pop!
Hmmmm, you're right.
Sometimes you gotta listen for other opinions, though.
This genre's gonna be tough, huh?
Yeah, it is.
