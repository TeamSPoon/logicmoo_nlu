Have you heard of The Exorcist?
Yes, it is a pretty scary movie.
I saw it recently and was so scared!
I feel the same. It terrified me.
Have they ever remade that movie?
I don't think so. But they have made very similar movies.
Are you a big horror movie fan?
Not really. I get scared easily.
Me too. But I still love to watch them.
What else do you like in the horror genre?
The Shining, Halloween, and many others.
Wow, you are braver than I am. Those movies are too much for me.
No, you can handle them. You should watch with me one day.
Ok, I will give them a shot I suppose.
Many horror movies are based on older books or urban legends.
That is the scariest part!
That some of them might be based on real events?
Yes, absolutely.
Just remember that the characters are actors and you will be OK
I'll try to stay brave and remember that. Thanks!
