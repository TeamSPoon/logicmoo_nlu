Get Out was such a good thriller.
i thought that Jordan Peele did a great job
I was surprised because of his experience in comedy
The lighting of the movie was superb
Yeah it helped with character development
The eeriness of some of the characters was odd
Yeah it helped make the movie strange
do you think they could do another one?
possibly but it would be odd
I loved how the scenes played out where you didnt know what was going on
