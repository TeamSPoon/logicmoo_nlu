When I was in Japan, it seemed like every convenience store was playing Yesterday.
Huh, the Beatles' song?
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like the song.
It's not my favorite.
Sure, but it's still a good song.
I just don't really like McCartney as a singer.
That's surprising to me. It's my favorite song on Help!
Well, it's definitely the most famous.
Anyway, it was just weird to hear it so often in a foreign country.
The Beatles really are popular all over the world!
