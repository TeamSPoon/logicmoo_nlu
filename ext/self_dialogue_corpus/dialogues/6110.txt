Whats your favorite kids movie?
I love so many I am not sure I could choose one, how about you?
I love Disney movies, bambi is my favorite
Why does disney always kill off the parents?
I think its so we become really involved with the character, is there one where the parents arent dead?
let me think, Mulans parents live, and lady and the tramp
Oh lady and the tramp, another personal favorite
The classics are always the best
Disney is amazing at keeping relevent
Yes, I heard they bought star warz
