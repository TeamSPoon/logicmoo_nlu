So I've read about the Atlanta Braves, and they were actually good fairly recently.
Yes, and they have had several men become elected into the hall of fame recently.
That's incredible, considering the hall of fame is pretty exclusive.
I bet Braves fans miss those days when they all played.
I'm sure they do, but they certainly can rebound to that point.
I read about a guy named Chipper Jones, and he was really good, but why isn't he in the hall of fame?
Well, he isn't eligible yet, but next year he will be.
Do you think he will get elected to the hall of fame?
I'm sure he will because he played great defense at third base and hit very well.
Something interesting about him was that he could bat right- or left-handed.
Yes, and not many players can do that, much less as well as him.
I'll say. I think Mickey Mantle was the only other switch hitter as good as him.
Who were the other Braves players that you read about that were recently elected to the hall of fame?
They were John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux.
Didn't they all pitch for the Braves at the same time?
They sure did, and they even won a World Series championship.
Did Chipper play with them?
He did, and his rookie season, 1995, was the year they won the World Series.
Who was their manager that year?
Bobby Cox, who, by the way, is also in the hall of fame.
