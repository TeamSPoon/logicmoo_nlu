How about those Jets this year?
Ugh, don't remind me! They look bad!
They ever get their quarterback situation squared away?
Heck no! That offense is going to be putrid!
What a shame, they have a really good defense.
Yeah, they definitely know how to build a defense.
If they even have a mediocre offense, that team's a contender.
Gotta get that Patriots monkey off their back, though.
I think you're gonna have to wait until Brady retires.
Brady's going to die before he retires at this rate.
Ha ha, that may be true.
Plus I think whoever may take over for Brady may be effective in Belichick's scheme.
That's what makes him a great coach, he knows how to play to players strengths.
They get a lot of these guys, and they always seem to work, no matter who they are.
It's really amazing, the guy's a Hall of Fame coach
First ballot, for sure.
At least Buffalo and Miami aren't serious contenders right now.
You might be right about Buffalo, but I dunno about Miami, they just need to get over the hump themselves.
They have a lot of talent!
Yeah, if it wasn't for New England and Brady and Belichick I think the Dolphins are the best team in the AFC East,
