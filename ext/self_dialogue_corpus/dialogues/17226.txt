Did you know Metallilca has a new album?
I did not. How does it sound?
It's actually not too bad.
Oh really? Is it better than St.Anger?
Yeah we don't talk aobut St.Anger.
That's a good point.
But yes it sounds much better than that.
That's awesome! I'll have to check it out.
Yeah it's not too thrashy but definitely not pop.
Does it play on the radio?
Sometimes, but only on heavier stations.
That's cool I wonder if I've heard them.
The radio plays Spit Out the Bone a lot.
I think I've heard that one!
Did you like it?
I did! I have no idea it was Metallica.
Yeah Jame's voice sounds a lot different now.
It does sound cleaner though.
Yeah you can tell he's been practicing.
I'm sure they all have.
