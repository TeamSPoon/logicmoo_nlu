Have you listened to MGK?
No, who is MGK?
Machine Gun Kelly is his name.
I have heard of him, but I do not know his music.
He is actually a good white rapper.
Wow that is unusual.
Yes and just like many rappers his earliest stuff is his best.
Oh wow that is good to know.
Yes he really has a talented skillset and rapping abilities.
That is special for a white guy.
Yes he has a unique voice, different from Eminem.
Ok that is good he is different.
Yes he is truly unique and talented.
I have heard of him for a reason I guess, I just couldnt tell you about his music.
I gave it a listen and was impressed, especially with the older stuff.
Ok I appreciate you letting me know.
Yes it is a super hype jam with his earliest couple albums.
What do you mean?
His songs give me a lot of energy and he puts a lot of energy into his music.
Ok that sounds great.
