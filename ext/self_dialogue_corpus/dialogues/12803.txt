Do you ever wonder if R2D2 would be jealous of BB8?
Why would he be?
BB8 has greater mobility and way more spunk.
Yeah there's no way R2D2 could have navigated those sand hills in The Force Awakens.
I think R2D2 can hover though, so maybe he could have just hovered over them.
Nah, he would have gotten so much sand in his gears.
True, plus his hovering abilities are pretty substandard.
They came in  pretty handy when he was stuck in that swamp in Dagobah though.
BB8 is still superior I think.
Well he's the millennial's R2D2 so of course he's improved.
