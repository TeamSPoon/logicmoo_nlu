What do you think about Taylor Swift?
I think she's great, I loved her music very much
for example?
like Love Story, and You Belong With Me
you know, I almost felt like falling in love with someone I don't know when I listen to Love Story
really? That song really has magic then.
yeah, especially the music video, she's so pretty and she met her prince and eventually got married, what a happy ending.
yea, but recently she moved to a totally different styled of music, it's more pop oriented, what do you think?
I think it's alright, she progress as a human being, so she progress in her music as well, things change
yeah, indeed
