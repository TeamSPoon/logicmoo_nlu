Do you think there is a chance for Kylo Ren to turn back to the light side like Darth Vader in his final moments?
I don't know. I mean I wish he did, but we all know what he did to Han Solo.
Yeah, that was brutal coming from his own son.
His facial expressions during the last fight with Rey were interesting.
It looked like he was questioning himself.
There's also the fact that his mentor is some powerful being.
Yeah, he sounds more powerful than the Sith Lord from the original trilogy.
I wonder if Rey or Luke Skywalker will be able to get through to Kylo Ren.
I would love to see that happen!
I can't wait for the next movie to come out, I want to know what happens!
