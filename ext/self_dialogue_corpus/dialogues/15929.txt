Who is your favorite rap group?
If I had to pick one of all time, probably the Wu-Tang Clan
Who are they.  I haven't heard of them.
Are you serious? They were the rap group of the 90's and early 2000's
Who was in the group?
They had the Method Man, Ghostface Killa, U God, Ol Dirty Bastard, Rza, Gza, Rakwon the Chef, Inspecta Debt, and Masta Killa
I have heard of some of them. I love Method Man
Well, he was in the Wu Tang.
What was their first Album?
Their first album was Enter the Wu-Tang?
was it really good?
In my opinion, it is one of the best rap albums ever.  Their wasn't one bad song on there.
Really, it was that good?
Hell yeah it was.  Songs like Wu Tang Clan ain't nothin to Fuck with, Clan in da front, etc are Amazing.
What made it so good?
First, their lyrics were great.  They rhymed and flowed in a way the rap today does not.
Are they better than the Beastie Boys?
Another one of my all time favorites?  The actually rhymes are better, but different style.
I'll have to download the album.
I would highly recommend it.  Long live the Wu!
