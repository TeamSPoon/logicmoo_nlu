So what's going on with DC movies?
yes, I was wondering the same thing!
they are just screwing up one movie after another!
yes, exactly! I mean look at marvel movies, it seems marvel knows the formula of success.
yes, it's not hard to see difference between marvel movies and DC movies
I personally think that DC people do not get a good director.
yes, I mean they have tried zack schnider, he is a mediocre director, yet they keep giving him movies to direct.
I don't know whoever is managing DC comics is exactly doing.
Did you see batman vs superman?
oh yes, I have seen it, and I regret watching it.
That movie just killed all the positive feelings I had for batman from christopher nolan series.
I think batman trilogy was one of the best superhero trilogy series I have ever seen.
I completely agree with you. and after watching batman vs superman, I feel that they are by no means even closer to that trilogy series.
But I think it would be unfair to compare batman trilogy with batman vs superman.
The whole story felt so artificial, I couldn't see any solid reason batman would turn against superman.
yes, the story was really poor, and without solid story, a movie is not going to be a great hit.
Have you seen trailer of new justice league movie?
Yes, but somehow I am not very impressed with it, even the trailer looks so mediocre that I have no plan to watch it.
Me too, unless critics come up with ridiculously positive reviews about it.
well, I see very less chances of that happening, still, let's keep fingers crossed!
