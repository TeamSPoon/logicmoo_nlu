Hey have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I've watched some games here and there.
Yeah, same here. I also follow the games and stuff on NBA.com and ESPN.com
I should check those out.  Who do you like in the Finals?
In the East, it's gotta be Cleveland.
You're right.  LeBron is unstoppable.
Yeah, and Isaiah Thomas just was ruled out for the entire playoffs with an injury.
Oh man, I didn't hear that.  That's too bad.
Yeah, and I think it's the same thing in the West.  Golden State will go back to the finals.
Did someone else get injured?
Yeah, Kwhai Leanard has been injured ever since he was stepped on in game 1.
Oh man, that's not good.  He  is there best player.
For sure.  Ever since he went down the series has been pretty lopsided.
So it'll be rematch of last year's finals then.
Yeah, and the year before that, too.
Well, they are the best two teams out there.  It'll be a great finals
I was hoping that someone could knock down Golden State in the west.
Not this year.  Even though Steph Curry isn't playing as well as last year, they are still a really good team.
Do you know when the finals start?
I think it'll be about a week from now depending on how the conference finals go.
