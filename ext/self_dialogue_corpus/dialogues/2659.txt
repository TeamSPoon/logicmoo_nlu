Who do you think is the worst NFL player right now?
You mean in the history of the game or currently?
I'd go for currently.
I'd say maybe JaMarcus Russell.
The quaterback?
Yeah I think he's the worst player statistically speaking.
Why do you say it's Russell?
He was suppose to be this awesome young talent when he got drafted.
So what happened.
He just flopped.
Flopped?
Yeah his three year stint with the raiders ended up being a complete waste for the organization. They got nothing out of him.
What do you think the cause of that was just bad luck?
No he had terrible work ethic.
Give me some examples.
Well he came to practice out of shape and overweight, was the last guy to show up for work and the first to go home.
Wow that is a horrid work ethic.
It really showed on the feild man. He was a disaster.
What ever happened to him?
He no longer plays for the NFL. No team wanted him.
