Do you know what the video of Lady Gaga singing in the car with a british guy is called?
Of course! Thats a segment called 'Carpool Karaoke' from 'The Late Late Show With James Corden'.
Yes, thats it! Have you seen it?
Only 15 times haha. I love all the 'Carpool Karaoke' videos, but the Lady Gaga one is a top favorite of mine.
I couldn't believe how amazing Lady Gaga's voice sounded completely natural in that car!
She's incredible, pure raw talent. Her voice has so much emotion in it, I can feel her words.
I liked seeing her personality shine through once she relaxed. James Corden is hilarious too.
If you like that one, then you have to watch some of his other videos. My favorite part was when she explained part of the lyrics to Bad Romance.
Yes! When she said that "Ra-ra-ro-ma-ma is like saying romance" it finally made total sense to me.
Me too. I had never thought of it that way before, but now I wonder how I ever missed that; its so simple!
