You pumped about less penalties for celebrations?
Oh yeah. It'll be way better. How about you?
Yeah, it's the best way forward. I always feel bad when they throw penalties just for celebrating.
Agreed. It's ridiculous.
And you know Marshawn's still going to get a penalty for some sort of celebration.
For sure. That will be worth it, though. I'm glad he's back.
Me, too. Oakland may just devastate folks this year.
It's possible.
I hope so, at least.
Yeah, I'd like to see them succeed.
What do you think Dak will look like this year?
Cowboys? He'll be good. Really good. Now. As good as last year? I'm not sure. He'll have a harder time, that's for sure.
Yeah. I think he'll do good. Just not as successful. It's just so much harder once defenders really start looking at the tape.
Yeah. And also. Now he's the man. It's just different for the players. To try to bring down the big man. You know, just a bigger famous QB to talk about you sacking?
Yup. It's good times, ahead. Still though, I don't think the Cowboys go deep in the playoffs.
Agreed. Who do you have in the Superbowl?
Man. Hate to say it. Because I hate them. Patriots. Maybe Patriots and Tampa.
Tampa? Man, I think you're dreaming a little now.
Maybe, but that's what I'd like to see.
Me. I want bang-bang. Maybe Steelers and Oakland. That would be good.
