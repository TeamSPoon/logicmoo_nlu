What's your least favorite Marvel movie?
I'd have to say Elektra with Jennifer Garner
Oh I heard that was bad. I wonder if she hated playing that role.
I doubt it. Who wouldn't love playing a superhero?
I agree. My least favorite would have to be Daredevil with Ben Affleck.
I've never seen that one. Was it that bad?
Worse. Luckily he redeemed himself playing Batman.
Yes definitely. Batman vs Superman was a fantastic movie. I've seen it three times.
It was great and I loved the cameos of the other DC characters, building up to The Justice League.
Oh you know every DC fan was geeking out when they saw that.
