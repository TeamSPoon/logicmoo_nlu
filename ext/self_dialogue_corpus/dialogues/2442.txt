A good ground game is still critical. Just not in vogue.
Don't know...look at the Patriots and the Falcons. Both teams have fantastic ground games.
Not everyone is Zeke and not everyone has Cowboys O-line, though
We'll see in four or five years if he is still around
The shelf lives of RB's may have gone down, but Zeke has shown backs can still do more.
Just because Zeke was an exception to the rule doesn't mean the rule still isn't true.
What do you mean?
Gurley went in the top 10 the year before and that was too high.
Ok...that's only one
Trent Richardson went in the top 3 in 2012 and that's just downright laughable now.
Forgot about him...
I didn't...
Lol. Good one
Everything goes in cycles..... running backs fell out of favor over the past decade.
But Zeke is special player.  Yes, he has benefited for excellent line play, but if you don't take advantage of your opportunities you don't become special.
He is a special player though
Yup...he the only reason I watch Dallas play.
True. And I hate Dallas
Tell them how you really feel man!
HAHAHAHAHA Yep.
