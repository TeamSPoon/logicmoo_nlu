Who do you think is the best superhero in the movies? I personally like Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man.
Tony Stark is so smart and rich, Downey plays a great Iron Man.
He is such a good actor, I love all of his movies.
Yeah, I really like Captain America. It would be so weird to wake up years later and see how much the world has changed.
Cell phones, computers, internet and even television that would be a shock to your senses.
I like Captain America, he starts out just an ordinary man it would be cool to become super fast and strong.
Well, you could hit the gym a little more often.
Sounds like a lot of work. I would rather have a mad scientist inject me with something.
Well it could improve on you dating life, not that you need the help. What are you doing?
Looking up the phone numbers for mad scientist, not that I need the help or anything.
