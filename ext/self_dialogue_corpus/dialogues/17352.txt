Did you see The Grateful Dead is touring?
What? They are still together.
Not with Jerry obviously, but yeah some members still play.
That's awesome! Do they sound good?
Totally, and John Mayer is with them.
What! John Mayer plays with the band?
He sure does. They're called Dead and Company now.
Wow that's really strange.
I know I wouldn't have ever expected that.
That's cool that he likes the dead though.
Yeah I can respect him a lot more knowing that.
How do they sound together?
They sound great! I think you'd get into them.
I'll have to check them out together.
Yeah john does most of the vocals and guitar.
Wow I'm glad he can take Jerry's spot so well.
Yeah I don't think a lot of people expected it.
I know I certainly did.
But we should go see them live.
We definitely should!
