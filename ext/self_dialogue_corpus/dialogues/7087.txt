Have you watched the movie Follow Me Boys?
Yes, I saw it when I was growing up. It has a young Kurt Russell in it, right?
Yes, and it also has Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles.
That's right, he was a traveling with a band and the bus stops in a small town. He decides to stay there.
He gets a job in the general store. He starts a Boy Scout troop for the kids in town.
Vera Miles works in the bank and after a while she realizes she likes him and they eventually fall in love.
Yes, and Kurt Russell plays the son of the town drunk.
His Dad dies and he's adopted by Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles.
It's interesting because Fred and Vera find out they can't have children so they consider the scout troop their children.
It's a really good story, and it kind of gives a history of the Boy Scouts.
