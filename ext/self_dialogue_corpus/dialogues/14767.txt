If you had to pick one, what is your favorite comedy movie?
I really don't know if I could pick one? If I had two I would pick either Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore
Really, you are an Adam Sandler fan?
I just remember when my roommates and I first saw those movies when we were in college?
What other comedies do you like?
Well, I am a big Will Ferrell fan as well, so I really liked Old School, Get Hard, etc.
Do you like Kevin Heart?
I like him but he is not my favorite.  I did like Central Intelligence with him
I also love old comedies like Coming to America, Trading Places, etc.
Now your talking, I love The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy
