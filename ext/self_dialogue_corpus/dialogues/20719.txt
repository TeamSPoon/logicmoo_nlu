Did you see Sausage Party?
Was that the cartoon?
Yes!  It was so funny.
No, I didn't.
You should see it!
I thought it looked interesting, then I found out it was rated R.
Yeah, definately not for kids.
I hadn't paid much attention to the trailers.  It looked kid-friendly at first.
Nope, it was pretty dirty.
Yeah, I noticed that after I read about it.
I can imagine your kids if you had brought them to see it.
They would have been scarred for life.
Yeah, it's a good thing you looked it up.
Well, the trailers were playing on the TV early in the day.
Were they asking to see it?
Yes, I had to tell them it was a bad movie.
That's so funny!
No, it was pretty horrible.
They should maybe put the ads at a later time.
They definately should.
