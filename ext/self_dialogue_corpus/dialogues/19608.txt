Hi.
Hey.
What's going on?
Not much, you?
Yeah same here.
We're talking about music today right?
Yeah that's right.
Okay, who is your favorite act now?
Now as in like recently?
Yeah of course.
I like Nickel Creek.  Little Big Town.
I don't know those bands.
They're country bands.
Oh okay that explains it.
Not a big country fan?
No not at all.
It gets a bad wrap, but some bands are really great.
Yeah I don't really listen to country at all.
You should check out those band.
Maybe I will, thanks.
