What are your favorite songs of the 80s and 90s?
Wow, that's going to be a really long list for me.
Me too, let's start.
Ok, Take on my by A-ha is definitely one of them.
Oh yea! For me too, I love that song.
Then would be Time after Time by Cyndi Lauper.
Yea that's another classic. True Colors is another amazing song by her.
Was that by her or by Phil Collins?
I'm pretty sure it's by Cyndi Lauper, he just redid it.
Oh ok. Speaking of Phil Collins, everything by him and Genesis.
For sure, they were incredible. How about Simon and Garfuncle?
Well, I don't think Garfuncle was around in that time, but definitely Paul Simon had that one cool song, Call me, Al.
I remember that song! That was the best.
Yea, I think the music video had that famous guy from National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live.
I know who you mean, I can't remember his name. Hey do you remember that song Amadeus?
Yea! Rock me Amadeus! That song was amazing.
That's the one. I used to rock out to that song in my room all the time.
Yea me too. Oh, I also loved anything by Depeche Mode.
Yea they were a really fun group. Do they backstreet boys count as 90s?
I think so.
