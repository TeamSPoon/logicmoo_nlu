I was having dinner at a friend's a couple nights ago, and another couple that was visiting had a hilarious argument.
What was it about?
Well, they don't have internet right now, so they've just been watching the same movies over and over.
The ones they have DVDs of or something?
Exactly. And my friend offered to lend them a movie or two.
That sounds normal.
Well, the guy is apparently really into chick flicks. They had watched "The Notebook" the night before and he loved it.
Okay.
So they get all the movies out, and look over them, and the decision comes down to The Last Unicorn and Steel Magnolias.
Both of those are such out there choices that I'm not really sure how to respond.
The girlfriend wants to watch The Last Unicorn, and the boyfriend is really pitching Steel Magnolias.
Of the two, I'd go The Last Unicorn.
Me too. I loved that movie as a kid.
So what did they decide?
Well, they couldn't come to a decision between the two of them.
So did you all vote?
Actually no. We flipped a coin.
So what won?
The went home and watched The Last Unicorn.
They made the right choice after all!
