What is your favorite Disney and Pixar movie?
I loved Ratatouille.
Oh, how come that's your favorite?
Everything in it is so pretty!
It makes me want to visit France, for sure. Even if I eat food cooked by a rat chef.
Hey, Remy was a great cook!
I know! He really impressed the food critic.
I was so nervous for them during that scene, but it turned out alright after all.
I felt bad for Remy that his family wasn't very nice to him.
That worked out, too, though, because they ended up supporting him when he needed it!
