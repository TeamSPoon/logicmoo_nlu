What do you like about the NFL?
The athletisism of course.
Yea same here. I went to a broncos game last year, center line.
Did you get close enough to smell the turf?
I was close enough to smell the players.
Are you going to any games this year?
No, not enough money.
I heard tyrod taylor might be the starting quarterback for the jets in 2018.
He's better then most of them.
I think there first game is against the bills.
That should be interesting.
Why is that?
Watkins, thats why.
No one can catch him.
You have to be able to get it to him first.
Its got to be weird for taylor to play against his last team.
No, players trade teams all the time.
I guess you are right.
Any time a new quarterback joins the team its always a rough start.
Depends on the quarterback.
