Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yeah, I took my kids to see it.
What did you think?
Emma Watson was better than I expected. Dan Stevens was great. And of course Audra McDonald was amazing.
Did the kids like it?
You could say so. My daughter's been listening to the soundtrack nonstop ever since.
Did your son like it?
Yeah, although he was a little too fond of Gaston for my taste!
You didn't like Gaston?
Oh, the actor was great, but he's not exactly an admirable character, you know?
That's definitely true.
But we had a nice chat about how he made fun of Belle for reading and being smart.
Teachable moment, eh?
Of course! There's always a few.
I saw it on opening night, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again.
Me neither.
I want to hear the Beast's new song.
I liked that one, but I wonder why they changed it from the original.
It wasn't really all that different, was it?
I didn't think so. But I still liked it.
