What's up man, you see the new Sports Illustrated?
Nah I didn't, who is on the cover?
Odell Beckham is getting crazy attention, I was actually just watching his highlights.
Oh man he was a beast, still is.
The injuries mostly got to him, but you remember that backwards catch?
Who doesn't bro?
That was a lifechanging moment, sealed him as an all time great!
An all time great off one catch and a single play?
Sometimes that is all it takes, that is in addition to the thousands of plays he's clutched!
He was on of the fastest dudes in the league, I loved his feints and fakes too.
I just see New York as a place where players and teams go to die.
That is the west coast in you brother!
It may be a bias, but still, most of the East just doesn't cut it.
The Patriots are incredible but I must agree.
The Giants and the Jets need a massive overhaul in coaching and management.
They definitely aren't who they were in the 80s.
As long as the West prevails, that is what I care about!
I can appreciate all teams as long as we get good games.
I remember only seeing you with Cardinals and west coast team jerseys.
Hey, I am an equal opportunity fan!
