Are you going to be seeing the new Stephen King movie?
It?
Yeah, doesn't it look good.
It doesn't look bad, but it's a remake.
I know, but if you hadn't seen the original, don't you think this would be good?
I actually think this is one that might be better than the original.
You didn't think the original was that good?
I loved it, but then I read the book.
What do you mean by that?
Well, after I read the book I realized there was so much more to the story.
Oh, I've never read the book.
Yeah, the movie made it all about Pennywise, but Pennywise wasn't the real evil.
What was?
I don't remember the name, but it's an evil that is in a lot of his books.
Yeah, I read a lot of them have the same connections.
The Pennywise thing shouldn't have overshadowed the main concept.
So what do you think this movie will do differently?
I think it might actually go into that evil.
What about Pennywise?
I think he will play a major part, but only a part.
