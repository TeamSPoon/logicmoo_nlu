Did you like the Chargers move to Los Angeles?
I hated that decision. The Chargers should be San Diego's football team.
I know it's sad that San Diego doesn't have an NFL team now.
It's just a really bad move. Los Angeles already has the Rams.
I didn't understand the move either. I mean win games, and the seats will get filled.
I know, it's not like the Chargers are like the Cleveland Browns.
Philip Rivers is a future Hall of Fame quarterback he just always comes up short because of the team.
I don't know how they'll be received in LA but I think Philip Rivers will have another good season for the Chargers.
I hope they made some good signings in the offseason.
They made a few but I don't think it'll be enough to contend or compete with the Raiders or the Chiefs.
That AFC West division is looking like a two team race at the moment.
Don't discount the Broncos. They still have a solid defense if not one of the best in the NFL.
I'm not forgetting the Bronco's defense but I just think they're offense is going to look terrible this year.
Yeah there isn't anyway the Denver Broncos can take the AFC West.
They might be able to sneak into a Wild Card spot though don't you think?
I'm not sure, because the Baltimore Ravens, the Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers always battle it out for the last Wild Card spots, whoever doesn't win the division.
It'll be tough for sure but I think defense goes a long way and the Broncos at the least have that.
I think that's why the Texans are going to be battling hard for that spot too.
JJ Watts is back so Houston should be a real threat in the AFC.
It'll be interesting to see if the Patriots can keep it going with all the competition this season.
