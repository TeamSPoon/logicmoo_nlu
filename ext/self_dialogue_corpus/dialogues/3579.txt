Do you like older horror movies?
From the 60s and 70s? Yeah, they're my favorites.
So you've seen 'Night of the Living Dead'?
Of course, it's a classic!
What's your favorite horror movie from that era?
That's tough. Maybe 'The Exorcist' or 'Rosemary's Baby'.
I've only seen 'Rosemary's Baby' once and I remember it creeped me out.
Exactly, it's not so much scary as really, really creepy.
'The Exorcist' is iconic, too.
I could watch that movie a million times. So original and terrifying.
