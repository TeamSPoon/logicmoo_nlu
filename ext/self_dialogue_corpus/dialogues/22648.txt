Has Jason Biggs done anything outside of American Pie?
He was in slacker.
But American Pie was his only hit, right?
yes it was.
I liked the movie.
I thought it was a landmark comedy especially for the time.
Yeah I would agree with what you said.
How many of the guys do you think ever made anything in comedy after that?
They all acted if thats what your question is.
No I mean do you think thats all they remember them for.
Oh yeah, Chris Klein especially.
Alyson Hanigan did alot more after the movie.
Yeah the actresses seemingly did fine.
I think one of them is on Orange is the New Black.
Yeah again this was the female cast.
I got what youre saying now.
So it was reverse discrimination?
I think the movie put the guys out there alot more.
Well the plot is fictitious
Yeah but it wasnt outlandish, that stuff could have happened
