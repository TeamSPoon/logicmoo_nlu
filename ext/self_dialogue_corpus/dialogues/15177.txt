What's your favorite heavy metal band?
I have a few but Metallica, Pantera, and Tool are my favorites.
I've always been a huge Pantera fan.
Same, but the band was never the same after Dimebag Darrel was killed.
Oh man I know. Dimebag Darrel is without a doubt the greatest guitarist of all time.
Dimebag could shred better then anyone in the world. Phil Anselmo is also one of my all time favorite vocalist.
I love Phil. The entire band had some serious personal problems. I think drugs played a huge role in the band's demise.
Couldn't agree more. Those guys loved to party. I still drink Blacktooth Grins in Dimebags honor on occasion.
What's a blacktooh grin?
It's a drink that Dimebag Darrel created, still somewhat very iconic in the heavy metal world.
I've never heard of it before, do you know how to make one?
Yeah! It's a double shot of Seagram 7 and a double shot of Crown Royal on ice, splashed with just enough Coca-Cola to give it a darkened look.
I'm going to make one rite now and jam to some Pantera.
Do it brother! What's your favorite Pantera album?
Cowboys from Hell! That entire album is insane.
Cowboys from Hell is also one of my favorites but their album Vulgar Display of Power is my favorite.
Don't get me wrong, I love Vulgar Display of Power but the album is a little too heavy for my liking.
I know what you mean, it's not the easiest album to listen to. You have to be into that heavy bass sound to really enjoy the album to the fullest.
RIP Dimebag Darrel, I think Pantera is greatest heavy metal bands of all time.
I'm torn between Pantera and Metallica, I can't pick one or the other. I love them both equally.
