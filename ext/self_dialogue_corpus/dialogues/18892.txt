I need some new music to listen to while I run.
What sorts of things do you usually listen to while running?
Well, I like to feel excited, but predictable melodies are always good. Like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Oh, okay. That's different from what I expected.
What did you think I'd listen to.
When you said you wanted to feel excited, I thought it'd be, like, high-tempo EDM.
No, sometimes I might listen to Ke$ha, or that sort of thing too.
It sounds like you listen to a lot of things while you run.
I guess I do! But I'm bored of everything now.
Well, what if you tried Lord Huron? It's a little downtempo though.
Lord Huron?
They're an alt-rock band. But I like to run to their music sometimes.
Why do you like them?
The sound feels very natural, I guess.
Hmm. Maybe I should try it. Any song recommendations?
My favorite is The Frozen Pines, but maybe for you, the first album would be better.
It would?
Yeah, there's a song called Ends of the Earth that pretty much everyone likes.
I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the recommendation!
Any time!
