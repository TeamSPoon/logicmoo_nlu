I just saw Beauty and the Beast this weekend. I know I'm late to the party, but better late than never.
We tried to go opening weekend but it was sold out everywhere. we saw it 2 weeks after opening day.
Yes it was sold out. Tell me, what did you thing about it? I love it!
I wasn't too keen on the idea of it being a musical, but It was so engaging that the last thing i was thinking was the signing.
I know what you mean and I agree with you. It's more than just a musical, its a movie for the whole family.
It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
I agree. The special effects, the costume, the performances were superb.
Emma Watson is for sure winning some awards next year.
Every one of the actors did a great job bringing the characters  to life. I was amaze by the great performances.
I was as well. Definitely one of the best movies of 2017
