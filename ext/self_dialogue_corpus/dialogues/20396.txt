What are some of the themes in 2001 A Space Odyssey?
Power structures, rebirth and many more.
It's a very deep film.
Yes. It is hard to understand at an intellectual level.
I agree. I did not understand a lot of it.
Me too. But, have you heard of the movie screen metaphor?
What is that?
The monolith represents the film screen
Cool. I have never heard that.
If you turn it on its side, it becomes the movie screen.
That is an awesome theory.
Heywood Floyd is supposed to be a propagandist.
Wow. I never knew that. But, I had a bad feeling about him.
Hal is a very deep character too.
I love Hal. It's sad when he gets turned off though.
I agree. He starts singing a song called "Daisy" and then turns off.
I think the film is supposed to be seem by people that were doing space propaganda to people.
Yeah, it makes sense.
That film is so awesome.
I agree. It has so many amazing scenes.
