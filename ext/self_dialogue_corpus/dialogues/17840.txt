Are you a fan of rock music?
Yes I am! Why?
Well, Breaking Benjamin is gonna be in Jacksonville soon. Would you wanna come with?
I've only heard a couple of songs, but yeah I'd be down.
What songs have you heard?
I've heard Diary of Jane, Breath and Cold.
Those are some of their most popular songs.
I roll with mainstream music at times, that's how I get to know new songs and artists.
I understand, you really should give their new album a listen before the concert, plus it's good.
Definitely, I'm sure it's good stuff if you say so.
Yes, you can trust me, they should play those songs you like at their concert though.
Oh good so I can enjoy them, what songs from the new album should I listen to first?
Failure and Angels Fall are great, you'll really like them.
Thank you for your recommendations. Will another band be with them?
Yes, Korn will be with them on Tour.
My dad is a huge fan.
They've been around a while so I can see how.
yes, should I invite him?
Sure, he should enjoy the concert.
Yeah, I think he's even a fan of Breaking Benjamin!
