What is your favorite Beatles song?
That's a tough one. There are so many good songs...
Well if you had to choose two then.
Ok, well I really like "Here Comes the Sun" and "Blackbird".
Great songs. I love "Blackbird".
It's such a beautiful song. My favorite part is the guitar melody that they play.
That song is definitely more toned down and less crazy than some of their other ones.
Yea. Although their more rowdy songs are a lot of fun too.
I love "Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da". It's so silly, but so catchy at the same time.
Yea. It tells such a cute story too.
