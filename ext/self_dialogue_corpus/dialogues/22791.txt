Have you seen the movie Total Recall?
The old one or the newer one?
Either one.
I've watched the older one several times.  I tried watching the new one but it bored me.
Yes, I liked the old one with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it.
That was awesome.
And Sharon Stone was the hottest in it.
She did a good job playing a sneaky villian.
I liked the whole idea of virtual vacations.
We may be getting closer to that in real life.
They do not implant into your mind yet!
Thank god no!
I do not think I would ever be up to something like that.
Yes, I don't know if I would want someone messing with implanting things in my mind.
Yes, think wearing virtual goggles might be my limit.
Me too.
The whole Mars thing was cool too.
Yes it was.  Do you remember the waitress in the bar?
That was too much.
Sorry to bring it up!
