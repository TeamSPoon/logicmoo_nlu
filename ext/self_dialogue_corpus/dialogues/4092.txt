What was the movie that won the Oscar about ten years back?
That's helpful.  Who was in it?
Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson...
Oh, you mean The Departed?
Yep.  That's the one I'm thinking of.
Awesome movie.  Scorsese is still the king.
I actually liked Mark Wahlberg's character the best.
Yep, he got the last laugh on Damon at the end.
Did you know it was a remake of a Japanese film?
Really?  Didn't know that.
