What'cha listening to?
I've got the music from the movie "The Hours" on as I'm working.
I don't think I've seen that movie...
I haven't either, but I really like Phillip Glass on when I'm working.
His name rings a bell for me, but I can't place him.
He's a minimalist composer and film score writer, he uses meditative and simplified themes.
Sort of like Hans Zimmer?
Yes, anyway the hours is really relaxing to put on as he plays through some nice themes.
What else has he done?
Well, he wrote the music for Scorcese's "Kundun" which has some really nice tracks as well as films like "Koyaniquatsi
Never heard of either of those, seems pretty obscure.
No, he's actually pretty big, he was even parodies on South Park in their first season when they put on that Christmas play!
Oh, I've seen that episode but don't remember his name coming up.
Ok, if you've seen "Candyman" that is his work.
He did the music to Candyman? I've seen it, but don't really recall iit
Yes,his work doesn't have a hummable theme like others because he builds it up through other means.
Sounds interesting, do you recommend anything in particular of his?
I really enjoy this score, but if you want a slow introduction I would get Koyaniquatsi and the last track of Kundun to listen to.
I will have to try those out, thanks for the tip!
Anytime! Oh, and you may want to listen to his sequel to Koya with Naquiqatsi when you finish.
