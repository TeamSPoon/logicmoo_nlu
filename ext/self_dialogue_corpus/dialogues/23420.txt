Have you ever written a movie?
No, never. I am a bad writer.
You should try sometime.
Ok. What kind of movie should I write?
Maybe write a comedy.
What comedies do you like?
I prefer romantic comedies.
I love those movies. Must Love Dogs is my favorite.
Does that star Tom Hanks.
It sure does. Good memory.
Do you like any other movies about dogs?
I do. I saw Bolt recently.
What is that about?
It is an animated movie.
Is it exciting?
It's cute. But it does have some action.
I'll check it out. Maybe I will buy the movie for my nephew.
He would probably like it. It is definitely a good movie for kids.
Yes, he loves the movies by Disney and Pixar.
If that is the case, he will be a big fan of this one.
