Do you like The National?
What's that?
They're a band, the lead singer has a wicked nice voice.
Oh cool, we usually share the same taste so I'll check it out.
I'm not sure if they have any newer albums released, but their older stuff is great.
I'll keep that in mind, what genre are they?
I'd consider them a mix of indie and alternative rock.
That's right up my alley, would groups would you compare them to?
I'd say they're similar to Interpol, Editors and Arcade Fire.
I love a lot of those groups!  I need to listen to them immediately.
I would recommend it.
What songs would you recommend?
Pink Rabbits is my favorite.  Graceless and the whole Trouble Will Find Me album is pretty good.
I'll start with those two songs then.
Maybe you should actually start with the song Bloodbuzz Ohio.
Why's that?
It was the first one I heard by them and it's what got me hooked.  It's a real banger.
What album is that one from?
I believe it's from the album High Violet, another good one.
Thanks!
