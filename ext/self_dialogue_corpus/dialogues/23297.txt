Hey, you own Deadpool, right?
Yup, I have a few copies of it, why?
Can I borrow one? It's about time I saw it.
Sure, you can have my Blu-ray or DVD.
Is it really as good as they say?
I loved every second of it. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as it.
Is it really rated-R worthy?
It's constant super-graphic violence and sex.
How graphic?
Well, think about 300. It's that level of gory, but far more fast-paced. There are even floating severed heads.
Is it done well, though?
Yeah, it's over-the-top, but not tasteless.
Is it funny?
Yeah, it's hysterical. He and Morena Baccarin have wicked chemistry.
I hear there's a lot of fourth-wall jokes.
Tons.
What is a fourth-wall joke?
"Breaking the fourth wall" is self-referential jokes, and talking to the audience directly.
How's that factor in here?
Deadpool makes lots of in-jokes about the X-men. It contains X-men, but they have B-listers because the studio couldn't afford a better cast.
