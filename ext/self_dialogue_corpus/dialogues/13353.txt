Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?
Rogue One? Yes I have.
Don't you just love it?!
I do! I have to admit I cried a couple of times.
Me to. I cried when I thought Cassian had died.
Which one is Cassian again?
The actor was Diego Luna.
Yes! I remember.
I also cried when Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, died as well.
That last battle scene on that planet was very sad.
