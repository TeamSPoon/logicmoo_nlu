Did Seattle run Lynch up the middle?
eck no they did a fake reverse handoff throw back to Russel Wilson to get down to the 5.
First play after the fumble. I mean, That's creative play calling right there.
If it hadn't been for denvers safety, the only guy who wasn't fooled, it would have been an easy TD.
I've seen a lot of creativity from a lot of teams, especially in the red zone.
i would always scratch my head wondering why can't the Texans do that.
We were so basic and predictable.
The only creative play was that wide receivers screen to Fuller in week 2.
Wasn't O'Brien the offensive co-ordinator at Patriots?
i  think so. It would be interesting to watch video of their plays near the line to see what O'Brien might be aiming for if he gets the QB capable of the required throws.
The line is a big part of it but the QB can help the line out big time by getting rid of the ball faster - enter Watson.
Osweiler and Savage are both a bit slow at getting rid of it.
Two fresh and dangerous backs will also add some firepower.
I think the offense will be better and likely improve from week to week - barring key injuries.
Fido will likely be our big bodied receiver near the line.
The reason why the O was so bad can be summarized in a word; Brock.
He didn't know the system well and in general he is just not that good. That's why Fitz and Hoyer (to name 2) played better at QB.
The OL is still the biggest question, secondary being second.
No good OL play will mean QB play won't be as good as it can be.
The running game will not have the impact it should with Foreman and Miller.
