Do you like the 'Fast and Furious' movies?
To be honest, I don't really like them at all.
I'm surprised.  What don't you like about them?
I just think they are rather absurd.  Hard for me to suspend disbelief.
Can you be more specific?
Well for instance, the main characters, especially Dom, are portrayed as invincible.
It is true that they pull off incredible feats, but I think it is excusable because it is fiction.
It may be fiction, but it borders on science-fiction.  There should be established laws in the film universe.
I think the one aspect that I agree is ridiculous, is the plot.  Though I enjoy that element nevertheless.
Exactly.  They are all street racers who then become heist experts, fighters, and save the country.
I do think that the series has redeeming qualities in spite of the criticisms.
What would you say is the best quality?
I think the emphasis on family is a really good touch.  Especially in 'Furious 7.'
'Furious 7' was particularly touching.  It was a great tribute to Paul Walker.
Brian's was my favorite character, so I was very upset.
Do you like the Rock's character?
He was a great addition.  The Rock has a way of reviving franchises.
I agree.  I suppose it was no coincidence why 'Fast Five' was such a commercial success.
I hope they keep making these movies.
Vin Diesel said in an interview that they would be going up to 'Fast and Furious' number 10.
