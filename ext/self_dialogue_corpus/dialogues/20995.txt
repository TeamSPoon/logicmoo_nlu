Did you see the new King Kong?
No. Isn't it a sequel to the new Godzilla though?
No, but they share a universe.
So what does that mean?
It means eventually we'll be getting a Godzilla vs. Kong movie.
Hey, is it true that they can't call him King Kong anymore? I think I heard that.
Yeah, some trademark issue or something. They get around it with the tagline "Kong is King".
Clever. But yeah, I haven't seen it.
Well, maybe you should I thought it was pretty fun.
Okay, I'll watch it sometime, whenever I get around to it.
I actually like it more than Peter Jackson's King Kong movie.
Yeah, why is that?
Well, I feel like Jackson's movie had more spectacle, but this new movie just more fun.
I did like the new Godzilla, so I'll definitely check it out at some point.
You know, the director of Godzilla also did Rogue One.
Really? Did he do the new Kong, too?
No, that was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. He's going to be doing the Metal Gear Solid movie next.
They're making that into a movie? I never thought it would happen.
Who knows, it might not. Movies have a way of not happening sometimes.
Yeah, development hell is a thing for a reason.
