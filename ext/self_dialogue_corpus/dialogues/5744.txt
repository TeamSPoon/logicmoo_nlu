I just saw the toy story movie. Did you see it
Yes I did . It was great
I like the part where Buzz light year  says in finity and beyond
I know that was a very good saying
I especially like the part with miss potato head
Her and Mr potato head were so funny
To think that they came up with an idea of your toys coming to life
Makes you think right
I wonder if my toys do that
Well overall that movie was so creative and fun
