Do you watch NFL football?
I love to watch NFL football.
Do you watch all the games or only certain ones?
I watch whatever games are on during Sunday afternoons and Monday and Thursday nights.
Why do you not watch on Sunday nights?
NFL games are on too late on Sunday nights and I have to work early.
That is a good reason. Do you have NFL Sunday Ticket from Direct TV?
No. What is that?
It allows access to watch all the games that are playing.
I watch on air games over my antenna. I am limited to what is shown in my local area.
That sounds awful! What games do you get to see?
I get to see the Tampa Bay games and a lot of Miami games.
Do you ever go to stadiums to watch games in person?
Not yet. I want to go to a Tampa Bay game someday.
I try to go to a game or two every season.
What is your favorite team?
I love the Atlanta Falcons. There is nothing like going to a game at the Georgia Dome.
That place looks really cool.
It is! You should come to a game with me. I think the Buccaneers play in Atlanta this season.
We should take a road trip and go see that game.
