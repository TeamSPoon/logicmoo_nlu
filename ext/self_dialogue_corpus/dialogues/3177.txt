Did you hear any more about the Raiders moving to Vegas?
I thought it was a done deal?
Already? For this coming season?
I don't know for sure but it will be interesting. They played good last season, though.
They really did! Kind of surprising...
So did Vikings and Titans, too.
Yeah, right? Nice to see these teams coming up though.
They'd better beat the Pats is all I can say...
You, me both! I hope the Browns beat the Pats!
Hahha! that will be the best! In your face, Patriots!
What do you think of the Dolphins?
They haven't done much lately. I remember their glory days though...
I used to be a Dolphin fan back in the days.
You mean like Dan Marino days?
Yeah, nobody could compare to him.
What about Joe Montana or Elway?
Montana, yes especially with Jerry Rice, Elway, no!
You don't like Elway?
He's okay, I'm just saying he's not in the same league as Montana.
Yeah, you may be right there...
