Oh my god, I love Samuel L. Jackson!
So do I! He's hilarious.
What's your favorite movie with him in it?
That's a hard one.
I would say that mine is Pulp Fiction.
I didn't really like that one that much. I would have to go with Django.
Why Django?
It was a good story.
His character was annoying in that movie.
You're not the first person that I heard who agrees with that.
How do you feel about Do the Right Thing by Spike Lee?
Samuel's part wasn't that major in it, but I love all Spike Lee films.
Me too! Every last one.
What is your favorite Spike Lee film?
Definitely Malcolm X.
Same here! Denzel did such an amazing job.
As always.
What's your favorite Dezel movie?
The Book of Eli.
I loved that one! Beautiful story.
