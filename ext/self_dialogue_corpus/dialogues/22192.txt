Today was the 40th anniversary of Star Wars.
Wow, really?
Yup.  40 years ago on May 26, 1977, 'Star Wars' came out.
It's crazy to think that 40 years later, 'Star Wars' is still such a pillar of pop culture.
The fact that you can go up to anyone and say "No, I am your father," and have them immediately catch the reference; that says so much.
Best 5 sci-fi movies ever.
Why five?
Well, the three from the original trilogy plus 'Rogue One' and Episode VI.
Ah, so you're not including the prequels.
I am not, because they were awful.
I mean they can't compare at all to the original, but they did have their moments.
Jar-Jar and Senate hearings were so boring to me as a child.
I thought pod-racing was sort of cool.
Agree to disagree!
Though they definitely could have connected storylines better so that they could transition into the original saga.
On the bright side, 'Rogue One' fixed a lot of the biggest plot holes.
Yes, and for that I'm so thankful.  They did it really tactfully too.
I'm looking forward to more one-off 'Star Wars' movies like that one.
Well you have the young Han Solo movie to look forward to.
That's right.  I can't wait to see it.
