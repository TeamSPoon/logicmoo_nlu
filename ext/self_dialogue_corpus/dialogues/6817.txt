Would you say the little mermaid was a comedy?
Not any more than I would say that about Alladin.
Yeah but I think it was just too funny.
There were serious parts of it.
Like when Ursula did all that evil stuff.
Yeah those parts were rough.
I think Sebastian was great.
Oh yeah he was the comedic relief.
But not a feature player.
Yeah so it was like every other Disney film.
