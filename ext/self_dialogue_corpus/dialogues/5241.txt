Do you like disney movies?
I love them!
Well, i was reading a note the other day, it seems that Disney is releasing a live action movie about Mulan.
That sounds cool, i actually liked that one.
Yeah, i'm not sure, i think the cartoon it's pretty special already.
I know what you mean, but, hey! you may be surprised, i'm guessing they will do something just great.
Well,i hope they don't change the soundtrack.
Sure, Christina Aguilera should be on that production.
Totally agree, she's an amazing singer.
I know. Well i think we will have to wait a little more to see how this movie goes.
