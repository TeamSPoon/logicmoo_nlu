I watched Little Odessa the other day.
Never heard of it,  Indie movie?
I think so.
What is it about?
A Jewish hit man has to come back to Brooklyn to kill somebody.
Anybody in it?
Vanessa Redgrave and the kid from The Terminator.
Cool.  What happens?
The hit man is from Brooklyn.  He tries to visit the family but his dad kicks him out, ashamed that he is a crook.
Neat.  Any action?
Yes, there's quite a bit of gruesome killing.
What does the Terminator kid do?
He's the hit man's younger brother.
Does he turn into a hit man too?
No, but he tries to protect his older brother, as others are out to get him.
What happens?
He gets shot and killed by the guys who are trying to kill his brother the hit man.
Too bad.  Anything else?
The hit man's mom dies, and his girlfriend gets killed.
Sounds pretty depressing.
