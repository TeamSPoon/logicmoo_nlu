Did you watch the Dodgers game last night?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
It's nice to see Puig producing.
I had a feeling he would. He's finally getting serious.
He has another year left on his contract too.
He needs to realize that he can make some serious money if he gets his act together.
Well, if he does then all the better for the Dodgers right now.
His contract is pretty team friendly right now. Only 6 million a year.
That's why they were willing to put up will all his nonsense. He has value.
Did you see Turner get hurt?
Yeah, hopefully it's not too bad.
At least they have a lot of depth to sort it out.
Yeah, there's a bunch of good players that are stuck in AAA because of it.
They'll just keep rotating guys up and down from the big club.
Just like they did last year with the pitchers.
Yeah, they didn't care if they were great or not. As long as they ate up innings,
Well, it kind of worked out for them last  year.
Yeah, they had a lot of pitchers hurt and just filled in the gaps with guys up for one start and then back down.
Either way, management seems to have things under control.
Yeah, they've planned well.
