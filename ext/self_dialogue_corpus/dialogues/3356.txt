Have you seen Cabin in the Woods?
Yes, it's one of my favorite horror-comedies.
Should I see it?
Well, sure. It's hilarious, super gory, meta, sexy, and fast-paced.
Sounds like something I'd like. I heard good things about it.
Yeah, It had great reviews!
What did it get?
Something like 90% on Rotten Tomatoes
That's awesome.
For a horror movie, yes, they're usually very poorly made.
