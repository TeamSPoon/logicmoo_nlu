What do you think of fashion?
Are you talking to me?
Yeah! You! What do YOU think of fashion?
Its alright, I suppose. I haven't given it much thought.
But fashion drives our culture!
Its just pants.
Its more than just pants, you are just apathetic, you bum.
The way I see it, if a mans got pants, hes got all he needs to make his way in the world, and this whole fashion business is overrated.
Wow, I never stopped to think of it like that.
Clearly not. What do YOU think of fashion?
Well I used to care about looking cool, but after what you said...
See, fashion really doesnt matter.
I don't know what I'm going to do with my life now.
Go forth, and enjoy your pants. Its what your mother would want.
But could I really enjoy my pants without seeking others approval?
Your pants are nobody elses business but your own.
Wow, thank you. That really is a great weight off my shoulders.
My pleasure.
I am pleased to have met you, what do you do for a living?
OH me? I'm a bum.
