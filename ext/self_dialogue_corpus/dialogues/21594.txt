Have you seen the movie Elf?
I'm not sure who is in that one?
It stars Will Ferrell.
Oh yes! I have seen that one it is so funny.
I know! It is my favorite Christimas movie I was hoping they would make a sequel.
It is good but I am more of a fan of the classics such as A Christmas Story.
I like that one but I don't think kids enjoy it as much.
That is true, my kids like Elf and The Polar Express the most.
What is the Polar Express about? I haven't seen that one.
It is an animated movie. It is great for the entire family.
We will have to watch it then! Anyone I would know in it?
Tom Hanks actually voices quite a few of the characters.
No way! That's cool that he is more than one character.
Yeah he is actually six characters!
Wow a true man of talent!
Yes one of my favorite movies that he was in was Castaway.
It's crazy how that movie could keep you interested with barely any talking for so long.
I cried and got so attached to the volleyball Wilson!
Me too! What a great movie.
We should watch it again sometime.
