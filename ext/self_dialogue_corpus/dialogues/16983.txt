Do you like country music?
Sure, though, mainly older stuff.  Why?
I feel like I should like it, but I just can't seem to get into it.
Maybe you could try some covers by country artists of songs you already like.  If you find ones you like then you might like some of their other songs.
That might work, I guess.
Do you like the song Life Is a Highway?
'You're going my way', that one?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, it's a pretty good song.
Rascal Flatts did a version of it for the Pixar Cars soundtrack that was pretty good.
Oh, yeah, I think I've heard that.  It was pretty good.
So, you could listen to a few of their songs and see if you like any of them.
I could do that.
I don't think country music is all that far from rock or pop, especially some of it.  In fact, you probably already like some songs, but in your head they're not in the country category.
Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash are, like, two top country artists of all time and I bet you like at least a few of their songs.  Crazy, I Fall to Pieces, Ring of Fire, I Walk the Line, like any of those?
Oh.  Yeah, I do, I guess you're right, I didn't really think of them as country singers.
Sometimes, someone gets well known enough that their music seems to transcend genres.  Of course, sometimes the music comes from more than one.
I don't know, I'm having a hard time thinking of more than a few.
Well, it doesn't happen all that often, but think about Elvis Presley.  He did all kinds of genres.
Okay, I guess he did do country and rock and gospel.
