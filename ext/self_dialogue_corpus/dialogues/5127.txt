Hey, did you watch the KC and Rays game last night?
Yeah, I watched up to the seventh inning but it was still one to nothing.
Aw, that stinks; they started scoring in the eighth.  The Royals got five in the eighth.
Really! I can't believe that.  I watched the entire boring ball and missed the good stuff.
Vargas was throwing some heat!  I think the Rays only had three or four hits.
That guy is a beast!  His ERA might be below one pretty soon.
I think this might be the end of the Rays for this year.  They've lost six of the last nine games to bad teams.
I think you might be right.  The Royals are bad too and they whipped them easily.
I think the main issue is their bullpen.
Yeah, every game I watch they are in the game into the starting pitcher gets pulled and then they start getting shelled.
You been watching your boys, the Red Sox, a lot.
Yeah, I've been watching all their games.  I've been pretty dead at work, so I get the chance to watch them regularly.
Their game last night was pretty good, did you see that win over the Brewers?
No, I actually missed that.  I thought they'd win easily so I didn't make time for it.  Did they win easily?
No, not really.  It was tied up one to one going into the ninth inning.
What! That sucks, I hate I missed that game.  What happened in the ninth?
Boston got a couple guys on and Betts crushed a three run homer!
That sounds like an awesome game, I hate I missed it.  Who got the win for the Sox?
Kimbrel got the win.  I think he's two and O now.  It was a little rough though, because they brought in Feliz first but he could only get one out.
Man, I'm not missing any more of their games.  Go Sox!
