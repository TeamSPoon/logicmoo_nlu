Did you see the March Madness games this year?
Na, I don't really watch college ball.
You should of really checked it out! The games were intense.
Oh, how so?
So many games came down to the last few minutes.
They were that close?
Yup, all the way to the end.
Okay, that sounds great.
I know, right?
What games would you recommend watching?
Honestly, every game.
All of it?!
They were all really close to the start.
But are there any specific amazing games?
Just watch all of it, trust me.
But that's a lot of games!
But it's so worth it!
I dunno, I don't think I have the time.
Neither do I, since we're both skeletons.
Oh, right
