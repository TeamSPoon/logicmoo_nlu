Which Lady Gaga album is your favorite?
I really loved The Fame and still listen to it regularly.
That was such a good album! I think that one is my favorite too.
Yeah, I love the song Boys Boys Boys off of it a lot. It has that fun summer feel.
I'm pretty sure I had that album on repeat the whole summer.
Same here. Which song was your favorite?
I would say Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) was my favorite. All the songs are so catchy though it's hard to choose.
Oh man I totally agree. Her early work was some of my favorite music.
All her old work was perfect music for summer road trips or going to the club. I want to go listen to it right now!
I'm about to go home and listen to it too now!
