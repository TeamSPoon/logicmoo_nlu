What clothing should we wear while doing this?
Well, this is during the 70s  So maybe close to disco clothing?
Nahh, that was during the 90s. We have to find a more suitable fit.
Like what?
Well, velvet and silk seems nice.
What other music genre can we use for clothing?
Rap, Jazz, Blues, and Hip-Hop.
Let's try rap.
What clothing do you think we can use for rap?
Why not fur coats?
I don't know if my mother has any fur coats in her closet, let alone a fur collar!
Don't worry, my mom's filthy rich, so we have definitely plenty to use!
Hey girl, how many does she have?
Like, a million!
Wowie, girl, she gotta let me try on some for the rap songs!
I will! Don't worry, I got you for this one, girl!
I never tried this for a rap project, though!
Speaking of rap, watch the music video "Fur Season", it includes a bunch of bad girls wearing fur, rapping!
Oh really?
Yeah, it's a pretty nice video, too! Especially for our rap!
