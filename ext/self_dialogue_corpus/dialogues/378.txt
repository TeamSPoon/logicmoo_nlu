What's your favortite Superhero movie?
Well, for me, it would have to be Superman III.
Really, what's that one about, other than Superman?
A wealthly tycoon has a computer genius, played by Richard Pyror, use a reprogrammed weather satellite to wreck the Coloumbia coffee crop for his own gain.
And I take it Superman doesn't care for this.
Nope, he stops the man made weather and cleans up the mess.
So what does the bad guy do then?
He manufactures artificial kryptonite to try and kill Superman, but it doesn't work quite right.
What do you mean?
The kryptonite doesn't injure Superman, but causes his personality to change, becoming selfish and cruel.
