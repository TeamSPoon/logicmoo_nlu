I need to laugh, what's a good comedy movie?
How about Bruce Almighty?
I haven't seen that, what's that about?
It stars Jim Carrey and he trades places with God.
I love Jim Carrey. I think he's the funniest man ever.
If you like Bruce Almighty, then you'll have to watch Evan Almighty.
Does Evan become God?
No, actually Evan becomes Noah.
Noah? Like with the Ark?
The very same. Both of them are great movies!
