Have you watched any good movies on Netflix lately?
I have a hard time sitting through whole movies anymore.
Me too! I did rewatch Babadook.
That one is good.
I tried to watch shimmer lake.
I heard it was funny. Who is in it?
Rainn Wilson and some other people.
I love him.
Another good one is a documentary about baseball.
What is it called?
The Battered Bastards of Baseball
Oh, I watched that one!
With Kurt Russell?
Yes and his dad!
Any other good sports movies?
I always love A League of Their Own
Yes. I wish there were more female centric sports movies.
I wish there was one about Babe Diedrickson
I think there is one in the works.
There better be. And the Williams Sisters.
