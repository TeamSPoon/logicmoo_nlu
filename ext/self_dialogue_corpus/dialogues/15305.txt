What music have you been listening to lately?
I've been getting really into The Mountain Goats.
Oh, cool. I think I've heard of them. What genre are they?
I'd say they're sort of folk and rock, but mostly rock.
Nice! I've heard some people say that about Dinosaur Jr, is it like that?
No, not really. The Mountain Goats has a lot of guitar, and less other stuff, at least in his earlier work.
His? Wait, I thought this was a band.
Well, it is, but it's mostly this one guy, John Darnielle. He's the only permanent member.
Oh, did he kick those other people out?
No, he just has different people that join it or leave depending on what they need for an album.
Huh. If I wanted to check them out, where should I start?
Probably with the album Sunset Tree! It's a bit older but it's a fan favorite.
Alright, I'll look into it. Do you have a favorite song?
This Year is really good, and usually the first song people hear by them.
Sounds great! I love knowing what songs are my friend's favorites.
Speaking of which, what have you been listening to?
I just listened to Master of Reality for the first time. The Black Sabbath album.
Really? How was it?
It's so good. The song Sweet Leaf is absolutely killer.
Yeah, it really is. I think it's the second-best song they ever made.
