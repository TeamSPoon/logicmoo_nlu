When did classic rock become stuff from the 80s?
It has been there for a while now.
I don't think Motley Crue is classic rock.
Dude, it's over 30 years old now.
Not to me. It seems like just yesterday they were rocking the world.
You got to face it your old now.
I still don't think of 80s music as classic rock.
So what do you think is classic rock?
I don't know.  Stuff from the 60s and 70s.
You got to face facts, in a couple of years classic rock will be Nickleback and 90s rock.
