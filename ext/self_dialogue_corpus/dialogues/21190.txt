Did you like the sponge Bob movie?
No, did you?
A little.
Why
I've been a big sponge fan.
Me too, but that doesn't mean you have to like the movie.
I like how it keep the same voice actors.
That's true.
Have you seen all the TV shows?
You mean episodes?
Yes, yes
I have, I would not have the movie called a movie.
What would you have called it?
A motoon.
Really?
Yeah, it was a half movie and cartoon.
Your right, but I don't think it would of cough on.

Me too.
