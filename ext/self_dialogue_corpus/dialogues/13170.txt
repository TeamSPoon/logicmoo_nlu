I am definitely a Star Wars fanatic, I've seen every movie dozens of times.
I like the movies, but it's definitely not something I'm in love with.
I've even dressed up as a Storm trooper for Rouge One.
I think that is awesome, I've dressed up my dog as Yoda and an ewok before.
It seems like you're a fan of the series than!
I really just love the characters of the series, they definitely make the series for me.
I could agree with that, but the plot and story line is so phenomenal to me.
I'm glad you love it so much, there are so many new movies coming out!
You're so right, I'll be at the midnight showing for each and every one of them!
I believe you, but I'll be in bed sleeping.
