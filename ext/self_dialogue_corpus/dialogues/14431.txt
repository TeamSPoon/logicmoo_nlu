The biggest joke of a franchise has got to be the Knicks.
Yeah Phil Jackson hasn't earned any of that big money he is receiving.
What an absolutely embarrassing time to be a Knicks fan.
They have totally disrespected Carmelo Anthony. Though he has brought some of this on himself.
How can you say that? The guy is doing all he can!
No I don't think so. I think Carmelo is a team killer. He has to share in this blame.
Carmelo is a scorer that's what he does. He has done his part.
What about the other areas of basketball? Defense, rebounding, team leadership? He's failed in all of those categories!
I agree he has come up short in those areas.
And those are large areas. Carmelo is not someone you can build a team around
Maybe. But I like to see him around a different supporting cast..
I think you would see the same result
Maybe. Maybe not. I think Carmelo has been dogged so much about Phil Jackson that he's been tainted.
I agree Phil did do some damage, but Melo didn't have the best reputation before.
Well they drafted Porzingis who seems like a keeper. They probably want to build around him.
I'm sure that's the plan going forward
I definitely think Carmelo needs to move on
Yeah he needs to see if he can go to a team and win a championship
Yeah I think it's not or never for him
Me too. He is not getting any younger
