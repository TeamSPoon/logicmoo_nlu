Vince Staples's new album was released today, have you heard it?
Yeah, I listened to it this morning.
What'd you think about it?
It's interesting. It's a new sound for him, not what I expected.
I think it's a bold move to go for an unconventional sound.
It was okay, I just expected a more traditional hip-hop sound.
I liked the second track on the album, "Big Fish".
That's the most hip-hop sounding track. I like "SAMO" the drums are heavy on that track.
It's been getting good reviews. I give it an 8 out of 10.
I'd go for a 7 but I can't argue against an 8.
