I hate how there is so much CGI in the new Star Wars.
It was the worst was in the prequel movies.  And then they had to go add some to the original.
I hated all of the added scenes that they put into the original.  The original felt more real.
That's because they used puppets instead of CGI. Much better in my opinion.
There was one scene that was better with CGI though.
Which one was that?
The Yoda fight scene where he bounces all around the room.
I do love that scene.  But I do prefer my Yoda as a puppet.
His original form was definitely the best.
And his voice is so iconic.  He is one of the reasons it is such a popular movie!
