What do you think about the latest blockbuster films?
Do you have any specific examples in mind?
Hmm.. How about Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Oh yes, that film made a whopping 844.4 million dollars at the box office.
Thats such a huge amount of money for one film to make.
It sure is, I rather enjoyed that movie. I think it can be very easy to over do it with visual effects.
I think it struck a good medium where despite relying entirely on computer generated images it still felt relate-able and real.
That's no easy task when you consider how outlandish that film was.
Some of the environments like the space scenes or the various alien planets were absolultey beautiful.
What they are able to accomplish with computers now is incredible.
Agreed. It really is like a work of art. Those planets and scenes were images created from a blank slate.
Its incredible what the human imagination can come up with.
That's why although I think films rely too much on visual effects it doesn't doom them to failure.
There is a certain amount of creativity that it takes to make something amazing and its no small amount.
I think on average most movies that are almost entirely computer generated miss their mark.
Some are good though, Avatar is a great example.
Oh for sure some are really good, Star Wars comes to mind as well.
Definetly, Star Wars might be the best space Odyssey of all time which by definition is composed almost entirely of computer generated images since we obviously can't film in space.
The amount of money to make the spaceships alone would be far out of this world.
I see what you did there.
