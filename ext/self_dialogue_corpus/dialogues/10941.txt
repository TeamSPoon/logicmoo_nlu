Are you a fan of the Kings or the Ducks?
I'm a Ducks fan! Of course, go Antoine!
You think they'll win the conference?
You bet, we'll kill the Predators!
To me it's unbelievable to think of an NHL game between Anaheim and Nashville! When I grew up, and ate, breathed and slept ice hockey there were only six teams!
Boring, dude.
Seriously, real hockey cities! When the Kings got a franchise it was just awesome to be able to see Montreal Canadiens play in LA. Jean Beliveau, Maurice Richard, man, that was hockey! Toronto even has a goalie who played without a mask!
No way! Who was that?
The guy played for the Kings after the Leafs, have you ever heard of Terry Sawchuck?
That was way, way back. He played for the Kings? Who else did they have?
Look up these guys, Eddie the Jet Joyal, Bill Cowboy Flett, Real Lemieux... those first years of hockey in LA were the best. But now, too many teams! The talent's too diffuse.
But the King's sucked back then, they lost every game.
All the new team did, it took a long time for the league to even out. The St. Louis Blues were the only good new team.
Who did they have?
They had an awesome goalie, Glen Hall. I don't think he wore a mask either.
Who was the first goalie to wear a mask?
I think it was Jacques Plante with the Canadiens, and I remember he took over for this old time goalie Gump Worsley. There's a great hockey name - Gump.
Were all the players still Canadians back then?
Oh yeah. No Russians, no Czechs...definitely no Americans.
I think I like it better now. It's cool that it's an international sport.
