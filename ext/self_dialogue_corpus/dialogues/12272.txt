Did you know Kylo Ren is the son of Leia and Han Solo?
Yes, I've seen the force awakens
What other star wars movies have you seen?
Just the first one
What is that one called?
A New Hope
Right, and the Empire STrikes Back is after that
Correct. And then Return of the Jedi
I was terrified of jabba the hut as a kid
We all were.
