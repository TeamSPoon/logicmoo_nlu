How crazy was that Celtics beatdown?
It was just nuts, truly, nuts
LeBron is amazing, and cruel
With Isiah out, the Celtics are done
Pretty much. They just don't have The Guy to stand up to superteams
This is what the Raptors and Hawks found out over the years
I think a well rounded team can win the title, just not against a Lebron team
The Pistons title team might have been able but I wouldn't favor them
The nice thing is that the Celtics have a ton of options to improve
Question is, would Gordon Hayward get them over the hump?
I just don't know, it comes down to fit. Al Horford hasn't been what they paid for
This is why I think Fultz is the best option
He is the one guy that looks like a superstar in the draft
Draft Fultz, and keep the status quo so he grows in a good environment
Agreed. Okay, so how do you see Warriors/Cavs 3?
The Cavs have to slow it down again, Lebron has to be amazing
Really, the Warriors have this as long as they are healthy
Which can always be a big if. Steph and Durant have had their share of injuries
I'm going with Warriors in 6. Cavs will have a crazy game from Kyrie that steals a game, and the Warriors will have one off game
Sounds about right to me. I'm pumped for the offseason, will another superteam emerge
