So when was THE first national combine, I wonder.
1982 is when BLESTO and National held a joint combine for the entire league.
That's kinda fun story.
yep. History is always interesting. Oh and then ESPN started televising the draft
In 1980. And in 1984, Mel Kiper started doign the analysis of the draft.
That's the best part, because it lets s know who's coming in, what value they bring, etc
Yep. All important imformation to have about your hometown team or your favorite team.
They even started televising the college picks.
That's just going to far if you ask me. They're just kids, barely 18 and talking about which college they will be playing for. That's silly.
Well, they form the base of the NFL draft picks in 4 years. It's pretty important
Maybe.
You know what irks me?
What's that?
Swapping drafts.
What's wrong with that?
Well it's misleading for one. And if you get a no 1 pick and get a star QB, you should stick with it, and improve the team
Oh yeah, that reminds me, that Eli Manning thing
Yeah, Manning told Chargers he didn't want to play for the Chargers flat out
But they picked him anyway only to swap with Giants for Rivers.
Well Chargers got more than just Rivers, they also got Nate Kaeding, Shawne Merriman.
