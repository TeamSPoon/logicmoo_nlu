Is it me or are movies getting more and more stupid?
It isn't you. What movie has upset your stomach now?
That Snatched movie.
Snatched? I don't think I have heard of that one.
Yes you have. You know that movie with Amy Schumer.
Who's Amy Schumer?
You know. The movie where some blonde is dumped by her boyfriend on the eve of their vacation,
Go on.
She  persuades her cautious mother, Linda, to accompany her on an exotic getaway to South America.
Oh yeah. I think I saw the trailer for that or at least part of the trailer.
What do you mean part of the trailer?
Well, if we are talking about the same movie, I changed the station when I saw it. That movie is beyond stupid.
Exactly.
Movies have no substance anymore. Who's the actress playing her mom?
Goldie Hawn.
Goldie Hawn? That was Goldie?
You didn't recognize her?
No. You'd think she wouldn't accept a role such as that.
Maybe she needed the money.
There isn't enough money in the world to make myself look that desperate.
