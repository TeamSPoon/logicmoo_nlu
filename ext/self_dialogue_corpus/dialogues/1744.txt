Did you hear about the NFL player complaining about the NFL salaries?
No, what was he complaining about?
He's complaining that NBA stars make more money than NFL stars.
Well, that's like apples and oranges, it's two different things.
True, and the pay structure is different, but it's not like these guys get paid peanuts.
I know what you mean. Actors and athletes make way too much money.
This former player, Terrance Knighton, was complaining because some NBA stars had some big contract signings recently.
Who were the NBA stars?
James Harden from the Houston Rockets signed a contract for 228 million for the next six years.
Wow, that is a LOT of money for playing with a ball.
Yeah, I know, it's crazy. Steph Curry from the Golden State Warriors signed a 5 year contract for 201 million.
So what was Knighton's point about?
He was arguing Aaron Rogers is a more valuable athlete, and should earn more than Harden.
How much does Rogers make?
He's in the middle of a 5 year contract for 110 million.
That's not exactly peanuts.
He also argued Tom Brady should make more than Steph Curry.
I thought Brady was very well paid?
He's on a two year contract for 41 million.
Well that's the same as Curry then. They should all just be grateful they get paid as well as they do for playing a game for a living.
