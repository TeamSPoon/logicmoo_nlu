So, in Star Wars, are droids alive?
No, they're not.
But they have like souls or consciousness or something?
They're not part of the force, so no. They might sentient or sapient though.
But doesn't Yoda say in Empire that the force flows through all things, even rocks and droids and stuff?
The force is everywhere, but not everything is connected to it in that way. Like rocks, droids aren't.
Okay, but R2 is clearly self-aware, and practically a living being.
But he's still a non-living machine. And most droids never even get his level of self-awareness.
So when a droid dies that's it? They don't join the force?
No, but they can always be rebuilt. That's the upside to being a droid.
