What do you think about the music of today?
Even though I'm fifty, I really still love all of the new stuff that's coming out.
Really? What type of music do you currently listen to?
I have those commercial free stations in my jeep, so I tend to tune into the top 40 channels.
Nice! I think I could get used to listening to music that way.
It is nice. I don't like commercials, but I do love music.
So who are some of your favorite newer artists?
I really like Bruno Mars. He's got moves and style.
I do too! I like Justin Beber too, but don't tell anyone!
That's funny! My grandson liked him until he turned about 7 and the world started influencing his choices.
I don't let anyone dictate to me what I can listen to musically, but I don't need that judgement either.
No one does.
Can you think of any other great newer artists?
I can think of some. I can't say they're all awesome though. Arianna Grande comes to mind.
She's got a good voice. But I find her a little bit too sexy for her age.
Exactly what I was thinking.
Not much different from how Britney Spears started out though. I guess it's a pattern.
Tried and true. As long as the music is good, I will listen.
I agree. Music is music, as long as it's good.
I like to think of music as a time out for my soul. So if I'm listening to it, it better be good.
