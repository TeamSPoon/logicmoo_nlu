So what are your thoughts on Chris Brown?
I am not sure if I have ever heard his music.
He has that song Party that is pretty good.
Does he also sing Loyal and Look At Me Now?
Yes!  He is my Brother's favorite.
I like mostly older music actually.
I like some of it myself, who do you like?
Prince has always been my favorite performer.
Yea he is a legend, I hated to hear of his passing.
Me and you both! I was so sad after I found out.
Which of his songs did you like the most?
That is hard to narrow down since I basically like them all!
Come on, you have to have a favirote.
I guess I would go with either Kiss or Purple Rain.
Both of those are pretty good songs.
Another great song of his is called Diamonds and Pearls.
I do not think I have ever heard that one.
I could introduce you to some great Prince music.
I will make you a deal; I will listen to Prince of you listen to Chris Brown.
I think I could handle that!
