Will Star Wars survive passed the 9th episode?
Sure why wouldnt it?
There are no plans for anything beyond that.
I mean even if they dont they still could do spin offs.
Like Rogue One?
Yeah side stories they explain
I think that would be tough to follow
Not really, they always do a good job explaining things
Plus we have the internet for stuff we missed!
Yeah Star Wars is just fine the way it is
