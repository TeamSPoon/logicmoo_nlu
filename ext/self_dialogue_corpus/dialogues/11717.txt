I recently watched a documentary about the Beatles.
How was it?
It was a little long but very interesting.
Who directed it?
I think it was Ron Howard.
Oh, cool. I'll have to check it out.
You should!
I'm really interested in the relationship between the Beatles and teenage girls.
How do you mean?
Teen girls' interests are often belittled, but they were the first demographic to embrace the Beatles, who went on create a lasting legacy.
