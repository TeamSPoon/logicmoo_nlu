Who is the greatest living film music composer?
Ooooh, tough one, but great question.
Are you going to answer?
Well, there are three or four possibilities.
And they are?
John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Hans Zimmer.
Of those, I prefer Zimmer.
Why's that?
His music is so alive, so driving, and great for action.
Yeah, but that's about all he can do.
He's about the same as Elfman for me.
Elfman too, is a bit limited. His genre is "weird"
Haha, yeah.
I'll have to go with John Williams.
Why is that?
Well, outside of being the most nominated composer ever, including Star Wars...
yeah, yeah,
He uses leitmotifs more than any other composer out there.
What's that mean?
That's where each character gets its own theme which is used throughout the movie. It gives them their own character and constantly changes, with them.
