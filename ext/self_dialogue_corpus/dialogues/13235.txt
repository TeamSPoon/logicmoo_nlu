The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite film in the entire series.
I think its where we see the Rebel Alliance in its full effect.
Yeah and you can tell vader is at his breaking point with them.
The probe droids were key in it.
Well that was just to find out where Luke and all of them went.
Yeah but I liked a change of pace.
Once the death star was eliminated i didnt think they would do another one.
Vader really made Luke fall into his trap
Well he was after his friend
Yeah the bond between Han and Luke was magical
