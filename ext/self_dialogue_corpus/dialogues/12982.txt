One of the great things about Star Wars is that they manage so many fantastical aliens.
I know! Like Jaba the Hutt.
I'm really surprised that the special effects were good enough to create him.
Or yoda, for that matter.
Yeah! I mean, at least Chewbacca was a tall guy in a suit.
It's different when you can just put on a suit.
Were there any others that you found particularly impressive?
I always thought Bib Fortuna was cool looking.
Who was that again?
The alien who advises Jabba the Hutt!
