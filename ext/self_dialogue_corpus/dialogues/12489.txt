Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I actually like Obi Wan Kenobi a lot.
The old version or the young one?
I like them both but I prefer the older Obi Wan.
Why do you like him the best?
I like how he is a teacher and is secretly watching Luke grow up. It's like he already knows all the events that will transpire.
Why do you think he let Darth Vadar kill him?
I think it has to do with a Force ability to come back as a ghost after you are dead. He even says that he will be more powerful than Darth Vadar ever imagined.
I never thought of it that way, it is an interesting theory. Do you think the Sith can do it also?
Possibly but its probably a more warped version of the ability. I think it is related to Anakin thinking he can prevent death from happening or some kind of mastery over death like that.
