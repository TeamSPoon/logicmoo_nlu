What are you hearing?
The Beatles!!! Do you like them too?
Oh wow, I heard a lot of them but never heard that song.
It's called We can work it out! I think it came out in 1970,
Sounds a little different from the others, why is that?
Oh probably because that's from the time Lennon and McCartney worked together, they composed the best lyrics but then Lennon left and things changed.
They were great after that too but I have to admit they were better when they had Lennon.
They also wrote for other singers, Fame sung by David Bowie was written by Lennon and McCartney too!
Sad times for the company that turned them down before they got famous!!! What a money machine!
Yeah Decca's bad move there, Parlophone had the best move and signed them.
