Do you like John Hamm?
I do very much!
I thought he was amazing in mad men, I just wonder is his film career really going anywhere?
I think he has had some good work film wise.
Like what would you say is good?
I love the town!
He is just a cop , like supporting role.
Still him in a decent size role in a great film.
But really what else that one spy movie was a big flop.
I agree that one,Keeping Up with the Joneses looked cheesy and bad.
Apparently he was in kissing jessica stein but i don't recall him much at all.
Well he is going to be in that new film Baby Driver.
I do think this one looks good for an action type film.
I am interested to see it.
Ansel Elgort should be good in it I hope.
I am on the fence did not love all the divergent films. But this looks better to me.
The divergent films were more geared for tweens, this seems more adult.
That is true. Though he still plays the "baby".
I can't help but think of dirty dancing a little.
I thought the same thing seeing the trailer. Nobody puts baby in the corner, would have been a great tag for this movie!
