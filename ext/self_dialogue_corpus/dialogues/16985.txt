Do you like Radiohead?
Who doesn't?
Which one of their albums is your favorite?
I prefer their early stuff, so I would say The Bends.
The Bends is a classic, but I love their experimental stuff like Hail to the Thief.
I can appreciate the risks they take with their music, but I like organic instruments.
I can't argue against that. What is your favorite song from The Bends?
It's hard to choose just one, but I guess my favorite is Fake Plastic Trees.
That's a beautiful song.
I'm sure I've listened to that song over a thousand times in my life, and I still have not gotten sick of it.
When a song is that good, it's not possible to get sick of it.
I agree. I saw them perform it live once, and it was one of the greatest moments of my life.
That sounds amazing. I have never seen Radiohead live, but I've always wanted to.
You must see them next time they go on tour. They are amazing live.
I would love to. Do they vary their sets or play all new stuff?
They do a good job at varying their sets. Is there one song you would love to hear live?
I would love to hear Sail to the Moon live.
That is a lovely song. It has a dreamlike quality.
It does. They are incredibly gifted.
They absolutely are.
