Do you like to go to the movies?
Yeah, sometimes.  If there is something good playing.  What's type of movies do you like?
I'm into adventure movies or action ones.  Like the Bourne series.
Those are great.  I love Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon plays him real well.
My favorite is Born Identity.  Back at the beginning in 02.
I think my favorite is the Bourne Legacy.  Can't remember what year that was.  It was real good.
2012,  Excellent too.  I also like that Taken series with Liam Neeson.
Those are great.  I've seen them all a couple of times.
Yeah, pretty intense.  What's your favorite type of movie?
I like a good comedy every now and then like Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
Oh yeah,  That's one of my favorites.  John Candy is my favorite comedian.
Yeah, and you gotta love Steve Martin.
They played so well off each other in that movie.
What was your favorite part?
So many...got to be sitting on the highway and the car catches on fire.  Man makes me laugh now.
That is pretty funny.  Or when they are driving down the wrong way just before that and John Candy is making like that couple is drunk.
Yeah, it's pretty good all right.  I like Uncle Buck too.
Oh yeah, with that big pancake turner. lol.
I know.  Well what are we going to go see.
A comedy.
