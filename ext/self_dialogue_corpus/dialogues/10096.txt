What is a good movie about the apocalypse?
I suggest you check out Terminator 2.
I heard that movie was scary.
It is scary because it could happen. You should face your fears though.
I will. What happens in this movie?
A robot goes back in time to try to destroy a man who will save humanity in the future.
That makes my brain hurt! I already have enough trouble keeping up with today.
It isn't that bad. There is good story progression.
Will it require more than one watches?
It might. You will catch more if you watch it again.
