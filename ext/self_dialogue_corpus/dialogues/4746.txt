Did you watch the Braves and Blue Jays last night?
Yeah, Braves looked terrible, and now Freeman is out.
It was dumb for Braves to retaliate against Bautista
Yeah, all that happened was that he got a free base and that started a big inning
If you're going to throw at someone, just scare them I guess. Why put them on base?
Yeah what good does it do to put baserunners on for no reason? I never understood that
Both those teams are terrible anyway.
The whole NL East is bad except for the Nationals, how many games will they win that division by?
Jeez at least 20 probably. Even the Mets are way under .500.
And weren't they in the playoffs last year?
Yes, and the World Series the year before.
Well the Royals won it that year and they are even worse I think.
I tell you, small market teams have to do everything right to stay relevant. They need too much luck every year
Yeah, the Royals caught the breaks but now they're not. Big market teams can rebuild much quicker
Look at the Pirates, they had to lose for 20 years just to get enough good players to finally make the playoffs
Yeah, and now they're in last place again. Hopefully it's not another 20 years
Other than the Rays for a few years and the Royals for a few years, it seems like there are about 10-15 small teams that are invisible.
I think the Twins and Brewers are actually in first place, but how many people realize that?
Probably cause their stays won't be long. I can't see the Indians and Cubs not winning those divisions.
Yeah, but they have both struggled for 40 games now. Still asleep at the switch.
