Which film do you consider the biggest superhero flop?
Catwoman with halle berry. It was so awful.
It was pretty bad, when that caliber of actress can't make it work you know that is a bad film.
I wonder if she is embarrassed by this performance?
Probably but many great actors have one or two awful roles/performances. just need to give the next good one to make us forget.
I am not sure anyone forgot how bad this was. but I do think she has been forgiven.
I think it is hard for actors, you never know for sure what you are involving yourself in, like is the picture that ruins you?
Some superhero movies may up lift a career too, put you in the limelight.
True, I mean I think I only know henry cavill because of playing superman.
But then flip it again and you get ben affleck as batman and that was just bad.
