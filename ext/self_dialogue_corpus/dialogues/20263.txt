Hey, what're you up to today?
It's raining and cold. Probably just going to lay around and Netflix it today. Any recommendations?
Yeah, let me think about it. Any genres you like?
Horror, suspense, comedy. I'm up for anything.
I saw a good one last weekend I'd definitely recommend.
What was it called? I'm up for something new.
It was a zombie movie, but an interesting one. All in Korean with subtitles.
Sweet, I love zombie movies. Not so sure about the subtitles though. I'm not a huge fan of reading while watching.
It was called Train to Busan directed by Yeon Sang-ho. Trust me, it's worth it.
Yeah?
Totally, you almost done even realize that there are subtitles because there's so much action.
Does it all take place on a train? The whole thing?
Most of it, but not the whole thing, no. It's set throughout Korea too.
That sounds like an interesting concept.
You should watch it!
I'll have to give it a try.
Definitely ranks up there with one of my favorite zombie/apocalyptic movies.
Awesome, thank you for the recommendation. I'll check it out.
No problem, let me know what you think of it.
I will! Off to Netflix land I go, haha.
