Do you think the Buffalo Bills should have fired Rex Ryan?
Yes, he wasn't a very good coach and has a bad temper.
Who did they hire as a new coach?
Sean McDermott, I think he will do a good job.
Where did Sean McDermott last coach?
He coached the defense for the Carolina Panthers.
I hope Tyrod Taylor can have a good year, do you think he will?
It's hard to say but he really needs to pass for more yards this year.
Do you think Sammy Watkins can stay healthy for the whole season?
I don't know, he seems to be a very injury prone wide reciever.
What other good wide receivers doe the Bills have?
They have Brandon Tate and they just drafted Zay Jones, hopefully they can be productive.
Who else did the Bills draft this year?
They drafted Jason Croom, Dion Dawkins, Anthony Harrell and Jordan Johnson, we'll see how well they can perform.
Is Richie Incognito still on the team?
Yes he is and he seems to be playing well and staying out of trouble.
Will LeSean McCoy have a 1000 yard rushing season this year?
It's very possible, he's very talented but it depends on how many carries he can get in this offense.
Have you ever seen the Bills play in person?
Yes, it's a lot fun to see them play in person!
