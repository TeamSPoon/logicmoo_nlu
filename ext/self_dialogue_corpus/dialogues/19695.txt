Where are you going?
To the nursing home.
Why? I thought you hate old people.
I do, but it's for a class project.
What's the class?
It's a class called Music and The Mind. It's pretty cool.
What do you do in it?
We study how music affects the brain, the parts of the brain, memory, et cetera.
Did you just say et cetera out loud? That's weird.
Sorry.
So why are you going to the home?
Oh, we're working with the Alzheimers and Dementia patients.
With music?
Yeah, it's awesome, actually.
How's that work?
We custom-make iPod shuffles with music from the teens and late 20's.
What's that do?
It can calm them down, bring back happy memories, put them in different states of mind, and even some of them get up and dance!
It cures Alzheimers?
No, but it's important for the patients and the caregivers. It's music therapy, basically.
