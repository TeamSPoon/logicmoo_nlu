Do you like rap music?
It depends on the artist and the content.
Which artists do you like?
I have a wide range of artists within the rap world that I listen to.  From Will Smith's bubblegum rap to DMX or TuPac.
Do you like Snoop Dog?
I enjoy several of his songs but I think he works best on collaborations with other artists.
For example?
"The Next Episode" was a song he worked on with Dr. Dre.  It's got a really nice hook and flow.
What do people mean when they refer to flow in the genre of rap?
In my opinion, they're talking about the way the words and music flow with each other- it's like a groove, when you're in it, you're in it.
Do you ever get offended by the lyrics? Hasn't there been controversy with rap lyrics?
I've only heard one or two songs, in my life, with lyrics that were so offensive I couldn't listen.  And, there's controversy in any genre.
How do you mean?
Rap doesn't have a trademark on controversy.  In the 80's, rap was a way for a minority population to express the feelings they had about authority.
Sure.
So, if something or someone is making you angry, the rap would reflect that anger.  But, I don't think it was a physical battle cry.  I think it was meant to be a statement on a situation.
Do you mean a racial situation?
Could be racial, but it was more often than not a societal commentary.  And, it's not solely a rap thing.
I guess you're right.  Didn't the Dixie Chicks get  in hot water for some of their lyrics?
Not only them, but Toby Keith, and several country artists have made political and cultural statements with their work.
