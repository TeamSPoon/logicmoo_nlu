What is your favorite movie?
I really like the Lion King! I watched it all the time as a kid, and I just saw it on Broadway last month!
That was the movie with the baby lion that was friends with the warthog and the meercat, right?
Yes! They adopted the baby lion, Simba, after his uncle killed his dad.
Heavy stuff for a kid's movie!
Yeah, but there were some great songs. I liked "Hakuna matata!"
That is a good one! It means no worries, for the rest of your days.
Yes! And it made "The Circle of Life" such a classic song. Once you hear it, it's stuck in your head forever!
Is that the song that plays at the beginning of the movie?
Yeah! When the sun is rising over Mufasa's kingdom.
