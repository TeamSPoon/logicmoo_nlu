What happened to the Kansas City Royals?
Man they have really fell off of the wagon.
They went from being on top of the world, to being in the outhouse in less than 2 years.
Yeah that is a swift drop!
Their pitching has really failed them this year and they are struggling to score runs
Yeah, the good thing is that they play in a weak division
True. But when I watch this team I'm not convinced that they can be division winners.
I don't know. Maybe they can make some deals at the trading deadline.
I don't know if they are going to want to increase their current payroll.
You're right. They are a small market team who probably wants to trim that payroll
It doesn't help that Yordano Ventura died in the offseason
Yeah that really cast a black shadow on this organization.
They were really expecting him to be the future ace of their staff
Exactly. I don't know what there next move will be, but they need to do something.
If I were running that team, I would wait to see where the team is after the all-star break
Yeah that way you can make a determination which direction to go
Then your fanbase won't scream too loud if you start slashing payroll.
Yeah that's a really good point.  A lot of fans are knowledgeable about how this works.
From the penthouse to the outhouse in less than 2 years. Only in Kansas City!
Yeah, well at least they won a championship. No one can take that away!
