Did you hear about the free concert this summer?
No. Where?
In Jacpot.
Cool. Who's playing?
I'm not sure who they got this year.
A couple of years ago they had Sammy Hagar.
I'll bet that was a fun show.
It was. They help it outside too.
Man! Wish I could have seen that one.
Well, hopefully they get someone just as good.
I've seen Blue Oyster Cult come through.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
And one of the brothers from ZZ Top.
Still bearded?
No Beard.
Sad...
I agree.
Well, let me know when you find out who's is coming.
I will!
Thank you, Sir!
