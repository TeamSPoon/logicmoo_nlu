Yea, I wouldn't bet on the Seahawks. They seem to be trending downwards.
What? Weren't they in the playoffs last year?
Yea, but they lost Marshawn Lynch and just didn't have the same pop.
Yea, I agree to some extent, but they still have an amazing defense.
Yea, if they can keep Richard Sherman's head on straight.
He is a great player, but sometimes he just needs to keep his mouth shut.
Yea, well it seems like if he keeps moving his lips, he may be traded.
Well, if he is traded, I don't know who I would bet to win the NFL or Superbowl.
I would probably expect the Falcons to come out of the NFL.
Yea? You think they could get back to the superbowl?
They might. They have a really strong team.
They do and Matt Ryan is coming off a great season.
Exactly! You never know though. Anybody could have a great year.
Yea, there's always a few other teams to watch.
It's just tough to see anyone taking down the Patriots. They just keep getting better.
Yea, they do, but sometimes age eventually catches up.
Yea, I can understand that, but sometimes I don't know how Bellichek does it.
Me either, the guy just wins.
How many superbowls does he have?
I really don't even know. I lost count.
