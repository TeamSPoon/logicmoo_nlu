Who is your favorite bad guy in the Star Wars movies?
Boba Fett, like there any other choice.
I would have to agree. What he lacks in screen time, he makes up for in awesome.
I never understood why they limited his on screen time so much.
I didn't either. You would think they would have really utilized this guy.
And the way he got killed, come on. That was just sad, lack of any vision.
Yeah, that was a terrible way to kill off someone so popular.
It would be like if Han Solo just ran into a asteroid and no one said anything else about it.
Well, probably not quite that bad, but I do get your point.
Yeah, that was a little over board.
