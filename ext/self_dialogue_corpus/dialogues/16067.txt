What is a hidden style of music that you like?
I like Jazz music.
Really? Who's your favorite band?
Steely Dan is one of my favorites.
A lot of people don't like them.
I can understand why but I like their music.
It's much more mellow than rock bands.
Many men don't think it's tough enough.
Music don't have to be masculine to be good.
They had plenty of Billboard hits.
Do It Again is still played on the radio alot.
That song came out in the 70s.
Those people are still alive.
Haha and younger people also listen as well.
They must have been inspired by BB King.
He was a great performer. I'm sure he inspired a plethora of people.
Blues and Jazz mix well together.
They are similar genres of music.
It's less aggressive than rock and roll.
Those bands still used those elements such as the Beatles.
