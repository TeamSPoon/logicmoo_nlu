Have you ever seen The Reef?
Is that a shark thriller movie?
Yea, a group of people on a boat crash, and they get hunted by a giant shark.
Yea I think I did see that actually. It was pretty corny.
Yea, but I love shark movies, even when they are corny!
Yea, I admit I watched the whole movie.
They basically just took turns swimming to a reef and getting killed.
Yea, I wish I could be a shark movie writer.
It's not about the story, it's about putting yourself in their place and getting scared.
Yea, definitely. That's why I watch shark movies too.
