Hey, you really like the "Fast and Furious" movies don't you?
Oh, yeah, for sure! They are some of favorite movies! Did you see "The Fate of the Furious" yet?
No, not yet, but I thought I would ask you about it. Did you like it?
Oh yeah, it was awesome! I really like it when the movies kind of take Dom and the team all across the globe; it really gives the stories an "epic adventure" kind of feel.
Cool! Where did they go in this one?
Well, I don't want to spoil too much, but they go pretty much everywhere in this one, including Cuba, Russia, and New York.
Wow, that's pretty awesome. I am guessing there are some crazy chase scenes like always too, right?
Oh yeah! There is a crazy scene involving a submarine in Russia that will totally blow your mind!
Wow! I really have to see it! Just when you think Dom has done it all, it pulls off some even crazier stunt!
For sure! This one even tops Furious 7, and that is really saying something!
