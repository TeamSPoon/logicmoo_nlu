Did you know Elvis made so many movies?
I knew he made a few, I like   a few.
I did not , I just started seeing some.
Did you catch his drama, Flaming Star?
No, a drama? I thought they were all just sort of romance singing ones.
No, he did a really great drama in Flaming Star. I do not even think he sang much.
Wow. I just finished, Blue Hawaii. It was cute.
His love movies are cute. There is one called, Clambake. Super cute and fun.
I do not think I have seen that one. I got a kick out of Kissing Cousins.
Where he plays more than one person, it was a fun one too.
Did you like the one Change of Habit?
I thought it was a bit more tuff, more drama.
I liked it. Who knew he could act.
Well he did make dozens of films.
Some of them seem to be like the same movie, only new songs.
Yeah, all the summer movies. Beach stuff.
They all remind me of that one movie with the mousketerr people.
Beach Blankey Bingo?
Yes! That one. With Annete something.
Annette Funichelo. Another cute summer film series.
