Did you like D12
Yeah I thought they were great
Why did they stop rapping
Proof died I think
So why not do it without him?
Then Eminem stopped doing much with them
Ok theres still 4 guys.
That kind of rap got old quickly
They had the talent to reinvent themselves
Yeah but all they knew was doing drugs and people dont want to hear that anymore.
