Did you know that in Frozen there's an Easter egg where you can see Rapunzel and Flynn?
Really? When?
During Elsa's coronation. You only see them for a moment and it's mostly the back of their heads.
That's so crazy. I wonder how they're related.
Yea, there's other Easter eggs and theories about Frozen too.
Like what?
Well one of the theories is that Elsa and Anna's parents were shipwrecked and basically became part of the Tarzan storyline.
Like they were Tarzan's parents?
Yeap.
That's so crazy! But I guess it would make sense.
