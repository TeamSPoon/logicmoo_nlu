What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I really like The Deathly Hallows 1.
It was pretty good with all of the different scenes when they were on the run. My favorite is The Goblet of Fire.
Oh yeah, that one is pretty good, too. Why is it your favorite?
I like it because we get to see them as teenagers for the first time exploring their first love sort of thing. And I like the ballroom scene.
Hermiony did look really pretty in her dress. It seems like she went for kind of a bad boy.
She didn't seem to have much in common with him. He was all brawn and no brain. But looks count for something when you are exploring. Plus I think she was trying to get Ron to make a move by making him jealous.
Ron did seem a little jealous about the two of them. He didn't really have a good time at the dance.
No, he didn't. But that was his own fault. He wouldn't dance so his date found someone else.
Ha, Ha. Yes she did. I had forgotten about that.
