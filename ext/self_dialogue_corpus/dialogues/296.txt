I don't think I've seen a good superhero movie since The Dark Knight.
The Dark Knight was an amazing movie. Christian Bale will always be Batman to me.
The voice he did in that movie was so great.
I know! His suit was also really cool.
It really was. I also think the dark tone of the movie really pulled it together.
I agree. It didn't feel like a superhero movie, which is why it was the best superhero movie.
I think so too. I even got my mom to watch it.
I can't believe that! Has she ever seen any other movies like Batman?
No, not that I know of. She may have seen the first Spiderman, but I don't think she did.
Spiderman is also one of my favorite superhero movies!
