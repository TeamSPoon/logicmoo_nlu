What's your favorite Disney movie?
Cinderella, by far.
Why Cinderella?
I can relate to the whole wicked step mother thing.
Your step mom was evil and wanted to see you fail?
Something like that.
Do you at least get a charming prince out of it?
Not at all.
I guess it could have been worse.
Not really. I really did have to sweep chimneys.
