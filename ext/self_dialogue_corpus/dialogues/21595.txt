I think the movies are really bad these days
why do you think that
just because there is so much language in films today
I guess I have not noticed
It is in everything, I guess that is the way people talk these days
I guess so
It makes me really mad to watch a good movie that has lots of cursing in it
it does not bother me
I just turn it off, I do not even bother with it
how do you avoid it
I usually go to a website that reviews movies and see how much language is in them
oh that is a good way to find out
it helps because you dont waste money on a movie ticket or rental
is it east to find the sites
I have 1 I use and trust
I will have to look into that
the site break down even all  of the words spoken so you know if it acceptable for you or not
that seems like a lot of work
it probavly is but they have lots of reviewers
I would love that job!
