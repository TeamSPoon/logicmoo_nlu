I can't wait to see the new, live Action Mulan!
they're making that?
oh yeah!
well...will Eddie Murphy be reprising his iconic role as mushu?
sources say no, but that would be cool.
wouldn't it?
they're doing a fairly racially accurate cast so far, though
that's surprising
i know, right? it's disney
they're always messing up
