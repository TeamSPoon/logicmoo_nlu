So when do you usually listen to music?
I'm listening to music all the time. When i workout, when I game, when I do homework.
Yeah me too. I couldn't function without music.
What kind of music do you listen to?
All different kinds, and it depends on what I'm doing.
Me too. For example when I workout i listen to EDM, and when I do homework, I listen to chill.
Wow it's the opposite for me. When I do homework, I listen to EDM and when I go for a jog I listen to chill music or oldies.
That's funny. I guess we have opposite tastes. What are you favorite EDM tracks?
I like Calvin Harris, Eden, anything mainstream really.
Yeah they're pretty good. I also listen to them, and some dubstep too when I workout.
How do you listen to dubstep. It's just a bunch of noise.
I don't know. The chaos gets me pumped when I'm lifting weights.
Oh that makes sense. I mostly workout by running, so all that noise doesn't really make sense.
Maybe the dubstep will make you run faster.
Maybe.
One thing I used to do was do a light jog on the chorus, and when the drop came on, I would go ham and start sprinting.
Interesting way to exercise.
Yeah. It's kind of like lifting weights except cardio in a sense.
Yeah that's true. Go write a book man.
Haha shut up.
