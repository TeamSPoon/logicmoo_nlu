Do you think Clayton Kershaw will ever pitch in the playoffs again?
Sure I do.
He has just been terrible in them.
Yeah he has but thats just how he is. LA will qualify for the postseason.
Does this take away from how effective people will remember him.
People carried around A-Rod's playoff failures so I think it does.
I cant believe Kershaw still has not figured it out.
Me neither its very bizzare.
Some guys are just not gamers.
I would not say that he isnt a gamer.
Yeah but he coils up in pressure situations.
Maybe he isnt a number one pitcher
In the regular season he is
Thats true I dont know what they should do with him
They are paying him like a top end ace and Joe Blanton pitches better than him
Didnt Blanton hit a homer before
Yes in the World Series for the Phillies.
Talk about a guy who has had a long career doing nothing
Well hes a champion
True I guess I shouldnt say hes done nothing
