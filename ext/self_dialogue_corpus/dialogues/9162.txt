You ever listen to REM?
I'm not a big fan, but I'll listen to them every now and then.
They really had a ton of hits back in the 90s.
Yeah, I really liked 90s type of rock, so I don't mind listening to them.  They have a lighter sound than today's music.
Yeah, I listen to music from that time more than I listen to stuff from today.
What's your favorite song by REM?
I don't know.  I really like Shiny Happy People for some reason.
Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.
Why not?
It's just not as popular as Everybody Hurts or Man on the Moon or anything like that.
