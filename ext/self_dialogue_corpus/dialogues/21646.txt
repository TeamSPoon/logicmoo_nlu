Hey Bob, can I join you for lunch?
Yeah sure! I'm actually checking out what movie I would like to see this weekend.
Oh I can recommend a good movie!
Which one?
Me and my wife went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2!
What? I didn't even like the first one!
No no! You are mistaken my friend.. Vin Diesel does the voice for the Baby Groot! Its so funny
Umm I'm still not sure
And Bradley Cooper does the voice for Rocket the Raccoon!
I never understood why a Raccoon was in space!
Well just go and see it and you will not be disappointed.. at least take the kids!
Hmm ok but first I will have to watch the first part.
Yeah try to rent it on netflix or hulu before you go otherwise you will be lost.
I also don't know if my kids are into it also
Ask them! If not there are other movies out that you can see
Ok will ask them when I get home.
It may turn out that you are the only one in your house that has not seen guardian of the galaxy one!
Yeah it could be!
Anyways good luck with your movie weekend!
I will thanks for the advice!
