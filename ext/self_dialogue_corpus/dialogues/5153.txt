What was that Disney animated movie that starred Mandy Moore?
You mean Tangled?
Yes, that's the one. What is that story about?
It's basically the Rapunzel plot, with a few new twists.
I see. I think I've heard one of the songs from it.
It might be "When Will My Life Begin." That's probably the most popular one.
It could be. How did you like Mandy Moore in that role?
I thought she was awesome. I've always liked her as a singer and actress, though.
Me, too.
It's a pretty funny movie as well. A lot of people like Frozen more, but I am rather fond of Tangled.
