Did you see that a new Frozen movie is finally coming out?
Yes, but not until November of 2019!
I know, that really seems like a long time to wait.
I feel like people will have forgotten about it by then.
Oh, I don't know. It became quite the cultural phenomenon.
That's true. I think the songs are really what did it.
Yes, Disney hadn't produced anything like that with great songs in a long time.
I think they realized that they should go back to that which is why we got Moana.
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.
It is really good! And another one that incoporates songs throughout the movie.
I've heard one - something about the water.
Yes, it is How Far I'll Go.
That's it! I really like that one.
Yes, the movie has a lot of really great songs in it.
As much as I like Disney remaking the classic movies as live action, I think it's great that they've started to go back to the musical format but with new movies.
Clearly audiences like it to! It seems to be a winning formula for them.
Definitely. Do they have anything like that coming out next year?
I don't think so. I think it is mostly remakes and sequels.
That's too bad. I like those too, but it is nice to see something really original.
I definitely agree!
