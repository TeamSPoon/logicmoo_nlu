Did you get a chance to see "Wonder Woman" yet?
Not yet.  Did you?
I saw an early screening last week.  I loved it.
Really?  Warner Brothers finally made a good DC Comics film?
I would say say they did an amazing job.
Interesting.  What did you like about it?
Can I say any spoilers?
No spoilers please.
Well, the movie's tone was much better than any of the other DC comics films.
Was it more light-hearted?
Yes it was.  It was light-hearted, but it was able to balance that with seriousness.
That sounds promising.
Gal Gadot did wonderful as Wonder Woman.
Was that a pun?
Sorry.  I had to say that.
How were the villains in the film?
The villains were just OK.  That was one of the weak points.
That's a shame.
Overall, it still didn't detract from the film.  I can't recommend it enough.
I may go see it tonight.
