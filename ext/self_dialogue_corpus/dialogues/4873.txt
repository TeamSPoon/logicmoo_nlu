What did you think of the Red Sox off-season moves?
I thought they were okay, but not great.
I agree.  What moves did you like?
I liked how we got Chris Sale to help the rotation.
Me too.  He is a stud.
I also like how we got Thornburg for the bullpen.
Agree, good move.  Did we give up too much?
Not really.  Moncada is young and supposed to be great, but you never know.
I would have rather kept him and gotten rid of Castillo.
Totally.  He has proven to be a bust.
I wish we had gotten more power to replace Ortiz.
Me too.  Encarnacion would have been great.
I agree.  Moreland is okay, but nowhere near the power.
And we already had Hanley at first base.
I know.  I would have preferred getting a decent third baseman.
Tell me about it.  Sandoval is not the answer.
No, he was a bust.  And Holt is good, but not for everyday.
Right, he's a great utility man.  Maybe we can make a trade during the season.
Yeah, go back to the White Sox and get Frazier for third base and Quintana for the rotation.
I'd be happy to give them Sandoval, Allen Craig, a minor leaguer and some cash.  They can have Swihart too.  He's a bust.
