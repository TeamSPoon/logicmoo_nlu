The Force.... is it a religion woth a power or do people who blieve in it so much get power.
What do you mean?
Well, is the power of The Force like mutants in X-Men, Telekenisis or something.
Possibly. What made you think of that?
Well, in Episode one, Anikin's metachlorins levels were off the chart. So is accessing the force a biologicial thing?
I never thought of it that way.
That being the case, only certain people can harnase the force, not everyone.
So that would mean.....
It would mean it's not a "Religion" but more like a mutation, like in X-Men.
Wow, a interesting theory.
