What is your favorite horror movie?
Have you ever seen the movie "In Dreams"?
No I don't think so. Is it new?
No, it came out years and years ago.
Who was in it? Anyone well known?
Yeah, Robert Downey Junior and Annette Bening.
Oh no way! Do you remember what year that movie came out?
I want to say late 90's?
I am going to have to check it out.
Yeah, definitely.
