Pirates of the Carribean is awesome.
It's an epic movie, what more can we say?
It's probably the most epic movie Disney has made in a while.
Probably the most epic movie EVER!
Sword fights and cannon battles. You can't really get any more epic than that.
And it's one of the series of movies Disney has made that the second and third movies aren't bad films.
That's true, I really do like Pirates 2 and 3.
Which one was your favorite?
Dead Man's Chest.
I liked At World's End.
