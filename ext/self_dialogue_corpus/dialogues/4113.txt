Have you ever seen Silence of the Lambs?
That's one of the most terrifying movies ever.
Anthony Hopkins was born to play that role.
Right he had the right blend of psychopathy and civility needed for that role.
Jodie Foster didn't do too bad of a job either.
That's right she didn't. She was pretty good in Panic Room also.
That's the one where she had a daughter right?
Yes and they had a special room they were able to hide from robbers in.
I definitely need a room like that, just to hide away from my kids.
You and me both. But without all the thrills and suspense.
