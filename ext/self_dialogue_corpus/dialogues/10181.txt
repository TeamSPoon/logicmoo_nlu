Arnold Schwarznegger is one of my favorite actors.
What movies did you like him in?
Terminator is a classic movie.
Oh, that was one of the best movies.
It's so cool how he was a robot terminating people.
There were plenty of action scenes.
Yeah, I don't like the soft romantic stuff.
It's a pretty fast paced movie.
That's good. I don't like to be bored watching movies.
Arnold movies are always fun to watch.
