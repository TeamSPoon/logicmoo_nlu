What do you think will be the biggest Cinderella team this year in the NFL?
I'm gonna go with the Rams winning the NFC North division!
Wow, that is a very bold prediction.
Here is my other prediction. Brock Osweiler will start at quarterback for the Browns.
You must be a comedian. Brock is the absolute worst quarterback I have ever seen.
He at least has some experience, so there's some hope. Maybe a new team will suit him better.
But the Browns man. They are not a great team.
I know, but they are a young team and hungry. You never know.
Alright. My prediction is that Brady retires this season after winning the Superbowl
No way, The man says he wants to play until he is mid-40s.
Well, when you have six rings, that might be untouchable. Plus his wife is worried about him.
I don't think so. He's still playing at a high level. And if they win, he has to try for the three-peat.
Maybe you're right. That would be a crazy goal that he would like to achieve.
Him and Bill Belichick you know! No one has done that before.
How crazy would it be if they went 19-0 this year to win the superbowl and then next year, get the threepeat.
No one, and I mean no one can ever touch their legacies ever!
I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. Imagine watching that play out.
It would be historic. Any NFL fan would have to appreciate it.
I can't wait for the season to start already!
I know, I got a new big screen TV just to watch the games.
