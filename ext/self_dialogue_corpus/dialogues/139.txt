Which actor portrayed the Joker the best?
Jack Nicholson.
Really? Not Heath Ledger?
Heath's performance was decent, but not that memorable to me.
I disagree. Heath did a phenomenal portrayal of The Joker in The Dark Knight.
I know a lot of people think that, but I don't see it that way.
Why not? What makes Jack better than Heath?
Well, for starters he was more of a nut and more maniacal.
Well, what about Jared Leto in Suicide Squad?
Don't get me started on that one. I didn't care for his dull performance at all.
