What do you consider the best genre of music?
I don't really know, that's a tough one to narrow down them all to just one.
Yeah but if you only could pick one what would you choose?
I would probably do 80's.
Why? Such a weird time.
It's such a fun time you mean.
Yeah I guess so. I would prefer the 90's.
How can you go wrong with Queen and Michael Jackson?
I don't know, just not my cup of tea.
Fair enough. So many one hit wonders in the 80's too.
Yeah, I guess you're right. But the 90's had gangster rap, boy bands, and amazing R&B.
True that, Boyz II Men, All 4 One, Shai, amazing.
Yup, best decade of music for me, I'd never get tired of 90's.
There was a lot more to choose from.
Crazy that most of those songs are "oldies" now.
Yeah, we're getting old but I can't ever get enough of the sound.
Something about analog versus digital, you just can't replicate it.
I'm not so sure, I'm okay with it. I can't really tell the difference.
It is nice that you can have thousands of CDs in one iPhone.
Yeah, that is true.
