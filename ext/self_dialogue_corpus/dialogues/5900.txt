i just bought the Frozen soundtrack.
Oh really I bet I have heard each song a bunch of times.
My favorite is probably In Summer with Olaf singing.
I just watched the movie again and Olaf still makes me laugh.
I hope he is in the second movie.
Ya I heard that is not coming out for a long time.
How did you feel about Cristoph and Anna?
I thought it was weird that she didn't know him that long but decided they were in love.
Ya I noticed that also. I thought it was strange after what had happened with Hans.
ya and he turned out to be a bad guy. Can you really trust Cristoph?
