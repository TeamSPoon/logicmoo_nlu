Scar is my all-time favorite Disney villain.
Scar? You think he's a better villain than Hades?
Hades? You like Hades better?
I mean, he is the King of the Underworld.
That is a more impressive title. Scar was so compelling though.
Hades is just really funny.
I haven't seen Hercules in a long time.
You should give it another shot! It's totally worth it.
Want to watch it with me?
Sure. How about Saturday?
