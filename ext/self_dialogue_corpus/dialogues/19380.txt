What do you think is the music for gen X?
Well, you know gen X covers a lot of territory. I would easily say 1965 to about 1975.
Agreed. I remember listening to Micheal Jackson, Blondie, Madonna, Men at Work.
Yeah, I remember all of them too. I didn't listen to them but I remember them being popular.
What about Air Supply, Hall and Oats, Chicago, Journey?
Yeah, all those sappy love ballads. We also had Queen and Asia.
Yeah, all that music is from when we were growing up. The music that I think defines our generation since I'm in the middle is the late 80's to early mid 90's.
You mean alternative rock and the grunge movement. Yeah, I totally get that. I didn't listen to a lot of radio. I got music from friends and we passed it around.
Ah, yes the iconic mixed tape!
Yep, some how it seems cooler than a CD though it definitely could get chewed up in the player.
I had a few of those myself. I was into Nirvana, Pearl Jam, early REM. I didn't really like their newer material.
We are on the same wave. I didn't listen to a lot of pop.
Me neither. I wouldn't say never but a song would creep in here and there. I did have a 70's throw back at that time and I was listening to more of that than the norm.
That's interesting. We were little kids then. The music was so different.
Yeah, some of it has to do with the vocals. They just had good voices and songs were good.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm having a hard time finding things these days even with apps like Pandora.
It doesn't seem to make it easier. I usually find stuff I hear on shows and then go look for it of Shazam it.
I do that too. I'm usually a year behind everyone else these days.
Yeah, I will probably have to have a retro music weekend.
Yep, you've given me the itch. Gen X music is turning out to be a classic.
