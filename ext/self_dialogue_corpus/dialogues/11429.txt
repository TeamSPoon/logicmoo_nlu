Hey, what do you think of the Beatles?
I don't know much about them. I think they are not from my mother's generation.
You might have heard their music somewhere, in the bar, parties, etc.
Yes, can you sing something that I might have heard?
Can'y buy me love...love....
Oh I know that one. Do you know another one?
Twist and shout! Baby baby baby...
I am not sure about that, but the melody sounds familiar.
You should check Beatles out. They are really cool.
I hope they are still giving concerts.
