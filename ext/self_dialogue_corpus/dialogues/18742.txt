What do you think of rock n roll?
I love it. I think it paved the way for modern music and then other genres to follow.
Why do you think that is true? Music has been around for centuries.
Well many of the rock bands of the 60's-80's learned from the blues and spun off from there. Very influential.
I agree. Some of those great blues artists set up many of the great rock bands.
Even the Beatles and many of the Great Britain bands like Led Zeppelin, etc. studied and learned from American blues
BB King and Buddy Guy as well as others still influence bands today.
Why do you think rock is fading?
Well I think it isn't fading, just evolving.
Heavy metal came around in the 90's like AC/DC, Metallic and others.
Yeah, a much harder sound for sure, but enjoyable once you get used to it.
Yeah, my sons started listening to Green Day and Nirvana, etc and I hated at first.
Me too. But after a year or two I came to really appreciate their talents.
What I am struggling with is today's version of pop music.
Why is that?
Because they are talented showmen, but lack instrumental skills.
Hmmm....interesting, I wish I knew why that was.
I suspect the music will come full circle in the next 50 years or so, but  I'm not sure.
Certainly pop has gotten more popular because of all the coverage on MTV, award shows, etc.
The rockers are having to still play to make a living because the music indusrty has been dramatically ltered.
