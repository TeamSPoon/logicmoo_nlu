Did you fill out your bracket yet?
Yeah, I actually filled out three.
Are you in a pool, or are they just for you?
I'm in one pool at work and one at the bar.  One is just for me.
Who do you have in the Final Four?
I took Kansas, North Carolina, Duke, and Gonzaga in my work pool.
Do you really think Kansas will get to the Final Four?
Yeah, they've been playing well at the end of the season.
I don't know, man.  They usually fold in the tournament.
Well, maybe this year they won't.
I don't know about that Gonzaga pick, either.
Why not?  They've been solid all year.
Yeah, but their conference is weak.
That doesn't matter; their coach can work magic.
I'm sticking with the Tarheels to go all the way.
Yeah, Roy looks pretty focused this year, and he's got a good team.
I'd like to see Kansas win, but I'm just not feeling it.
Self seems like a good guy, but sometimes his teams just can't finish.
You have to love this time of year.
Indeed, it's March Madness, baby!
