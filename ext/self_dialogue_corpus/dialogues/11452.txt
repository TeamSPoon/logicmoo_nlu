DId your parents listen to the Beatles when you were growing up?
Not really. SO I didn't really grow up knowing their music.
That's a shame. It's so good!
Is it?
Yeah. I really enjoy it.
What is your favorite album?
I like their traditional stuff, but I also really like The White Album.
I actually have listened to that one -- I took a history class that used that album as social and political commentary of the time.
That's really cool!
Yeah. Maybe I should give some of their other stuff a try.
