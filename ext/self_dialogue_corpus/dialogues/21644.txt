Have you ever seen the movie 50 Shades of Grey?
You mean that movie that was almost like a porno film?
Yea that's the one.
Wasn't it based on a book?
Yes actually it was. There are 3 books in the series.
Right! Just recently I watched the first 2 movies with my husband.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was actually really good.
Kind of raunchy though huh?
It definitely was but so interesting. I loved the story line.
I remember after the first movie I felt so sad hoping they would work it out.
I know. I'm so glad the second movie went as it did.
When his helicopter crashed I thought for sure that he died.
Yes that was terrifying!
I can't wait for the last and 3rd one to come out.
When will that happen?
Next year sometime, I forget exactly when.
Oh okay. I'll definitely want to watch that also.
Maybe we could go see it as a girls day.
That sounds like a great idea!
