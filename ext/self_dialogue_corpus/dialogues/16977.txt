This song reminds me of my job at the herb garden and of my Aggie.
Agnes your Scottie? What song, you're wearing ear buds.
Yes, Agnes. It's World Spins Madly On by The Weepies.
Love the Weepies! Why does it remind you of Aggie.?
Heard it the morning I woke up after she passed away. It was like a soundtrack to that moment.
Made you sad. Those lyrics!
Mad me sad but the next song that came on was I Was Made For Sunny Days, so it's a happy sad sort of thing.
Why the herb garden connection?
It's where I first heard the Weepies. We would listen to Pandora while we worked and they came into the mix.
Oh Pandora is great! So I bet stuff like Ingrid Michaelson and Matt Nathanson was in the mix.
Yes and even Shawn Colvin - now an oldie but goodie in many ways. Love her.
I jumped aboard the Colvin train at Few Small Repairs - amazing album!
Agree. I came on board at the very beginning via my WCLZ listening in the 80s. Remember Diamond in the Rough?
Oh yeah! So I do know some earlier stuff probably. Speaking of 80s woman folksters - remember Tanita Tikaram?
Slice him up, slice him up poor cow! hahaha how could I forget! She was great. Wonder if she still records?
I think so. I Googled a while back and it looked like she still tours anyway.
Queen of the females in the genre is Joan Armatrading. I've seen her twice in concert. She still tours!
Yeah I read somewhere she says she will never retire.
Hope she comes around here again. One of those artists whose music I will never tire of.
Yes! Show Some Emotion, Down to Zero, Love and Affection - soooo many classics.
