What's your favorite rock band?
I like Led Zeppelin alot.
That's an old band. You don't like new music?
No, I feel like it has less emotion?
I understand all about that.
I really liked their guitar player.
Jimmy Page? He was one of the best.
He played a very messy style.
That's what rock is all about.
Some many guitarists were influenced by him.
He was truly a legend.
The vocalist is very distinct.
Robert Plant set up the tone of the band.
You can always tell a good band by their singer.
Journey is a great example of that.
Yeah, Steve Perry's voice is very distinct.
There's no mistaking who's singing.
Journey made so many hits.
Faithfully was my favorite song by them.
That's a ballad that will always be remembered.
