Some Beatles songs seem to be descriptions in the life of the Beatles.
Like what?
The first one that comes to mind is "Penny Lane."
What makes it feel like it's a real life description?
Specific details of people in the streets, and moments in time.
Like "The banker never wears a Mac in the pouring rain/very strange"?
Yes, exactly like that.
Do you know if there is actually a street called Penny Lane?
I don't know.
It would be cool to find out though!
