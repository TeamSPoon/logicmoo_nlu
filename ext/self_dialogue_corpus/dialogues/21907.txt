What type of movie interests you?
Well, I like romance and comedy.  Maybe some drama.
I like those type of movies too!  I do not like science fiction or fantasy movies in the least.
I don't ever watch those type of movies either.  They don't hold my interest.  I want something real not fantasy.
So what have you watched lately?
I haven't seen anything recently.
Well, name a movie that you have seen even if it's been a while.
I've seen Bridges of Madison County.  It is an older movie, it came out in 1995.  One of my favorites.
What's it about?
Well, it stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep.
Oh, I love their acting.  I bet they did a great job together in the movie.
Clint Eastwood is a photographer and he happens to need directions and stops at Meryl Streep's house and asks for directions to a bridge that he wants to photograph.
Well, tell me more.
That's how they  met.  Her husband is out of town so she is alone when he comes to her house.
Oh, sounds like romance in the making.
Yes, It turns out to be such a romantic love story.  They fall deeply in love with each other.
Does her husband ever find out?
No, not that I can reacll.  He does come back into town.
How does it end?
She ends up seeing him in town while she was with  her husband.  Of course it is one of those tear jerker parts where you just wish they could be in a relationship forever.  Very touching.
