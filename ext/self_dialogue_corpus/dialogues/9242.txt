What are you doing?
Talking to myself...
Is anybody listening?
I don't think so. I think I put myself to sleep.
Yeah, you are quite the conversationalist.
Uh-huh.
OK. Do you mind if I change the topic of conversation to rock music?
Fine. Just stay away from death musicians...they freak me out.
Ok. Did you hear that Ozzie Osbourne is making a come-back?
Why? Did he tire of needlepoint?
