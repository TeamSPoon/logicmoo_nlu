Did you see that movie A Monster Calls? Sigourney Weaver and Felicity Jones were in it.
No, I never even heard of it.  Was it in theaters?
Yes, it was for a few weeks.  Unfortunately, they pulled it really early.
So it wasn't good?
No, I thought it was amazing but I think they marketed it as a kids fantasy type movie.
What type of movie was it?
It was more of a drama and sad movie.  It's about a boy dealing with grief because his mother is sick with cancer.
So, not one you want to take the kids to huh?
Yeah definitely not.  It was based on a book and the book is really good.
They're making a ton of movies based on books in the past few years aren't they?
They are.  That new movie Before I Fall is also based on a book.  It's a teen book I think by Lauren Oliver.
When did that come out?
I think it came out sometimes in March. I saw it at a small independent theater in town.
Was it good?
I thought it was very good but I looked up reviews later and it looks like it got pretty mixed reviews.
Is there anyone in it that I would know?
The star is Zoey Deutch. She played in Vampire Academy a few years ago.
That one was based on a book too right?
Yes it was. Lucy Fry was in that as well. I thought she was quite good in what I've seen her in but she's not really taken off.
She was good in that movie Mr. Church.
