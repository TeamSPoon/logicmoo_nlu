What do you think of the new Metallica album?
Hard Wired? I think it's their best album in a long time.
Yeah it's definitely their best work since the Black Album.
What's your favorite song on it?
Mine is Moth to the Flame. What's your's?
Mine is Atlas, Rise!
Yeah that one's good too.
The album is just really long. That's my only complaint.
Yeah it's two discs and almost 2 hours of music.
Some of the songs could have been removed I think.
Have you seen James Rolfe's Metallica playlist on youtube?
No what is it?
He changed the order of the album and added in some songs from Death Magnetic to make it more fluid.
That sounds awesome!
Yeah he has a new series about making music playlists.
What other artists has he done playlists on?
He just made one about Led Zeppelin using the different lyrical themes to group the songs.
Cool! What is his Youtube channel called?
His website and Youtube channel are called Cinemassacre.
Awesome I'll check it out!
