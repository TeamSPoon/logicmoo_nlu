Who do you think is the best quarterback in the NFL right now?
I would have to say Tom Brady. And that's saying something because there are some other really good ones.
I have to agree. The numbers he put up last year even after missing the first four games were amazing.
Yes, and he's absolutely ageless it seems.
I think there are others who are really good but fall short.
I would say Aaron Rodgers is the next best, but he was inconsistent last year before turning it on later in the season.
Yes, Rodgers when he's on comes pretty close to Brady. What other quarterbacks are up there?
I've always liked Ben Roethlisberger, but he gets hurt too much and may be tailing off now.
Yes, he has the career success that puts him up there. I think Matt Ryan is very good, but needs to do it for longer.
Ryan had a fantastic year last year, but I think a lot of that had to do with Julio Jones.
That's probably true. I think Drew Brees is still really good and Andrew Luck has the talent, he just needs a better line.
I feel like Luck may be a little overrated because people were wowed by his talent.
I think the next couple of years will tell us a lot about Luck and how good he really is.
Yes I would agree with that. Which young quarterbacks do you like?
I think Mariota, Winston, and Carr are poised to be good for a long time.
I think Matt Stafford is moving up my list with the numbers he's put up.
Stafford to me is just empty numbers though, he's never proven himself to be able to elevate his team.
I don't know I just think he has had bad teams around him.
What about Prescott in Dallas? He had an amazing year last year.
I wonder if a lot of that was due to the players around him. Plus it's only one year, he has a lot more to prove.
