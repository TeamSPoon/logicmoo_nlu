Remember that one artist from the 90's that was super popular?
You need to be more specific than that, who do you mean?
He was an attractive African American man. I'm trying to think of a song.
Was he older looking or young?
Older I think. Oh wait I think one song was called "Back At One."
I know who you're talking about! That's Brian Mcknight!
Yes I couldn't think of the name! Thank you.
I really loved his songs.
Yes he was quite talented. You don't hear much about him anymore.
I wonder why.
Probably because of newer artists. Maybe he doesn't want much of the spotlight anymore.
Yes you're probably right.
He kind of reminds me of a female singer I liked back then too. Her name was Brandy.
Didn't she have her own show also?
Yes she did!
I loved that song she did with Monica called "The Boy Is Mine."
Yes that was so popular when I was in middle school! My friends and I would sing it.
It cracked me up.
I miss that kind of music.
I know, it's rare these days.
