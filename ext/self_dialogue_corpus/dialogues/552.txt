Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I prefer more manly sports
Really?  How about I pretend I didn't hear that?
Haha!  Lighten up bro!
No, but what is more manly than football?
MMA
That's arguable.
True.  But you vs one other guy until one of you gives up or is knocked out is super manly.
I'll agree.
So you think I'm right?
Nah. I mean football has a group of guys plowing through each other to get a ball to the other end of the court by almost any means necessary.
Well when you spin it like that...
Nah, there is no "spin".
I think there is a spin, but you also have a point.
So football we can agree is more manly then?
Nah
I guess we'll have to disagree then
Indeed
