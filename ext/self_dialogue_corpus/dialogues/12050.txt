Who do you think would win, a young Rey or a young Leai?
Well, that is hard. Leai was strong but raised a princess.
And Rey was raised to be tuff.
True, but Leia always ended up on top, in everything she did.
I think she would be more mature, I mean come on she was a leader on Alderan before Luke even knew he was a jedi.
She is smarter, has wisdom.
But Rey has street smarts, living alone in the desert.
Scouring for food in old ruins and so on.
I think it may be a hard fight.
I think they would not fight, instead become a two woman team and defeat all the dark side.
