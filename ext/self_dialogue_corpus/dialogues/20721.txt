I have just seen the most romantic movie today!
I love romantic movies! What did you see?
I saw "Return to Me" starting Mini Driver and David Duchovny. It was so sweet.
What was the movie about?
Mini Driver plays a woman who has had a heart transplant and David Duchovny is her love interest.
That doesn't sound so unusual.
It isn't except Mini Drivers Character got her transplant from David Duchovny's deceased wife.
Wow that's a plot twist you don't see coming!
I loved all the characters in the movie but especially Carroll O'Connor who plays her dad. He reminds me of my dad.
Who else is in the movie?
James Belushi and Bonnie Hunt play the couple who are her best friends.
Ah, a cameo cast of actors! I love those!
You really should go see this and be sure to take some tissues because it may make you cry a little.
Yea, I do get involved with the plot of movies that way.
The whole cast of characters are so sweet that you would love to live near them in this neighborhood.
What is the setting of the movie?
The setting is the little Irish Italian restaurant owned by the father of Mini Driver's character.
Irish Italian?
Yes her father is Irish but her mother was Italian so that is the food they serve.
I love these kinds of sweet love stories. I will definatly go and see it. Thanks for the tip!
