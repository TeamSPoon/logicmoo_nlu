Did you like The Force Awakens?
I thought it was a litte boring.
Why do you say that?
Because there were new characters I suppose.
OK I get where you are coming from.
I just wanted the same characters from the first 6.
But even when they did the first 3 they were all new.
Yeah and it took forever to get attached to them.
Well Luke is grown up now.
I hate his self exile. Think its lazy writing.
