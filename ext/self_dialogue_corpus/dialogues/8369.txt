Who are some popular pop artists?
Right now? I don't keep up but someone like Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber.
I used to like Britney Spears. That's pop.
I enjoy older pop like 80's or 90's.
Did you like Prince?
Yes, he was one of my favorites. Such a shame.
I loved George Michael, shame about him also.
Yes, he was very handsome.
I think I need to google modern pop.
These millenials all sound they same.
