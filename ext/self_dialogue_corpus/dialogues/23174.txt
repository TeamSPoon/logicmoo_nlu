Did you watch Guardians of the Galaxy?
I did last night.
What did you think of it.
It was really good, i'd give it a 5/5 stars.
I thought the same when I first watch it.
Who was your favorite character?
Rocket Racoon.
He's a hilarious little guy isn't he?
Yeah I loved his personality and he has a sweet side.
I loved his sidekick Groot.
Groot is great too especially at the end when he's just a little plant dancing.
Yeah that was awesome.
Did you like the story?
I loved it, a bunch of misfits forming a team to take on the greatest threats of the universe.
Yeah it's appealing.
What's not to like.
Gamorra I believe her name was, was an interesting character.
How so?
Well she was kind of in this weird situation but chose to fight back instead of falling in line.
She's brave.
