Did you watch anything good lately?
I introduced my boyfriend to Star Wars over the weekend. He had never seen them before!
That's crazy! What did he think?
Well we just watched the first one, but he enjoyed it.
By the first one do you mean A New Hope?
Yes, we're watching the original three movies before we start on the prequels.
That's probably for the best.
How are you going to watch Rogue One and The Force Awakens with the others?
I guess we'll just watch those last and keep seeing them in the order they came out.
So in the version that you saw, who shot first in the cantina scene.
I don't remember which edition we watched but Han reacted.
Oh no, that's not right!
I had to explain my frustration about it.
Are you going to watch the Holiday Special?
I had not considered that!
You should, to really get the full experience.
It's so bad though.
I think it's charming in a way.
I guess it does have that Boba Fett cartoon.
And it has that great cooking show.
