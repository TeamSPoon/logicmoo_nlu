Yes,I just did.
What kind did you buy?
I bought the Hanes brand.
I use the fruit of a loom.
How do you like them?
I like the way they feel after a free washes.
Oh yeah, how about the color.does it go yellow?
No they stay white.
Nice, so do mine.
Does your neck line stretch out?
Yeah, it's a problem I have.
Mine to.
How long does it take for that to happen?
Maybe 15 washes.
That sounds about right.
Do you know of any other brand?
Not really? How about you?
