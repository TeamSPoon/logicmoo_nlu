Say, did you hear they are going to put out a new Shrek movie.
I did hear that.  Number five I think.
Gees.  I can't believe they've got four movies out of that series.
It's huge though.  Have you seen all the Shrek junk out there you can buy.
I know.  I got my niece a Shrek doll for Christmas.  I thought it would be out of date for her but no she loved it.
Knew all the charitures I bet.
Oh, yeah we even had to watch a couple of them later that day.  She has all the DVD's of course.
Your a good uncle.  Are you going to take her to the new Shrek?
You know I hear it's not even due out till 2019.  So who knows.
Wow, well I'm sure it will be worth waiting for.
