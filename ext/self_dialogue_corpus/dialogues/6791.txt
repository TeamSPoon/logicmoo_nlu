Are you excited for the new release of Thor: Ragnarok?
Nah.  I'm not really into those kinds of movies.
I hear it's really good.  I don't really like those movies either, but they are fun to watch in the summer.
I can agree with this.  I like super hero movies, just not Thor for some reason.
Yeah, I don't get the appeal of Chris Hemsworth.
I don't either, he's not even that good looking.
They should put Orlando Bloom in a super hero movie.
I can get behind that idea, he's gorgeous!
Yes!  I've loved him since Lord of the Rings.
He's so good looking in the Pirates movie series, too.
