What did you think about 'Doctor Strange?'
I was honestly surprised that the movie worked.
There definitely was a lot working against it.  The fact that it's so not grounded in realism, must have been a challenge to make.
What did you think of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance?
Well, I think he is great in every role he plays.  However, his accent was rather lacking.
You're right.  I guess you can't be good at everything.
Maybe it would have been better for him to keep his normal voice, since it's so great as is.
I think more than Cumberbatch, I really liked Tilda Swinton's performance as The Ancient One.
She was so great.  I love her range as an actress.
Yes, she is truly talented.  I just saw her in 'Okja.'
I did too.  She becomes a different person from role to role.
I would also give an honorable mention to Mads Mikkelson.
He really knows how to play an excellent villain.
He has a pattern of great villain roles.  From 'Casino Royale' to 'Hannibal.'
Though don't forget that he was the good guy in 'Rogue One,' just disguised as a villain.
I can't wait to see Doctor Strange in the new Avengers movies.
It will be an interesting dynamic to see Stephen Strange interact with the other Avengers.
Especially someone like Stark.
I can't wait to see that.  They are basically the same character.
They even both have cool facial hair.
