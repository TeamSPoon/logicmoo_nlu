I want to rent a movie tonight got any suggestions
What sort of movie are you in the mood for?
I am not sure i kinda want something not to heavy and to the point
Hmm any movies you do not want?
I do not want anything like the titanic or anything like that
Well true that movie is deep and heavy and pretty easy to bring you down.
Yeah i want something to just enjoy you know what i mean
Yeah i get what you mean
I do like some action movies
What sort of action
You know things with explosions and superheroes
Well their is plenty of those if that is what you wanted
Yeah i am sure about that i am just not sure what to pick or where to go to get them.
Well you can see if their is a redbox near you is the quickest way to rent an actual movie
What is a redbox
A redbox is a machine that lets you rent movies
I think i heard of that
it is easy to use and you can look at their selection and choose
That might work better if i can see my choices
Yeah just go to their site and put in the zipcode and it will tell you the nearest one.
