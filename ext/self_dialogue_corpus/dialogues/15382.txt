Hey! I like that song you are playing, who sings it?
Beyonce sings it.
Oh interesting usually I do not like Beyonce's music all that much.
Really? What type of music do you typically listen to?
I like to listen to country music mostly.
I like some country too!
You do? What artists do you like?
I like Luke Bryan, Faith Hill, and Tim McGraw.
I love Faith Hill too! She is amazing.
I saw her in concert and haven't stopped listening to her music since.
Wow that must have been a great concert!
Yea it was!
I love her old music such as her album Fireflies.
I agree. Her old music was amazing.
It is funny how we both enjoy artists so different from one another.
I know. Beyonce and Faith Hill sing completely different genres of music but I love them both!
Beyonce is much more pop/rhythym and blues music.
Sometimes people are just in the mood for different kinds of music.
Absolutely. When I am outside at a BBQ, I tend to listen to country.
Yeah and then when I am in a nightclub I like to listen to Beyonce.
