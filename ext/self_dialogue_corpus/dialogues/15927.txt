How was American Music Abroad?
It was great! Wait, how'd you know I was in that?
Your mom told me.
She's weird. Yeah, it was great.
Tell me about it!
It was a large band made up of high schoolers from PA, New Jersey, and Georgia, for some reason.
That seems odd.
We rehearsed at a university, then travelled Europe for three weeks.
Which countries did you go to?
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, and France.
How many concerts did you perform?
About ten. We stayed at each location for a few days, and played a concert at each.
What kind of music?
A mix, but mostly some patriotic American music, like Sousa.
What groups were there?
Umm, there was a concert band, where I played tuba. Also a Jazz band and a choir.
Was it a lot of fun? Did you make a ton of friends?
It was fun but no friends. I was there for the music and sight-seeing.
What was your favorite musical moment during the tour?
At the end of one concert, the entire audience applauded with the beat in unison for about five minutes. It was crazy!
