I just got the blu-ray dvd of the movie Avatar!
Oh, that's nice. I didn't really like that movie though.
What?! Are you crazy? Everyone loves that movie.
Just because a large amount of people love it means I have to love it too?
Well, no, I guess not. But how can you not like it?
It's boring, way too long, predictable, and what's more, the aliens are the silliest looking creatures I've ever seen.
What about the digital animation? Nothing like that was ever done before, it was positively groundbreaking.
Yes, I'll give you that, it was amazing, however one can't spend hours just looking at pretty virtual scenery.
Okay, why else don't you like the movie?
It's full of mistakes and plot holes that just ruin the whole thing. I mean glaring errors that can't be ignored.
I didn't catch any mistakes. Like what?
Well, for one thing, why were the scientists so furious when they discovered what Jake was doing with the video logs? How could they have not known what he was doing the whole time?
I see. And what else?
The message of the movie is too preachy for me, and a bit hypocritical as well.
Now I'm totally lost. What do you mean by that?
It's supposed to be a metaphor for how humans are destroying the earth, right?
Yes, I suppose so.
So then why do they spend the majority of the movie blowing up trees instead of promoting peace?
They didn't blow up the Home Tree!
Thank goodness..
