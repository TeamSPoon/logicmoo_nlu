Quick! Name your favorite modern rapper.
That is a tough one. I'd have to say Eminem.
Why is that?
He raps about stuff that is relevant and important.
Other rappers don't?
Some do, but most just rap about the same "gangsta" stuff over and over.
That is true.  Who else do you like, that raps about stuff like Eminem?
I really like Kendrick Lamar, and I loved Prodigy.
Sad news about Prodigy, he was great.
Yes, he will be missed.
