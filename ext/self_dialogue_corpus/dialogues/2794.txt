Do you think there are any teams that were as good as the Patriots are nowadays?
There were quite a few great teams in the past, but none of them has lasted as long as the Patriots' dynasty.
Did any teams come close?
The Steelers and the Cowboys probably came the closest.
What did they do? Did they win a lot of Super Bowls?
Back then it was a little harder to win it every year or every other year. The schedules were a little tougher and medical technology wasn't as good.
Then why do you say they were so good if they didn't win it every year?
Because they could have won it all every year without injuries and such. The Steelers won the Super Bowl 4 times within a 6 year period.
That's pretty good. How about the Cowboys?
The Cowboys were one of those teams that was good every year, year in and year out, for decades. In fact, I think two of the Steelers' victories came against the Cowboys.
Were there any other teams like that?
The Vikings were great every year, but they always lost when they made it to the Super Bowl. They won it one year, but lost all the rest.
Anyone else?
Sure. Green Bay was a solid dynasty rivaling the Patriots, but they were on the decline by the time the Super Bowl became a 'thing.'
Then why do you say they were great?
Well, before the Super Bowl there was the league championships, and Green Bay was always winning their league championship. It culminated with Green Bay winning the first two Super Bowls and then they went into decline.
Is that it? Were there any other great teams besides the Steelers, Cowboys, Viking, and Packers?
There were the Rams.
What did they do?
They were one of those 'almost' teams that constantly dominated their division, had a great defense, terrorized everyone, but always managed to lose in the playoffs. In fact, they never made it to the Super Bowl until XIV, when they lost to that great Steelers team.
