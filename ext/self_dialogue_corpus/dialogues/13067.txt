Were you disappointed that little Anakin Skywalker turned out to be Darth Vader?
Yes, because he started out as a cute kid with a happy personality.
His character was so fun and likable in Phantom Menace especially during and after the pod race!
I liked it when he was older in Attack of Clones and was romantically interested in Padme and she in him.
I know, right! You could totally see them getting together. Hayden Christensen is a very handsome young man.
What happened to him? Why did he go to the Dark Side?
I think it had something to do with his separation from his mother and the huge fear he had of losing Padme.
I think you're right. That fear in him, the kind that makes people do irrational things, turned him to the Dark Side.
I'm so glad George Lucas came out with prequel series otherwise we would have had no idea why Darth Vader said, "Luke, I am your father"!
Me too! The Star Wars series has been one of my favorites since they started back in the mid-1970s.
