So what is your all time favorite movie?
Gosh that's a really tough choice, there are so many good ones out there!
Mine is Gremlins, have you seen it?
Of course!  That's an old classic.
Yeah it's great.  It came out in 1984!
Oh wow.  And it had Phoebe Cates in it, didn't it?
Yep!  Her and Zach Galligan.
I loved the little creatures in that movie.
I know!  They were so cute.
It had amazing special effects for being made so long ago too.
Yeah it really did.  I thought it was truly unique for its time period.
It's funny and scary too, which is a neat combination.
Yeah, it's hard to come up with funny and scary.  Kinda like Beetlejuice.
Yeah, but it was much better than Beetlejuice.
Did you see any of the sequels?
Yeah, I didn't think they were as good as the original though.
No, but they were still good movies.
Yeah no doubt!  All the Gremlins movies have been great.
It'd be neat if they made another one wouldn't it!
Yeah, like a fortieth reunion Gremlins or something like that.  The timing would be right.
