What teams do you think could compete for an NFL title this season?
I don't know, but the AFC looks stronger to me, overall.
As strong as the Cowboys were last year, that seems harsh.
That's fair. And I can't rule out the Packers or Seahawks.
But you still prefer the AFC?
Yeah, you start with the Patriots, then have perennially competitive teams like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, and add in Oakland.
You really think Baltimore has a shot?
Sure, Flacco is still decent, and I never underestimate Ozzie Newsome.
Flacco needs weapons, and those wide receivers are pretty thin.
Right now, yeah, but a lot rests on how Breshad Perriman develops.
Is he even starting this year?
I think he's penciled into an outside spot, with Maclin in the slot.
How do they make up for losing Dennis Pitta, though?
Well, a lot of that will have to come from Maclin and Perriman.
I don't even know who their tight end is, now.
They have a few B-listers, Ben Watson and Maxx Williams, for example.
That's not a very inspiring list.
I'm hoping they'll take a look at Gary Barnidge.
Why didn't the Browns bring him back, anyway?
I assume they just want a roster full of young guys for the rebuild.
