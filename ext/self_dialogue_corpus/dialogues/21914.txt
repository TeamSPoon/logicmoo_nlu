Have you ever seen Zombielane?
Oh that was such a cute movie. Jesse Eisenberg is hilarious in his own dry way.
My kids love Ghostbusters so the part with Bill Murray freaked them out.
Oh that's so cute! Have you seen the rebooted Ghostbusters with the women?
I know it got panned but I loved it. I loved the idea of using women.
Right and every single one of them was hilarious, especially Leslie Jones.
It's so sad that she's so talented and all people can do is talk about her looks.
But she takes it in stride though. I love her personality.
Melissa McCarthy is very funny too. Every word that comes out of her mouth I'm just cracking up.
She had a small part in CIA with Kevin Hart and The Rock. She was still funny though.
Oh that whole movie was hilarious. I like anything with Kevin Hart in it.
Have you seen The Secret Life of Pets? He's doing the voice of the little white bunny.
And he's doing the voice of one of the little boys in Captain Underpants.
My kids can't wait to see that movie. We just barely got to see Lego Batman.
Oh I loved that one. I loved the Lego movie too, the first one.
That was super funny. And smart on Lego's part.
Right it was an excellent marketing strategy. I love animated films.
Have you seen the new Cars yet?
I'm not a big fan of the Cars series even though I love Pixar.
Oh Toy Story hands down is my favorite animated movie of all time.
