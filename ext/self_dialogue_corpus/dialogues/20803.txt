Have you ever seen any Japanese action films?
Yes, I saw Seven Samurai recently.
That is an excellent film. Who directed it?
It was directed by Akira Kurosawa.
Of course, he is legendary.
Yes he is, the film also included a lot of legendary Japanese actors.
Oh really, like who?
It stars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, among others.
Oh wow, those are legendary actors! I guess I never realized the film included so many legends of Japanese cinema.
Yeah, and the film always turns up on 'best films of all time' lists.
That's very interesting. Isn't it also one of Ebert's favorite films?
Yes, it is included in his list, 'Great Movies.'
That's not surprising. It had some of the greatest action sequences for its time period.
Absolutely, the scale was extraordinary.
It was also epic in terms of it's length.
That's true too. It's over three hours long!
Wow, I never realized it was THAT long.
That's because not a minute is wasted.
Yeah, the movie never drags on or has unnecessary scenes.
It is truly one of the best from the master Kurosawa.
