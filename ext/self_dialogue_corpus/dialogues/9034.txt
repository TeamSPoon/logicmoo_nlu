Who do you think was a better rock band, the Beatles or the Stones?
Hmmm, well i prefer the Beatles but they were a bit more poppy. If you're talking straight up rock, maybe the Stones
Yeah, i see what you mean. I like the Beatles better too overall.
Who are some of your other favorite rockers?
David Bowie would definitely be at the top of my list
Yeah, Totally. He was a legend.
Yeah, speaking of legends, i'd have to say Neil Young falls into that category.
For sure! How about Bob Dylan, he was folksy but can also rock out
Yeah, definitely legend material
Right on.
