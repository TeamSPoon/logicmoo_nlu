Have you seen the 1st Pirates of the Caribean movie?
Yes I have, i love Johnny Depp in it.
I know, he is so cute, especially when he swings on things.
I liked when he was fencing with Will Turner.
Me too, what was his real name?
Orlando Bloom.  He played a good pirate.
Yes and he's cute too, especially when he was running in the cage ball.
I liked when he was 1st seen by Elizabeth as a boy.
Yes and when he was fighting with Jack Sparrow on the rafters.
But Jack Sparrow was cute when he said, "Savvy".
