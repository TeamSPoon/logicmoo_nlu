What team do you see winning the NFC North division?
I'm going with Green Bay.
Hard to bet against Aaron Rodgers.
Exactly. When in doubt, take the best Quarterback.
Green Bay has shown some cracks in the armor, though.
Agreed, but I'm not convinced that either Detroit or Minnesota quite have what it takes.
You didn't mention the Bears.
For a reason! They're probably going to struggle.
Yeah, probably another tough year for Chicago.
I do think the Vikings have a chance to be special.
Their defense has the potential to be great.
I love their defense. A lot of solid playmakers.
But the question is whether they can figure it out offensively.
Which translates to the Quarterback position.
Yep. Is Teddy Bridgewater healthy?
Bridgewater's out for all of 2017. And he's a free agent.
Sad. He was a promising young quarterback, but that injury was terrible.
Yeah, it's another NFL injury story.
Without stability at the QB position, I think I agree that Green Bay is winning the NFC North.
In the end, always bet on the Quarterback.
