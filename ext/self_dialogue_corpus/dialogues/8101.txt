I have been listening to the top 40 playlist on Spotify; it's great!
Really? What are some of your favorite songs on it?
I am loving that song Despascito with Justin Beiber!
Me too.  It is so catchy.
I also really like that song I'm the One.
Same! I could listen to it on repeat all day.
I don't usually like DJ Kahled but I do think that song is so catchy.
It is definitely a major key.
Haha! I saw Chance the Rapper do some of it live.
That must have been awesome.
