Over the weekend I binge watched all of the Indiana Jones movies.
I love those movies. Did you know they're making another one?
Really? When?
It's due to come out in 2019.
I don't think I can wait that long. Do you know of any other movies that are like Indiana Jones?
You would probably like the Tomb Raider movies. They star Angelina Jolie.
I saw those a long time ago.
There's also Romancing the Stone and it's sequel The Jewel of the Nile.
Who stars in those?
Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito.
If Danny Devito is in it, it must have some humor.
It does. There's also the Crocodile Dundee trilogy that stars Paul Hogan.
I've never heard of him.
Those are the only movies I know of with him.
Someone else I know recommended a movie called sahara.
That was a good movie. Not exactly the same genre, but it is adventurous.
I still can't believe Harrison Ford is doing another Indiana Jones movie. I mean, he's getting up there in age.
I know.He;s currently 74 years old.
He must have a lot of energy to make another one of those.
He sure must.
