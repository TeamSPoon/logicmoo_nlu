The SEC baseball tournament is the weekend after next
Yeah, I think Florida will probably win it all
I know they're favored but they always seem to choke in these tournaments
What about Kentucky?
They're traditionally terrible but their hitting is amazing this season
I know, they're the only SEC team that has never been to Omaha
Wow, I didn't know that
After Vanderbilt's recent rise they've become the undisputed cellar-dweller of the SEC
I was listening to Head-to-head the other day and they predicted they would host a regional
I don't doubt that a bit. Their home stadium has those short alleys in right.
I know, they hit a lot of homeruns in that stadium
What about Ole Miss?
They have solid pitching but their bats sometimes don't show up.
True, but they've played better at the end of the season. Bortles is hitting well
I could see them making a run in the tournament
They did last year before their regional collapse
Yeah, that game against Texas A&M was exciting, very back and forth
I missed it but I was not surprised that Florida won the next day
What do you think of Auburn?
They seemed to be cruising to an easy conference title but have collapsed the last few weeks
