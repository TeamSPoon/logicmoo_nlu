Mikey, how long has it been since you listened to a flawless album?
Good question, I'd say years in the least.
I've been thinking how rare it is to listen to an album all the way through with only pure enjoyment.
You are very right, and it is sad.
I think the last flawless album I listened to was FutureSex/LoveSounds.
A Justin Timberlake album, seriously?
That album is incredibly under rated, it ushered in a new era of pop and hip hop music.
You may be kind of right, but not every song on that album was great.
I'd say SexyBack was the weakest song musically, but every other song was literally amazing.
Didn't Timbaland produce Justin's works at that time?
For years they worked together, the true dynamic duo.
I'd say that goes to Eminem and Dr. Dre.
I can't argue with that, I was just in a pop music mood today.
I can definitely appreciate Justin's voice and Timbo's beat making ability.
Summer Love, My Love, What Goes Around..., all so different and astounding for the time.
I remember we were in Spain when that album came out right?
Yeah man, it just shows I haven't listened to a flawless album in over a decade.
I think you're just stuck on the past.
I am stuck on the past because the past was better.
I actually get what you mean.
