What NFL team will have the best regular season record this year?
Hard not to go with the Patriots, right?
I'm not so sure, this year.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I think the Dolphins might be a good team this year.
If their division gets more challenging, that will make it tougher for them to roll through the regular season, true.
Also, at SOME point Tom Brady's age will catch up to him.
Hasn't happened yet! The dude just won the Super Bowl.
But eventually, it will happen. Maybe through injuries.
Eventually, you'll be right about Brady, but I wouldn't bet on it this year.
I think the Seahawks have a really good chance to have the best record.
Hmm, I think they'll be good, but why do you say best record?
First of all, they have the best home field advantage in the league.
Yep, no better home field advantage.
Second, I think their division is soft.
You're not a believer in the Cardinals?
I'm not sold on their QB situation, and I think both the Rams and the 49ers will be bad.
If all three teams are mediocre to bad, then Seattle should have a great record.
Yeah, that's just how I see it falling out this year.
I hope it's not another Seattle/New England Super Bowl. I want some new talent!
