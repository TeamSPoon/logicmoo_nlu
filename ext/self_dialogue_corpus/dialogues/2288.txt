Do you know much about the NFL?
A little, why?
I've never been much of a fan, but you seem like the type. What are some interesting facts about them?
Did you know that it is virtually impossible to get season tickets for the Green Bay Packers?
No, I didn't.
In fact, you would have to be on the waiting list for almost 1000 years to get your tickets.
That's carzy. Hit me with another one.
Okay, how many footballs do you think Wilson, the sporting goods company, makes per day?
I don't know, I would guess about 50 thousand.
Well, the answer is four thousand. A single cow yields only 10 balls.
That's fascinating.
Do you know that no football team has ever won the Superbowl three years in a row?
I believe that.
However, the Packers won three championships before the Superbowl era.
That's ironic for them.
Yes, it is.
How much is the NFL trophy worth?
The dollar value of the trophy is about 25 thousand.
That's all? What else can you tell me?
Carl Weathers, known as Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies, was an NFL player. He played for the Oakland Raiders.
