I heard there is a live-action remake on cards of 101 Dalmatians.
I absolutely loved the movie and the dogs were a delight to watch.
Well, brace yourself, as the story focuses on Cruella.
Well, I'm not much interested in that villainous character.
Then another piece of news for you, Emma Stone plays Cruella.
What kind of story will the movie have then?
I guess it will focus on the back story of Curella and how she became what she is now.
Do you really think people want to know that?
I guess not. I would love more of those Dalmatians on my screen.
I wouldn't even mind any other breed of dogs or puppies.
