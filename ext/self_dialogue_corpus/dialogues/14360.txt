Can you believe the fans booed KD?
Well, they figure he left them out of greed, when really he went for opportunity over at Golden State.
How great is the OKC Thunder?
They could do better, but the season is young.
Did you see that half-court shot?
Yes! But what about the foul by Bird?
You think John's gonna make the free throws?
I don't know, he flubbed that lay up.
Did you see the Bulls play last night?
No, man, I was watching the Knicks.
The Laker game was super great.
Right? Did you see that three point shot?
KD looked tired last night, but still scored the most points.
Golden State is lucky to have him.
You think our team will make the playoffs?
No, but the Thunder will.
Man, I can't believe all the travelling violations last night.
For sure, it's like they forgot how to dribble.
The Mavericks looked good last week.
Yeah, but the Jazz looked even better.
