Do you think Dak Prescott can get Dallas to a championship this year?
I hope so. It has been a long time since we have been there.
He looked really good last year.
True. I think he was just too inexperienced to get as far as we wanted him too.
I think so too, and the fans leaned too hard into wanting Romo back.
I don't think Romo is as good of a quarterback as Prescott is.
He was when he was younger, but he gets injured too frequently now.
He really has had some serious injuries. He probably should have stopped playing a few years ago.
If their defense can do better this year I think they have a real shot with Prescott in as lead now.
Yeah the defense has been pretty bad the last few years.
They also need some more action from their receivers. I think Beasley should get more play time.
They don't use him much because he isn't a big guy.
He does really well when he is in though.
Except for the fact that he tends to turn over the ball during key moments.
That hasn't happened often though and he has definitely scored more points than he has lost.
He is an important part of the team. I don't think the give him the credit he deserves a lot of the time.
He has had some key plays that have won games but they always focus on the star wide receivers.
They definitely can't afford to lose him.
That's true and they might want to give him a better contract so they don't lose him to another team.
It would be a shame if they lost him to another team because they don't appreciate his talent.
