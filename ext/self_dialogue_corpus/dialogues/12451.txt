Did you see the Phantom Menace?
I loved that movie, I thought it was pretty good.
What did you like the most about it?
I liked the Villain, I thought he was so cool.
I thought he was really cool as well but liked Liam Neeson the most.
He was also cool, I like the jedi action that the movi had.
Yeah, that was pretty cool as well although it had a sad endind.
How come, I remember it was sad but I watch it a long time ago.
Well I remembered that the character Liam Neeson interpreted died.
Oh yeah I remember, it was a sad scene.
