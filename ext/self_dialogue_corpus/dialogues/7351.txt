I kind of wish they would remake Mulan with real people like they did for Beauty and the Beast.
That would be such a great remake!
I agree!  There are some great actors and actresses they could choose from.
And think about the set if they were able to actually shoot in China!
The family's home and the Emperor's castle would look so cool.
It definitely would.  Can you imagine what casting would be like though?
I'd love to see who they would cast as Chien-Po, Mulan's grandma, and her mom.
How about Li Shang?  And Mulan herself?
Honestly, they could probably cast Lea Salonga as Mulan and she'd still be just as great as she was when she was the voice for the original.
Agreed!
