I could go for a good spaghetti western right about now.
A what?
A spaghetti western! You know...
I have no idea what spaghetti has to do with westerns.
Well, let me enlighten you!
Please do.
The term "spaghetti westerns" refers to a genre of movies made about the old west. They were created starting in the 1960s.
You are kidding!
No, really! One of the most famous stars appearing in these movies was Clint Easwood!
I don't get it.  What do they have to do with spaghetti?
These movies were mostly directed by italians. Sergio Leone was one of the directors that was made famous through these movies and his suspenseful dramatic style.!
That makes more sense than what I was thinking!
What were you thinking?
When you said "spaghetti westen" I had some strange ideas about what you meant.
Like what?
Cowboys dressed up like Super Mario Brothers...
No way!
Yes. Wearing chaps and riding Yoshi around the dusty, sun-filled badlands.
That's hilarious!
I just could figure out how they rounded up the veal parmigiana!
