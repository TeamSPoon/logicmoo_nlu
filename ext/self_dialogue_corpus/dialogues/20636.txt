Have you noticed how movies go in groups as to what is popular at the moment?
You mean like vampire movies and zombie movies?
Yes that is exactly what I am talking about.
Yeah i have noticed. Why?
Did you ever wonder how that happens? Does someone in the industry that isn't a producer make a suggestion?
Or maybe it's someone who hits on a subject that resonates with the public,does well and then here come the copy cats.
Hoping to capitalize on others success..  good point
Some get lucky and can ride the wave until it poops out.
But you know that's were some of the "bad movies with the cheesy acting" become cult classics for some.
Like Rocky Horror Picture Show!
Now that's one that was weird as it gets especially if you get to go to a viewing in a theater where people dress the parts and then throw toast in the movie theater.
Holy cow yes and the reciting of certain lines from the movie verbatim.
What other movies can you think of that are like  that?
I am trying but I can't come up with one just this moment. can you?
My oddity and obscura fuse just blew after that one. I can't come up with one at all.
Oh wait. How about Dazed and Confused?
Yeah good call! My husband remembers all the lines that are the cheesiest!
How funny!
yes he has a very juvenile sense of humor
You are so lucky!
