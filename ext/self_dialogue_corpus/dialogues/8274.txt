There's been so much great music lately. What's your favorite summer hit?
I'm really into Liam Payne's Strip That Down.
Didn't he used to be in One Direction?
Yeah, he was! He's taking time to expand his solo career.
That's great, I'll have to give that a listen. Have you listened to any of Harry Style's new album?
I have. I've been listening to it on repeat for weeks!
Same, what's your favorite song?
Probably Two Ghosts, it's so emotionally charged and lyrically beautiful.
I love that one too. Sign of the Times is my favorite.
I love that one too! The members of One Direction are all releasing some great solo music!
