Have you ever listened to Kacey Musgraves?
I don't think so. What does she sing?
Her biggest songs are probably Merry-Go-Round and Follow Your Arrow. Have you heard them?
Oh, I think I have heard Merry-Go-Round. Did it come out awhile ago?
Yeah definitely a few years ago, on her first album.
Does she sing Dime Store Cowgirl?
Yeah! That was on her most recent album.
What was her most recent album?
It was called Pageant Material.
I've heard of that. When did it come out?
It came out in the summer of 2015.
Oh, that has been awhile. Is she planning any new music?
I'm not sure, I hope so though!
Me too. Do you listen to Miranda Lambert?
A little bit, yeah. I was sad about her and Blake Shelton.
Me too. Her album, Platinum, is so good though.
What is your favorite album on Platinum?
Probably Little Red Wagon, there are lots of good ones though.
Oh I like Little Red Wagon too. Priscilla is really good too.
I haven't heard Priscilla; I'll have to give it a listen.
