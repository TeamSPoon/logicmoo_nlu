I know it sounds silly, but my favorite comedy is Wayne's World.
Are you kidding? Wayne's World is awesome!
I'm glad you agree with me. What's your favorite part?
"Turn it off, man! Turn it off!"
Oh yeah, the scene where that guy is trying to use that awful haircutting machine on Garth. That was hilarious!
What's your favorite scene?
I think my favorite is when they're singing "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the car.
Oh yeah, that was great! So funny.
I also like the "We're not worthy" scene with Alice Cooper.
Me too!
