What do you think of disney princesses?
I love  them all, why?
Well there seems to be a lot of talk on their image on young girls.
Oh like the barbie thing?
Yes, Somewhat are they giving young girls unrealistic idols?
They are cartoons, they are not real to begin with.
Well they are animated people and represent an a image to them.
True , I don't think there is anythign so wrong with their image though.
Well you see disney has kind of changed the mold. Look at moana for example.
Yes she is quite different in terms of body. Is she a princess?I have not seen that one yet.
