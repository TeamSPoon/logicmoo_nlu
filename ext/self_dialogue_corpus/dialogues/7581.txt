Harry Potter is one of those movie series you can just watch over and over again.
I have seen them, in whole, at least ten times over.
I am on my fourth re-watch.
What is your favorite scene in the franchise?
I like the bigger scenes, but there are a few subtle ones I think pay a fair homage to the films.
Then a subtle one, what is the most fitting subtle scene.
When Harry admits to Sirius his concerns about maybe being a part of Voldemort. There's a line where he says "I'm just so angry, all the time" .
I think it was very fitting to his personal experience, as well as being a teenager in general.
And Siruis is really shown as the family role Harry needed. Supportive and rewarding.
Yes, he comforts him after. Like a father, of an uncle should.
