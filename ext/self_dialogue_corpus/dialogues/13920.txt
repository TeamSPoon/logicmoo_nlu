How great was Lady Gaga's album, 'The Fame?'
That was her debut album, right?
That's correct.  The one featured "Just Dance" and "Poker Face."
Those were so great.  The album also featured "Paparazzi."
I remember her winning a bunch of awards for that album.
You're right about that.  She was nominated for multiple Grammys.
Did she win any of the Grammys that year?
She won the Grammy for Best Electronic Album and the Best Dance Recording.
For which song?
"Poker Face" of course!
