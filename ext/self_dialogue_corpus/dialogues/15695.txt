Do you think it's possible to define indie rock?
Yeah. Bands that are signed to independent labels that play rock music.
Okay, I see that definition, but what do you do with bands that are "indie" but signed to majors?
Who are you thinking of here?
Modest Mouse, The Killers, The Strokes, I could go on and on.
I guess you make a good point, a lot of what we are referring to isn't actually too closely related to whether or not the label is an indie.
Yeah, I think it refers to an aesthetic, but I'm not even sure if there is anything that unites the disparate acts that play indie rock.
So what are you suggesting then?
I'm not sure what I'm suggesting, but how are Sufjan Stevens, Vampire Weekend, TV on the Radio, Joanna Newsom, Tokyo Police Club, and Animal Collective all indie rock?
They probably all share some aesthetic influences, but I see what you're suggesting. They don't actually sound much alike.
So what is the purpose of this term indie rock then?
I'm not sure. It's definitely not a super coherent term or concept sound wise.
Yeah, I'm starting to think it's a convenient marketing term. A way to sell a lifestyle to hipsters.
Well, I think it *was* that, for sure, at one point. The hipster is a dying phenomenon and being a hipster doesn't seem super tied to indie rock anymore.
You're right, but do you see what I'm saying. All of these bands might share some influences and have a spirit of independence from overt commercialism, but that they all got lumped in as indie rock suggests something else is at play here.
Yeah, something is for sure at play. Maybe it's just a catch-all term to compare to the overproduced, formulaic sounds of the mainstream?
What do you mean?
I mean like in the nineties and aughts the post-grunge and nu metal stuff. Like Slipknot, Nickelback, Limp Bizkit, Korn.
Right, but I think there are a ton of bands that aren't post-grunge or nu metal that wouldn't get classified as indie.
I guess you're right.
