I'm so thrilled that the Wonder Woman movie is doing so well at the box office. Have you seen it?
No, but I want to. I love action movies and super hero flicks.
I'm a big action movie fan, too.
I want to see The Mummy, too.
I can't believe Tom Cruise is still bankable as an action hero at his age.
Well, age is just a number. He keeps himself in ridiculous shape.
Plus, action movies are mostly CGI now.
I guess. I wish they'd revive the Die Hard series.
That would be amazing. I love Die Hard.
I just watched the first Die Hard movie recently. It never gets old.
