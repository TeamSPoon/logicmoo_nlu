Did you see that 18 inning game last night?
Yeah, 48 Strikeouts. That was nuts.
Looks like the Giants lost again.
Its been a rough start to the season.
Kershaw is definitely the best pitcher in the game.
No doubt about it, he just needs to perform in the postseason.
That Stanton is a beast. Two HR's the other day?
He sure is. He hits the ball harder than anyone in the league.
I Can't believe the Mets let Thor get hurt. What were they thinking?!
Their management is terrible and has a history of this sort of thing.
You think the Rockies can keep it up all year?
They are off to a hot start, that's for sure, but i think they will come back to earth soon enough.
Who do you like this year to go to the World series?
Tough call. The Cubs still have a heck of a team.
You think the Yankees will stay hot all year and recapture some of that magic?
They just might. They have some good new talent.
Did you see the Red Sox throw at Machados head the other day?
Yeah, that was bush league. You don't ever throw at a players head.
Sale struck out another 10 hitters last night.
He sure is something. Leads the league in strikeouts.
