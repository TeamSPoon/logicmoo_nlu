Hey what do you think of Carson Wentz?
The Eagles new Player??
Yea.
He had a good rookie season in 2016.
Yea but he is a great quarterback.
He was the second choice pick in the draft this year.
Yea and he makes 450000 a year!
That is almost a half million dollars for playing a game!
Sure, and he is only 24 years old.
You have to be a good player to do that.
I can't wait to see how he does this year.
I hope he helps the Eagles along.
What does he do during his off season.
He is a hunter.
Relly, well I guess they do a lot of that in North Dakota.
Is that where he is from?
Yes.
He is a good player.
I hope he has a great season.
Me too, that would be an experience.
