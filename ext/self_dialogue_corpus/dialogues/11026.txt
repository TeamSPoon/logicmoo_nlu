Are you disappointed that the Lightning missed the playoffs?
Of course!  What kills me is that they only missed by a few lousy points.
Do you thing not having Bishop on the net made a difference?
It made a huge difference.  It also didn't help that Stamkos was injured for so long.
RIght.  He was out for a while at the end of regular season, but wasn't the only one injured.
Yeah, there were others.  If our lineup was healthy we would have made the playoffs guaranteed.
We also have a few younger players that could develop into a good core.
They could if players like Kucherov, Hedman, and Johnson take on strong mentor roles for the team.
What do you think is the team's biggest weakness?
They don't attack the zone hard enough and not enough speed to the zone.
I think they don't shoot enough on the power play.
You're right they seem to make one pass to many looking for the perfect shot.
If you pepper the net, eventually something will get through.
Do you think Jon Cooper can lead us to a Stanley Cup...ever?
I think so.  He's a good coach and the players respond well to him.  It might take another season or two.
What do you think of the overtime rules since the change?
I think this is the best rule change since removal of the 2 line pass rule.
Yeah, it really speeds up the game and makes overtime more exciting.
But there's nothing like a good shootout.
Nothing except a good shootout that your team wins.
