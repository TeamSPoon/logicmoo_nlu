You know... there's days I completely forget Disney owns Star Wars and Marvel.
I know what you mean. I never imagined either being anything more than their own company.
It was quite ingenious though. They make an incredible team.
Yeah, with Disney's financial and creative resources they're really killing it with all the new films.
Not just that but have you heard about the theme parks?
No, what?
Both Star Wars and Marvel are getting their own lands now. They might even be opened already or opening soon.
No way! That's like a nerd's dream come true!
So in the real world we get truly the most magical place and in the cinematic universe we have Episode VIII, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel to look forward to also.
Don't forget some really great sequels: Thor Ragnarok and Ant Man and the Wasp. Which other than Infinity War is one I'm looking forward to most.
