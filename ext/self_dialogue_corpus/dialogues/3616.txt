I saw the most awesome horror movie the other day.
Really, what was it called?
It's Get Out, I think you've heard about it.
Yeah, I heard it was good! You liked it?
I loved it! It was a different type of horror movie than I've seen recently.
I've been looking for a new type of horror movie. It seems like every horror movie is the same stuff.
No, it was different. Totally unexpected. Not that it was super scary but there was so much suspense.
What was your favorite part?
When you see it, pay attention to the part about the grandparents. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.
Awesome, thank you!! I'm definitely going to watch it soon.
