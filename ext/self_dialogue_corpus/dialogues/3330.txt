What's the latest horror movie you've seen?
Prevenge
Prevenge? What's that about?
Instructed by her unborn child, a pregnant woman goes on a killing rampage. She's trying to avenge the wrongful death of her baby's father.
Wow, that sounds different. Was it good?
It was, actually! It's a British movie with an element of comedy/satire.
Who's the director?
I don't remember her name, but she wrote and starred in the movie as well. It's great to see more women getting involved in the horror genre.
I agree! Diverse perspectives are always good.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to checking out any other movies she might do.
