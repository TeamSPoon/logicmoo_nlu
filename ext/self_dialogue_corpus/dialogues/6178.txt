What did you think about the movie Tangled?
I loved it, it was so cute!
Me too, I thought it was an interesting remake of Rapunzel.
It did a good job of breathing new life into old stories, especially with the addition of certain new characters.
Like Maximus and Pascal?
Yes! Oh my goodness, I loved Pascal!
Even though he was just a chameleon, he seemed like such an important character in the story!
He was so funny, such a good sidekick!
What about Maximus? Watching his grudge with Flynn was hilarious!
That, and the fact that he can be bribed with apples.
