It's only two months away from the start of the season. I can't wait.
Neither can I. The season always comes up so quick.
Which rookies are you looking forward to seeing?
I'm excited to see the new batch of tuning backs most of al.
Yeah I can't wait to see how Fornette and McCaffery do.
Don't forget about Dixon, he should get a lot of playing time too.
Yeah he fell into a good spot with the Bengals. They should be better this year.
There's a lot of teams that could be a lot better. The Raiders are looking like an up and coming team.
Yeah I agreee, if Carr stays healthy they should be a Super Bowl threat.
It would be nice seeing someone other than the Patriots there.
Yeah it seems like they are good every year, but Brady can't be this good forever.
He's probably got a year or two before he starts declining.
When was the last time they didn't win their division?
I can't remember it's been so long. The Jets and Bills are a long ways away but the Dolphins are getting better.
Yeah the Jets are looking like they could be the worst team in the league.
I'd be surprised if they won four games.
They need a QB, they had a long stretch without one.
And they lost their best two receivers!
I can't believe they let Eric Decker go.
Well at least he should have someone better throwing to him now.
