"Guardians of the Galaxy" is my happy movie.
Your happy movie? What do you mean?
Whenever I don't feel great, for whatever reason, it never fails to cheer me up.
Why do you think that is?
It's just a naturally uplifting movie. It never takes itself seriously and there are so many funny parts.
That's true, though it has a couple of sad ones.
It does, but they just add to the movie. The rest of it just puts a smile on my face.
Is it the humor?
Mostly, but there's something else about it, too. I think it's the camaraderie or how they never give up.
Are you sure it's not Chris Pratt?
Well, there's that, too. I admit, I love watching him. He's great-looking and so hilarious.
There's more to the film than that, though, isn't there?
Of course there is. The cast has awesome chemistry together.
They really do. Everyone seems to fit.
Plus, it's just such a unique film. It doesn't follow a model the way most superhero movies do.
So you like the misfit factor?
Yeah, I think I do. It makes the characters relatable.
I can see that. They're kind of like us.
Exactly. They may be aliens (except for Peter Quill) but they're funny and flawed. It's easy to understand them.
I agree. I bet that's what makes it such a successful movie.
