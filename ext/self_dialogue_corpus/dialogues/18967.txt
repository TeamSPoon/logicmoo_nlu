How do you feel about Blink 182?
I loved them they got me into the music I listen to now
When did you start listening to them?
Around the time Enema of the State came out
They are from California
As if I couldnt tell
I like the new singer Matt.
He offers the same sort of pitch and range that Mark does though
I agree Tom was a huge part of the band
He wanted to change their sound
Yeah Neighborhoods sounded so different.
I love California, I think its a return to their roots.
Its definitely a change of pace from what they have been doing.
What was your favorite song on the album?
I loved Los Angeles.
OK that sounded like a rock anthem
Yeah it was definitely the best on the album
I loved California for starters.
They had an entire album of songs they didnt release
Yeah I could tell why they didnt make it to the finished product
