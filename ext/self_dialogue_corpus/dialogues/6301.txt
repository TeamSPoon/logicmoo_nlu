Do you musical movies?
Not really, however Disney movies are an exception.
Oh, is that so ? Which song is your favorite ?
It's actually a tie between two songs from the same movie.
Which movie and what songs?
The movie is "The Lion King". And the songs are "Hakuna Matata" & "I can't wait to be the king"
What is so good about them?
" Hakuna Matata" means no worry in Swahili , It is almost my motto , I don't worry about things  and have a chill atitude.
what about the other one?
The beat and lyrics of " I can't wait to be the king" are really upbeat and the childhood imagination is really great about it .
