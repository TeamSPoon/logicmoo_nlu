Wowie. What happened to you?
It's been a rough week, I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay, that's fine by me. Anyways, we were just talking about the football players of old, what say you?
I overheard that Richard Seymour's back in poker recently.
Really? How'd you find out?
The latest and last tournament of the WSOP season, the WSOP Main Event, it's going on right now throughout this week.
Okay....... since when did you hear about Richard Seymour playing poker?
Dude, he's been playing for a while now. But he's not a pro at it.
Oh, yeah. I did remember him retiring long ago. But I didn't think he'd play poker.
He won a couple of tournaments here and there. Small ones.
Oh, okay. Anybody else that's not playing football after they're retired?
Not really. It's because they showed Seymour playing in the WSOP tournament.
Oh, okay. Now that makes sense.
Yup. What else are you talking about?
Not much. Hey, what about Joe Namath? What does he do now?
Not sure. He's old as heck, though.
When I meant football players of old, I meant football players of old.
You didn't imply of the recently retired ones?
Not really. Speaking of Joe Namath, what do you think of his daughter, Jessica?
I think she looks pretty hot in that fox fur jacket.
