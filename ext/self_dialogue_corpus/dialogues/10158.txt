Hey, have you ever seen Never Back Down?
Yea, I thought it was really good!
Really? I thought it was kind of cheesy.
Well, yea, but movies like that are supposed to be.
That's true, like how this football player who's never had a fight in his life is suddenly going up against top fighters.
Yea, that was pretty stupid.
Or how about how that guy's girlfriend just dumps him and gets with the new guy so fast?
Yea, the script wasn't well thought out.
The fight scenes were great though.
Oh yea, the fight scenes were fantastic.
