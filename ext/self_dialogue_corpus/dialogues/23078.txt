Do you like the movie Mad Max?
No I was not a fan.
I did not care for it either.
I was quite let down, I was really looking forward to it before it came out.
I was also let down.
I think I was so excited because I like Tom Hardy.
I do too, I am a huge fan.
What is your favorite Hardy movie?
I really like Lawless.
Is that the one where they own a bar.
Yes it is.
I am a fan of that one as well.
Is it your favorite?
No, I think my favorite would be Warrior.
Is Warrior the boxing movie.
Yes, with his brother.
That is a great one.
I think the acting is great in Warrior.
It sure is.  What is his character name in that movie again?
Tommy.
