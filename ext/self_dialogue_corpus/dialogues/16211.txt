I love early 90s techno music.
Me too. What were the best albums?
The XL Recordings compilations discs.
Yes! Were the Chemical Brothers on those?
Sure. Lots of bands were.
Prodigy too.
Yes--didn't someone from that band just die?
No, that was a rapper.
I think I've been confused by that a few times.
Me too. I've searched for Out of Space and gotten rap before.
Totally.
Too bad about that Prodigy guy who did die, though.
Yeah that's sad.
He wasn't very old.
42 I think.
What did he die of?
Sickle cell disease is what I saw.
Wow. That's sad.
A lot of people were upset about it.
I'm sure.
