Hey, how ya doing?
Great, just hanging out how about you?
Not too bad I'm thinking of either going to an outdoor concert or going to the movies this weekend.
Oh cool me too. When the weather gets really hot, I'd rather be in the movies though.
Yeah you're right all the cool movies should come out this summer.
I usually hang out with a bunch of friends at the Hillsboro Park. Sometimes they have free concerts along with the farmers market there. Usually Starts in late April til around early August.
Yeah, I have the same thing too in my neck of the woods out in Marylhurst Park. It's also by the lake, so it's really nice.
but this weekend I'm thinking of going to the movies though.
Oh yeah? What kind?
I've watched Pirates of the Caribean yesterday. Will watch Wonder Woman for sure.
Oh yeah hard to keep up with all the sequels. How was it?
Pretty cool actually although it gets a bit boring towards the end of the movie.
Yeah I figured maybe after what, six or seven installments they might be running out of ideas.
True, a trilogy is pretty much the maximum in my opinion.
Unless it's Star Wars....then it's a trilogy of trilogy hahaha.
Haha yeah, not including Rogue One. That's ten movies!
Yeah I can't wait for the final one this December.
Me too!
Oh well, it'll be a fun summer hopefully with all the movies and fun outdoor music concerts.
Yeah it will be, talk to you later!
