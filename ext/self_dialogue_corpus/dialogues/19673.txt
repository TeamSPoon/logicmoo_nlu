What do you think the music of the future is?
Oh electronic for sure!
And why do you say that?
Well, think about recent music. Have there been really new melodies?
I think so. I hear new sounds everyday.
Well that's my point! The melodies are the same. I mean, how do you really make a new melody when there are so many notes. It's just a new sound everytime.
Yeah I get that. That makes sense.
Yeah think about all of the genres of the past 100 years. what comes to mind?
Classic, then rock, then disco, then hip hop.
And those are just different ways to explore sounds. So I think the future will be just trying to mix sounds even more creatively, on a computer.
Right. So electronic, dubstep, house music. You think that's the future?
Baby steps toward the future. Who knows what else could happen.
Huh. That's hard to imagine. I hope we won't run out of ideas.
I think humans like music so much, music will never die no matter what.
It's weird to think about that. Why do humans like music so much?
I guess we've been singing for millienia.
Is it a social construct?
Hard to say. Can't imagine we genetically like music.
Well, anyway, let's put on some tunes.
Sure.
