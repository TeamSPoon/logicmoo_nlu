Did you enjoy The Little Mermaid?
Of course. It was spectacular.
When did it come out?
That came out in the late 80's. 1989.
I remember seeing it as a kid.
There is nothing like it. The love story is so sweet.
I like the part when Ariel loses her voice and is just do happy to be with her loved one.
Yes and then they go on that date.
What is that song that plays on the date scene?
I think it is called "Kiss the Girl."
