Do you remember the Scream movies?
I think so. They're from the 90s, right?
Yes, they were so popular back then.
I want to watch them again just to see the 1990s fashion.
I'm always impressed that Kevin Williamson wrote it.
He's most famous for Dawson's Creek, right?
Yes. I guess they deal with a similar target audience though.
He definitely knows how to write for a teenage audience.
I like how Scream is funny, too.
Exactly. It's a fun horror movie.
