Did you see Edge of Tomorrow?
What is that?
It's Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt dying every day to learn how to defeat aliens who can reset time.
That's what it's called?
Yeah.
I saw it but not that name.
What was it?
Live. Die. Repeat.
Oooh, they renamed it because the studio thought we couldn't handle the title.
Seriously? It's not that hard to figure out.
