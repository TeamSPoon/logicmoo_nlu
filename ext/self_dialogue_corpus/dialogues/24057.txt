What's your favorite absolutely terrible movie?
Have you seen 'The Room'?
Uh no, I don't think so.
That's probably my favorite awful movie. It's just... awful. I'm still not sure how it ever got made.
Oh?
Yeah, it was made by this really odd-looking dude named Tommy Wisseau who I think is from Eastern Europe? His accent is kind of weird, but somehow he got his hands on a bunch of money and made his dream movie.
Really. And that's bad?
Well, coming from him it is. It's like this really ridiculous almost Lifetime Movie-esque story about a guy who is seemingly perfect and his awful fianc√© is cheating on him... and Tommy plays the perfect  guy himself.
Oh no.
Oh yeah. And he wrote it himself, and it's just so  cheesy and bad but also hilarious.
It sounds like it could be!
He threw in lots of totally ridiculous and over-the-top love scenes, and insane dialogue and just weird performances from all the supporting actors.
I kinda want to see it now.
You should! It's a lot of fun to go see in a theater with a crowd.
Do they still show it in theaters?
All the time! It's actually gained a huge cult following the last couple of years and is often shown in theaters at late-night screenings.
That's crazy.
It kind of is. It's the kind of movie you'd think would have been buried soon after it was released  and never allowed to see the light of day again, aand yet here it is, with all sorts of fans.
Well it's kind of neat when that happens though, and something good comes of something that initially seem so bad.
It is. There's even a fictionalized movie about the making of it coming out soon, from James Franco and Seth Rogen, who are apparently big fans of it.
