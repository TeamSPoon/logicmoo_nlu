Okay, who is your favorite 80's rock bad still performing today?
Well, I'd have to say that it is Bon Jovi
Ah, that is a good bad. What's one of your favorite songs?
It would have to Wanted Dead or Alive.
Well, I prefer Its my Life.
That's good, but what about One WIld Night?
That's a good one as well, but what's one you like from they're more recent work?
How about Have a Nice Day?
Yeah, that's good. Ever seen the music video for it?
Yes, though I thought the tramp stamp tattoo of the logo was a bit much.
