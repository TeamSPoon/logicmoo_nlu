I never thought I would cry during a Disney movie.
Really, which one did you in?
It was Up, the thing had me melting on the floor.
Oh for sure, I had to hold back tears in the theater.
The beginning section with his wife killed me.
For me it was when he found his wife's adventure diary.
Oh my god definitely, when he saw all of the pictures of their marriage.
Up managed to be one of Disney and Pixar's best films.
No doubt, the magic of those two studios is unparalleled.
They manage to connect human emotions to a child's story everytime.
