Hey
Hey what do you think of Hopsin
he has some good lyrics
Right?
He gots more meaningful stuff going on compared to most MC's
Yeah he does
He can rap fast and he has got talent at writing
True
Most rappers now adays are one note
Do not get me started
I know man
Especially on that thing called mumble rap
That is awful
I know it sounds like trash
Not something i can enjoy
Which is odd
Why
Because you seem to enjoy most stuff
True that i do
You got it diverse
