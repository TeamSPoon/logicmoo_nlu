morning
Good morning
Do you like music?
I love music
What is your favorite genre?
I love a good boy band
Oh yeah? Like nsync?
Yes, and backstreet boys, and if you think about it, even rascall flatts
Rascall flatts? I wouldnt think of them like that
Think about it, they are boys and they all sing together like a boy band
well, I guess, not sure that qualifies though, whats your favorite song
I love bye bye bye, I dance every time I hear it
That one was fantastic, I have to admit
I also love Boys 2 mens "mama"
I saw them sing that on oprah on mothers day, many years ago
I wonder if I can find that on youtube
Lets look...Oh I found it!
That was amazing, I loved it thank you
No problem
Talk to ya later
