What is your favorite Harry Potter Book?
The Prisoner of Azkaban.
That's a good one.
Yeah, Sirius was misunderstood.
Some of the things they did at Hogwarts was crazy.
I think it was nice that he got to escape in the end.
It's sad that no one believed his innocence.
I'm not sure why they didn't expose Wormtail.
Maybe they were trying to act like they didn't know about Voldemort's rise.
The really didn't believe Dumbledore about that.
