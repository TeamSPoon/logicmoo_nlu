I know a lot of Beatles songs, but I didn't grow up with them like you did. What are some interesting things about them I might not know?
Let's see, I've forgotten a lot of things--did you know they made two movies?
Really?
Yes, "Help" and a "Hard Days Night" and they weren't too bad.
Anything interesting about Ringo Starr?
Well, he was the drummer, of course, but  he was not the first--they fired some guy named Pete Best I think, who could have been famous.
Poor guy, anything else?
Well, Ringo actually had the lead on some Beatle songs, such as Act Naturally. and Yellow Submarine.
I've heard them--not classics, but not too bad.
I've never thought Ringo was that talented but he's still going.
