What kinds of movies have you been in to lately?
I've been watching some foreign films.
Oh? Like what?
I really liked Leon the Professional.
Is that movie foreign?
I think it is, I think it's originally French or done by a French director.
I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't be able to tell you.
You should see it, it's very well done.
What's good about it?
The characters are really interesting, especially the main guy and the villain.
What's the movie about?
It's about a mercenary who is kind of lonely and doesn't know how to live well.
That's interesting, what else?
He meets this spunky little girl who's had a tough life and takes her in.
That's an interesting idea.
It's very interesting, though there's some controversial stuff that happens between them.
Really? Like what?
Well, the girl thinks she's in love with the mercenary, who is much older than her.
That's very strange, especially for a more modern movie.
It's more of a movie about their mental age, but it's pretty respectful at least of what would be inappropriate.
