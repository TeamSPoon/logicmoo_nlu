Hey
Hi, do you want to talk about fashion.
Sure that sounds good.
What kind of shoes do you like.
I love vans, I'm wearing black and white ones right now.
I prefer nikes, they have so many different kinds.
Vans do too, we'll different patterns.  I have some Mackey mouse ones.
Well nikes don't have patterns, but they have shocks and Jordan's and lots of different ones.
That's true, I don't really prefer athletic ones. I also like Sperrys.
I like Sperrys to.  I have a pair that's grey and leopard, Sperrys are cute
I want the Sperrys that look more like flats. I don't have a pair of those yet
I just got a pair of those yesterday, I love them.
Are they comfortable?
Yes, they are very comfortable. I've been wearing them all day I need to go get me some of those then
Yes, you would really like them, and they are cute with my Jean Capris
That sounds nice
I can't them in black and white first then I want some new patterns.
I got the black ones
You cant go wrong with black.
No then you can wear them with everything
