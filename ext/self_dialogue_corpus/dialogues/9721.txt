Explain what you mean by motivational. Get moving motivation or inspired motivation?
I'd say get up and get moving motiavtion.
I'd say Survival by Eminem. It's a very energetic and hype song.
Interesting I'll have to check it out.
What about you? What song would you consider ge up and go motivational?
I'd say Stronger by Kanye West.
Yeah thats a decent one.
I'd consider it my all time favorite but it's hard to really find others like it.
I can agree with that. You really have to search around.
