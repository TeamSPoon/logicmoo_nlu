Football season isn't too far off!
I'm really looking forward to it this year.
What do you think the Steelers will be like.
Well Big Ben is still there throwing to Antonio Brown.
What a great a combination the two of them are.
Brown can run really fast and he has a great TD celebration.
One of the best celebrations for sure.
Not as good as the Icky shuffle though.
That was a great dance.  He is a Bengals legend.
The Bengals seem to be right on the cusp, but haven't broken through yet.
I know they are a hard team to figure out. Dalton is pretty good and A.J. Green is a great wide out.
Their defense is usually pretty tough too.
Speaking of defense I wish there was more in the NFL.
Me too.  I like the close grind it out games.
The Ravens a few years back were really tough on defense.
That was a good defense with Ray Lewis and Ed Reeves.
Ed Reeves just can find a ball anywhere.
He is awesome to watch, such a ball hawk.
He reminds me of Ronnie Lott.
Ronni Lott was a great defensive back for sure.
