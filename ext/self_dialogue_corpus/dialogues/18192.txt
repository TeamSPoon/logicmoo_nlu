So who do you think are Bruno Mars' influences?
He definitely reminds me a lot like Prince.
I think this makes sense because he is a multi-instrumentalist.
He also has said that he is influenced by Elvis.
I can definitely see some of that in his personal style.
He also does seem a lot like Michael Jackson in his dance moves and high pitched voice.
What is your favorite Album by Bruno Mars?
I would have to say Unorthodox Jukebox.
I like his 24K Magic Album the Best.
I think all of his albums so far are pretty good.
Do you have a favorite song by Bruno Mars?
There are many that I like, right now what comes to mind is Gorilla.
Off the Unorthodox Jukebox album I really like Locked out of heaven.
I forgot about that sound and how catchy it is.
I also really like some of the songs that were not released as singles off that album.
What songs in particular?
I llike Show Me, and Moonshine.
Yes those are both very good songs.
I love Bruno Mars, mostly I like his showmanship.
Yes his Superbowl Halftime Show alone showed exactly what a great entertainer he is.
