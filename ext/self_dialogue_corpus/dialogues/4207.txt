Hey lets go and see a movie this week
What do you want to go and see?
I think I would like to go see that new movie King Arthur
You sure you don't want to go see 47 meters down?
Is that the one with the Sharks?
Yes, It looks like something that would have you on the edge of your seat the entire time
Okay lets go see that one I love a good shark attack movie
Right, I loved Jaws
Best Shark movie ever!
Even Jaws 2 and 3 were really good.
