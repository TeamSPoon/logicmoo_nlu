Is it true that you're a Wu-Tang fan?
Yeah. I was always a big fan of their ciphers.
Really? I think I might have a song that you might like, then.
What's it called?
It's called "1Train" by ASAP Rocky.
Why do you think I'd like it.
Because it's structured like a cipher. There's no hooks, and it's just a bunch of rappers spitting verses one after the other.
That sounds great. Who's on it.
It features Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big KRIT.
That really does sound awesome. I'll definitely be checking it out soon.
