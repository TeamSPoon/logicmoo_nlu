Okay, I've seen It's a Wonderful Life. What are some other good Christmas movies?
Bell, Book, and Candle is a cute and funny Christmas rom-com from the 1950s, with witches, warlocks, and, worst of all, beatniks.
Who's in it, though?
James Stewart, Kim Novak, Ernie Kovacs, Jack Lemmon and the perfectly named Hermione Gingold.
And where does Christmas come in?
Beautifully, at the end, when Gillian the witch changes her evil ways.
Sounds good. What else have you got?
If you crave a white Chistmas, there's Smilla's Sense of Snow.
What's that about?
It's a mystery set in Copenhagen and Greenland. It's filled with a high moral purpose and clever detective work.
Who's in that one?
You get to watch Julia Ormond, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, and Vanessa Redgrave at work.
Tell me more.
If you haven't seen it, you might like my favorite Bogart comedy, We're No Angels.
So it's got Bogart. Who else is in it?
Just Peter Ustinov, Aldo Rey, Joan Bennet, Basil Rathbone and Leo G. Carroll. Fabulous actors.
But what's the plot?
At Christmas, three criminals and their deadly snake escape prison on Devil's Island. That complicates the lives of Bogart and his kin.
Wasn't there a remake of that one?
Don't bother with it. Watch White Christmas instead, or Home Alone, A Christmas Carol, or Edward Scissorhands.
