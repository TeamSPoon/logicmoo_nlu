Hey, you aren't going to believe this.
What? Tell me.
My husband hasn't seen any of the classic disney movies that we grew up on.
What? You're kidding.
No. I realized it when we went to see the new Beauty and the Beast that he hadn't a clue what was going to happen. He kept asking me obvious questions.
Haha, like what?
Like, "Why doesn't she want to be with Gaston? That guy is awesome."
No. He was on Gaston's side?
I kept telling him, no - he's the bad guy. He figured it out in the end.
That's funny.
