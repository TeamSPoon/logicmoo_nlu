Do you remember Tupac?
Who could forget him?
Yeah I know just didn't know if it was before you time.
Tupac's music and ideas will live for a hundred years past his death.
Possibly, anyway I was just thinking about him today.
What about?
I remember him on tv always preaching how we need to be nice to eachother and stop killing one another.
Yeah that stuff was deep, do you think that's what got him killed?
I think it was because he was convincing the world that just because you're one thing doesn't mean you have to be this or that and to stop doing it.
Yeah he was deep and I loved him.
