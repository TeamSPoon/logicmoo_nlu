Do you think that the hard cap in the NFL has helped the NFL.
No doubt. Look at it's popularity.
It may be popular no matter what the cap situation is. Football in the United States is that popular.
That could be true. However, I think the growth of the NFL and the uncertainty really keeps everyone's interest.
Partly true, I suppose. Most every team comes into the season with some hope.
Except for maybe the Browns and Bills fans.
Ha ha. Yeah. Well, most everyone.
Another point with the cap. I think that the cap has also helped the balance of team worth and team revenue for all 32 teams.
How so?
I think every NFL team is worth at least a billion dollars.
Don't you think it's held back some franchises from becoming even more valuable.
No doubt. I think if there wasn't a cap, teams like the Cowboys would probably be worth billions more than they already are worth.
I was thinking of them when I was asking.
However, I don't feel sorry for Jerry Jones. His franchise is worth plenty with the salary cap rules in place.
Yeah, I would love to have his billions.
Wouldn't we all. It's really helped the smaller franchises like the Vikings gain their worth.
How much are the Vikings worth?
I think every team is worth at least a billion dollars now. Last time I looked the Vikings were valued at 800 million, and that was 5 to 6 years ago.
Yeah, I would have to figure they are over a billion dollars now.
I'm thinking the same thing. The Jaguars probably are now the least valuable franchise since the Vikings got their stadium issues figured out.
