Have you been listening to any rap music lately?
I have been listening to Missy Elliot.
I haven't heard her in a while.
Yeah she has a new album out that seems cool.
What songs are you hearing?
Well mainly old stuff. I like Lose Control.
That is a great song! I miss that!
Do you have any albums of hers?
No, just singles.
That is a shame.
