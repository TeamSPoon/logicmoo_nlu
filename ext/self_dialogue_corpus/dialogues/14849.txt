What do you think was the best time period for comedy movies?
I'd have to say probably mid to late nineties was when some of my favorite comedies came out.
Yea? Like which movies?
I really like the older Jim Carrey stuff like Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
Yes! Those are classics...I must have watched and re-watched those so many times as a kid.
Yea, comedies were so like silly and stupid back then. Nowadays everything is just super crude and sexual.
I know, it's like all these comedies nowadays are competing to see who can push the envelope the most and show the grossest, most outrageous thing.
Yea, I haven't seen a really good comedy that I really enjoyed in recent memory.
Like I said before, all the best comedies were made in the 90's.
This is true. Now I want to re-watch some of them!
