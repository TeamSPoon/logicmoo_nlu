Have you seen all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies?
Yeah, they're great, I just saw Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2!
Did you know Vin Diesel is still providing the voice of Groot?
Yeah, the must have altered his voice because it's clearly not deep like it was in the first movie.
I'm curious to see how they're going to fit everything into the next Avengers movie.
Well, in the upcoming Thor movie, it takes place in outer space and has the Hulk in it, so they're setting something big.
I heard the Avengers will be fighting the Infinity War, which will make this an epic battle!
I wonder if they're going to add Spider-Man again, since his movie is coming out later next month!
I don't know, since that franchise is on loan from Sony Pictures... they own the rights to the character's cinematic use.
They must have made some kind of deal, since the last Spider-Man and Fantastic Four movies tanked so badly.
Those were horrible! Don't they know how to make a good movie anymore?
They're trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's not necessary! The content has been there for years... there's no need to give it a makeover.
All of these reboots leave a bad taste in my mouth. Just make a franchise right and stick with it!
James Bond went on for a long time without a reboot, and now those movies are hardly recognizable.
Changing actors is one thing, but changing the theme and tone is just inexcusable... they may as well not call him James Bond anymore!
Tell me about it! But at least the Marvel Movies are holding true to what they've already one.
Yeah, but it has to end sometime... those actors are getting older and it's not easy to stay in shape.
Right, just like Hugh Jackman no longer playing Wolverine because he's getting too old.
Well, he had quite a run as the character, and I'm sure he'll find more work beyond the superhero genre.
He was fabulous in Les Miserables, and the guy can sing as well as act!
