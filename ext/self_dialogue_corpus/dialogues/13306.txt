Who is your favorite character from the original trilogy?
My favorite character is Han Solo, how about you?
I really thought Boba Fett was a cool character!
Yeah, I wish he had more screen time in the movies.
I'm still mad how they treated his character in the prequel trilogy!
Yeah, they turned such a cool character into a wimpy kid.
The prequel trilogy ruined a lot of stuff though.
Yeah, I really hate them, especially Attack of the Clones!
Why do you hate it the most?
I hate it the most because of the horrible love story between Anakin and Padme!
