Want to talk about movies?
Sure that sounds good.
Awesome, what kind of movies do you like?
I like action movies, you?
I prefer comedies.
One of my favorite movies is Next with Nicholas Cage
That one was really good, and the twist at the end was great
Yea it was really suspenseful
I also like the Bourne movies
Those are good
I just watched Jason Bourne the other day, it was on hbo.
I haven't seen that one
It was really good. I liked it
I'll have to look into it
I like them all really
Yea it's a good series.
What about national treasure?
I love those movies
I wish they came out with another one
Me too. That would be good
