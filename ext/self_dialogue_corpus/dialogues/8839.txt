I wish we'd hear more rock on mainstream radio.
I agree, there are so many bands though that how do you choose what to play?
I don't know, it's just a bummer to me to hear obvious radio hits not make it to radio.
Yeah, stuff like Here Comes My Man by Gaslight Anthem would have been huge if it got airplay.
And that's what I'm talking about, I don't mind that I don't discover artists on the radio, it's just a shame.
The music landscape is so different anyway, most people are listening and discovering on Spotify.
Yeah but there's so many artists on there that a good rock band will get lost in the shuffle.
I hear what you're saying, you want these rock bands on the radio alongside the pop acts.
Exactly, because so many rock bands like Gaslight and Jamie T have hit hooks.
I guess we'll see if any of them ever break through.
