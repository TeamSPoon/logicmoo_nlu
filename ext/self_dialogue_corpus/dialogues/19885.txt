What is it about country music?
What do you mean?
I feel like they all sound the same, and complain about the same things
Like what?
Every song is crying about a girl, drinking, or his guitar.
Or chicken fried!
Chicken fried? Fried chicken?
No haven't you ever heard of chicken fried?
No I haven't
Hey I'm not the biggest country fan, but chicken fried by Zac Brown is awesome
Country is weird man.
It's weird but catchy! Chicken fried! Cold Beer on a Saturday night!
Oh stop it.
Pair of jeans that fit just right!
See what i mean?
And the radio upppppp.
I have much higher taste in music than that.
Yeah okay big guy. Country's country. You got to grow up with it.
I suppose so.
Yep.
