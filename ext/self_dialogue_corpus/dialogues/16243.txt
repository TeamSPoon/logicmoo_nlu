What is your favorite movie soundtrack?
I really liked the soundtrack for The great gatsby.
Any favorite in particular?
So many good ones. Maybe Love is blindness.
The u2 song?
Jack White's cover of U2's. That is the one on the soundtrack.
I think I recall it, not sure 100%.
It is a really good rendition. I also really liked Together by the xx.
I do know that one. I love it.
It is good right? I feel a lot of people don't know it.
I think it is great and so sensual. It really captured the movie character's longing so well.
I really like it too. I don't know if it is on the soundtrack or not but lana del ray's young and beautiful is great too.
I like lana del ray. She is very cool.
She has an edge but sexy sweetness to her.
Agreed. Kind of weird she always seems to have old men in her videos though.
She may have some daddy issues. But I love her anyways.
Me too. Blue jeans is a great song.
I also thought video games and summertime sadness were great from her.
I think so too. Saw a live performance on tv, she can really sing.
Yes she is very talented not really on auto tune like many artist now a days.
