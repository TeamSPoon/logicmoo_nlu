I just started listening to the Jonas Brothers again and it's so great.
Really? I don't think I've listened to them since middle school.
Me neither, until the other day and now I can't stop listening to them.
I can't even remember what songs they sing.
"Burnin' Up," "When You Look Me in the Eyes", "Year 3000."
Oh, right. That was them!
They're actually so good. I don't know why I ever stopped listening to them.
I think I just stopped listening to them because my tastes changed as I grew older.
Well, you should give them another try. They're so good.
Are they even making new music anymore?
No, they broke up in 2013.
I didn't even know that happened.
Yeah, they all kind of grew out of it.
Do they still do anything individually?
Kind of. Nick has a solo career and Joe joined DNCE.
What about the other one?
Oh, you mean Kevin?
Yes. What's he up to?
He's married with two daughters.
Wow, they seemed to get old so fast.
