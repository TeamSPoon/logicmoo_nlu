Do you know what new Disney movies are coming out?
Um, I can't remember. I remember Frozen was an OK one, but I was never a big fan of singing in movies.
Hmm, that's probably why we haven't ever talked about Disney movies before.
Oh, there's The Good Dinosaur! That one got good reviews. Is there singing, though?
If there's only one song, would you still see it? We could go see it this weekend!
I guess I could suffer through it, just because you're my friend!
What do you want to see if that one is sold out? My only rule is that it has to be a Disney movie.
What about Zootopia? I'm up for animated animals in a big city any day!
I think that one is a couple of months old. What about Finding Dory?
Yes! I loved Finding Nemo, I think I'd love Finding Dory too!
