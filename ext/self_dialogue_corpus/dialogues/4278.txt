I saw Rear Window last night.
The original or the reboot?
The original.  Nobody beats Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart.
Not to mention Thelma Ritter.  She was a riot.
I liked Raymond Burr as the heavy.
Wendell Corey was ok.
I liked the Hitchcock cameo.
Yes, winding up the clock.
The ending was pretty cool.
And Jimmy gets the girl!
