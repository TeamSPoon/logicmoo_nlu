Are you ready for some football?
I am always ready for some NFL football.
I hear you. I have been watching replays in the off season.
Me too.
Except the Superbowl. I can't bare that one again.
Oh, no. Me either. But we are starting fresh in just a few weeks.
That goodness.
I know. There is going to be a target on Atlanta's back though.
For sure. They are going to have to prove themselves all over again.
I know. We don't want them to look like a big joke.
I think we have a shot.
I do too. I just don't want that kind of let down again.
True fans will stick through it all though.
I am not going anywhere.
I know. I may get mad, but I am not bailing.
Me either. I will always be an Atlanta Falcons fan.
Yes, and I will breed my children to be too.
I already started that. My kids watch all the time.
Well, I don't have kids yet.
Oh, yeah. It fun to watch football with the little ones.
