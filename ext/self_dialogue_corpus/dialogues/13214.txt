Did you know they are doing a Han Solo movie?
I was unaware of that.
Yeah its supposedly just going to be focused on just him.
I think this ruins Star Wars.
Why?
Because the plot needs to be linear.
So you dont like spin off types of movies?
No I think it gets hard for a fan to keep up.
Well its not like a show where you need to keep up with the way the plot moves.
Yeah I mean I know you have time but I think its all a bit wrangling.
