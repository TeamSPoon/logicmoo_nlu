Did you hear about the director for the Han Solo spinoff movie being replaced by Ron Howard?
Yeah, I heard a little something about that. I wonder if it will make the movie better?
I sure hope so! I do have a lot of faith in Ron Howard though.
Yeah, has has done some pretty amazing work. Do you know why they git rid of the old directors?
Yeah, apparantly they were wanting to take the movie in to much of a comidic direction for the executives at Disney.
Hmm, that's interesting. But shouldn't a Han Solo movie be funny?
Well he is a funny charactor, but I think it was more like they were wanting to make a comedy rather than a Star Wars movie with funny Han moments.
I guess that makes sense. I just hope they do better with this spinoff than they did with Rouge One.
You didn't like Rouge One?
It was OK. There were some great moments and it was very well made, I just didn't feel a connection to the story or charactors.
That's a good point. I think this will be better since we all know and love Han already.
I agree. This is a story of him when he was younger right?
Yeah, it sounds like they will kind of show how he learned to become a smuggler.
That will be fun!
Totally! They also have a great actor to play Lando so I hope we get to see Han win the Milinum Falcon!
I would love to see that!
Me too! We should plan to get tickets and see it on opening night.
I would be down for that. When does it come out.
Good question, I'll have to check.
Well whenever it does, let's plan to go see it!
