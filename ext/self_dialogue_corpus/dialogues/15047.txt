Who is your favorite comedy actor?
I love Paul Rudd.
I completely agree. I've been a fan of him since Wet Hot American Summer.
He's handsome, and he's so sarcastically funny.
He can even turn a superhero movie into a comedy. Just look at Ant-Man.
Yeah, I feel like he's never been in any very bad movies.
My favorite movie of his has to be 40 Year-Old Virgin.
He definitely steals some scenes in that film.
What is your favorite comedy with Paul Rudd?
I'd have to say Knocked Up.
