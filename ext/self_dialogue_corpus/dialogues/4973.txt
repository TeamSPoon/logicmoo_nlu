Who do you think will win the AL West?
The Astros will this year.
Are you an Astros fan?
No. I root for the rangers
They won it last year
They won the last two years
You don't think they will win this year?
No, They were in last place at one point. They just don't have the hitters in their lineup.
They Astros I know has some good hitters
Yeah they are also the best team in baseball.
Jose Altuve is really good
Yeah. I think he is an all star I just hope the Rangers make it to the wild card
Do you think the Astros have a shot at winning the world series?
It is too early to tell. They would have to make a good trade too.
Yeah they may need another pitcher.
Yeah if they could get an ace pitcher that would make them a lot better
Who is your favorite Rangers player?
Elvis Andrus without a doubt. I also like Mike Napoli
Elvis has been around for a while
He has. He is a great shortstop not much gets by him and he is starting to hit better too.
