Do you like Ozzy Osbourne?
I've never heard of him. What's he like?
He's the main singer of his own group, but they play metal and hard rock.
I might have heard of them before now that you mention it.
Most people recognize the song Crazy Train.
That one I have heard of actually.
That's their most popular one, mainly because of Randy though.
Who's he?
He was the main guitarist for two of their albums.
How come he's not involved anymore?
He actually passed away in an accident shortly after their second album.
Oh, that's awful.
It was very tragic, especially because he was an absolute genius.
What made him a genius?
He was very classically trained, but wanted to play heavier music so he brought a lot of classical knowledge to rock and metal.
That's interesting, I would not have guessed.
A lot of rock bands don't have that classical knowledge, so he was a breath of fresh air.
I'm sure. I'll have to give them a listen.
You should listen to Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman, both those albums are great.
I'll keep that in mind when I look on Youtube.
