Yo man?
What's up?
I just watched this new movie with Big Worm in it.
You mean Big Worm from Friday?
Yeah.
Is it a new movie?
Yeah. It's called Ripped.
Was it good?
I think so.
What was it about?
These two dudes smoking weed.
Word?
These two dudes smoked some weed in 1986 and woke up thirty years later.
For real?
I thought it was going to be lame but it actually turned out pretty good.
All they were doing is smoking weed?
Naw. When they woke up in 2016, they had a business plan and ideas and reached out to a childhood sweetheart.
It sounds interesting.
I can't fully describe it but it's funny and is only about 90 minutes long.
I might have to check that one out.
