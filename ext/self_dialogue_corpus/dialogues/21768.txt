What is your favorite movie?
Wow! That is a tough question!
I know, right? Mine is probably The Imitation Game.
Hmm, I think I have heard of it. Does it star the guy that plays Sherlock?
Yeah! Benedict Cumberbatch.
What is it about?
Have you ever heard of Alan Turing?
No. Who is that?
He was a mathematician and computer scientist. He made one of the earliest computers.
Wow really? So the movie is about him?
Yeah. It is about his life.
So it just shows how he made the first computer?
Well, he worked for the British intelligence agency cracking Nazi codes.
Oh wow. That sounds interesting.
It is! He built a machine to decipher the codes.
And that was the computer?
Well, an early model, yeah. They used it to crack a code that was thought to be unbreakable.
That is really impressive.
The movie is super interesting. You have to watch it.
I definitely will.
