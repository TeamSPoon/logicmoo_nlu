There were three large battle stations in the main Star Wars movies. Which would were you the most interested in?
Let's see there was the orginal Death Star, then a rebuilt Death Star under construction, and then the Starkiller Base in The Force awakens.
Yeah, it's a common thing in the Star Wars universe. Which of those three was your favorite?
Well obviously the Starkiller Base was the most powerful but as far as which one was the most entertaining in the movies, I'm going to say the original Death Star from Episode Four.
What makes that one better than the other two?
Well I'm going more by the story and not the Death Star itself.
Personally, I would say that Starkiller Base is my favorite. It was amazing and powerful, plus the lightsaber duel between Kylo Ren and Rey took place there.
True but in the original you had Hav, Luke, Chewie, R2D2, and C3PO on their rescue mission to save Leia. That was a really good section of the movie.
You're right, that sequence is one of the more memorable ones in the Star Wars series.
That's also where Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader met again and had a duel. The first Death Star was the best.
