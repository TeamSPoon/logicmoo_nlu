What movie do you think was awful?
The sex and the city films were complete wastes of money.
You didn't like either of them?
No, i thought they were really awful. The storyline of the first movie is really so depressing mostly.
Did you like the tv series?
I loved the show, it was one of my favorites.
Hmm, weird you hated the movies so much.
Well the show ended so well, had tied everything together so wonderfully, totally stasified with each storyline.
I do agree the end to the show felt very satisfying for all characters.
Yes, and then to have carrie and big on the outs again and go through all that, just hated it.
We did wait all those years for them to be together then the movie essentially ripped them apart.
More than that, samantha in the movie could not be happy in a monogamous relationship with smith.Frustrating.
It was not the best movie/movies but I liked them.
Fine, but admit Sam had made all this emotional progress (show) then reverted backwards in the movie.
I do see your point. I think they were reaching for storylines.
Agreed, then they should have left well enough alone.
You think they should have never even made the movies?
Yes, I disliked those films that much.
The second was a little better than the first at least.
Maybe, but it still stank.
