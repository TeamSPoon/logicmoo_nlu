Do you like rap?
Some.  It's not my favorite, but there are quite a few songs I like.
Who are your favorites?
You might say I like older stuff-- like Wu Tang and Tupac.  What about you?
I like some newer stuff, like Jay-Z and Big Sean, and Kanye.
You like Yezzi?
Just because he's crazy doesn't mean he's not a brilliant artist.
True. Do you like any old school rap?
Not really.  The rhymes sound corny, and the beats are super cheesy.
I think rap is probably the fastest evolving form of music.  Today's sound is so different from even 5 years ago.
Yeah, and stuff from the 90s sounds ancient by those standards.
What do you think about Eminem?
Probably the most overrated rapper out there.
I agree with that-- his rhymes are good, but his voice is so whiny.  He should just write songs.
Who is your personal favorite rapper?
I'd say Method Man.  Not only do I like his voice and his music, he seems like a really cool guy.
He's a member of Wu Tang Clan right?
Yeah, but my favorite stuff of his was when he worked with Redman.
Do you like Redman?
Yeah, I like them both a lot individually, but I think their best stuff is when they work together.
