Have you seen La La Land?
No, I haven't...did you?
Yes...and you have to see it, you will love it.
Really? Tell me about it.
We saw it, and it was such a feel good movie.
Is it a musical? I hate when they keep breaking into song in musicals.
IT's not like that. The songs and dances are woven into the overall story so well.
I always think it seems silly, who does that in real life?
You just get so wrapped up in the story that you won't think like that at all.
Well, I do like Ryan Gosling.
Oh, I am in love with Ryan Gosling now, if you like him before this movie, you will love him after.
How about Emma Stone?
She is cute as a button and excellent in the movie too.
How about them together?
Well, I don't want to spoil the movie for you so I will not go into that.
Oh no, I don't like sad endings.
It's not a sad ending, I told you it was a movie that had you feeling good on the way out.
OK...do you think my boyfriend would like it?
Yes...mine did.
Ok then, I think we will give a try.
