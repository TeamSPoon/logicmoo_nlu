Did you hear that Prodigy passed away?
The rapper from Queens?
Yeah, he just died today.
What happened?
There's no official cause yet.
I'd heard he was having trouble with sickle cell anemia.
Wow, he wasn't that old, was he?
No, he was only 42.
Wow, it really makes you think.
I know, he was such an influential person, what a shame.
