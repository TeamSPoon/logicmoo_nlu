Suggest a decent thriller movie to me.
I thought "10 Cloverfield Lane" was good for how little press it received.
What's it like?
It's a bit of a sci-fi thriller. It kind of reminds me of "The Village".
That's awesome. Is it scary?
I wouldn't say outright horrifying. It is creepy though.
I will add it to my list. Will I understand it if I haven't seen Cloverfield?
Yeah, they actually have nearly nothing to do with eachother.
Really? I always thought it was a sequel.
Not really at all. It's completely a movie that can stand on it's own.
