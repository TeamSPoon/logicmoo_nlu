Do you know the song Sweet Dreams?
The song by the Eurythmics?
Yeah, so you know it?
Sure, it was a popular song.
Did you rather their version or Marilyn Manson's remake?
Actually, I liked Marilyn Manson's version better.
Are you a fan of Marilyn Manson?
Not really, but his version would just better.
So, you don't like the original version?
The original has too much of that 80s sound.
I guess you don't like all the electronic sound.
No, that's probably it.  I like that Marilyn Manson's version is just a little harder.
Are you into hard rock?
No, but this song isn't all that hard.  It's just hard enough for me.
Are there any other Marilyn Manson songs that you like?
I like the one about the drugs.
That really doesn't narrow it down.
It says "I don't like the drugs, the drugs like me."
Oh, that song.
Yeah, and I like the Dope Show too.
