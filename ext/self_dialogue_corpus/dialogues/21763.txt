What was your favorite Christmas movie?
Bad Santa.
Ok, wasn't expecting that.  But that movie was awesome.
Billy Bob was great in that movie.  I never stopped laughing.
His constant drinking and obsession with getting ladies into bed had me rolling.
I love the irony how one of the most inappropriate movies ever made was a Christmas movie.
I know right?  How about when he was in the car with the lady.
Yes, that was awesome.  Then the kid comes to save him.
The best part were his one liners.  "Let's get it moving this aint the DMV!"
I know or the part where the midget kept saying it was his low blood sugar.
You know what was funny?  When he said he was going to quit drinking and open a bar.
Yeah, then you see him cutting limes and it's not his bar, he  just hopped it and is stealing booz.
Haha, yeah then he's drinking that beer with cigarette in it.
That was awesome.
How about Bernie Mac?
He cracked me up.  Like when he smoked that cigarette so fast.
I love it. That movie was done right.
That kid killed me too.  He was so pathetic.
He was.  That's what made it so funny.
Like when he fought the midget.
