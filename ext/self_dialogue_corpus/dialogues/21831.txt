Do you like Vietnam war movies?
I love them! Do you have a favorite?
Difficult to pick, but I guess 'Apocalypse Now'. You?
Maybe 'Full Metal Jacket', for me. It is difficult, though.
That's unusual - I know a lot of people don't care much for the second half of that movie.
I've heard that too, but I love it. I'm a big Kubrick fan, though.
You've seen 'Apocalypse Now', yeah?
Oh of course, dozens of times. Incredible movie. Martin Sheen does an amazing job.
That opening scene where he cuts his hand after punching the mirror is real.
I didn't know that!
Yes, he was actually drunk and the director just let him do whatever he wants and filmed it.
I guess that's why the emotion feels so raw - because it is.
Marlon Brando is so scary in it too.
I remember how little time he's actually in that movie, and yet he's so ominous.
Yes, his presence just looms over the whole movie like a ghost.
Which, correct me if I'm wrong, was the intention?
I believe so, yes. Martin Sheen's character is given the assignment right at the beginning.
I still remember that creepy audio of Brandov when they give him the assignment?
About a snail crawling along a razorblade? Yes! Such a great script.
Incredible script. So much of it became instantly quotable and iconic!
