How many NFL games have you attended in your life?
Oh. Quite a few, you know me and my dad have been going to see the Bengals play since I was just a kid.
Are they your favorite team or is it just because you live in Cincinnati
Its pretty much because I live there. Though I have gone to see a few games with uh.. the  Miami Dolphins
Do you like the Dolphins?
They are okay, Ryan Tannehill could improve just a little. How many NFL games have you attended
In my whole life? I guess maybe twenty but the most memorable ones were the playoffs.
Who did you see in the playoffs?
The New York Jets.
What year was this ?
I think it was 2010. No they didn't win but the game was interesting
Who is the star quarterback for the Jets this year?
Probably Josh McCown I hear he's signed with them
What about Christian Hackenberg, his stats seem pretty good
Yeah but he's not the best. Sorry.
Yeah there's always gonna be a younger much better, player than him. So you say it's Josh McCown?
Clearly. But we will see when the season starts
Yeah we will see.
Well next time your in New York we will catch a Jets game
The Jets? I hate them......
