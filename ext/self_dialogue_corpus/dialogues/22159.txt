Is it just me, or is there a surplus of Teen post-apocalypse movies?
It's not just you, it's everywhere.
Like, Hunger Games and Maze Runner.
That Divergent Series.
Did we ever have things like that when we were young?
I think for us, it was Harry Potter.
That's right.  And keep in mind that craze went for a long time because of the 7 books and movies for each.
Those were great movies.  Not like those teen apocalypse movies
I don't like them either, but I guess they have their own appeal and target demographic.
I wonder why though, because they're so tragic and depressing.
I think it has to do with the fact that movies like 'The Hunger Games' put young adults at the forefront of the action.
I guess it can be empowering for young kids and teens to feel like they can be the hero and make a difference.
I did actually see 'Maze Runner.'  It had an interesting concept.
Who's in it?
Dylan O'Brien, that actor from the 'Teen Wolf' series I think.  And Ki-Hong Lee from 'Kimmy Schmidt.'
Are they good?
They're both very talented actors.  I can see them being in a lot more movies in the future.
I noticed that regardless of the quality of a movie, these days, all the actors are so talented.
I think there is definitely a shift from the past, where movies cast actors based on looks, whereas now they also focus very much on talent.
I think that's for the better.  It makes movies that much more better to watch.
