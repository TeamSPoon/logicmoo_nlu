What do you think about the Carolina Panthers this season?
I think they are going to have a much more dynamic offense.
Yea me too, I think those rookies they picked up are going to have a big impact.
Cam really needs to step it up a bit this year in the passing game.
I agree, he's a great mobile QB, but he's fallen off a bit since his rookie season in passing.
Well, they certainly do have a lot more targets now for him to throw to.
Yea, McCaffrey is just going to be all over the field.
Devin Funchess hopefully progresses into a bigger role.
Yea if he can step it up a bit, that would be amazing.
Yea, Benjamin and Funchess two twin towers on the outside, with McCaffrey, and Samuel slicing over the field with speed.
Greg Olsen of course too.
As long as their offense steps up a bit I think they win the division.
The defense is solid, a lot just depends on how much the corners and secondary has improved.
True, I did like how we brought buck Munnerlyn.
Remember, Worley had 87 tackles as a rookie corner last year.
That is impressive.
But I really believe Bradberry is the playmaker, look for him to step up.
Yea if those two can improve upon their rookie season, they will be a solid duo.
The front seven bring back Julius Peppers too!
So happy we brought back Peppers and Munnerlyn!
