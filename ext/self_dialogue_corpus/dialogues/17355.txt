What kind of music do you listen to?
Nothing on the radio really, mainly alternative and J-pop or J-rock.
Oh, I know a couple of those!
Oh, really? What ones?
Do you listen to UVERworld? They were pretty popular for a while.
Yeah, I do! I really like them.
Cool, I haven't heard anything new from them in a while though, have you?
No, I don't think so. They had a new single like 6 months ago, but that was it.
Aw, thats a shame. What other bands do you like?
Um, I like Sawano Hiroyuki's vocal stuff a lot.
Who is that?
Someone that does soundtracks for shows, but does a lot of normal rock/pop songs in those soundtracks. Those are amazing.
Oh, thats interesting. Anyone else?
My favorite band was School Food Punishment, but they broke up several years ago.
Oh no! Thats the worst when that happens.
For real, I couldn't even listen to their music for a while after cause it was too sad.
Are you finally able to listen to them again?
Yeah, haha. I haven't listened to them a lot though, I should go back through all their songs again sometime.
Maybe we can listen to some together! I want to know what they sound like now.
Okay, that sounds fun!
