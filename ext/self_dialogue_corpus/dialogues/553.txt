If you had to name one, who would you say is the all time best football player ever?
I would say Joe Montana.
Didn't he play for the San Francisco 49ers?
He did.
He's won a Superbowl before, right?
While with the 49ers he won four of them.
Four? That's amazing!
It really is. Not only that, but he was name MVP three different times.
What an honor. Did you ever see him play?
I did a few times in San Francisco many years ago.
Why did he stop playing for them?
He had an injury and once his injury got better, he traded to play with the Kansas City Chiefs.
Is he still playing for them?
Oh no. He retired a long time ago.
I thought so.
Personally, I think he would have stayed with San Francisco if he hadn't injured his elbow.
I think you're right.
The bottom line is that he had an awesome career.
I agree.
Now you know why I think he's the best football player of all time.
