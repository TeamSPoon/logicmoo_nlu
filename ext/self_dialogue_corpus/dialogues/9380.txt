What did you make of Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's Control?
Man, that was the best thing to happen in rap in 2013.
One of my favorite moments for sure too.
It was a call out to all rappers to start making real music, real hip hop, to get back to the roots. And he basically crowned himself the King of Rap in that song.
Yeah, I think it was a call to artistic arms that has since elevated the game.
Right, he calls out Tyler the Creator, Drake, Mac Miller, A$AP Rocky, and others and says he isn't rapping to be good. He's rapping to be the best.
Have you heard what Big Sean said about it?
What'd he say? That he didn't hear Kendrick's verse before recording his?
Well, he has said that in the past, but he somewhat recently said he thought he had the best verse on "Control."
Oh come on! No one thinks that.
