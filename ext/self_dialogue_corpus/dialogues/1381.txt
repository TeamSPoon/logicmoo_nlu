Hey do you know anything about football or watch anything about the NFL?
Not really. My family are huge Oakland Raiders fans.
Well now they are the Las Vegas Raiders?
Wow, I didn't realize they were moving. Weren't they the Los Angeles Raiders at some point?
Yeah they were in the mid 80's to mid 90's. But now they are moving to Las Vegas.
Any particular reason why?
They say it was because the old stadium was falling apart and the team couldn't get it renovated in a way that the owners were happy with or something like that.
They must've really screwed up bad to lose the whole team
Well the proposals have been going on since 2009, so someone must have just gotten sick of dealing with it.
I don't know if Las Vegas is a good place for any sports team to be honest.
Yeah, me neither. But I guess we'll find out.
It's just so touristy, I don't see how they can consistently pull in a fanbase.
I agree, I go to Vegas to gamble, drink, and see unique shows. Not watch NFL.
Agreed. How long do you think it'll take for them to move.
The NFL commission has said that the Raiders will play in Oakland for 2017 and 2018.
Well at least my Bay Area family can still see them for a couple more years.
It may be longer than that, the stadium in Vegas has ran into issues off and on in terms of investors and building it.
It seems like they would need to build it away from the strip since that is already pretty clogged up.
I'm guessing so too. I don't think the NFL has thought this through all the way..
I guess we will find out in the next few years if the Las Vegas Raiders will be a real thing.
