One time I was with this guy, riding back home in his truck.
Uh-uh.
And this song came on.
What was it?
A song that was like our life at that moment. It was so awkward.
Oh yeah? What was it?
She Fuckin' Hates Me!
By Puddle of Mud?
Yeah.
Haha, that's funny.
Dude. I was trying so hard not to burst into laughter when that song came on. It was like our theme song.
OMG! That's hilarious!
I know! She fuckin hates me! I tried so hard and she tore my feelings like I had none, ripped them away!
Do you think he knew that was y'all's song?
I don't think he had a clue. That's what was so funny.
Oh gosh.
I was just thinking to myself, "Hahahahahaha that's so you! That's so me! Hahahahaha"
Poor guy.
And he's just singing along like oblivious.
I repeat, poor guy.
