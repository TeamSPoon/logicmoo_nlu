It bums me out how long it takes Tenacious D to put out albums.
I agree, Rize of the Fenix was a super funny album.
Most of all I miss album releases because I miss seeing them live.
Yeah album releases, besides the abundance of new tracks, always bring on the tour which you and I love.
I love how even though they're somewhat of a joke rock band, they can still genuinely rock.
Oh totally, Jack Black has a great voice and Kyle Gass can shred.
It's even better when they get Dave Grohl to guest on drums.
Him as the devil in Pick of Destiny was a great treat.
What's your favorite Tenacious D song?
It's a tough choice and maybe it's a generic choice but Wonderboy.
