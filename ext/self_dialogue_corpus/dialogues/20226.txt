Are there any sports movies worth the time?
I guess my first question would be what sport interests you?
I like lots of sports, but let's start with football.
OK.     How about Rudy?     That is a classic.
Remind me what that film is about.
It is based on a true story, a kid wants on the Notre Dame football team.
I think I remember it.     Working class, and he takes a job as the assistant or something.
Yes, that is the one.      He works for the team all season, but does not get a shot.
That is sad.     What happened in the end?
The other players convince the coach that they will not play unless Rudy is given his opportunity.
Happy Ending.    That's nice.     What about a baseball movie?
I like that Kevin Costner one, For the Love of the Game.
I remember that.      They got permission to use real logos and team names.
Yes, they did a very convincing simulation of a game and a broadcast.
What was special about that game?
It was the final game of his career, and flashed back to his relationship with a woman.
That's nice, a love story too.    Who was the female lead?
John Travolta's wife.    Kelly Preston, I believe.
So it is there story too.
Yes.     The only thing is we know it is Fantasy given the role of the Detroit Tigers!
