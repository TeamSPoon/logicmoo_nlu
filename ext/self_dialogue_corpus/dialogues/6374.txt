Did you ever see Brave?
That's the one with the red-headed princess, right?
Yeah, Merida.  That's the one.
Yeah, I did.  I liked it.
I did too.  I really liked that Merida was strong and independent.
Yeah, she was really independent.  She was also stubborn and that got her into a bit of trouble.
True.  She shouldn't have gone to the witch to get help with her mother.  She should have just kept trying to make her mother see her point of view.
But she tried to get her mother to understand and she just wouldn't.  She had no choice but to go to the witch.
I don't know.  At least she figured out how to fixed the curse and turn her mother back into a human.
And don't forget her brothers because they'd turned into bears too.
