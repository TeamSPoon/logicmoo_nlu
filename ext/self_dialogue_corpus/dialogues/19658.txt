What kind of music do you like?
I like all kinds of music, except country.
Really? I love classic rock!
Nice, anyone specific? I love Queen!
Yeah, Queen is awesome, I'm glad they still tour.
Even with a new leader singer?
Well, I think they did what they have to, and spent time finding someone good enough to replace Freddie.
That's cool, who else do you like?
I also love Billy Joel.
That's a bit different than Queen, haha!
Yes, but I grew up listening to him.
Well, he is a classic.
Yeah. I saw him in concert in NYC a few years ago.
How was the show.
Surprisingly, it was really good. His voice has held up well unlike some of the other old singers.
Yeah like the Rolling Stones.
Oof, yeah. I mean, they're honest about the things they've done and how they've treated their voices though.
True, and hey at least they're still going.
Yeah, I've got to appreciate that they still want to rock.
I hope I'm still doing that at their age!
