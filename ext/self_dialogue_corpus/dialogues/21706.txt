Did you ever see Wanted?
No, who was in it?
Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman and Wesley Gibson.
Oh yea, that was the movie where they can curve the bullets right?
Yea that's it. Good movie right?
It was ok. Good CGI, but a terrible plot line.
I thought the plot was good!
No way man, too basic.
How so? He was training to become an assassin after being a basic office worker.
Yea, that doesn't ever happen.
I thought Wesley Gibson was awesome in it.
What else has he done?
Honestly, I really don't know haha!
Well I do know Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie have been in a lot of movies.
Yea they are, but they are very talented people.
Oh I agree, did they do any other movies together?
Was she in Black Snake Moan?
No, that was Christina Ricci!
Oh yea that's right. Justin Timberlake was in that too right?
Yea, he's great as well.
