I like punk rock as well.
Who's your favorite band?
Probably Fall Out Boy.
They're great. They stand the test of time with their music.

Definitely American Beauty.
That's an awesome one. I like From Under the Cork Tree too.
I don't know that one off hand. What songs are on it?
It was their 2nd album. It has Dance, dance on it.
Oh ok, yeah that's definitely one of their better songs.
Have you seen them in concert?
No, not yet. How about you?
I did once last year. Would you be interested in going if they came to town?
Definitely, I know most of their songs.
Great, I'll keep a look out for their next tour dates.
Sweet, I'd love to hear them play My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark live
Yeah, it's always better live.
I agree, it would be an experience.
