Had you ever seen Ace Ventura?
No, I actually never did.
Oh, it was hilarious.
I just never was a Jim Carey fan.
There was a part with a rhino that was great!
Yeah, in middle school everyone talked about that part.
You didn't think it was funny?
Even as a kid I thought it sounded stupid.
Maybe that kind of humor isn't your thing.
I guess not.
