Are you still a big NFL fan?
Yes, I am really looking forward to the upcoming season.
I am to, I can not wait to set down and watch some football.
What team do you cheer for the most?
I am a huge New Orleans Saints fan!
I have always been a big fan of Drew Brees myself actually.
Yea, I hope he never retires!
He has been great for the Saints in every aspect.
He sure has; he saved our franchise in my honest opinion.
I remember watching him in college when he played for Purdue. I could tell he was going to be special.
Yea he had a great college career as well.
I feel that him and Sean Payton have been a perfect match together.
They have great chemistry with one another. It reminds me of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady in some ways.
Do you think he will be able to win another Superbowl before he retires?
I sure hope so. I would love that for so many reasons!
Well, at least he has one ring to silence the critics.
Yea, I am happy that he does not have to worry about retiring without it!
I feel that if he had better defenses over the years he would have gotten a few more of those rings.
I agree with you one hundred percent about that!
Without a great defense it is hard to win in the NFL.
