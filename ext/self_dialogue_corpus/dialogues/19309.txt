Do you know about Trivium?
They released Ascendancy, didn't they?
That's the one.
Then yeah, I've heard of them.
I recently started checking them out and I really like them. That's why I'm asking.
Which albums have you heard?
Ascendancy, like you said. I also listened to Shogun and In Waves.
Those have to be their three best ones.
I also saw that they have some more recent ones.
I don't have a very high opinion of their stuff after In Waves.
Why? What's wrong with it?
It's not that. It's just that their sound is changing dramatically.
That doesn't sound like a bad thing.
Again, it's not. It's just something that I'm not used to.
I'll check them out to see what it sounds like.
You do that, and then tell me what you think.
Is it really that drastic?
Yes. The Trivium that wrote Silence in the Snow is not the same one that wrote Ascendancy.
Did they change members or something?
Not really. They've had drummer changes, but that's about it.
