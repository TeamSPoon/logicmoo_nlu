I heard that new Aliens moving is coming out.
It's already out actually. It's called Alien Covenant.
Cool. Have you seen it?
No. I haven't seen it. I just saw a trailer that said it was playing in theatres now.
I wonder if it's any good. I like the previous movies in that franchise.
I hope it's good. The original Alien movie was really good.
I love that movie. Sigourney Weaver is great in that.
Yes. I find it to be the most memorable one in the franchise.
Remember Alien vs. Predator? Did you ever see that?
I did see it. It was good, I suppose.
Yes, I agree. It's not like you can really expect a movie of great profundity with a topic like that.
Sometimes movies are just fun. They don't always have to be profound.
I agree. Some people feel that way about car-chase style movies.
Sure. Fast and Furious is a franchise that keeps producing.
I'm more of a Smokie and the Bandit type of person myself.
I agree. That was an original classic, starring Burt Reynolds.
Wasn't Sally Field in that also?
Yes. I think she was, as well as Dom Delouise possibly, if I'm not mistaken.
That's a movie with a great song that goes with it, too.
It sure is. "East bound and down. Loaded up and truckin'..."
