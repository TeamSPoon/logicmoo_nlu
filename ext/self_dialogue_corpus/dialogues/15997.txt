I have a new band to introduce you to.
Who are they?
Hillsong United. Have you heard them?
No. What kind of music do they play?
It is Christian pop music. Kind of mellow.
Sound intresting and nice.
Brother, they have amazing melodies and the feel is very unique.
I will listen to them tonight as soon as I get a little time to relax.
Look for an acustic concert they did some years ago.
How will I know which concert it is? There is too much stuff on the internet,
i'll try to send you a link, but it is the concert in which they are sitting in like a circle wodden room and there are some people around them.
Ok, I'll look it up.
The first song I heard from them was "Oceans". I got immediatelly hooked.
What's it about?
All their songs are about God and Scripture.
Oh, ok. That's beautiful.
but this song has something special in the melody and in the way the girl that sings sings it.
I can't wait to hear them.
Let me know what you think as soon as you do.
I sure will. Thanks for the recommendation.
