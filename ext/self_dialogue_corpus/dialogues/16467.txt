Did you know there are glam metal bands in Asia?
No kidding?
Nope. and it's a relatively new thing. They still play and release albums and so on. They're popular in Korea, Japan etc.
How do they sound though?
Pretty sad and lame.
Hahaha. knew they couldn;t be that good. Glam is so old and the sound was pretty even in the 80s
Well, the glam rock in Asia is not at all liek the ones we had in the 80s.
No>?. What are they like then?
They're just weird. They wear period clothings.
What's period clothings?
like clothing White people wore back in the 19th century.With wide ruffles on their shirts, and things.
That's just so weird. Why would they think that's cool?
Who knows. And the sound theyhave ranges from flat out lame rock/pop mix to some weird fusion metal thing
That doesn't sound at all appealing.
I think they're popular among girl fans in Asia
Probably just because of their appearances.
Maybe. But it's a niche market thing it seems to me.
Give some people what they want, make money, stay in business, etc
Yeah. Exactly.
Glam, even in the US, was never about music to begin with anyway. If they like it, so be it. I wouldn't buy their albums.
