Do you ever go to the record store?
To buy albums and CDs?
Yes, I went to a new one in the neighborhood last week.
What did you buy?
The new Foo Fighters album and an old Pink Floyd album.
Wow, you have very different taste in music than I do.
What do you mean?
I love classical music.
Interesting. Who is your favorite composer?
Beethoven. He is a genius.
I agree. But I prefer Bach.
Bach is great. He is my second favorite.
Do you like any modern music?
Not really. I tend to prefer older music.
What else do you like?
I like Etta James and Nina Simone.
Those are great artists. Good choice.
Thanks. Their voices are amazing.
I agree. They are fantastic singers.
I wish I could hit high notes like that.
