Have you seen the latest Star Wars movie?
No, I haven't yet. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
Which story arc do you like best?
My favorite arc was learning how Annakin become Darth Vader. Who would have imagined that little boy would have turned into the imposing Vader?
I'm more a fan of the original three movies released.
They sure packed a punch! I bet my ex wasn't the only one who thought he was piloting a fighter home after the movie!
I think part of that is that it was the first time we were exposed to that world. It was so much to take in.
True, even excellent sequels can suffer a bit in comparison, because the "newness" of the experience is gone. It seems like reviewers sometimes forget that.
The filmmakers must be always trying to up their game, to try to bring in new locations, characters and story reveals to make it new again.
It's a daunting task. I'm not sure they could ever top the impact of: "Luke, I am your father!"
