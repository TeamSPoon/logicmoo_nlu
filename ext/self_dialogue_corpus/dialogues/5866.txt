When did Beauty and the Beast come out?
The cartoon version right?
Yes
That was 1991 I think
Wow, I was a kid then.
When did Pinocchio come out?
That was in the 40's I think.
Wow, I never knew there was such a big time difference there.
Yeah, they started making animated films since the 30's. Snow White was first in 1937.
Wow. That was a long time ago.
