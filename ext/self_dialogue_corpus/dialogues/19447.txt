What's a good song to learn to play on the Ukulele?
I love ukulele! A lot of artists are incorporating it recently because it's so popular.
Like who?
Well Tyler Joseph from Twenty-One Pilots, Jason Mraz, Vance Joy.
That's pretty cool. I'm really enjoying learning to play.
Also there's this song in a Pixar short film called Lava, the song, Someone to Lava, is adorable and it's all Ukulele.
Oh, there was that scene in How I Met Your Mother where the Mother plays Ukulele, it was so pretty.
Yeah that's La Vie en Rose, I love that song.
Are there songs that just sound good on Ukulele that I could try. But modern songs?
Pretty much every Ed Sheerhan song, some Bruno Mars, like Count On Me, and Sean Mendes, but his songs are a little harder to learn.
I love Ed Sheerhan, I think my favourite is Thinking Out Loud.
That's a good one.
I've been learning ukulele since I heard this version of Over the Rainbow that was amazing.
Yes, IsraÃ«l Kamakawiwo'ole did that. He was a great ukulele player.
I will never remember that name!
That's ok, any time you search Over the Rainbow and ukulele he will come up.
What about John Legend songs, do you think I could learn those?
I'm sure you could, his music is beautiful, I love his duet with Meghan Trainor, Like I'm Gonna Lose You.
Any other suggestions? You're pretty good at this.
Learn a bunch of holiday songs, by December you'll be ready to be the hit of your family gatherings!
