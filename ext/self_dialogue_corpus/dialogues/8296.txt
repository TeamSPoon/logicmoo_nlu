Are there any songs in the charts you like right?
On the pop charts? Not really.
You don't like the Selena Gomez track?
I haven't heard it. What's it like?
Well it's totally unlike her.
How so? I liked her last album.
Well she samples the Talking Heads.
That's not something I would have ever expected from her.
You've gotta hear it. She's really doing some cool stuff right now.
I will. Thanks!
