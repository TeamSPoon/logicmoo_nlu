Do you play any instruments?
Well, I took clarinet lessons as a kid, but I didn't really like it.
Oh, really?  How long did you play it for?
About six or seven years, but I was never very good, to be honest.  How about you?
No, I never learned anything.  I would love to learn guitar, if I had the time.
I took a college course on guitar and it was pretty easy to learn.  You could probably teach yourself.
Really?  The main reason I want to learn to play is to do covers of songs.  Nothing fancy.
They actually make books with the sheet music for pop covers!
That's great, but I don't know how to read music.
I'm sure the instruction books would tell you how to read the notes.  And some of the sheet musics for guitars doesn't even use traditional notes.  It uses chords.
Couldn't you just teach me?
No way.  I haven't played since college!  And without practice, it's easy to forget.  But if you signed up for lessons, I would probably sign up, too.
How long do you think it would take to learn the guitar?
Well I took one semester of lessons, and I was able to play two songs at the end.  The lessons were weekly.
That's not bad, I guess.  It's only six strings, right?
You're supposed to practice every day though.  Not just to get better, but because you need to build up callouses.
What do you mean, build up callouses?
The strings are made of wire and when you play guitar, it can really hurt your fingers.
Oh, forget it.  I think I'll just take up drums instead.
No, you should learn the guitar!  After all, you're already a champ at the air guitar.
