Have you heard SORRY?
I think Justin Bieber wrote that.
It was released in 2015.
It has 2.6 billion views.
The girls are dress colorfully.
The girls seem to do all the dancing.
Is he even in the video?
I don't understand why it has so many views.
Maybe all the colors keeps peoples attention.
It is an OK song.
