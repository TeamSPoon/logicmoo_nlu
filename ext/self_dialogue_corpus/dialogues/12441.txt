How many films are there in the star wars series?
Well I guess there are the first three from the seventies and eighties then the prequel three in the two thousands and now they are making the newer series
Plus was there not also a cartoon?
I think there was but it wasn't very popular among adults but I think they took the cartoon story line and made that a part of the video game
Wow I remember playing the pod racer game on the nintendo back in the day but that was a part of the franchise for episode one
I would have to say that episode one is my least favorite. I just hate jar jar binks.
For sure that was the most useless racist character.
Plus the fact that he was completely computer generated so the actual on screen time looked so cheesey
I feel like that was something unnecessary for them to do, they could have had a more real feeling from the use of a real actor.
In all the movies I hated no character more than jar jar binks.
