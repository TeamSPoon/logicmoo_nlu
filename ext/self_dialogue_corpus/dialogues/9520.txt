Do you like rap music?
Well, I don't listen to it very often, but some songs and artists I like.
Which artists do you like?
Nas, Jay Z, and Jadakiss.
Oh those are really great rappers.  Some of the best, actually.
Yeah, I only like decent rap.  None of this Lil Wayne stuff.
Why not Lil Wayne?
His music, like a lot of others, is exploitative.  It doesn't say anything, it's just random garble about guns and women and weed.  It promotes a poor outlook for black culture.
Wow, yeah I guess it does.
Rap should say something meaningful, not just talk about money all the time.
