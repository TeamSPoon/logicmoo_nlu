You know what really upset me about Fast & Furious 6?
What disappointed you?
I feel like the characters totally forgot about Gisele at the end.
Wow.  Now that you mention it, they totally glossed over that.
One of their crew members died, but they seemed so happy about celebrating when they got Mia back.
That was very uncharacteristic of the crew to forget a family member.
They should have at least had a moment of silence for Gisele.  Especially since she died sacrificing herself for Han.
That made me angry as well.  By the way, you realize who the actress who portrayed Gisele was?
Yeah, it was Gal Gadot!
I guess we can't be too sad about her leaving the franchise, now that she's Wonder Woman.
