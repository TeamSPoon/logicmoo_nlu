You've got a pretty eclectic collection of music here! Do you have favorites, or do you listen to all of them?
I tend to gravitate toward classic rock, like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, The Who, Deep Purple, even some Traffic and Mountain.
Who was in Traffic? I've never heard of them.
Oh, come on, you must have heard their music some time in your life. The group was headed up by Steve Winwood.
No, you're mistaken. Wasn't that Blind Faith, with Eric Clapton?
No, Traffic was formed after Blind Faith broke up.
Oh, so where did Clapton go? Did he form his own group?
Well he sort of toured and did his own thing. You know, I think after all those years with Cream and Blind Faith, he decided to go study the Blues.
Oh yeah, I remember when he came out with "Crossroads". Great tunes, man.
No.no that was later. he did that single "After Midnight", now that was a great song.
So you like Cream too? I love "Dark Room", and "The Rainbow Has a Mustache".
Yeah, I'm into the sound of Jack Bruce. What a voice that guy had, for a little man.
Seriously, but didn't he pay the bass? That's so unusual for a bass player to lead a group
Yeah, frankly only one other group with a lead singer who played the bass comes to mind, and that was The Police.
Wow, I can think of even more! How about Gene Simmons, of KISS, and Greg Lake, of Emerson, Lake and Palmer?
You're right, I forgot a really important one: Paul McCartney! He had the lead sometimes with the Beatles, and then later in Wings!
Wow, so much great music there. Could it be that bass players are greatest musicians?
Oh, come on! What about drummer lead singers, like Phil Collins, of Genesis, Don Henley, of The Eagles, and Levon Helm of The Band?
Okay, okay, you're right. But you have to admit, those bands are few and far between.
Yeah, but they were so awesome, some of the best in the music business. That's a hard thing to top!
