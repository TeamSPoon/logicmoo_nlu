Man, I wish the Rockets could pull out this series.
There still is a chance.
Yeah I guess it is not totally over.
It is not, but Harden is looking really run down.
Exactly, that is the problem with not closing out series earlier.
Well that and him clearly being on an MVP campaign this year.
Yeah he just looks exhausted out there.
It is odd though since his teammates are not that bad.
They are not but the way they run their offense he has to be involved in each play.
That is true, his usage rate is off the charts.
Second only to Westbrook.
Who was rigging the system to get triple doubles.
Exactly! Which was the NBA's most overrated storyline this year.
Could not agree more.  Triple-Doubles are a totally made up stat.
Agreed.  I don't know why people clung to that so quickly.
Because ESPN repeated it a million times this year and made it seem like a thing.
Yeah, but really it was just ball hogging and terrible basketball.
Yeah, hero ball is not fun to watch.
Unless it is Jordan.
Yeah and Westbrook is no Jordan.
