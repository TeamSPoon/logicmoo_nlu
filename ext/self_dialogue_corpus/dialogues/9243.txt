I love rock music!  I would love to live in a little pink house by John Mellencamp.
That would be very cool but what would the interior have?
I think I would have "a magic carpet ride" by Steppenwolf.
Magic carpet inside would be insane.  I wonder where this would be?
If I had my choice it would be "standing on the corner of Winslow Arizona" taking it easy by the Eagles.
Arizona is cool and I would live there.  Who are you living with?
I am living with "Jack and Diane".  They are performed by John Cougar Mellencamp.
Jack and Diane, no way.  I bet they are crazy people!
They are "born to be wild".  They get their motor running by steppenwolf.
For sure they are wild.  Very cool rock n roll conversation.
