Let it goooo, let it goooo...
Omg, are you singing the frozen song?
Yes, i love it.
That is a great song by the way.
Totally agree. Which version is your favorite?
Well, i guess i'm picking the one from Demi Lovato.
Really? She's good but i think i like Idina Menzel more.
Both of them are really great singers
I know, i hope Disney decides to release a sequel.
Actually, they are doing it. I hope it doesn't take too long!
