Did you see Rouge One?
Yeah I loved it, the effects were incredible.
Oh yeah it looked amazing, Donnie Yen played such a cool character.
Yeah when he was walking blindly through all the gun fire it was sick.
I couldn't believe how good it was, I think I liked it better than Episode Seven to be honest.
yeah me too, its funny cause its not even part of the main movies.
Yeah really, but it leaves me hopeful for the other in between movies, like the one about Han Solo.
True and it got me even more hyped for Episode Eight.
Comes out in December though of course so we have a long wait.
Yeah unfortunately, I can't wait for it.
