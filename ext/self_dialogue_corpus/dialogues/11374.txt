So, you're a big Beatles fan, right?
Yeah, I like a lot of their stuff.
Cool, I was reading some trivia the other day and thought it might interesting you.
Lay it on me, although, I might already know it... hehe.
Okay.. check, the song "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" a lot of people think is about drugs, but one it's actually based on a picture Lennon's son drew at like age four or so of his classmates.  They were like, "What is this?" And he said, "That's Lucy!  She's in the sky with diamonds!"
Yes, I've heard that.  That was Lennon's son Julian, actually.  Supposedly, he inspired two other Beatles songs.
Oh, really? Which ones?
I believe "Hey Jude" and "Good Night."
Oh, that's neat!
Yeah, sadly, John and Julian's mother got divorced when the boy was five. After that, Julian says John didn't have much contact with him.
