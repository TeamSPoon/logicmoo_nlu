Have you heard Lady Gaga's new song?
No, I haven't heard it yet. What is it called?
It's called "The Cure."
I'll have to look it up. Is it good?
I think it's good. It's different from what I am used to hearing from her.
What do you mean by that? I know her last album was kind of country.
I heard people say that, but I didn't hear anything from her last album besides that song "Million Reasons."
I didn't care for that one too much. She has a great voice, but I don't get what she was trying to do. She's not a country artist.
Anyway, her new song is different from that. She's back to doing pop music.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that. So what is it about?
It's like a love song I guess. It's about how love is the cure for everything.
Is it a dance song?
Not really. It's not as uptempo as "Born This Way" or "Poker Face." It's a little slower.
"Poker Face" was one of my favorite songs by her.
I know! Me too. I wish she would make more songs like that.
Well she's probably trying to do new things. You know artists like to change their style every once in awhile.
I know. I don't like when they change too much though. Like, I really loved her first cd the most.
That was my favorite too. After that, she was kind of hit or miss for me.
This new song might be a miss.
Well I will look it up on youtube and let you know what I think.
