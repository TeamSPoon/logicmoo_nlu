Do you Baby Face?
I like him more as a producer than an artist.
What? His first album Tender Lover was the bomb.
Yeah, it was good, but I like what he did with the Boomerang Soundtrack.
Boomerang was pretty much the discovery of Toni Braxton.
I know. Toni Braxton is one of my favorites.
I like Unbreak My Heart.
I like He Wasn't Man Enough For Me.
I do too. Every time I play it I want to blast it but I don't want my neighbors thinking I'm gay.
Man you crazy. I play my music loud and don't care what my neighbors think.
I do too but I like to sing the words if I know them. The words aren't written for a man.
Music is art. I don't care. I sing along if I want.
I know that's right.
Every time they play Salt and Peppa on the radio I sing along.
Which song?
I'll Take Your Man.
That's crazy because I know all the words to that one.
I be singing and thinking about that scene from Beauty Shop.
You talking about when they be in the salon and the dude be singing it word for word with flair?
I know that's right. Too funny.
