What do you feel is the most overrated NCAA conference in basketball?
Mens or womens?
Mens of course. The womens are all the same.
Again, you're sexist. I'd have to say the American conference.
What? Why?
Well, their two premiere teams are usually Cincinnati and UConn, neither of whom have done anything in a while
UConn just won the title a few years ago!
True, but that was as a 7-seed. They haven't been dominant.
Elaborate.
Well, the past few years has seen Memphis, Houston, ECU, UConn, and Cincinnati all being highly-ranked, and temple being respected as well.
So?
Well, with the exception of UConn, no one has done well on the national stage. They play well, then bomb in the tournament.
Yeah, that's true, Their non-conference schedules are weak as well.
So, your choice?
Big Ten for sure.
Why?
Well, everyone keeps saying they're one of the strongest because of MSU, Wisconsin, and OSU's recent strong seasons, but no titles.
Well, Wisconsin was robbed against Duke, that's pretty much been proven.
Yeah. Indiana and Maryland are also supposed to be strong schools but always fade in the tournament.
It's like the Big Ten and American are great regular-season conferences, but awful in the tournament.
