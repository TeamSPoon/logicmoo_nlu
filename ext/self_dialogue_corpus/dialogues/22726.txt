Did you ever see that movie "Moonstruck"?
I'm not sure, who was in it?
It had Nicholas Cage and Cher.
Oh yeah, that was a great movie, although kind of silly.
Yeah, we actually used that movie in our English class in college.
How would that be used in a class?
We watched the movie and would have to point out the symbolisms and write about them.
Oh wow, that's actually a pretty neat idea.
Yeah, at first I didn't like it but as it went on, I was so glad that the professor chose to teach us about symbolism that we might miss.
Yeah you can't be a good writer if you don't know the reason behind the object, person, action, etc.
Exactly right, and it really taught me a lot.
So give me an example of something from that movie that was symbolic.
Ok, so of course the movie revolved around the title "Moonstruck" and the song about when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie.
That's amore!
So one morning we see Loretta making Ron some french toast with a poached egg in the middle.
Right, I remember that because I tried it for breakfast after watching that movie.
Well, the egg inside the toast represented the moon.
Right, but what was the significance of that?
In the beginning, everyone was obsessed with death, but the moon brought them all together and gave them life and love again.
The moon connected them all, I never even thought about that.
