What do you think about the movie Mean Girls, have you seen it?
I have, I think is hilarious and one of the best teen movies out there.
I agree, I just loved the whole scenario, you can feel like it is all real.
You are so right! Who are the main actresses on the movie?
Lindday Lohan is the main actress and the other mean girls are: Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert. Also featuring Tina Fey.
Oh wow! It did have an all star cast. Who was the meanest of the mean girls?
Without doubt it was Rachel McAdams, she nailed her part.
Oh yeah! You are right, I remember now.
I believe Rachel McAdams has been in several movies after that, do you remember some?
Of course! She became very popular, she was in the Notebook, the Vow, About Time, The Time Traveler´s Wife, Midnight in Paris, Morning Glory. etc.
She has so many. Don´t you think is funny how she did two different movies where her co-star was a time traveling guy.
Yes! You are right, I found this to be very odd. I think I liked About Time more, less sad.
Yes me too!. There is another movie that you did not mention that I really like, is called The Family Stone.
I have not seen it. What is it about? Is it good?
Oh you have to see it, it´s hilarious, it´s about a family and their internal problems, all the kids are all grown up.
Oh I see. Who else is in the movie?
You have Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Claire Danes, Luke Wilson, Craig T. Nelson, etc.
Oh wow! no wonder it´s good, it has an all star cast!.
Yes it does! Sarah Jessica Parker does a fantastic role in it. Would you like to watch it tomorrow with me?
You do not have to ask me twice. I´ll bring the popcorn.
