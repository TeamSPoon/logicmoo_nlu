I am amazed at the number of singers who sung or sing message music.
I believe it's called artistic creation and alot of singers are guilty of it.
I'm thinking of BIllie Holliday and her song called "Strange Fruit."
That song was about lynching wasn't it?
Yes. Did you know she was a heroin addict?
Yeah, I know from the movie "Lady Sings The Blues" that Diana Ross starred in.
Ray Charles is still one of my favorite singers and he recorded a song called "Let's Go Get Stoned."
He was a heroin addict also and made some of the best music.
Rap stars like Jamie Foxx sampled his song "I Got A Woman Way Across Town."
I remember that! Kanye West did a rap over the song's music didn't he?
Yes. Do you know anything about Jimi Hendrix?
He was one of the best electric guitar players that ever lived.
He was a heroin addict also. If I'm not mistaken he died of an overdose a while back.
The Beatles recorded a song titled "Lucy In The Sky Of Diamonds" that was a song about drugs.
What? Oh you changed the subject on me. (laughs)
You said musicians put messages in their music. That song is about-
LSD. Lucy In The Sky Of Diamonds. Rick James made song about drugs too.
Mary Jane. I didn't know that song was about marijuana when it was out.
A lot of people missed that message completely.
Man you learn something new about music everyday don't you.
