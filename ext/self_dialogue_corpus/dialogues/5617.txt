Who is your favorite Disney hero?
Robin Hood
He is really funny. I like his character.
Him and Little John are a great duo.
Who is another one you like?
Aladdin.
He is good too.
Robin Hood is great though. He has that memorable hat and bow.
That is true. That is an underrated Disney film.
Yes, it is. So is The Sword in the Stone.
