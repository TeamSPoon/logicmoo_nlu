Have you ever thought about where NFL teams got their names?
Not too much but some have interesting names.
The Atlanta Falcons solicited team names from fans to pick its name. Now it has the nickname dirty birds too.
Do you know how the Browns got their name?
They were named after their first coach Paul Brown.
That is quite an honor. The Cincinatti Bengals were almost named the Buckeyes.
I did not know that. The original Browns franchise moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens.
The Ravens were named after the Edgar Allen Poe poem.
Most NFL team names were chosen based on fan submissions.
They built fan loyalty from the start.
The Buffalo Bills name was picked from a fan contest.
Were they named after Buffalo Bill? The cowboy?
Yes they were! Pretty cool name huh?
That is a good name.
The Chicago Bears name was based on their baseball team the Chicago Cubs.
That is true. Both teams played at Wrigley Field when the franchise first started.
The Detroit Lions were originally called the Spartans.
Maybe they should have kept that name. They may have won more games.
You have jokes!
I like some laughs with my football.
