So are you ready for NFL to start up?
Whoa, is it already that time of the year?
Well, not until September, but that's pretty close now!
Huh, I honestly hadn't been keeping track. Not after my team's performance last year.
Who's your team?
Carolina Panthers.
Oh. Ouch. Yeah, they haven't played well since they were in the Super Bowl.
Cam's still quite the rookie; he's either good or he's just bad.
That's true. And he's basically the only star player, I can't think of anyone else on the team.
Well, we got Julius Peppers on our defensive end. He's good in a pinch.
I forgot about him. Funny name, but a good player.
I'd like to think that this is the year we get our act together, but I won't hold my breath.
In the meantime, I can always count on my team!
Oh, please tell me you're not a Patriots fan.
You know it! Tom Brady is the man.
I'm so ready for him to retire already.
You're just jelly because we win all the time.
And cheat, Mr. DeflateGate! And get away with it!
Okay, I will admit that his punishment was a little light.
If a little light means they didn't even barely slap him on the hand, then yes.
