So now that I'm a little heavier, where should I shop for fashion?
Lane Bryant created the first modern maternity dresses, and her company's ads were the first to mention pregnancy. What a scandal!
But isn't her stuff kind of matronly?
Not really. But try Torrid if you want sexy things in Plus Sizes.
Well, no, I don't really want sexy, exactly. Just some interesting clothes.
Try Modcloth then. They use real women in their ads, and carry a full size range of vintage and indie clothing.
But aren't they part of WalMart now?
They're an independent part of of a subsidiary. But if you like cute clothes, you won't care.
I dont want to shop online, though, I want to try things on in the store. And I dont want to overspend.
You might like Forever 21, then. Although it's mostly young looks, they do carry a full range of sizes.
Their prices are pretty good? Money's tight.
Very good, sometimes. But you know, it's fast fashion, not the classics.
Sounds good. Have you got more stores like that?
There's Topshop. They're actually an English brand, but they sell over here too.
And they have my size?
Yes. And looks you won't find anywhere else.
Well, thanks for your help. Shopping can be depressing when you're overweight.
Are you kidding? You look fine.
Then why can't I find fashion I like?
Sweetie, the average woman is a plus size. They do make clothes for us--they have to.
