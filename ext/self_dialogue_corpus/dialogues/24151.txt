What are you doing later tonight?
No plans actually. Why?
Wanna catch a movie?
Sure! What did you have in mind?
Well, I have a Netflix subscription!
Cool! There's a few movies on there I've been wanting to see.
Awesome. What ones?
Well... I'm pretty into romantic comedies, so there's a bunch.
Yeah there's a good amount of romanctic comedies on Netflix.
Have you ever seen The Breakup?
I haven't, but it looks funny!
It is! Its kind of an older movie, but it's still good.
Really? When did it come out?
I don't remember exactly. Probably 10 years ago or so.
Wow, time flies!
Haha yeah it does.
The late 2000s were a great time for romantic comedies actually.
Yeah it was!
But the 80s were probably best.
I totally agree!
