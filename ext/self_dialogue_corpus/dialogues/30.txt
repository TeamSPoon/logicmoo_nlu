Logan was absolutely amazing.
I know!  I'm a huge fan of all the X-Men movies.  Hugh Jackman has been a great Wolverine.
I thought they had kind of done him to death actually because he was the only one that got an Origins movie and then they made that movie Wolverine.
That one wasn't good to be honest.  His origin story was ok but they messed up a lot of parts.
You really need to give Logan a chance.  They finally went R rated and it's awesome!
I'll give it a shot.  I really need to rewatch all the X Men movies.  How do you feel about this reboot they're doing?
I'm ok with it.  Some of the casting isn't great. Jennifer Lawrence isn't a great casting for Mystique.
No, I don' think she really fit in.  She's just so in demand right now.
Now, Marvel they've got their casting right for sure.
Definitely Robert Downey Jr definitely is a great Iron Man.  Plus you got Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.
