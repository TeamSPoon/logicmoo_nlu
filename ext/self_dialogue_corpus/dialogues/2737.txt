Has the league ever had this many good receivers?
Seems like it's a very deep group of players.
You could probably make a case for 4 or 5 guys being the best.
Not sure it would go that high, but there's some great ones for sure.
Alright, so who's your #1?
He had a breakout year last year and he's uncoverable.
Ok.  And who is that?
Julio Jones.  He was outstanding last year.
I can buy that.  Probably his best year ever.
It helps that Matt Ryan had his best year so Jones was able to capitalize.
He's just so big, I mean how do you cover that?
It's kind of the problem that they used to have with Calvin Johnson in his prime.
I might give the edge to Antonio Brown there.
Over Julio?  Nah, but he'd probably be my #2.
Nobody runs routes like Brown and his speed burns everyone.
I feel like Julio does the same, but is four inches taller.
Brown is more quick.  He jumps in his cuts much better.
Whereas Jones is probably the better red zone target.
All I'm saying is I'm throwing a hail mary, it's going to Brown.
And for me, Julio's grabbing that sucker in traffic.
