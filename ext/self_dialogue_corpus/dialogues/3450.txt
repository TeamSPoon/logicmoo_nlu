Have you ever seen the Exorcist?
Yes, that movie gave me nightmares.
One of the scariest and most shocking movies ever made.
Yeah, that poor little girl being made to do and say those awful things.
And the misty breath when it was freezing during the exorcism.
Definitely one of the greatest horror movies ever made.
It was easily in the top 3.  Not fancy with the special effects either.
Nope, just creepy voices.  It's a wonderful day for an exorcism.
I know that part gives me chills.
Also the soup puke was pretty gross.
