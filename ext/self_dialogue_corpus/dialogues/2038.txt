How about them Steelers?!
I love the Steelers, but they are going to have to wait until Tom Brady retires to win again.
Yeah, the Patriots have our number for sure.
I'm unsure about the Falcons this season. I think they had their one shot and blew it.
Maybe! That loss in the Super Bowl last year probably stings.
Yeah. Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl again?
I'm not sure. The NFC has so many good teams.
Totally. It's definitely the stronger division.
AFC is good, too. Watch out for the Raiders this season.
Definitely. They got robbed last year.
I still don't see them making it past the Patriots or Steelers in the playoffs.
We'll never know. Hopefully they can redeem themselves this season.
I see Colin Kaepernick still hasn't been signed.
This country wants to talk about rights and freedom but blackballs a guy for exercising his rights.
There are a number of teams I could see him being the starter on.
Yeah, like the team he was already on.
Yeah. I wanted to have high hopes for the Browns this year but I don't think I can.
They had a good draft this year.
Yeah, but it's the Browns.
True indeed. Good point.
