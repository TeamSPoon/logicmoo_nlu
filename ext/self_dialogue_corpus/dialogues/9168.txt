So best rock band? Led Zeppelin or the Stones?
Gotta be Led Zeppelin. Or maybe the stones? What day is it?
Gotta love the Stones. Best Stones album?
What's the one with Sympathy?
Beggars Banquet. Great album. Love in Vain.
Great song. Street Fighting Man is my favorite summer song.
Really? That's an odd choice.
What's a poor boy to do? Just love the song in the car windows open.
I think I like Exile on Main Street best. There's just so much going on there.
I love Sweet Virginia. Great country-rock song. They could play all rock. Yeah. It's Saturday's children for me today.
