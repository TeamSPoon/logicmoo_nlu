What do you think about Tony Jefferson joining the Ravens?
Well last season resulted in a Pro Bowl selection so I'm sure they think he's a good fit.
Well from a defensive standpoint I think the team suits him well.
I personally think it's too soon to tell but I hope he's happy with the move.
You didn't see him on Total Access the other day?
I caught a bit of the interview but I missed the majority of it.
Oh you should of see it. I thought it was a good interview.
What did he say?
Well he talked about how well the team defense fits his personal style of play.
One thing I've noticed from his play is he like to cover.
Yeah, he was literally Arizona's swiss-army knife on defense. He did everything well.
Well I'm sure he's going to do well, i can't really see him failing unless the tam holds him back somehow.
What kind of things do you think the team would do to hold him back.
Anything that would force him to play out of his comfort zone is enough in my opinion.
I don't see the Ravens doing that to him.
I don't either, It would be a dumb move overall on their part.
Absolutely agree with you there.
Do you think he will carry his team to the super bowl?
It's really hard to tell but I wont say it's impossible.
I wouldn't say it's impossible either.
