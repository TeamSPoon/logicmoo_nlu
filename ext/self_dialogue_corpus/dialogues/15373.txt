I'm falling in love with this new Mika album.
I haven't heard anything from him in a while.
He's been very subtle as of late. The new album is great.
Is it true he worked with Madonna?
They worked together, but on her album MDNA.
I didn't buy MDNA. Was it any good?
It was okay, but not really up to Madonna's standards.
I did buy her new one, Rebel Heart.
Rebel Heart is a much better album with lots of good material.
Well she worked with the right people, I think.
I think she worked with Kanye.
She worked with Kanye and Aviici and Natalia Kills I think.
Who would have that Kanye could do such a good job producing?
Well have you heard My Dark Twisted Fantasy?
I've only heard that Monster single with Nicki Minaj and Jay-Z and Bon Iver on it.
He did an amazing job on that record. He's a good producer.
I believed it once I heard Madonna's record.
I hope she releases another album soon.
I think she needs to take a break for a while and come back with something slower and more serious.
That would be heavenly.
