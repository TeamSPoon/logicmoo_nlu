What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?
Easy, easy, easy. The Shining, it's such a classic.
Right on. Jack Nicholson is absolutely mad and it's based on a Steven King book.
I remember watching as a kid and having nightmares.
Do you remember what was in the nighmares?
Yes, those twins on the bicycles and of course REDRUM.
I watched it a little later than you I'm guessing, probably 15 or 16, so it was less scary, but my dad told me to watch out for REDRUM.
Did that make it easy for you to understand that it spelled MURDER when you reversed it?
Ha! No, not at all, he had to make that connection for me.
Yeah, I can see how one might get fixated on the RUM part.
