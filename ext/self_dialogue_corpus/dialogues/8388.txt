Were you a Backstreet Boys and an N'sync fan?
Totally N'sync, although I quietly like Backstreet Boys too.
Me too, crazy how you could only declare to be a fan on one because high school works that way!
Seriously, how silly kids can be especially when it comes to pop music.
What's even crazier is that one guy was the writer for both albums.
Really?  Who is that?
Max Martin, he is literally behind a huge number of top 40 pop hits for the last two decades.
Who else did he work with?
He has written songs for Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Pink, Beyonc√©, Bon Jovi, and a ton more.
Wow, he is a king of pop for sure.
