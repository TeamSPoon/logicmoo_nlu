You ready for those Cowboys?
Of course! They have a really good shot this year.
Dak Prescott almost led them to the Super Bowl last year.
He had a great season.
It was still a shame to see Romo injured again.
Probably a good thing he retired this year.
Any idea what he is going to do in retirement?
I heard Romo is going to be a broadcaster for CBS.
Are there any other big names retiring this year?
Jay Cutler and Mike Vick are both retiring.
Those guys haven't been relevant in years.
I agree but they were star players at one time.
That is true. Mike Vick was a dual threat in Atlanta.
That guy could run the ball.
Do you think Dez Bryant will have a good season.
I think so. He is one of my favorite players.
I would love to visit Dallas's stadium.
I plan on going next season. I have to save up for tickets.
I bet Jerry Jones has made his money back.
I am sure he has. They sold out most of their games last year.
