The Wonder Woman movie looks really good.
I don't really like DC movies.
Suicide Squad I could understand, but you don't like Man of Steel?
It was okay. Didn't much care for Batman v Superman either.
Let me guess, you like Marvel films?
Ha, no. I don't care for superhero pictures in general.
Has there ever been a superhero movie you really liked?
I remember enjoying Spawn when it first came out. It probably doesn't hold up anymore.
Yeah, the CGI in that movie looks so bad now.
Most '90s movies that used CGI look bad now.
Not Jurassic Park.
Jurassic Park didn't use much CGI. But even the CGI it did use doesn't look that good anymore.
Wait, I know! The Phantom Menace!
Really? That's your argument for good '90s CGI?
I mean, things like Jar-Jar don't hold up, but like the battle droids and ships and stuff still look nice almost 20 years later.
Alright, maybe, but you also have to remember that Star Wars had like, a hundred million more dollars in its budget compared to Spawn.
Money isn't everything. Plenty of low-budget films look good.
Like what? Name one.
The original Star Wars.
Ha! I should've seen that coming!
