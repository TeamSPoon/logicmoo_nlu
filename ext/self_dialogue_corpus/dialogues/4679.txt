Did you see the scuffle between Joey Bats and the Braves?
Yeah I saw it, Jose getting into it again.
What do you think about his bat flip?
I think it was dumb of him to do when they were losing, but the Braves should not been butthurt about it.
The next game The Braves hit Joey in the thigh deliberately.
Well, I hope it angered Jose and motivated him to hit another dinger.
I agree with you, bro. Braves will continue to be wussies.
True. Every Brave except Bartolo haha.
Bartolo Colon truly is big sexy.
I hope he stays in the league forever.
Yeah, dude. We need to see him hit another bomb.
Hope he starts when the Braves come over to AT&T Park later this month.
Me too! I'm down to going if he pitches. You down as well?
Yep, definitely! Haven't been to a game all year!
Sweet. I'll hit you up if I hear any more about the series.
Hope Giants can turn things around fast.
Yep. They are really struggling.
The last series with the Reds and Dodgers wasn't bad though.
True. They've got the Cards coming up. You think they'll win the series?
They should be able to. Or else I will be disappointed.
