What's your favorite Tarantino movie?
I don't know, they're all so good.
I know what you mean, but I have a definite favorite.
Okay, I'm gonna guess Pulp Fiction, his first big hit.
Nope, it happens to be Jackie Brown.
Jackie Brown? Tarantino didn't even like that one.
Oh, I think he did. He just realized that it was terribly unpopular, for a Tarantino flick, so he didn't make another like it.
Really.
That's what I read. But it's a great film. Takes its plot from Rum Punch, written by Elmore Leonard, and offers a wonderful female lead.
And I heard he called it Jackie Brown to play off Foxy Brown, the character Pam Grier had played years before.
Right. It's Foxy Brown after the years started getting to her. I don't know why she didn't get an Oscar.
I think Robert Forster did.
Yep. And Brigit Fonda is fabulous as the pothead princess.
Plus Michael Keaton, Robert DeNiro, and the amazing Samuel L. Jackson.
A true villain! Yet funny.
And Elmore Leonard supposedly said it was the best screenplay ever made from one of his books.
Yet nobody seemed to like it. As a Tarantino film, anyway.
Too subtle?
Maybe. Too sensitive maybe. A criminal hero, who is a middle-aged African American.
Too good. He never made another like it.
