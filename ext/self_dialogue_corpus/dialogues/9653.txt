Man, what's with all these mumble rappers on the radio like Future and Lil Uzi Vert?
Yeah man, I can never understand what any of them are saying in their songs.
Remember music like The Fugees and Mobb Deep? Whatever happened to good rap music?
Speaking of Mobb Deep, did you hear that Prodigy just died?
No way, I didn't know that! Do they know what happened to him?
Yeah, he was battling sickle cell anemia for years. Sad to see a legend like him pass.
Tell me about it man. The Infamous is probably one of my favorite rap albums of all time.
That's definitely a classic man, I've had it on repeat all day after hearing the news.
I'll make sure to pour out a 40 for him after I go to the liquor store. Rest in peace to the legend.
Totally man, come over. We'll have a couple beers and listen to some of his music in his honor.
