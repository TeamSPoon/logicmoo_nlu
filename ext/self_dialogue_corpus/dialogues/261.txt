These new Avengers movies are getting out of hand.
Yes, the whole thing is getting way overplayed.
I enjoyed the first movies in the series like Iron Man.
They seem fresh when they are just getting started.
If they are going to bring all of the superheroes together then there needs to be more character development.
There should be more emphasis on the relationships in the script.
Too many of these Avenger movies end up being too dependent upon special effects.
There is definitely a dearth of good script writing in these movies.
Iron Man had a good script and Robert Downey really brought to life a fresh new character.
He did a great job in the first one, but then went off on the character too far.
