What's your favorite A Tribe Called Quest song?
It's gotta be "Get a Hold" off of Beats, Rhymes and Life.
That's a really great song. The beat is crazy.
Yeah, that's a J Dilla beat, and do you know the sample?
Nah, what is it?
The sample is taken from a song called "The Visit" by a band named The Cyrkle.
That's interesting. How did you find out about that?
I saw Benji B talking about it in a YouTube video.
It's interesting to learn where hip-hop samples come from.
Yeah, I've always enjoyed tracking that stuff down.
