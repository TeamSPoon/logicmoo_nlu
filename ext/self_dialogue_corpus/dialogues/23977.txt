Which superhero’s movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe do you like the most?
Of course, it’s the original superhero that started it all!
Do you mean Iron Man?
Yes! Iron Man started the MCU we all know and love!
I agree! Without him, none of this would of happened.
The acting is also great. Robert Downey Jr. is just the best.
He is such a good actor! I’m glad he was able to make a come back.
Me too! Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark and that’s final!
It’s like he was made for the position.
Yes! I can’t imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark.
Which Iron Man movie is your favorite?
They are all good, it’s so hard to chose just one.
I know, but just pick which movie you thought was the best.
If I had to choose, I guess I would pick Iron Man 3.
Why Iron Man 3?
I really loved the evolution of his suits. But we also go to see a human side to Tony Stark because of his PTSD.
Yeah the beginning made me sad.
I also thought the airplane scene was awesome.
That was my favorite!
I can’t believe he did all that without even getting in the suit!
