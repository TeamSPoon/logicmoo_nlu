So, who is your favorite band?
I think my all time favorite is The Pixies.
Oh yeah, I like them a lot too.
As soon as I heard them, I knew they were amazing.
I know Frank Black has an incredible voice!
Who is your favorite band?
I gotta go with Tool.
Wow. Good call.
I've listened to them for forever it seems like.
They have been around a really long time.
They really have stood the test of time.
Have you ever seen them live?
Only every time they come around.
Wow. That's dedication!
The only thing better than listening to Tool cds, is seeing them live.
I've been to a few of their shows, they are pretty mind blowing.
Exactly. You never know what you're going to see when you go.
I remember one of their shows I was at, they had people hanging from the rafters, dancing in front of the screens!
I was totally at that show!
Wow! Small world, huh?
