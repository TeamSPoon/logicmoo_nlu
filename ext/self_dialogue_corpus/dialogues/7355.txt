So what is your wedding song going to be?
"You got a friend in me" from Toy Story.
I love that! Toy Story was my favorite movie growing up.
Yea mine too. It was actually the first movie me and him watched together. He even let me write Andy on the bottom of his foot.
That's adorable. Which one of you is more like buzz and which one is more like woody?
Oh he's definitely more Buzz that I am.
Yea I could totally see that. I typically date guys who are like Sid.
Haha you make a good point there.
I used to always try to get my parents to take me to Pizza Planet even though they don't exist.
Haha me too.
