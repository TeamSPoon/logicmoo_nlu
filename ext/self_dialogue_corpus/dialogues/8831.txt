What kind of rock music do you like?
I like AC/DC and Metallica.
I'm more of a Megadeth fan myself.
Did you know Dave Mustaine used to play guitar for Metallica?
I didn't know that.
They kicked him out because of his excessive drinking.
That must have been really bad considering it was Metallica.
Yeah, there was animosity for years, but they seem to be on good terms now.
Age mellows us all.
Indeed.
