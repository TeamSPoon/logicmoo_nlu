Whats your favorite comedy movie?
Probably the movie Ghostbusters.
Oh my god, that movie is great!
I know right? I watch it once a week at least.
Jeez, really that often?
Yeah, when is the last time you saw it?
Probably over a month ago, haha.
Dang, do you not watch movies often?
No, I really don't have much time to during the week.
Well that's a shame. You should get more free time to enjoy the simpler things in life.
I agree, maybe I will look into it.
Another great movie you could watch is Ghostbusters 2.
Ghostbusters 2? I had no idea they even made a second one, haha.
Yeah! They did, and its just as good as the first.
I'm definitely going to have to set a movie day for me and the kids.
The kids will love it for sure.
Bill Murray has always been able to make kids laugh one way or another.
Yes, he really has.
He has such comedic talent.
I know, he is such a great actor.
