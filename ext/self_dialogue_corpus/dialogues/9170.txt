Godsmack. They still around?
You know what. I'm not sure.
I must not be the only one to not know. Last hit I remember was years ago.
Some time around 2010. Good Day to Die is the last one I remember.
Same here. Last one I remember also.
They are a band I miss. They had some great music.
Their slower, spiritual songs seemed to be their best hits. Although, I liked their more heavy stuff as well.
Definitely. Voodoo and Serenity were their greatest hits. Almost spiritual feeling you get when you listen to those songs.
Yes. Something about the beat to the songs.
You are making me nostalgic and taking me back to the early 2000s.
