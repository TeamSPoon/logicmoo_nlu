Which Fast & Furious character do you like out of all the movies?
Well my favorite Character of all the Fast and Furious Characters is Paul Walker. Broke my heart when he passed.
Yeah mine too such a tragedy to loose a fellow cast member in real life.
Despite the tragedy , the Fast and Furious movies are really good. I mean they gross 207.3 million USD on their very first of the trilogy .
Rob Cohen really knew what he was doing with the story line to capture an audience.
I heard they got a 53% on rotten tomatoes critics, for Fast and the Furious.
Really honestly after Fate and the Furious will there be anymore Furious movies?
Don't get your ducks in a row, but their just might be a Fast and the Furious 9.
You really think so I will be excited but now too excited like now they are dragging it!
Dragging it or not I am confident they will make sales Rob Cohen is a good director. he will capture the audience.
