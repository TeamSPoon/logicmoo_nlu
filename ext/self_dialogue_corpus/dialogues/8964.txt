Hey do you remember The New Kids on the Block.
Yea, ha ha. My daughter loved them!
Oh mine too.  What was that hit of theirs?
They had many but I think you mean The Right Stuff.
That was it. Yea I remember a few more, Step by Step and Hanging Tough.
I hear they are on tour again. All grown up now.
I heard that. My daughter told me.
Well that is one band I do not want to spend my money on.
Neither do I!
I guess they are a good teeny bopper band.
