Have you heard of any good horror movies coming out?
yeah, actually there are a lot of sequels to recent horror movies coming out. Movies that I thought were good.
You never know, with sequels though.
That is true, but there are plenty of originals too.
Tell me the sequels first?
OK, based off this [picture I've seen on social media; purge 4, orphan 2, mama 2, wrong turn 7, lights out 2, saw 8, scream 5, jeepers creepers 3, annabelle 2, conjuring 3, insidious 4, and a few other older comebacks too.
Whoa, there's so many sequels and you said more?
Terminator vs. predator, cult of chucky, and there's a new Halloween movie too, also a remake of IT.
What are some of the new originals?
The Nun, Heidi, phoenix forgotten, and......SLENDERMAN!!!
no way!!! a slenderman movie?
I know right?
the remake of IT seems like it could be really good too. The previews for the Nun freaked me out as well.
I also would like to recommend some movies I found while googling for other movies recently.
Sure.
I was watching trailers on youtube and found The pet; was a movie from a few decades ago that was remade last year and It looks like a pretty intense psychological thriller. There was actually a surprising amount of horror movies that received little to no recognition that looked really good.
Anything REALLY DARK?
Like Human Centipede dark?
yeah!
I suggest the movie titled: A Serbian Film.
