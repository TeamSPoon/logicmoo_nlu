So what did you think about Fast & Furious 7 ?
That's the one where Paul Walker was still alive right ?
Yea he was able to act for some of the movie, his brother had to do the rest with the help of CGI.
Wow, I couldn't even tell that it wasn't Paul himself acting.
Yes, the movie was done so well a long with the outstanding acting from the crew.
Yep, so who was you're favorite character in the movie ?
Well if i'm being honest it would be Paul.
Me too, it's sad he passed away.
What do you think about their decision about containing the series ?
I think that it was a great spot to stop at in the story-line and with Paul gone,but we'll have to see how it goes.
