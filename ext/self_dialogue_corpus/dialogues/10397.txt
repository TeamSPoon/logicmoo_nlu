Hi, guy.
Hi, What's up?
I wondered if you've ever heard of Deanna Durbin?
No, who's that?
She was this amazingly popular singer and actress from the forties that nobody has ever heard of today.
Huh! What was she in?
There was a really funny one called "It Started With Eve". She pretends to be Bob Cummings's fiancee because his dad is dying. But then the dad gets well, oops.
I know Bob Cummings. He can be funny.
Yeah, he's really caught in the middle here. He set up the impersonation to give his dad a happy last moment, but then what does he do?
Anyway, so what about this Durbin woman?
Well, she wants to get out of the situation, but comes to like the father and doesn't want to disillusion him.
That sounds pretty trite.
You'd think so, but the thing about Deanna Durbin is that she makes it all seem really fresh.
You seem to have really developed a crush on her!
Yeah, well, maybe. It's just so odd to me that she could have been such a big name and be almost unremembered now.
I guess. Under the old studio system, the actors were a lot more like commodities. Even big stars sometimes had to do two or three movies in a year.
It's true, I guess there were probably a lot of actors that everybody recognized then but we don't know now.
I read somewhere that they almost cast Ronald Reagan as Rick in "Casablanca."
Naw, that's a myth. They were considering George Raft, though.
Wow, that would have been strange.
