Do you think the Dallas Cowboys can make it to the Superbowl this season?
I think they have a very good chance if Dez Bryant can stay healthy along with Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott.
That's such a solid core they have right there. I was so impressed by both Ezekiel and Dak's rookie season showing.
They both exceeded expectations that's why the Cowboys were so good last season.
I know they were so mature for their age.
At the start of last season I thought the Cowboys were done for after Tony Romo got hurt.
It did look pretty bleak, but Dak came in and looked like a seasoned veteran!
I think their coach Jason Garrett did a fine job in easing him into the quarterback role.
They didn't put a lot of pressure on him so he had time to settle into the role, I agree.
Having Ezekiel play so well helped out a lot! Don't forget that.
Sometimes I still wonder if Ezekiel is that good, or if the Dallas Cowboy's offensive line is just that dominating.
I think it's a combination of both.
That's true you can't be an effective running back with a poor offensive line but you also need a running back with good vision, speed, and strength to make your offensive line look good too.
You also need a down field threat and a competent quarterback. Dallas had all those ingredients that's why their season last year was so successful.
I'm excited to see them this year with that season of experience under their belts.
I think we're going to see a resurrection soon of the great Jimmy Johnson Cowboys of the past in the form of the current team.
I can see that. Ezekiel would be Emmitt Smith reborn, Dez Bryant as Michael Irvin, Dak as the new Troy Aikman.
What's amazing is Jason Witten would still be Jason Witten!
That's not right. Jason Witten came into the league drafted by the Cowboys in 2003! That's after great Cowboys era!
Oh yeah, you're right I forgot about that. It just seems like Jason Witten has been around forever!
