Do you like Bruce Sprigstien?
Love the Boss.
You know why I ask?  I didn't used to like him but as I get older I like him more and more.
That's because his songs are so much about struggle.
I know what you mean.  You just kind of get lost in that rolling style and his lyrics.
Like Dancing in the Dark.
Or Born to Run.
He could be described as an acquired taste.
I heard he's awesome in concert.
I heard the same thing.  He just goes and goes.
I'd like to see him in concert.  I bet it's pricey though.
You know, I've never checked.
I actually heard he was up for a best concert award this year.
At his age?  Wow that shows how good of performer the really is.
Yeah, seems they don't make them like that anymore.
Cliche but true.
So favorite song from the Boss?
Born in the USA.
Yeah, that was good.
It just paints this real picture of American life.
