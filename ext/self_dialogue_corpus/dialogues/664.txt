The summer is so boring without football!
I agree, not too long until NFL training camps start.
What is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Bears, but they have been bad lately.
Well at least Jay Cutler is gone.
Yeah he was bad.  What team do you like?
I like the Dallas Cowboys.
They had a great season last year.
Yep until that playoff game with the Packers.
That game was insane.  I think they were down 25 points.
Something like that, and then Rodgers made that ridiculous scramble and pass.
Yes that was a great game for the last 3 quarters.
I just hope Dak Prescott is the real deal.
He seems to be, and so does Elliot the running back.
Which game was crazier the Cowboys and Packers, or Patriots and Falcons?
Tough call, but I have to go with the Super Bowl comeback by the Patriots.
Yes I think so too.  Can't believe how Atlanta collapses.
They'll have a tough time forgetting that debacle.
Good thing is ther are a young team.
Yes they are.  Their fans should have some good football to watch in Atlanta for years to come.
