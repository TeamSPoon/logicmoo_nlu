I just introduce the wife to the Big Lebowski.
What did she think.
Loved it!
Who doesn't!
Best Jeff Bridges movie, by a long shot.
Agreed. The Dude....Ha!
I know! He's such a great character.
I love the part when he's talking to Samuel Elliot at the bar.
The cowboy?
Yeah.
Why does that tickle you so much.
Because I can't tell if he's calling him dude because he knows him or that's just what cowboys say.
That is pretty funny. My favorite is John Goodman.
He's soooo angry.
That's why its so funny.
"I don't roll on Shabas!"
"Shut up Donnie!"
Poor Donnie.
He never gets in a word edgewise.
To funny!
