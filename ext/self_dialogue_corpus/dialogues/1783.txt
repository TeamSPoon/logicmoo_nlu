What are you looking forward to most about this NFL year?
I want to see if the Falcons will bounce back after last year's loss.
Oh yeah that was wild. i wonder if that tore them apart.
I think they'll be good, but not as good.
yeah they are in a tough division.
I think the Steelers and Raiders could make some noise.
Oh yeah I'm amazed how much money Derek carr got on his new contract.
yeah if only he could play every game in warm weather though. He's so bad in the cold.
I wonder who else will be good.
Maybe the Chiefs or Broncos.
What about some NFC teams?
I think the Giants may bounce back this year.
They always have a chance with Eli Manning.
What about the Saints?
I think they can score with Brees but they don't play much defense.
Defense wins championships for sure.
What rookie is going to be good?
I think McCaffey down in Carolina will be good.
Oh yeah he'll help them a lot.
yeah they need someone to help Cam newton.
