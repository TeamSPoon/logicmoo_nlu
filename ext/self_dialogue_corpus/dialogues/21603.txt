Do you want to go out to a movie? Wonder Woman looks good.
No, too busy and too expensive. Beside, i always get stuck behind someone with a beehive hairdo.
Well, let's rent something. There's a Redbox rental by the Pizza Hut. I think they have the new Mummy movie with Tom Cruise.
Redbox? You mean physically rent a DVD?
Yeah, man. What's wrong with that?
Dude, I've not had a DVD player for five years. What am I? A savage?
Can you stream anything thing?
Can I stream? This is my domain. I've got Netflix, the Apple Store, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, Showtime---
Crackle? Do you have Crackle?
No, I don't have Crackle. What movie is on Crackle that you want to see?
I don't know. I feel like a classic. Something I don't have to use my brain.
Classic it is.  What's a movie that when it's on TV, you can't scroll past? You're stuck on it once you've seen five seconds of it?
Let's see . . . Shawshank Redemption. Pulp Fiction. Uhh, the one with the guy . . . .
The "one with the guy"? That's only every movie. How about really old. Like Film Noir.
Yes, a black and white classic.  Maybe a murder mystery. You know, the darker side of Hollywood.
How about "Crime, Inc." with Tom Neal?
"Crime, Inc."? Is it a murder mystery?
1945, crime, noir, Hollywood . . . my bet is there's some murder going on.
The description says it's about a reporter uses his friendship with a mobster to expose the crime in his city.
Ohh, a reporter. After this, we need to watch The Night Stalker with Darren McGavin.  The ultimate dark, creepy, scary reporter show.
