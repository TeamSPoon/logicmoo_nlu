I've really gotten into the Beatles lately.
Oh I love their music. Let It Be always makes me feel better when I'm upset.
Let It Be is so soothing. Have you ever seen Across the Universe.
Is that the movie about the Beatles that came out a few years ago?
Yes, it is. It is worth watching. The music is pretty good in it.
I Wanna Hold Your Hand is another favorite of mine.
I Wanna Hold Your Hand is great; I think I'd like it played at my wedding.
It is such a sweet song. What are your other favorite Beatles hits?
I also like Here Comes the Sun and Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds.
Oh, Here Comes the Sun is awesome. It reminds me of the Parent Trap movie.
