What kind of music are you in to?
Well really I just listen to anything.
You have to have one that you prefer.
Well if I had to choose I guess country.
Me too, it always makes sense to me.
I like it for the acoustic guitar.
Yeah there is something about how it sounds that makes you feel good.
I've always wanted to learn how to play.
Well why don't you take some lessons?
I've looked but haven't found one that I like.
There's some great beginner programs online for free jsut to get you started.
Really? That sounds like a good idea.
Well when you get big and famous, I get first autograph.
Very funny, how about we wait till I at least know how to play a cord first.
Yeah, but you seem to have a grasp on the lingo.
It's one thing to talk about playing music, it's another to actually do it.
Well I took some lessons when I was a kid, maybe I could help you out.
That be amazing, would you really want to?
I get to watch you try and play a guitar, how could I pass that up?
Well there's the tittle for my first hit, "Why aren't we friends anymore?"
