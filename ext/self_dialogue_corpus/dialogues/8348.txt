I think there has been a lot of one hit wonders in pop music.
You mean like Come On Eileen?
That's a really good example.
I think another good one was Tainted Love.
That one I don't know. I happen to like I'm Too Sexy.
That is a funny song. I loved the video for it.
What do you think of Don't Worry Be Happy.
That is a total chill song.
Another favorite of mine is Turning Japanese.
I don't think I've heard that one.
