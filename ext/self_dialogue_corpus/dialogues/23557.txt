Is Ryan Reynolds a good actor?
This is a great question.
He did a great job with Deadpool.
Then he follows it up with some clunkers.
Its a very strange career path he has taken.
I just think he takes whatever work is offered to him.
You could say that and I would not argue.
But some of the stuff he does is pretty good.
I dont know the Green Lantern movies were terrible.
They werent that bad but they didnt have the allure of some other superhero movies.
DC made it so thats probably why.
Yeah Deadpool was going to be terrible if you based it on that.
He probably should stick to that role.
It might get old pretty quick.
I dont think so, especially since its a rated R character.
Could they integrate him into a movie like Infinity Wars?
They havent really meshed those worlds together just yet.
How long before they do so?
They dont really need to, those characters can stand on their own
As a last ditch effort, I could see them doing so
