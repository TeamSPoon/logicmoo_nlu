I heard there was another X-Men movie coming out.
I've lost track at this point.  They've been producing them for eons now.
Seems like they pretty much tapped the franchise out at this point.
They have so that's why now they're all starring younger people.
I just wish they would start coming out with some more original stuff.
Well, Logan was pretty darn good.
Totally agree.  That was a definite departure from the others.
And pretty sad at the end, but they ended it on the right note.
Hugh Jackman will always be the best Wolverine.
Completely agree.  Can't see anyone else in the role.
