I am in here just trippin'.
Why? What's up?
I'm listening to Whitney Houston.
Which song.
I Have Nothing.
Isn't that from The Bodyguard Soundtrack?
Yeah.
I love that movie.
Me too. I'm actually watching the video with it hooked up to my stereo.
I know the sound is off the chain.
I got my sound processor on mountains, that thing sound right.
Whitney could sing her behind off.
I wasn't feeling her when I was younger. But now.
You crazy. I was feeling Whitney ever since I'm Your Baby Tonight.
I feel you. Man this video making me want to cry.
Awe. Probably because you know she's gone.
Whitney was gorgeous. And she could sing.
And she was with Bobby Brown.
Yeah, that lucky son of a gun.
Well her music will live on forever. Rest in peace Whitney.
