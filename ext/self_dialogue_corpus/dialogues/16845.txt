Hey, so with everything going on in music these days, is there anything that really stands out for you?
Oh, yeah, there are tons of great artists doing some awesome things right now. Do you like Imagine Dragons?
Yeah, they are pretty good. Do you have any favorite songs from their most recent album?
You mean "Evolve?" Yeah, I really liked "Believer."
I liked that one too. It kind of seemed like everyone else did too. It might be the most popular song from that record.
You might be right. I really liked "Thunder" too. That was a great track.
Me too. Pretty much every song on that album was good, but those two really stood out.
Hey, not too change genres or anything, but have you heard anything from the new DJ Khaled album?
You mean "Grateful?" The one with Justin Timberlake and Rihanna?
Yeah, that's the one. Have you heard any of the songs from that yet?
Yeah, I really like "I'm the One." It really stands out for me.
That's the one with Justin Timberlake right?
Yeah, it also has Chance the Rapper and Quavo on it too. It's pretty good.
I really liked it too. There were just so many great artists on it.
"Wild Thoughts" is super good too. It might, for me, be even a little better than "I'm the One."
That was a good song. Rihanna was awesome on it!
Yeah you're totally right. She is pretty much one of my favorite artists right now.
Me too! I am still playing "Work" on a non-stop basis!
Oh man, I love that song. It is so, so good.
Oh, totally! I just can't wait for her new stuff! Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long!
