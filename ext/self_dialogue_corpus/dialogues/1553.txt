How to you think the Miami Dolphins will do this year?
Same as every year, not good.
You really don't like the Dolphins do you?
I think they are an overrated franchise.
They were good when Don Shula was the coach.
Yeah that was in the 70s and 80s.  What have the done in the last 30 years?
They had some good teams with Dan Marino.
Some good teams that never won a Super Bowl.
The Dolphins still have the only undefeated team in history.
That's there only claim to fame anymore.
Well, I think they will be good this year.
I think they will win 6-8 games.
You don't think the will win half their games?
I don't think Ryan Tannehill is that good a quarterback.
He's still young.
That is true but I don't think he will ever be anything special.
Hey atleast he's a quarterback they can build around.
I guess you can build around an average quarterback.
The Raven won a Super Bowl with an average quarterback.
The Raven also had the best defense in the league that year.
