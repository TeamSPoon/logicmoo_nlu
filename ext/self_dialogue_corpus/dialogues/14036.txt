I saw Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl.
What did you think?
First time I ever heard her.  Probably the last time too.
I'm sure she'll be heartbroken.
Just not my thing.  And what was she wearing?
I think they're called clothes.
They barely fit her.  It wasn't kid appropriate.
Kids should usually be playing outside during Super Bowl anyway.
All I know is I will not let my kids listen to or watch her from this point forward.
Whatever you want to do, it's your life.
