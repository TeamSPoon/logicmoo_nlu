Are you going to watch the Yankees game tonight?
Why?  Because it is Derek Jeter night?
Yes.  I am not necessarily a fan of the Yankees, but I do want to watch to see how they honor him.
Yes, I guess I will be watching as well for that reason.
What are your thoughts on Derek Jeter's career?
I think it really stands out.  He's a legend on a team full of them.
Yes, I think no matter how you feel about the Yankees, you have to respect what Jeter did.
I agree.  He played twenty seasons for the most scrutinized team maybe in all of sports.
Exactly!  And honestly he never had a scandal or got in trouble for anything.
Yes, he did seem to conduct himself as a professional off the field.
And he was pretty good on the field as well.
Well the five World Series titles kind of speaks for itself.
Yes, and wining three straight.  I don't know if any team will do that again.
I think he just had the personality to fit in New York.
Yes.  He's a good looking guy, well-spoken, and always seemed to deal with the media very well.
Do you think he was the best short stop of his era?
I definitely think so.  I mean Alex Rodriguez was a short stop.
Yes, but ironically Rodriguez had to change positions when he came to the Yankees.
Well those two did not really get along.
Yes, it will be interested to see if Rodriguez is there tonight for Jeter's night.
