I feel like sequels are never any good.
Oh, I totally disagree with you there--think about Disney!
What good sequels did Disney ever make?
Well, think about the Toy Story movies and Finding Dory, those were both sequels.
Oh, I cried my eyes out at Toy Story 3!
The way they handled the Andy and Woody storyline was so sweet.
And it was really sentimental for me, too, since I was about the same age as Woody.
I was really nervous when the first announced another sequel, but they really knew what they were doing.
And I guess Toy Story 2 was pretty good, too.
Oh for sure! I cry at Jessie's song every time.
