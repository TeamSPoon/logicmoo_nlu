It's hard to find someone who is not a fan of music. Do you have a particular type of genre?
Not really a favorite, per say. I can listen to just about anything. What about you?
I mostly enjoy rock music. Whether it'd be hard rock, heavy metal, or alternative.
I feel you on that. Same here, but I'm also into some retro music.
Retro as in from the '80's and 90's?
Definitely. I listen to a lot of those '90's Alternative stations on my iPhone.
I think when it comes to good music, there are a number of things that make it enjoyable for me.
What comes to mind? Perhaps the lyrics?
The lyrics are a strong point, for sure. It's always good to hear a strong story unfold.
I completely agree. Instrumentation is something I really enjoy.
I think instrumentation is a huge factor for a rock song.
For sure. Vocals can play a big role in the enjoyment too, in my opinion.
I think vocals are most important for a solo act. Such as a Country song, for example.
True. Do you have a particular favorite song of all time?
That is a hard question, because it is difficult to narrow it down to one song.
I understand. Could you possibly try, for I am curious.
I would have to go with Hotel California by The Eagles.
That is definitely a classic. What made you decide on that one?
Honestly, it just brings back a lot of memories and I think it still holds up so well!
I cannot disagree with that, even though the song's premise is a bit unclear.
