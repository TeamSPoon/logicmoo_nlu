Do you like early Beatles songs better or later Beatles songs?
What do you mean?
Well, most people consider the Sgt. Pepper album like the transition album where they went from early to later Beatles.
Oh really? I'm not sure I know that album, what songs are on it?
It's designed to sound like a live album, so it sounds really distinct.
Is Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds on that album?
Yes! I think it's the third song on that album.
Oh, nice. I love that song! It's probably one of my favorite songs by them.
So then you actually are a later Beatles fan, huh?
I guess so! I learned something new about myself today, huh?
