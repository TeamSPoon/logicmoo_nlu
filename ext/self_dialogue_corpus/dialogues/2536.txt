None of those teams have any chance of going to the Superbowl anytime soon.
Dallas maybe.
It's a big maybe.
i think it's more important to look at the point allowed compared to points made.
I mean obviously. The Saint no 2 in terms of points scored per game with 29.3 points/game, but they give up 28.4 points/game
And look at Partiots. They give up 15.6 points/game while scoring 27.6 points/game
I wonder how did Falcons do last year
They gave up 25.4 points/game, but got 33.8 points/game
which explains why they were able to lead the Pats in the superbowl by 25 points initially.
yep. It's an offense powerhouse, but defense wise, they need work.
Obvioiusly. otherwise, Brady woldn't have been able to mke the biggest comeback in history
We should watch that game again. It's on youtube.
The full game?
Yep.
Huh. Guess the NFL learned a valuable lesson of allowing full games tobe viewed on youtube.
Revenue from youtube is better than no revenue from youtube. It IS a valuable lesson.
You know this points against vs points for is meaningless.
Well, it's at least something to go on.
But look at the total, Pats are no 2, and Falcons are no 1, with Cowboys not far behind. I think win percent is a better marker
Not really, because divisions have different strength of schedule. Win percent depends on that also. Pats have the highest win percent and Cowboys are the second. Anythgin can happen in the post season.
