What did you think of the new Logan movie?
Is that the new Wolverine one?
Yes, the first rated R X Men franchise movie.
Yeah, it was really intense
That's what I thought too. Really violent.
Yeah, there were several decapitations on that movie.
And several impaling of people's heads, chests and other appendages.
Yeah. I did like professor X in that one thought.
True, interesting take on the whole future state of mutants.
Yeah, everything wasn't bliss in the future.
No, it sounds like most of the mutants were killed off somehow.
I think Professor X killed a lot of them with his mind
Oh really?
Yeah, his mind was starting to fall him and so he'd have seizures...
...oh yeah, and those seizures would kill other people and mutants.
Yeah, except for Wolverine.
Right, since he can heal himself.
Well, unless he starts getting old like Logan.
Yeah, that was kind of sad. Finally died in the end.
But makes sense that all things die at some point.
