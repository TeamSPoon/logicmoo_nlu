Is this the last stand for the Cavaliers?
Why do you say that?
I dont know doesnt seem like they are built for the future.
As long as James is there they are fine.
Some of the guys may want to leave for bigger deals.
And then they shuffle in the next round.
Irving will be there but I dont know about JR Smith
Smith? Please, James gave him a career.
I will agree on that but I just think it might be over.
Its over when he leaves until then enjoy the ride.
Well as a Bulls fan I am not enjoying anything.
Yeah well hold tight cause its his league until otherwise.
Jimmy Butler has something to say.
Its just chatter, LeBron is better than him.
Yeah I subscribe to that.
What a time in the NBA though.
Not really its just a couple of good teams and everyone else.
This is true but I dont think for long.
The Warriors take over or may have taken over.
If Cleveland wins this year, they are the cream of the crop.
