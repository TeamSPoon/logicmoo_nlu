How do you think it felt being Han Solo frozen in carbonite?
Oh man, I don't even like to think about it.
What if he was awake the whole time, but just couldn't move or open his eyes?
That's a creepy thing to even think about.
I know, but he was in there for a long time.
How did they keep him alive without being able to eat?
It's a drama in space and you're worried about how someone stuck in a rock ate?
I mean, it's a valid question.
I suppose you're right.
What if they just fed him a really big meal to tide him over until he got out?
