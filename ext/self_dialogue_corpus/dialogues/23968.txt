Did you see they are making a Avatar sequel.
The air bender or what one?
No, the one in space.
Oh, with the blue people?
Yes, Avatar Two.
Never seen the first one, was it any good?
It was one of the highest grossing films of all times.
So was Titanic, but I did not like it either.
Well, it had romance, but it was far from Titanic.
What was it about?
Hard to explain, but humans wiping out another planet and its inhabitants.
That is the whole movie?
No, there is action and love too.
I do not think I want to see it.
You should give it a try, it has a lot of plot and a good story.
I am not a fan of Science Fiction.
It was Science Fiction, but it felt like more.
I think the only one I ever like was the Star Wars movies.
Well, you might want to give it a try then, a bit like that.
I think I will stick to Lucas Films only for Space Operas.
