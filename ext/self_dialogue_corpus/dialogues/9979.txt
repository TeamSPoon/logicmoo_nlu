I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time today.
Wow, that is a real classic cult action film.
It was nothing like what I expected.
John Travolta is brilliant in that movie.
He was like this cool contract killer, him and the other guy?
Samuel L. Jackson?
Yes! When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense.
Then ended up shooting the guy any way.
Yes! I liked how all the stories bled into one another.
Yes, but some characters never even met. Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,
