What is your favorite movie genre?
That's would have to be action movies?
Really, why is that?
Becuase I like seeing the good guy pound the stuffing out of the bad guy.
Good versus evil, I get that. Any particular type of action movie?
Well, I'd have too say martial arts action movies or ones with martial arts scenes in them.
So, you literally like to see the good guy pound the bad guy?
Yeah, but hey what about you? What kind of action movies do you like?
Well, I tend to prefer shoot'em ups, with plenty of firefights and explosions.
So, westerns, crime thrillers, and war movies, right?
Pretty much, but I prefer World War II movies as far as the war movies go.
Really, any particular reason?
Well, WWII films have a clear cut division between good and bad. Allied powers are generally good, while the Axis is almost always evil.
Okay, I can see that, but what about the Korea war or Vietnam. Plenty of good war movies made about them.
Yes, but both tend to have much darker tones to them.
Yeah, you got me there, both were a lot more morally ambigious than WW2.
So, what's would be your favorite WWII film? Mine is Patton.
Really, mine is Patton as well.
Huh, why do you like it? I like the fact is based of a book written Omar Bradly, a man who actually knew and worked with Patton.
Me too! Between that and the technical advisor and a numbner of actor who actually served during the war, you get a pretty accurate picture, as least what they were allowed to show you.
