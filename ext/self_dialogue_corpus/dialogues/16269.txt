What is your favorite Weezer album?
I think I like Pinkerton the best.
Its one of my favorites too, but I think I'll always hold the Blue album as number 1 favorite.
Did you hear that they're releasing another album?
No, I had no idea. Do you know when it is coming out?
No, I don't know when the full album will be out. They released a single a few months ago, its called  "Feels Like Summer."
I'll have to check it out. What did you think?
I thought it was pretty good, it sounds more like original Weezer.
I wonder if this means that they'll tour again.
I imagine that they will, what's the point of a new album if you don't play it live?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I do hope that they play smaller clubs and venues. It feels weird seeing Weezer play in a huge auditorium.
I agree, their music is infinitely better played in an intimate setting.
I think that's true for most bands. I understand why well known bands play the bigger shows, but the sound isn't nearly as good.
Well, they have to support the tour with ticket sales. Its not like bands make a ton of money off cds and albums anymore.
Right. Why buy the hard copy when you can pirate it online, right?
Unfortunately, that's the truth these days. People want the music, but they don't want to pay.
I still buy records whenever I can. Nothing I download online ever sounds as good as it does on vinyl.
I agree with you on that. I love having my records to listen to.
Maybe Weezer will do a vinyl release of the Black Album when it comes out.
