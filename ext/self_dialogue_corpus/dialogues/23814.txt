Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite movie actors of all time.
Which movie do you like him in?
Well, I like them all, but I think one of my favorites is Deep Blue Sea released in 1999.
I have seen that one!
I love his movies, they are so fun!
Yes, that one is a bit of a thriller!
Yes, the scientists at the ocean facility are testing sharks and collecting brain cells to cure alzheimers. It doesn't turn out so well!
I agree! It is one of the most amazing and fun rides to watch.  Those sharks are massive.
I am sre the creators of those sharks had fun making them so big on screen.
It was fun to see the sharks actually figure out things and attack  intelligently.
The cook was one of my favorite characters in that movie too.
LL Cool J played the cook!
And Saffron Burrows played the misguided doctor that would not listen to reason.
What they created in the movie were really hyper monsters that tried to kill them all.
It was a lot of fun to watch.
Thomas Jane played an excellent part in this one as a diver.
Yes, he worked well in the script, I liked his work in it.
You should come over and watch it with me one day.
That would fun, how about this weekend?
Sounds good!
