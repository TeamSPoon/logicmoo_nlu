Next game is Saturday.
I am looking forward to seeing this game.
Me too.
Tim Golden has really been playing well.
Yes, he has.
I enjoy watching him with the 3 pointers.
A couple games ago, he made six three pointers.
Yeah, that was some game.
The ticket cost has sure went up.
I wonder how a family with 2 or 3 children can afford to go.
They probably can't unless both parents are working.
You're right and good paying jobs at that.
Why don't we see if our wives want to go Saturday.
Great idea.
If they want to go, let's plan dinner before the game.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Do you have a certain restaurant you would like to go.
Yes, the new Mexican restaurant - Hacienda Fuentes.
Ray and I have been wanting to try that.
OK - it's a deal; I know Debbie will want to go.
