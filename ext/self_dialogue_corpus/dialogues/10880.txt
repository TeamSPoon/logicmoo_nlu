I'm really impressed that the Fast & Furious movies are able to get such great actors to join the franchise.
Yeah, they really stepped it up ever since The Rock joined.
He was the first one to bring that kind of outside star power into the franchise.
'Fast Five' was probably my favorite one, and it had everything to do with The Rock.
It's unbelievable that now, they have actors like Charlize Theron playing the main villain.
Yeah. I mean she's won an Oscar before.
Also, Kurt Russell as Mr. Nobody.
I loved him in that role.
I suppose if they can get Helen Mirren, they can get anyone.
That's right, I almost forgot about her!  I can't wait to see who they bring into the franchise next.
