What were your favorite movies as a kid?
I was always really into Disney movies.
Really? I liked Ghibli a lot better.
Which are those?
The Miyazaki movies. Like, My Neighbor Totoro. Or Spirited Away.
Oh, I never really got into those as a kid.
I can't believe that! They're great.
I saw the one about the fish and didn't really care for it.
You mean Ponyo?
Yeah, Ponyo.
That's not really my favorite of them. The better ones have more complicated themes.
Hmm. Well, it didn't do it for me.
That's too bad. I loved them as a kid. And Milo and Otis!
I also had Milo and Otis! I watched it over and over again.
We never had a copy of it. But I rented it a lot.
We had a copy until my mom got so tired of it that she threw it away.
Wow. That makes sense though.
If you're a parent you have to watch the same movies over and over if your kid is in love with it.
That would drive me crazy.
Me too.
