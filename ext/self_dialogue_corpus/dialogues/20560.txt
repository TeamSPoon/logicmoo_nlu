So what type of movies are you into?
Me? I can pretty much watch anything but musicals.
What's the matter with musicals?
Everything. The writing, the singing, the instruments. I rather go buy a real album than sit through two hours of that.
Well whats the last best film you have seen recently.
Definitely the get movie called Fate and the Furious. No question.
Awesome.
Yep, has everything you need in a film.
And that is?
Action, comedy, thrills, and romance all in one package.
I think my favorite film so far for this year is Going in Style.
Really, and why is that?
I'm such a sucker for heist films and it has morgan freeman in it.
Who doesn't love morgan freeman.
Absolutely, it just a fun time for an hour and a half.
Any other recommendation besides that movie?
Well, the new Alien film definitely looks interesting but it isn't released until the end of the week.
Right. We could go see that because i love sci-fi thrillers.
Awesome. Sounds like a plan.
As long as you're paying.
