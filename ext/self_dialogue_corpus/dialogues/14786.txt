What's your favorite Tina Fey movie?
I think it would have to be Mean Girls. What about you?
Mean Girls is a good one, but Sisters is probably my favorite.
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are great together. They look like they could be sisters in real life!
I know. They were also hilarious in Baby Mama together.
Oh yeah, that was a good one too.
Wow I just realized they were in Mean Girls together, too! I completely forgot that Amy Poehler played Regina George's mom.
I completely forgot too! It's so funny when she says that she's a cool mom, not a regular mom.
I know, and the fact that her boobs are rock hard.
Yeah, that movie is classic.
