Do you like the Minnesota Vikings?
I really only watch them in the playoffs.
I am somewhat of a fan.
Do you think they have a chance to win this year?
They will win games definitely.
You know what I am asking!
I am not sure if they can win a superbowl.
Do you like Sam Bradford?
He put up some great stats for the Vikings this season.
I didn't know that.
Yeah he played like a hall of famer.
What were his stats like?
He put up 20 touchdowns, only 5 interceptions, and had a rating of 99.3.
Those are really efficient stats!
Yeah Minnesota was lucky to get him from the Eagles.
I remember him being on their roster.
He didn't play nearly as great for the Eagles.
How were his stats with them?
He had one less touchdown with nine more interceptions.
Well you must be happy he's helping Minnesota now!
