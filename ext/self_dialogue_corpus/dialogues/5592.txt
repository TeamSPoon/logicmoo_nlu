Did you cry when you watched Bambi?
No the movies never touch me like that
But the scene where her mother gets shot.
Yeah it as heart wrenching.
I cant believe you didnt show any emotion.
Disney always does a good job at almost getting me there.
The character of Thumper was also very good
I think it was very cute
But Bambi was the ultimate feel good story
You loved to see Bambi triumphant in the end
