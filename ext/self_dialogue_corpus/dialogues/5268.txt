What is your next favorite classic Disney movie?
Bambi was a good classic movie.
Bambi was good but it made me cry when his mother got shot.
Yeah, but Bambi learned a valuable lesson at the end.
What was the name of Bambi's best friend?
I think the best friend was a rabbit but not sure of the name.
Did Bambi had other forest friends besides the rabbit?
I think there was a chipmunk or a fox as a friend.
The fox was in another movie.  But I think Bambi had a chipmunk friend.
You're right, the fox was with a hound.
