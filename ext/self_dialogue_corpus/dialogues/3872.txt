You remember when Halle Berry played a phone operator and she went after a killer?
Yes, and the hostage was calling from the inside of a car trunk?
What about Bruce Willis in the movie "The Sixth Sense."
That was good but I didn't get it until the ending. I couldn't believe Bruce Willis was dead all through the movie.
In a strange kind of way put you in mind of the "Ocean's Eleven" movies doesn't it?
Yeah and I'm not sure which one had more twists and turns. I like movies that make me think.
Well then you loved Samuel Jackson in "The Hateful Eight" didn't you?
It was alright. The best part was when Samuel Jackson cold cocked that lady was handcuffed. (laughs)
You're sick, that wasn't funny.Now what was funny and full of thrills was "The Long Kiss Good night" with Darryl Hannah.
Samuel Jackson was in that one too wasn't he. I don't why but that movie reminds on Jamie Foxx movie "Law Abiding Citizen."
