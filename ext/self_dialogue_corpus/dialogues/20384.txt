Did you get to see Alien Covenant yet?
I did and it was fantastic!
Yeah, that movie saga will go on and on!
Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace played their roles very well as usual.
Yes, they were in the one previous to it.
Dannie McBride and Katherine Waterston played in this new Alien version as well.
It really surprised me that the entire team decided to go check out the new planet for colonization, when they knew nothing of it.
It didn't take long for the crew to start dying from infections from the aliens, or being torn up and eaten by them!
Yes, David's role in the movie really got interesting as it went along.
He always had a devious side to him.
It surprised me when he was the one that crated teh alien species and brought it to what it was.
Yes, he wanted to create his children, so he did it that way.
David didn't care who died as long s he got what he wanted.
Most of the crew die in this movie too.
Sadly, I think David survives and the other android that looked like him also died.
David had a hand in his death as well.
In the end, David had control over every living embryo on that vessel for the colonization.
And he also had a queen embryo from Alien.
He had everything he wanted in the end.
Their lives were in his hands, which meant they were in trouble.
