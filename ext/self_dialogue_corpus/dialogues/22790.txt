Have you heard aout the new Spider-man movie?
Dude, it's all over the internet!
I have watched every video and it looks amazing.
Me too. I wish it was out now.
Yeah, Tom Holland actually looks like a teenager.
Not like Toby McGuire who looked 30.
Aunt May is a stone cold fox.
C'mon, she's like 40 or something.
I like older women.
Sorry, I want a girl my age.
Your loss.
What about Michael Keaton?
What about him?
He plays the Vulture and he's a bad man.
Who's Michael Keaton?
He played... um...he played a bad guy in one of those old movies.
You dont even know who he is, do you?
Forget it.
Anyway, it comes out in July.
Yes, guess what I'm doing during holiday break?
