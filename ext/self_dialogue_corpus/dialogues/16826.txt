Hey, have you heard Gucci Mane's new mix tape?
Oh yeah, I heard that at John's party last week. Pretty good.
Yeah, pretty good. But--
I miss Waka!
Oh my gosh you read my mind! I really wish they didn't have a big fight.
They were so good together.
Now it's just him and Young Thug or Rae Sremmurd. Or whoever else is hot now.
You gotta admit, Black Beatles was FIRE, my dude.
Yes, it was good. But if it wasn't for that mannequin challenge you think we'd be talking about it now?
Hmmmmm. I guess maybe not.
Don't get me wrong. Sremmlife 1 and 2 were both cool. So many features too.
But it's bubble gum, right? Sesame street voice rapping.
Man, those fools sound like they are just going through puberty and they are twenty-something! That ain't right.
Huh. I never thought about it like that though.
Anyway, back to Gucci. Do you think he's really a clone sent here by the Illuminati?
I guess anything is possible. Right?
Right. But you know. Occam's razor.
Yeah true, true. Maybe that fool just did hella exercise and got some veneers when he got out of prison.
Exactly. Exactly, my dude.
Illuminati might not be messing with him, but his wife is fine as vintage wine. I know that  much.
