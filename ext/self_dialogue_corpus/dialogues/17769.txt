You know, it's true what they say: The music you grew up is the music that stays with you throughout your life.
You think so?
Yeah. Whenever people ask me about my favorites, I'm always referencing my high school faves.
Hm. I guess I do, too. Stuff like Blondie, Madonna, the Go-Gos.
Good stuff. Yeah, mine were like Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, The Cure.
Great stuff. Gothic and romantic and dark and rhythmic.
Yeah, I just don't think there's stuff today that's as good.
I think you might be right. Of course, we're listening to less now than we did then.
True. Back then, I was open to anything and everything. Now, not so much.
Me either. Some of the new stuff I hear -- Lady Gaga, Drake, Katy Perry -- it just doesn't do it for me.
Yeah, the only new stuff I like is Taylor Swift. A little of it, at least.
And rap? Rap I don't like at all.
Me either. Don't tell my kids I said that, though. But it's all so aggressive or sexual. Makes me uncomfortable.
I like Eminem a bit. But he's not exactly new anymore, is he?
I don't think so. He is talented though. Great use of language.
I like him because he has a sense of humor, too. He's not afraid to be silly or to make fun of himself. And others.
Yeah, and he likes to spoof things, too, which I really appreciate. Makes fun of the culture really well.
He is all-around talented, for sure.
Good actor, too. Did you see Eight Mile?
I did. I was super-impressed with his performance. The passion of it.
