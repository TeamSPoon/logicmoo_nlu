What is your opinion on Elvis Presley?
I know a few of his songs, and him of course, but not all of it.
He had a much wider range than he gets credit for.
Really? Like what?
He did a lot of gospel. Really deep, spirituals, old hymnals.
I did not know that, like what?
How Great is Our God, for one. But he did it in the southern style.
I like when some singer do hymnals, it can be really touching.
Carrie Underwood does a few and it is really just beautiful, even if you are not into christian music.
I think it is the emotion they convey. I like the Elvis song, about a pocket full of, is it Rainbows?
Pocket full of Rainbows? Oh, yeah that was a really good one. I like his deeper ones.
Like what?
In the ghetto. It is a cover, but he did it well. Really moving.
I know his other one, Hound dog.
That one was cute, everyone seems to like it.
I like the way he sounded. It was so happy and free.
He had his own voice, no one could replace it.
Do you think his later stuff was any good?
Like Hey Jude?
That one, was that not a Beatles song?
