OK, I've got a movie scenario for you: You have an unlimited budget, and you get to cast three lead actors/actresses. Who do you pick?
That's a tough question. What kind of movie are we talking about?
You mean genre?
Yeah, is it a sci fi movie, a comedy, a drama, a thriller?
Let's say it's whatever genre of movies you want it to be.
Then I'm going to go with Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, and Jessica Chastain.
Hmm, interesting choice. Why?
Leo is a fabulous actor, and as his performance in Django Unchained showed, he can play a villain.
True, he was willing to be unsympathetic. In Wolf of Wall Street too.
So I'd use him as somewhat of a villain. Bale would be more heroic, though not perfect.
Bale was pretty good in The Prestige as a hero with flaws. And he rocked as Batman.
The true hero would be Jessica Chastain. I think she was amazing in Zero Dark 30.
I never saw that one. That was the one where she was a CIA operative?
Yep, she did a great job. An intelligent, nuanced performance.
So, you've got your dream team. What kind of movie would it be?
I'm thinking it would be some kind of corporate thriller.
Hmm, interesting. Most people wouldn't make a movie about corporation if given the chance!
I think with that cast, you could make just about any movie you wanted and it would be great.
True. Do you want to hear my list of actors?
Maybe next time - I've got to go!
