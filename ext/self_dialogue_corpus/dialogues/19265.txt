What was the greatest musical decade in the past 100 years, would you say?
Gotta go with the 60s, I think.
That's definitely the traditional answer.
Yeah, but I think that's true for good reason. SO much good music made in the 60s.
It was definitely an influential era for music.
I mean, peak production for the Beatles alone would make it one of the greatest decades of music of all time.
I do think the narrative gets pushed a little bit by the Baby Boomer thing.
What do you mean by 'Baby Boomer' thing?
That the Baby Boomer generation has dominated media and pretty much all avenues of US life for the past 40 years or so.
And?
That the music of the 60s is what the Boomers grew up on.
Ah, I think I see where you're going.
So of course they love the music of their teens and early 20s, so they rate it the highest.
And kind of mythologize the whole era into something greater than it actually was.
Yeah, I think it's possible that something like that has been going on.
I can sort of see where you're coming from, but at the same time, there really was some great music from that decade.
No question.
Jimi Hendricks, Janice Joplin, the Rolling Stones, The Who, the Doors, and did I mention the Beatles?
Haha, I think you might have!
Point being, it might be somewhat overhyped, but it was also a fantastic decade of music.
