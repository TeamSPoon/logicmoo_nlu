What is your favorite sport?
I would have to say the NFL without a doubt.
Yea that would be my pick as well!
Do you follow any particular team?
Yes, I grew up as a huge fan of the Philadelphia Eagles.
My uncle used to be a big fan of theirs back in the Buddy Ryan days.
My dad did as well, we love Ryan to this day!
What did you think about Chip Kelly?
I had high expectations,but they came crashing down pretty quick!
I thought Kelly was a home run hire when I first heard the news.
Me to! He was so great at Oregon that I just knew he was going to do the same for my Eagles.
How do you feel about the hire of Doug Pederson?
I am not sure just yet, he seems like a decent fit; but I thought the same about Kelly as well.
Where did he coach before the Eagles made him their choice?
He was the offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs.
I thought he was an offensive coordinator for someone.
Yea, I guess we will see what this upcoming season will hold for him and the eagles.
What would have to happen for you to define the upcoming season a success?
I would at least like to see us make the playoffs. I would be happy with that.
We will see soon, the new season is not to far away!
