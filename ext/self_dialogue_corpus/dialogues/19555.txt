Are you a fan of the Beatles?
For the most part I am.
What do you mean?
It depends on the song and it depends on my mood.
In my opinion no one has been as talented as the Beatles.
Really? I guess you know more about them then I do.
They had the ability to create harmonies like no one had ever done.
I really like that song by Joe Cochran that was originally by the Beatles.
Oh, yes! Get By With a Little Help From My Friends!
Yes that's it! That's a beautiful song.
You'd be shocked to know how many songs were actually done by the Beatles originally.
Really? I had no idea.
Yeah if you get a chance you should listen to the soundtrack from Across The Universe.
What is that?
It's a movie and every song is a Beatles cover.
Oh neat I will have to check that out.
If you want to borrow it let me know, it has a huge variety of artists on it.
Sure I would love to borrow it, are there any artists I would know?
Oddly enough there is a Joe Cocker song on there!
Oh well I'm sure I would love it!
