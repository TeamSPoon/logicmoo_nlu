Hey, man, did you see the Yankees game last night?
Yeah, their outfielder was on Not Top 10 because he couldn't find a ball that was a homerun!
What an idiot!
Seriously, and he makes like $5 million a year.
I hate them so much. I hope next time their star player is up to bat, the pitchers of that team repeatedly hit all of their batters in the knees.
Why? Dude, that's cruel.
Once again, I'm a girl. I'm not a dude. Anyway, this way even though the pitchers will get suspended for a few games, all of the Yankees players will have to forfeit a few weeks of games as they have no one to play.
That sounds good, as everyone loves an injured Yankee. But there's one problem.
What's that?
The minor-league system.
Ooooooooooh snap. That's right. Well, if they bring up those players, they won't be as good, so they'll lose anyway.
Unless they play your Red Sox.
That was not cool, dude.
Hey, I'm not a guy either! Why are we calling each other dudes? Anyway, your Sox aren't very good this year.
They have a winning record!
Yeah, 18-16. That's like getting a solid C on an exam. No one is proud of a C.
Well, I bet Yankees fans are, since they're dumb.
True. I just hope they don't make the playoffs again this year.
That'd be great.
Know what would be even better? If one of the Yankees tries to steal second but trips and smashes his face on the base!
