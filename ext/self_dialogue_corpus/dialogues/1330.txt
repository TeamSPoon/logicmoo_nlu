Hey bro what are you watching?
Oh I'm just catching some CFL, waiting for the NFL to come back.
Me too brother, seems like an eternity with all the other sports going on.
You got a favorite team?
Of course man, I'm a Patriots fan!
Oh you're just a bandwagon fan, who doesn't love the Patriots?
Am I really a bandwagon though I've loved them for over 13 years?
I guess not, but why so long?
Firstly they have the greatest quarterback of all time...
That is surely debate bale bro!
Debatable or not, he is amazing and I loved the Panthers matchup in 2004.
Wasn't that the game with the infamous Janet Jackson happening?
Yeah in fact it was, it is why that event was so memorable.
So you love the team because of a Half time show?
Not at all, it just helped me remember the performance and why I've loved the team so long.
I don't want to berate you I just hate bandwagon fans.
I completely get you, everyone in my city is a Warriors fan now.
Of course they are, and when the new West Coast stadium is built, people will flock.
Well I guess it is why we watch the game, we enjoy a battle.
For sure, picking sides can be fun!
