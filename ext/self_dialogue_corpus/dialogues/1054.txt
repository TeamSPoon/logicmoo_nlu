Do you want to make a bet on the upcoming NFL season?
What type of bet?
A bet on the playoff teams, the person who predicts the most correct teams gets fifty dollars.
Sure that sounds fun, I think the Patriots are the obvious pick we will both have.
Yeah, that is a foregone conclusion, they are pretty much guaranteed.
Are you picking your Jaguars to make it?
No, I want to win the money, they are not going to make the playoffs.
I see, head before heart.
Yes, well at least you don't have to worry, I think your Packers are in.
Yeah, I also think they have a good shot at the Super Bowl this year.
They probably do, I think they improved enough in the off season to be a favorite to win it all.
As long as Aaron Rodgers is there they have a shot at it.
He is a game changing type of player.
For sure, he also came up big in the second half of last season.
I can just imagine what he could do with a competent team around him.
Yeah give him a better coach like the Patriots and the Packers have a dynasty.
I do not doubt that at all.
So anyway want to up the bet, lets make it an even one hundred.
Yeah, I can live with that, this season is going to be even better because of the stakes.
I agree, it's been great talking football with you.
