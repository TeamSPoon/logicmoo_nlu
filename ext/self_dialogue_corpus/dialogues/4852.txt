The next match is next Tuesday
I might go if i have time then. Have you watched any good games lately.
Their is a really good baseball game that i watched that has my home team in it recently.
What is your hometown? because i seem to have forgot
My home town is Cleveland Ohio. not really that hard to remember.
So their is a game with the Cleveland Indians?
No i have not seen any of their recent games.
You should watch them they are mesmerizing.
I might if i got a chance but i am busy watching the other teams i really want to see that rangers match
That rangers match is gonna be good they will win like they did last time. By a landslide
They did?  That sounds impressive by how much?
over twenty points It was impressive i watched the game and i was just jaw dropped the whole time
I cannot recall the last time i saw a baseball game that was impressive.
I know right some teams are just awful.
I would not call them awful but they are far from interesting.
Yeah i watched the yankees game and it was just so Rote and almost put me to sleep.
I never watched a yankees game and i will never will.
Why will you not ever watch them i mean they are boring but not the worst thing out there.
They are the worst team in the league the best teams are the Indians and the rangers.
If you say so but i think you are making the right choice.
