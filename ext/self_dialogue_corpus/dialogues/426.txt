What is your favorte team?
I have two, because I can't choose like that.
Fair enough, what are they?
My first is the Tampa Bay Buckeneers...
Seriously? I never hear that one.
Yeah, it's my family's team.
Family's team?
You know, everyone in my family likes them so I like them by association.
Oh okay, I guess that makes sense.
Yeah, my other favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
I like the Steelers too!
Do you watch a lot of their games?
Not really, I always seem to be working whenever any are on.
Well, I just think they are a great team.
Yeah, they've won a lot I believe.
Games? Superbowls?
Well, obviously both if you win games to win the Superbowl....
Fair enough. When was the last time they won a Superbowl anyway?
I'm pretty sure like 2 or 3 years ago.
Yeah, something like that.
