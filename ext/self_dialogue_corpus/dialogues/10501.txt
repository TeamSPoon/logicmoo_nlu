Hi there, how's it going?
Hey! I'm good thanks, how about you?
Things are good. I just got back from work.
Same here. Did you get caught in that traffic jam earlier?
Yeah, you too? It took me 20 minutes longer to get home.
Me too. I hate how much traffic builds up on Fridays.
So any plans for the weekend?
Yeah a group of us are going to the movie theater.
Sounds fun. Which movie are you seeing?
We're checking out the new Marvel movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Yeah, the one with Chris Pratt. I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy.
Me too. Dave Bautista's character was my favorite.
He was great. I'm excited to see Kurt Russell in this new one.
Have you seen the trailers for it?
Yeah the trailer is great. I'm expecting this movie to be a lot of fun.
I hope the soundtrack is as good as the one in the first movie.
Me too. The soundtrack was one of my favorite things about the first movie.
So far I've only heard good things.
A friend of mine saw it last week and really liked it.
