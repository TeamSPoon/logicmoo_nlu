What did you think of Jabba the Hut in the Star Wars movies?
I thought that he was creepy.
Me too!
I wish he had some sort of clothes on.
That would of made everything better.
I was also freaked out when he made Princess Leia his slave.
I really hated that part!
Yeah, I am glad that Princess Leia got her revenge.
In my opinion, Jabba the Hut deserved it.
Yes, he so did!
