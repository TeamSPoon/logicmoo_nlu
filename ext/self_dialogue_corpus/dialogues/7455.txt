Disney has been making some pretty amazing movies lately.
I know, Moana was one of my favorites.
My daughter loved that movie, I’ve seen it 10 times already, still makes me laugh every time.
I know what you mean, it’s on everyday in my household, Beauty and the beast as well.
I haven’t seen that yet, is good for the kids?
Yes, they go crazy for it. I can play that, finding Nemo and then finding dory and it fills the kids days.
I know finding nemo and dory inside out, my kids finally stopped watching finding nemo and then finding dory came out.
I don’t mind though, I love the Disney Pixar movies, toy story 1, 2 and 3 were my favorites.
I love putting those on, I can watch them over and over again. Which one was your favorite.
I love number 2, don’t ask me why, I just love the story.
