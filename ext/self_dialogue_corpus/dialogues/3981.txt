Let's talk about the Psycho movies there are lot's of them that have been remade since the first old original one from the 1960's.
Wow so you mean to tell me you saw that movie Psycho too what year of the Psycho Thriller did you see?
I saw the Thriller movie from 1998 starring that Psycho maniac guy Norman.That guy was really mental.
Yeah he sure was there was a hotel that was owned by his mother who he seemed to be very close to.But one day his Mom Died and he began reacting mentally ill.
Yes he wouldn't bury his mother he left her body hidden inside the house behind the hotel. This was insane.
I know when the customer's would go and rent a room they would start disappearing one woman named Marion who stole her bosses money tried to get away with stealing it.
And Norman got in the way of that and while she was showering he brutally murdered Marion. I know because i saw this one.
Well anyway after that the sister and her boyfriend had been looking for Marion. but Norman kept lying saying he seen her and she left the hotel.
Meanwhile the sister and boyfriend was still searching around for Marion and they were curious about that house in the back of that hotel.
Norman had pushed the body into the lake when they found out the sister was murdered they had Norman arrested and inside the jail he sat there thinking talking and sounding just like his mom with that insanity. And the police informed he was mentally ill. Cool Thriller.
