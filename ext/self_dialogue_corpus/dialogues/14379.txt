Who do you think wins the Finals?
How about Golden State?
Well I think Cleveland has a great shot.
They have steamrolled through the playoffs thus far.
I think LeBron is on a whole new level.
What makes you say that?
Well he doesnt need motivation, right?
I got ya.
So when he gets snubbed for the MVP race what does that do?
Motivates him?
Exactly, now hes out to prove his worth.
I get what you're saying.
So I think that will almost ensure he wins and his team wins.
Will be interesting to see a third straight finals.
I think its great for the NBA
Why is that?
Rivalries benefit everyone
Do you think this will be the next one?
Its already looking like that.
This is true!
