Were you more of a Backstreet Boys or NSYNC fan?
It's embarrassing, but reflecting back I think liked both Boy Bands equally.
They had just about the same number of hits. I think Bye Bye Bye is my favorite NSYNC track.
It's so nostalgic to think about those songs. I still pull up the music videos from time to time and they just bring a smile to my face.
I know that era was something else. It was poppy and fun. Bubblegum pop with the singers too.
Oh that's right, Britney, Christina Aguilera, who else was there?
There as Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore too. I guess if you want to count Willa Ford. She had one track that was a hit.
Was Willa Ford really a hit or considered in that category?
She can be mentioned no doubt, but she was a tier lower than all those mentioned singers.
I'm a little iffy on Mandy Moore too. I know she released a lot of album and she probably is the most successful one career wise and still going today.
Mandy Moore played it safe by the books. I think she has a very devoted group of fans. She never really played up some kind of image like the other singers and her music was very mellow in comparison.
I liked that wholesome image, I think it worked out well for her.
Christina Aguilera had the best music from the batch though, although some would argue Britney's songs were more catchy.
Britney's song are iconic today.
I know, but they're not exactly memorable for genre defining music, more for it's nostalgia to those days.
I agree with that, I can't argue about the nostalgic factor, but they were really catchy, Hit Me One More Time, Oops I Did It Again, there were so many.
Just hearing those titles makes me feel a little uncomfortable, those are such bad title names.
That may be true, but nobody can forget those titles and the chorus lines from the songs.
It's amazing we've moved from that pop area to the Rihanna, Katy Perry, Adele, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce today.
Things happen in cycles, so I'm expecting a boy band resurgence soon!
