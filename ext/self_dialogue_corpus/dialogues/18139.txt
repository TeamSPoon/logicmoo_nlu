Who's your favorite 90's band?
STP.
Huh?
The Stone Temple Pilots.
Oh, yeah! What ever happened to them?
They broke up I think.
Why?
Their lead sing was in and out of rehab.
That's a bummer.
Yeah.
Wasn't he in another band?
Scott Weiland?
Yeah, this group called Velvet Revolver.
I never heard of them.
They were like this "super group".
Who else was in it?
Slash.
From Guns N' Roses.
One and the same.
I'll have to look them up.
