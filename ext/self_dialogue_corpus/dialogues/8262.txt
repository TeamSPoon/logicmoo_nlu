Who is your favorite Pop band?
Well I know they are also considered rock but I would definitely choose Coldplay.
I really like Coldplay, yeah they are pop-rock but have done a lot of pop songs, as they are a very diverse band.
My recent favorites has to be "just like this".
I liked that song as well, but my favorite is "hymn for the weekend".
Both are great songs and I love how diverse they are as a band.
They are really diverse from their earlier work, to the more recent experimental rock and pop they have made some excellent music.
The GhostStories album had a different feeling to it but I enjoyed it all the same.
I think one of the things that makes them so diverse is their ability to collaborate with other great artists.
I agree, we even kinda pointed that out earlier with our favorites, being that "just like this" was a collab with the chain-smokers and  "hymn for the weekend" was a collab with beyonce.
