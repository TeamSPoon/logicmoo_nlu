Did you ever see The 'Burbs?
What was that?
It was a movie from the 80s.
Oh, who was in it?
Well, Tom Hanks was the main character, but I remember Corey Feldman was in it too.
I don't know if I remember that.  What was it about?
Tom Hanks' character is off for the week so he is hanging around the house.  He starts to notice his new neighbors are really weird.
What is weird about them?
They just look weird, first of all.  And they never come out during the day.
Some people just look weird.  That's no reason to hate!
No, they kind of looked inbred weird.  Then things start happening.
Okay.  Like what?
I think a cat went missing and then a person.
Oh, so Tom Hanks thinks that they have something to do with it?
Yes, so he starts spying on them.
Is it a horror movie?
No, it's more of a dark comedy.
Was it good?
I loved it.
I might have to look into that.
