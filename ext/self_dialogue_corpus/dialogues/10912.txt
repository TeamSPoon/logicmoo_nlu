Which Fast and the Furious did you think had the best car chases or races?
I think the original The Fast and The Furious had the best. It was actually a racing movie with a heist background.
That's true, the original had I think three actual races. The first street race at night, the desert race battles, and then there was that race with the Ferrari guy.
That guy had one of the best lines in the series, "More than you can afford pal, Ferrari."
Then Dom tells Brian to smoke him in that legendary orange Toyota Supra.
If you go back to watch the original The Fast and The Furious, you'd be surprise at how many great one liners you'll be able to recite.
Nobody comes here for the tuna! I kind of miss those early characters, Vince and Jesse.
Well Vince made a return and redeemed himself later in the series which was cool, but Jesse died! He got shot up at the end remember?
That's right how could I forget about Jesse's unfortunate murder.
They need to keep the core characters that are there now, people need Dom obviously, but now you can't take away the Rock from us.
