Hey, where are you going to see the game?
I am going to the game.
Really, where did are your seats?
20 yard line, not bad.
Why do you like the dolphins so much?
Its my home town team, and because of ace venture.
You know they haven't been good since the 70's, right.
It doesn't matter, team spirit.
Do you like any other teams?
I like the lions.
Is that an NFL team?
I really don't like you right now.
Falcons, Broncos?
I like them, I like everyone in the AFC East.
Did you get me a ticket?
Of course I got you a ticket.

We are in the car already.
You told me we were going to the doctors.
Yup, I am a liar. Told you, I am a dolphins fan.
