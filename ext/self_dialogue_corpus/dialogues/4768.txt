The cubs lost to the brewers today
What was the score?
6-3 Brewers.
Darn it. I really thought the cubs were going to go on a run
Yeah me too. The Brewers have really been playing well.
Yep. You have to give them a lot of credit for how they have been playing.
For sure. This was a big win for the Brewers. Even though it's early in the season.
Yeah. You want to show everyone that you are going to be a contender
Plus this instills confidence in the team that they can compete against the top teams.
Yeah, I don't think anyone envisioned them in 1st place at all this season
I know I didn't see that coming, but kudos to them for their performance.
Yeah they actually had to comeback in this game.
And they had to deal with a rain delayed game that can sometimes mess up your rhythm.
Absolutely. I think MLB messed up though. They should have called this game earlier.
Why do you say that?
Guys were slipping out there and making mistakes in the rain. Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Oh I see. Yeah that is dangerous and a little bit irresponsible of the league.
Yeah. Hopefully we won't see that too often going forward.
I know they want to get these games in, but you got to protect the players.
Yeah you do. You can't have people getting hurt, when it is absolutely unnecessary.
