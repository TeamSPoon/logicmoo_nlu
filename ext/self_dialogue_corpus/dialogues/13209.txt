What language does R2D2 speak?
I don't know, some kind of binary jargon I guess.
How is it that every Star Wars character is multilingual?
They must have gone to really good schools.
And with C3PO, that dude speaks thousands of languages.
I know, how many languages are there in the Star Wars universe?
Beats me, but there are a lot.
I was disappointed when Ben took off the mask in the middle of The Force Awakens.
Me too, you're the bad guy, you're supposed to keep the mask on and keep the mystique going.
Yeah I know, it kind of ruined the whole movie for me.
