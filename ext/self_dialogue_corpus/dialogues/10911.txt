Do you remember the truck heist from Fast & Furious 4?
Yes of course, who doesn't?
Didn't the driver of the truck have an iguana?
Yes he did and hit ate a piece of chocolate.
That's crazy I didn't know Iguanas ate chocolate.
Me either could just be for the scene.
I liked the part when the truck blew up and rolled down the road and Dom sped up and drove under it.
I loved that scene I thought they would be crushed.
I think that's my favorite scene of that specific movie.
Yeah it was very well done.
