Are you a big superhero movie fan?
Yes I am! The Marvel Universe is my favorite over DC.
Oh definitely. Have you seen Deadpool?
Yes I have, over and over. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious in it.
I agree, fantastic movie. Although not suitable for kids.
That's for sure. He's very edgy and has trouble controlling his mouth.
I loved all the Easter eggs, the references to the other time he played Deadpool and when he played Green Lantern.
Yes those are hilarious. I didn't realize he'd played Deadpool in the Wolverine movie. A different personality though.
I can't believe how horribly he was tortured and still came out of that to get his revenge.
Yes that showed his resolve and how upset he was, and how much he loved his girlfriend.
