Why does every action movie have to have some boring female character?
So that women will go see the movie.
I don't think women want to go see action movies.
They might. That's why they have a female character.
Predator didn't have a female character and it was awesome.
Wasn't the Predator a girl?
I don't think it was.
I thought it was pregnant or something.
Well, if they want to make the Predator the female lead in all action movies I could live with that.
I'd pay to see the Predator in 50 Shade of Grey.
