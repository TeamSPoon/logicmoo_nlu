Have you seen any good bands live lately?
Yeah! I saw Cake a few months ago, and just last week I saw The Protomen.
That's neat! I haven't been out in a while, so I haven't had a chance to catch up with the scene.
That's fair. If you can see Protomen, totally give them a chance, though!
What kind of band are they?
They're pretty geeky actually! They're basically a rock band, but all their music is based off of the Mega-Man series.
Oh, huh. Like how?
Basically they made up their own story for each of the albums with the characters from Mega-Man.
Can you follow it easily?
Not really, but the music is really cool, so it doesn't matter that much to me.
Oh, haha, that's fair. Are they expensive to see?
Not at all, and their shows are often all ages so there aren't a lot of drunk people.
That's so awesome, I'll totally check them out. Do you know anyone else like them?
Maybe Bit Brigade?
Who are they?
Their music is pretty different, but it's a similar theme. They opened a few times for Protomen.
Different how?
They play instrumental rock versions of the actual Mega-Man soundtrack.
Oh my god, really?
Yeah! I saw them live with Protomen, and they even had someone playing the game on a little TV as they played along!
