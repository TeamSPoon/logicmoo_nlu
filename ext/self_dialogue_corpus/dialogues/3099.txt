I was thinking about the NFL uniforms and wondered how they were ranked as to best and worst.
Interesting. What did you find out?
One poll showed  Seattle Seahawks as the best and Jacksonville Jaguars the worst.
I think those are both really boring uniforms.
I agree but not as boring as Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They fit terrible and they look like the leftover candy from Halloween that you liked the least.
Wow that's a heck of a description!
Cleveland Browns are about on the same level they look like brown and orange candy corn.
I like Green Bay and Pittsburgh Steelers uniforms. They make a statement.
Yes those are good ones for sure.
I wonder how expensive uniforms are?
The helmets cost around $1000 and I think the jersey is  about $200  and pants $100.
Then you have all the other "extras".
Yeah it's ridiculous  when you start thinking about what they are charged from these sports companies.
Yeah like 35-50 for a pair of socks!
No wonder they charge so much for tickets
Everybody gouges everybody else because they know they can get away with it.
Vendors screwing the patrons with ridiculous vending prices and the stadiums screwing the vendors for primo spots to sell there wares or food.
yeah unless you are rich it's almost impossible to go to a game.
They don't give a crap about the common man.
Yes  i wished they would make it more affordable for more people
