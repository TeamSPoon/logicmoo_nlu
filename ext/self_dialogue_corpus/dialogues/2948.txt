Hey did you watch the playoffs
Yeah man they were so good
I cant believe the Falcons blew that lead
It was so fun to watch, I can't stand the falcons
I really wish Julio Jones would come to the Panthers
I know, he would be so good to pair up with Cam
How do you feel about the draft picks?
I really love the first 2 picks
Same, I think this will help our offense tremendously
I think if Shula gets his act together we can be the top offense again like 2015
I'm a little concerned about our secondary
I'm not, I think we have vast improvements over last year
Hopefully, it was probably the worst we've ever had
Yes Ill agree to that
How do you see the NFC playing out this year
Hmm I think Seattle and Carolina will get the byes
Really, I think New York will put up a fight this year
I can definitely see that too
I could also see Arizona giving Seattle a run for that division
Definitely looks to be an interesting season
