Have you seen Rogue One in the movies?
Yes, and I loved how it tied into the New Hope movie.
What did you like about it the most?
The way it explained why the Death Star had the vulnerabilities it had.
I agree. And I think the new characters introduced were very interesting too.
Which of them was your favorite?
I really liked the blind, force sensitive monk Chirrut.
What did you like about him?
His apparent connection to the Force.
Yeah, it was great to see how the Force is present even in those not trained to use it.
