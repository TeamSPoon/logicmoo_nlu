Have you ever listened to the Jonas Brothers?
Yeah, I think I have.
What did you think of their sound?
They were too generic for me, personally.
That's too bad. I really used to like them.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
I like Year 3000 or S.O.S.
I think I've heard of S.O.S. Is it a break-up song?
Yes it is. It's from their first album, I think.
Cool. How many albums do they have?
I'm not sure. Maybe 5 or 6.
Wow. That's more than I thought.
Have you listened to any of their solo work?
I think I've heard some of Nick's new music.
What did you think of it?
It's okay. It's different but sort of mainstream.
Yeah I think it's pretty good. What about Joe's stuff?
No, I didn't even know he went solo!
Yeah, he has a few albums with a new band.
I'll have to check it out.
