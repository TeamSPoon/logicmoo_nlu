Who's your favorite Classical composer?
Beethoven.  Who's yours?
I also really like Beethoven, but my favorite is Tchaikovsky.  What's your favorite Beethoven piece?
Probably his third symphony (the Eroica).
Yeah, that's a great piece.  Very exciting music.
Yeah, and it also had huge historical significance, as it ushered in the Romantic era.
I didn't know that.  Very interesting.  I knew it was an important piece but I didn't know why.
What's your favorite Tchaikovsky piece?
There are so many to choose from, but I really like his 5th symphony.
I don't know that symphony, what's it like?
Of his symphonies 4-6, it's probably the most melodic.  It's best known for a recurring "motto" across the movements.
Very interesting.  Is the "motto" idea similar to the "fate" theme of Beethoven's 5th symphony?
They don't sound the same, but kind of.  The motto gets transformed from minor to major and shows up explicitly in each movement.
Cool.  In Beethoven's 5th, the "fate" motive isn't as explicit but the "short short short long" motive shows up in all movements.
Yeah, well in Tchaikovsky's 5th, it's pretty obvious and very exciting.  Different instruments carry the motto.
Interesting.  I'll have to listen to it sometime.
You should.  I like the Berlin Philharmonic's version with Herbert von Karajan.
Thanks for the recommendation.  I'll check it out and let you know what I think.
Great.  If you like that, also listen to Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony.
Sounds like a plan.
