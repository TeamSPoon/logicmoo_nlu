You know, I tried to watch that movie From Dusk Til Dawn. And there were no vampires at all and i just turned it off after a while.
The first part of the movie is practically a different movie, about these two criminals on the run.
Yes, but that isn't what the commercials for it showed.
It just suddenly changes from this ordinary movie, all at one, into a vampire movie. It's so abrupt it's crazy.
So I just gave up on it too early?
Exactly. The first part of the movie is interesting, and you actually get a feel for who the characters are.
Then everything goes batshit crazy?
Exactly. And you're sort of rooting for these guys, because you've gotten to know them. But of course that isn't really the best part.
What's the best part?
The director's commitment to showing either vampires or people die in outlandish, brutal ways.
Now you're talking. That was the movie I wanted to see!
It totally delivers as a good gory vampire movie.
Dang, I shouldn't have given up on it so quickly.
I don't think it's on Netflix, but I think I still have the DVD around somewhere if you want to watch it.
You still have your DVDs?
Yes, why? They cost a lot of money, I wasn't just going to toss them out.
It's just funny because nowadays you can find almost any movie instantly because cable has it on demand, or it's on Netflix or Hulu.
Well I didn't see any reason to get rid of my old DVDs.
Seriously, you're the only person I know who still has DVDs.
Really?
