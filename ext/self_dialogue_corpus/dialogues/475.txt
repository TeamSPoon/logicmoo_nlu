Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
I love it!
Oh, yea?  What is your favorite team?
Buffalo!
Let's go Buffalo!
Oh, you too?
Yea, man!
How do you think they'll do without Rex Ryan?
The head coach?  I think they'll do better
Really?  See I didn't think it was his fault
See I think it was partially his fault
I don't think so.  The QB needed replaced
Well they did that too!
I know.  But I would have kept Rex
I'm all for the changes
See, I think they did too many.  Now they're too new
But it will pay off in the long run
I'm not so sure
In any case, we'll find out soon!
