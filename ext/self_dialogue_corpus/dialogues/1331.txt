Who is your favorite Cardinals player?
I like Fitzgerald the best
A lot of people do
I like all of their players though
Who is your favorite all time Cardinal?
Kurt Warner
He was really good
Yes he was
I loved their Super Bowl team
Me too.
They had a great team
Their receivers were amazing that year
Anquan Boldin as really good. I'm sad they lost him the year after.
I wish teams stayed together longer
Who is Boldin on now?
The Lions I think
Is Kurt Warner still playing?
No, he retired
I wish he came back
Me too
