The Cavaliers seem unstoppable.
Yeah I don't know who can guard LeBron.
They will win back to back championships.
I don't see them beating Golden State.
You gotta be kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Who on Golden State can guard LeBron?
I would put Kevin Durant on him.
No one will stop LeBron.
It doesn't matter, Golden State has too many shooters.
Kevin Durant cannot guard LeBron.
You are missing the point.  Golden State has 4 or 5 people on the court at all times that can score.  Cleveland maybe has 3.
You think that will be the difference?
Absolutely, we'll concede that LeBron will get his points.
What if other Cavaliers are also scoring?
I really don't think it will matter, there is too much fire power on Golden State.
I think if Cleveland slows the game down they have a real chance.
If Cleveland slows the game down they just have a real chance of losing by less.
You are impossible.
I'm impossible to defend, like Golden State.  They will win two out of the last three championships.  Scoreboard!
