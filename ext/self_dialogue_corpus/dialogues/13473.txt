Who is your favorite Star Wars Character.
I like R2D2.
He deserves plenty of credit.
The whole plot is around him and C3PO
Until the prequals, I never knew he could fly.
I wonder why he didn't talk normally.
He could do everything else.
If he did talk, he would be a fun person to be around.
He might play pranks
It's good that he found C3PO
