Since the NFL season was coming up, I randomly had a question come to mind.
What is it?
Do you think Terrell Owens was snubbed of the Hall of Fame?
Honestly yes. His stats match up with the greats.
Isn't he top three in Touchdown receptions?
Number 2 or 3. I think Moss is 3, while he was number 2.
How can you not put that in the hall?
Not only that, but he had over 1000 catches and 15000 receiving yards.
The man was a freak of nature.
He proved that during the Eagles Superbowl run.
Didn't he break his ankle late in the season and still was amazing in the Superbowl.
I don't even get how he did it. His documentary showed he was hobbling mightily like a week before that game.
And people want to say he has no heart and is only about himself.
You can't be selfish if you are running on an ankle that is basically on the brink of breaking at any second and still trying your hardest.
That game would have been a Pats blowout for sure.
It's a shame him and McNabb Loathed each other.
Seems like every team, but the Cowboys hated him. For the most part
He had a big mouth. The man talked too much, but my goodness he backed up that talk.
Back on the overall topic even Polian said he shouldn't be in, because he was a team killer. Like come on man attitude isn't a tangible thing.
The hall is about what did on the field not off of it. Even if he did spike a ball right on the Dallas Cowboys' star.
