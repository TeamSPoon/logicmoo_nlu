Hey, have you heard Lady Gaga's most recent album?
I'm not sure? What was it called again.
It's called Joanne and it features the song 'Dancing in Circles'.
Oh I did hear that song but no I have not heard the whole album.
You are missing out dude. It is definately the album of the year.
Wow. It must be a really good album then. My personal favorite will always be 'The Fame'.
I loved that album. It was so iconic.
What was your favorite song from that album?
My favorite song was 'Paparazzi'. What was yours?
That was a good song but mine is Poker Face. It is such a classic.
