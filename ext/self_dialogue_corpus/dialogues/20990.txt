Why do you think so many movies are made in California?
Thats a good question I guess because the weather is great?
I think they do alot of stuff indoors anyway.
The sets are already built there?
I thought the income tax was so high, dont know why youd do business.
Well its not always feasible to go to a different city and shut parts of it down for filming.
This is true, I guess its more open there.
Or already conducive for producers and writers to do what they need to.
Imagine if Hollywood was founded in middle America.
I think its called that and out there for a reason.
I agree, its a perfect place.
Did you see if the Kardashians are ever in any movies out there?
I dont pay much attention to them so I would have no clue.
I like movies that feature bimbos.
Why?
I think they make fools of themselves and no one but them thinks its great.
I would rather not have them ruin a movie.
Paris Hilton made her Scary Movie almost unwatchable
I think she was only in it for a fraction of the time.
Thats my point!
