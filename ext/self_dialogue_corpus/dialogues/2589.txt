So who do you think will be the surprise team this NFL season?
I'm thinking that the Philadelphia Eagles will get some serious attention this year.
You really think so?
Yes, I do as they have several things going in their favor this year.
So why do you think they are going to improve so much?
Well, last year they had a rookie quarterback and although he started off good, he faded late.
You think he's going to improve enough to really help the team?
Yes, I think he got overwhelmed with all of the publicity last year and choked, but this year will be different.
I hope so as I would like to see someone actually beat New England for the Super Bowl this year.
The Eagles can do it and they have the talent to pull it off. Who do you think will be the surprise team?
Call me crazy, but I'm liking Tampa Bay to really turn some heads this season.
So Winston and the guys impressed you this off-season?
I wouldn't say that but I just think that they had so many injuries and close games last season, they will get better.
I have to agree that they did have some bad breaks last year.
Yep, if the ball bounces their way this season, they could make the playoffs
True, as once a team is in the playoffs, you never know what will happen
You know as that's why they play the game on the field and not on paper.
Either way, there is no telling what will happen this year.
Yep, only time will tell who makes it to the big game this year.
It should be a fun season regardless of who wins it all but I'm rooting for any team besides the Patriots.
