What do you prefer, opera music or symphony music?
Ah, that's hard.  They overlap a lot.  But I think I prefer arias to symphonies.
I prefer arias to symphonies as well but I do like concertos.
I like arias because they are shorter.
I like the vocals.  I like concertos when I am trying to read or study.
But, it depends on the aria.  I don't like modern opera.
Oh, I recently saw Nixon in China.  I thought it was brillant.
I have seen it too and I hated it!  I thought the music didn't have any style.
I don't agree at all. I love modern opera, especially in English.
Nope.  I don't want anything written after 1920 and nothing in Engish.
What about modern classical music?
Some of it is all right, like Aaron Copeland, but not too modern.
I like the Grand Canyon Suite and the Syncopated clock.
I like those too.  I think they are very approachable.
What do you think of Porgy and Bess?
I like Porgy and Bess, but I have a hard time seeing it as an opera.
I think there is a fine line between opera and musical theater.
I would agree with that, especially when I think about Andrew Lloyd Weber.
Yeah, like Le Mis and Phantom of the Opera.
I agree.
