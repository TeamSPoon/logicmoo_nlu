What was the first 'real' record or album you  got?
What do you mean by 'real'?
Like, not a children's music or a movie soundtrack, things like that.
Ah, I understand what you mean now.
The first album that adults also listen to.
I think it was Billy Joel. 'We Didn't Start the Fire'.
Oh, I remember that song.
I am not even sure if that's what the album was called. But that was the hot song on it, and that's why I got the album.
That was the one where he just basically rattles off a list of stuff that happened in US history, right?
Yep! As a nerdy young kid, that really appealed to me.
Haha, that's funny. Did you only listen to that song, or did you listen to the whole thing.
At first, I only listened to that song, but eventually I listened to the whole album.
And are you a Billy Joel fan to this day?
No, I don't listen to his music at all, actually.
So I guess you got your fill of his music at a young age.
Apparently. I bet listening to those songs would bring back some nostalgia, though.
I'm sure. I can't even remember my first real album.
I'm surprised. My first one was graven into my memory.
Actually, it was probably something my older sister gave to me.
Oh, I guess it's a different thing being an oldest child like me versus being a younger one like you.
