What's one of your most favorite movies?
Oh that's easy. Jurassic Park would definitely be up there.
Really? How come?
Well I used to be an avid reader. I had purchased the book not knowing much about it except that it sounded like it would be good.
I never read the book.
Well the movie blew me away because it was the first time a book made in to a movie lived up to my imagination.
I don't think i get what you mean. How can a movie compete with your imagination.
Your brain paints pictures in your mind of what a place or person would look like and my perception of what the compound looked like was right on point.
That's pretty interesting.
I mean the whole movie is mind blowing to watch on a big screen but to feel like someone was inside your head seeing what your imagination came up with was stupifying.
When the special effects kick in in certain places in the movie it does make you feel likes it's pretty real.
Yes the water sitting on the console that shakes as the T-rex approaches is scary.
Is the T-Rex the first dinosaur you see?
No I don't think so. It was a Brachiosaurus.
That's the one that looks like Dino the dinosaur on the Sinclar gas station sign isn't it?
I do think you are right about that.
Or was Dino a brontosaurus?
I don't know i am not a nerd like you.
You are so funny...
Oh just go watch all 4 or 5 of the sequels and you can get your dinosaur nerd on!
