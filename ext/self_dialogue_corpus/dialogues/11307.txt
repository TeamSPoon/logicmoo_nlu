Do you remember when they had that Beatles Anthology collection?
Yeah, I bought all the CDs!
When had that all come out?
Around 2000, I think.
Why did they release that collection?
I really don't know.
Was it just all their songs?
No, it was some songs, some live stuff, some outtakes.
Did you like it?
Yeah, I really did.  I found some songs I'd never heard of.
