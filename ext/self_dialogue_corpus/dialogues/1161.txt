Where are the boys?
The are outside playing football.
That's about right. It's halftime of the Texan-Patriot game.
Yeah. They raced outside screaming, "I want to be the Texans...you can be the Patriots!"
That's the tradition. Every halftime, my Dad used to take my brother and I outside to throw the ball around.
Why don't you go out and play with them?
Not now.
Why not?
Because of the other tradition.
What was that?
That was when we would come back inside after playing football.  Fall in upstate New York was cold and wet.
No.
You guessed it!  We would come back in the house all muddy and grass-stained, dripping wet, with mud on our shoes, pants, shirts...you name it!
That was the tradition?
No, the tradition was driving our Mom crazy!  Just like we ran outside screaming to play, upon our return inside she would run around screaming, and chase us off of the furniture and into the showers.
That must have been crazy!
I missed the third quarter of more games that way than I can remember!
Go ahead. Play with the boys.
Are you sure?
Yeah, go ahead. And I promise I won't scream when you come back inside the house all muddy!
