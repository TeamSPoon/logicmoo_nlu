Like any global pop music artists?
Kylie Minogue, for one.
Yeah she's very popular internationally.
Her music in general is catchy.
She does some dance music too.
She has a playful artistic persona.
She's sold a lot of pop music globally.
Is she still performing?
I'm not sure now. She was acting for a bit.
Well I hope she puts out another album.
