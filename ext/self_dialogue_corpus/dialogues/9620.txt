Do you like any rap or hip hop?
Yes, I love Kendrick Lamar's older albums such as Section. 80 and Good Kidd, M.A.A.D City.
You don't like his newer albums?
I think they're good, but I don't find myself wanting to listen to them.
What don't you like about the newer albums?
I just feel like they're made more for the mainstream. I feel like "Be Humble" was made to be played at NBA games.
Hm, I disagree. Have you heard any good songs on the radio lately?
No. None. I heard an awful song by Ugly God called "Water". Maybe it was meant to be terrible, so I would rememeber it...
I guess it worked if that's the case. What's so bad about it?
It has an annoying water drop sound effect and the lyrics are so idiotic. It sounds like no effort was put into it. I thought it was ameteur/local at first.
