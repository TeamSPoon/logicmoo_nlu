What sort of music have you been listening to lately?
Hmm, I've been really into the Eagles lately.
The Eagles? No kidding
Yeah, my parents listened to them when i was growing up and they sort of rubbed off on me.
I can understand that. They were very talented
Yeah, they were great songwriters.
And vocalists.
Absolutely
Hotel California was one of the first songs i learned to play on guitar
Oh yeah? Is it hard?
Not really. It's just about right for a beginner who's ready to challenge themselves a bit.
Yeah. I love when they did that acoustic version of it a few years back.
Oh right, that's when they did a world tour i think too.
I think you're right about that.
Their music's pretty laid back really. When you think of songs like Witchy Woman and Peaceful Easy Feelin
Lying Eyes.
Yeah, i love that one.
Me too.
Let's put some on right now.
Sure, sounds good to me!
