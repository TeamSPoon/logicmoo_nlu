What are your predictions for this year's football season?
College or pro?
The NFL. Who do you think will win the Super Bowl?
I think it is the NFC's year.
Are you serious? Who in the NFC could actually beat the Patriots?
Oh, so you automatically think the Patiots will be the AFC champion?
Actually, yes I do, but I don't know that there's any NFC contender who could beat the Raiders either.
The Raiders? Didn't they fizzle out last year?
Only after their quarterback broke his leg! Carr was awesome last year.
Ok fine, but that doesn't mean anything for this year.
Except for the fact that the Raiders now have Marshawn Lynch too.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, that also makes them a force!
But I thought you were all about the Patriots?
Well, given the way they traded and drafted, I am. I'm just saying I don't see any NFC contenders that will be better.
I think this is the Eagles year.
The Eagles? You must be joking!
Nope. I think it is there time.
You are delusional! They've never won a Super Bowl and they don't have the personnel to do it this year.
I think now that Wentz has a year under his belt they will surprise everyone.
