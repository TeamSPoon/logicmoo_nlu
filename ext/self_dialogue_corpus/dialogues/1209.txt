looks like brady and the pat are still the best
no doubt about it
the man never ages he still plays like he's 25
and along with belichick it's an unbeatable combination
imagine if he had speed and could run
he would be even more awesome but he can't run
i know his best asset is his brain and how he just knows the game
for sure, what do you think about dallas this year
they have a great qb and rb they should be right up there
agreed, they didn't really have playoff experience last year but should go further this year
i can't wait until football season
same here I'll soon be putting my fantasy team together
yes me too, the only problem is when you have to cheer on players when they play the pats
that's why i try not to use players when they play us but it's kinda difficult
training camp starts in a few weeks I think I'll go watch a few
sounds good maybe I'll join you
great we can grab some lunch and a beer after watching brady warm up
sounds like a plan .....GO PATS lol
yes GO PATS  but no problem getting to the superbowl again this year
i couldn't agree more we are spoiled fans but that's fine with me
