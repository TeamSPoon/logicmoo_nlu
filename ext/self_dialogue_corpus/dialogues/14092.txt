When was lady Gaga born?
I think 1986.
She's not that old then.
No,but she's been around awhile.
I heard Sony signed her to,write songs for brittney spears and others.
Yes they did.
Then they found out what a great voice she had and she started her own recording career.
She's really good.
She didn't have a hit right away though.
I heard it took some time
