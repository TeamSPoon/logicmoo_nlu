What do you think was the best film of last year?
It sure wasn't moonlight OR la la land.
I haven't seen either one, so you didn't like either film?
I don't like musicals.
Is moonlight a musical?
I don't know I haven't seen it.
How about hidden figures? That was good wasn't it?
I thought hidden figures was very thin on the actual mathematics or science of it all.
Hidden fences!
Exactly, kinda the same movie... Feces and Hidden figures.
Taraji P is good and so I that viola Davis right?
They're okay. And the films are okay.
Just ok?
Yes, the films are overrated.
What movie did you like?
I enjoyed silver linings playbook.
That didn't come out this year. Silver linings playbook is a few years old!
Anything with Bradley Cooper then
You know he's remaking a star is born with lady gaga?
Really? Bradley Cooper and lady gaga! Wow! I'm there
