I heard my favorite song on the radio today. Do you have a favorite?
Oh really, what song?
It's called Creep.
Oh, nice! I love any movie with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.
It is my favorite Radiohead song.
They are so mellow and can sometimes have really deep meanings to their songs.
Right! Yeah, Thom Yorke is the lead singer of Radiohead.
Does he write all the music, mostly?
Yep, they are from England and have been together since 1985 so they have a ton of songs.
Oh okay cool. I really like the song, No surprises.
That is a great one and also the song called Karma Police.
The words to Karma Police are intense.
I know, they are good at grabbing emotions and taking you through a journey with a song.
I had heard they played live at Coachella this year.
I wish I could have went to it.
Me too. I had read that the sound equipment went out when they started the show.
Oh man, I bet they didn't handle that well!
Right, I heard they were pretty mad and throwing stuff around.
I can imagine that. That is hysterical.
The top thing on my bucket list is going to see them live.
