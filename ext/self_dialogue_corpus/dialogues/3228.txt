Man check out this costume.  It's looks just like Freddy Kruger.
Cool.  You going to be Freddy this year?
No, I was thinking about being the Swamp Monster and having my Mom help me make the costume.
I'm going to buy mine.  I was thinking about going as Pinhead.  I saw that mask around here somewhere.
Yeah, that'd be cool.  Those were great movies.
Yeah, he was pretty brutal.
What's your favorite horror flick.
Halloween.  How bout yours?
I don't know.  The bloodier the better.
Right.  Like chainsaw massacre.
