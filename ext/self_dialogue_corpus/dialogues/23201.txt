Have you ever seen the movie The Holy Grail?
You mean the Monty Python one?
Yeah, the funny one with the British actors.
Yes! I love that movie.
Whats your favorite part in that movie?
I like the part when the Frenchmen catapult farm animals out of their castle.
That part is hilarious, haha.
Have you seen any other Monty Python movies?
Yeah, I saw Meaning of Life and Life of Brian.
I saw Meaning of Life too, but I have never heard of Life of Brian.
Wow really? It is hilarious.
What is it about?
Basically a guy who people assume is the messiah when hes really just a guy.
Sounds like it bashes religion.
Oh, it does. It makes some really good points why religion is stupid.
I'll bet its a really funny movie.
Definitely, I recommend watching it.
Is it a good movie to watch with kids?
No, its got some pretty bad parts in it.
Okay, Well I'll have to check it out when my kids aren't around.
