So i see Ryan Griffin is going to be the Second String QB for Tampa
And Sefo Liufau will be third string.
Right on, sounds like a good QB line up.
Bryan Anger is coming back as the Punter.
He's good, who re the other two?
Dunno, i do know we got Deshaun Jackson as a wide reciever tho.
Oh, very cool.
Yes. Chris Goodwin and of course Mike Evans are returning this season.
Mike Evans stood out last season, very good to have this year.
Speaking of Wide Recievers, Josh Huff i hoping to make the cut as well.
How are his stats?
I dunno, he's fresh to the scene
Ah, well, i'll wish him luck.
Same here.
Oh, very cool. He put points on the board last season.
Yes he did.
Isiah Johnson is returning this season as well.
Right on. He was another poins earner from last season.
Yes, i think we got a good crew, hoping they make playoffs this season.
Same here!
