I wonder who had the most punt return TDs last year...
Well. Things like punt return TDs are better if we look at the career records
How come?
Because it's a rare thing. We don't get it in every game, Some teams never even get one ina season.
Huh. That's a good piont. So who has the most punt return TD over the career?
Devin Hester who had 14 punt return TDs over between 2006-2016
That's amazing
in 2007, he had 4 punt return TDs. That's like every third week.
That must have been amazing to watch
Yep, excepot he hasn't had one since 2014. See these are so rare, it's kinda pointless to talk about a season record.
I see your point. But season records are what we use to fantasy mostly.
Um, some people use average of the seasons for fantasy. Others even use bayesian networks. But football isn't very amenable for bayesian if you ask me
How's that?
We need way more data points, more than they keep.
How many more pata points?
For Baeysian predictions to be reliable? probably millions
We probably have millions of data points for NFL.
Yeah, but we need the right kind of data at those numbers. And we don't.
Even NFL doesn't give you enough data points? That's insane.
Well, it's just reality. It's just like financial market prediction. The agents are stochastic, and they often defy predictions
