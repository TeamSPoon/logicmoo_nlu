Have you seen Logan yet?
Yes I have and I loved it. I loved seeing him with his daughter.
I love any movie Hugh Jackman is in but Wolverine is by far my favorite character.
The only thing that confuses me is I thought Professor X died in The Last Stand.
He did, and that confused a lot of people. Their storylines confuse me.
Yes I'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe and that confused even me.
I wish more X-Men characters would have made an appearance in the movie though.
I agree but it probably would have taken Wolverine out of the spotlight.
You might be right. I was sad when he died. Even though someone spoiled it for me before I even saw the movie.
That's terrible, so it wasn't even a surprise for you. I can't stand spoilers.
