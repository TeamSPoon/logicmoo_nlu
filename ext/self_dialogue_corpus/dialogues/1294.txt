I just saw Superbowl XXXVIII on replay.
The second Patriots' Superbowl victory?
Yes, a good one.
I did not think the Panthers would be that good.
They were only 11-5.
I think the Pats were 14-2.
I was surprised the score was 0-0 after the first quarter.
What was the score at the half?
14-10, Patriots.
The halftime show was a riot.
Oh, yes.  Janet Jackson's "wardrobe failure".
I think it was staged.
No scoring in the third quarter.
The fourth was a riot of scoring.
How many points were scored?
37.
Wow, exciting.
The Panthers tied it with 1:02
A replay of the last Patriots' SB win!
Yes, another Vinateri field goal.
