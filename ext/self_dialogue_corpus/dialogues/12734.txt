Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Palpatine.
You mean the Emperor?!
Yes, well I really like him as both Emperor and Senator. I find him compelling.
Just the acting, or the character himself?
Both! He's a great actor, and the character has such great nuance.
Nuance? Such as what?
Well, he's this really good politician and evil Jedi, but he is also really sympathetic.
What's his most sympathetic moment?
I was really impressed by when he argued that the force must be balanced.
