Seen any good horror movies recently?
I have watched a few. I enjoyed crimson peak have you seen it?
I did watch it a few years ago now. I liked the costumes in that film.
The costumes added a lot to the atmosphere and time it took place in.
I also thought the cinematography was very well done. But was it really a horror?
I thought so. It has some plot twist that may have been more thriller but I thought it was very creepy and scary and fits the horror category well.
Mia Wasikowska has a kind of creepy vibe to her in general. Very gothic feel to the film and her.
Maybe it is her pale skin. And yes gothic is a very good descriptor of the films feel and look.
Guillermo del Toro is very skilled at producing some evry visually appealing scary movies.
True I liked pan's labyrinth as well.
