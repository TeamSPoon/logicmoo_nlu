Whatever happened to Darude?
Darude? I don't think I know who that is.
I think you do. He's a Finnish DJ.
That doesn't sound like I would know.
He wrote the song "Sandstorm" in the late 90s.
That does sounds faintly familiar.
It was the song that pretty much every laser tag place would play.
So it's like a heavy, electronic thing.
Yeah, exactly.
Is that his only song?
I don't think so. I had an able that he made when I was middle school.
So there's more stuff out there. Why don't we just google him?
Huh. It looks like he put out a new album in 2015.
What's it called?
Moments. This is super weird though.
What's so strange about it.
Apparently an all-cello band called Apocalyptica did a guest spot on one track.
That is weird.
I really want to listen to it.
Let's find a copy!
