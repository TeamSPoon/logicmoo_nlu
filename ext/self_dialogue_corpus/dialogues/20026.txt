Hi, how are you today?
It has been great! I just came back from LA for a concert.
Whose concert is it?
Taylor Swift's. It is one of her world tour this year.
Amazing. I wish I could have gone with you together.
Oh, I don't know you are also a fan of Taylor Swift.
Well, I was not a big fan a few years ago, but in recent days, I start to listen to her songs frequently and find out she is amazing.
Absolutely. I have been her fan since 2012. She is one of my favorite singers.
Which of her songs do you like most?
It is "All Too Well", which appeared in her album "Red".
I like it very much. I also like "Red" in the same album.
Me too. You and I have a similar taste.
Interesting. We should hang out more often to talk about her songs.
That is a great idea. Are you interested in attending one of her concert with me?
Sounds great. When will be her next concert?
It will be in Boston in early July. Will you be available at that time?
I think so, but I need to check my schedule. I have not been to Boston before but it sounds to be a great tour if we go.
That's absolutely true. Let's talk in detail once you know your availability.
Sure. I will catch you up later tonight.
Sound great. Taylor Swift, we are coming together!
