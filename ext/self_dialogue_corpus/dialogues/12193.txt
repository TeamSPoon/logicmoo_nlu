Ugh, I hate all the hype about Star Wars.
What? You don't like Star Wars?
I hate it! The movies are so bad.
Are you kidding? Have you seen them all?
No, Just the one's that came out in the 90s.
Oh, those one's were pretty bad.
Yeah, they were awful.
Well you should try watching the old ones, or the new one that came out in 2015. They were so much better.
Really? I kind of figured they were bad too.
No, the 90s one's were awful but the new one especially is really good.
