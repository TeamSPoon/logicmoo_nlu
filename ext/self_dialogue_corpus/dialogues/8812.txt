So, how do you feel about the '60s psychedelic rock scene?
Well, I like it a lot, really.
I know some people would say it hasn't held up too well.
That it's super dated? Yeah, but that's part of the appeal for me.
Sure, I mean, I don't need my music to be timeless.
Looking at music as a historical document is much more interesting for me.
Yeah, and '60s psychedelic rock shows a lot of what changes were happening with the postwar generation.
And honestly, if you look past some of the dated production and stuff, I think its messages are pretty timeless.
Yeah, the idealism and optimism!
Exactly, and we need a lot of that today, if you ask me.
