Do you ever see any of the videos that show people with bizarre musical instruments?
Yes I have and they are so interesting! My husband shows them to me a lot.
I am always excited to hear what they sound like and what kind of music their inventor had intended them to mmake.
Have you ever seen William Close and his Earth Harp?
No. What's he all about?
Yeah that's one you have to see and experience for yourself because words are not suffcient.
That good huh?
Yes I can't imagine you not liking it. It's breath taking.
I like harps that are an amazing instrument and some are works of art to look at.
I am in total agreement with that.
I am trying to learn to play the didgeridoo and it is not easy.
I have heard that before and also that other thing they fling in circular motion off the end of a string.
What is that thing called? It's used in world music a good bit.
It's called a bullroarer and it has a very cool sound
I wonder if it is played along with didgeridoo in traditional Australian music?
I haven't a clue but they do sound very earthy and primal
Weird sounding music coming from never before seen instruments is always a treat.
Yes it's like some one who says they sing and the most amazing voice comes out of them.
I love to be surprised by someone's musicality.
I have been blown away more than once by the most unassuming people and their musical abilities.
