Do you think that animals have music?
Definitely! Birds, for example, use their "mating call" to communicate.
Any other examples of animals having music?
Yes, monkees assign a "guard" to protect the "tribe" while they sleep. Yet, they often calm the tribe with their singing as well.
Wow, that's amazing! Why is music so important?
It serves many purposes.
What are these purposes?
People think of music as an artform. Yet, there are many other functions.
Give me some examples.
Many cultures and subcultures use music as a tool to bring people together.
Yes, I can see that. At the Olympics, for example, the host country usually has a concert showing the world how proud they are of their music.
Great example! People also use music in times of strife. It helps maintain group cohesion and keep the group positive.
I see. I can also see how it can be used to communicate.
Yes, and people are not always aware of that use.
What do you mean?
Sometimes music contains subtle or hidden messages.
Wow, that's interesting. Can you give me an example.
Sure, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is more than just a silly children's song.
It is? What other purpose does it serve?
It's believed to have been made to inspire children to do great things.
