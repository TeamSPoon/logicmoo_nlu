I just thought of another cover I really like.
Okay, which one's that.
"Bette Davis Eyes" by Kim Carnes
Oh, wow, I just heard that recently on the film "Final Girls"
Yeah, I remember that.  What's crazy though is I didn't even it was a cover until about year ago.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I thought it was an original, but turns out someone in the seventies originally song it.  Uh... shoot, can't recall the name, I'd have to Google it or something.
Ahh, that's okay.
You know, what's really interesting?  A lot of people have speculated on what the song means really.
Do you have a theory?
Well, I just go with the "it's about a mysterious woman who happens to look like Bette Davis" theory myself, but I've heard some other interesting ideas.
Like what?
Well, some say the song is a allegory or drug addiction.
Actually, it seems like nearly every other rock song in existence has someone saying it's about drug addiction.
Yeah, that's true.... I don't recall the reasoning, but I know, some of them point to the line, "She's pure as New York snow." as a reference to a drug or something.
Okay, I can kind of see that.
Yeah, but to me, I've always thought the lyric was being ironic.
How so?
Well, if you know anything about snow in New York (literal snow) iit quickly becomes grey and slush because of the pollution.  As since white is usually a symbol purity the phrase "pure, ie 'white' as New York snow" is being ironic.
Hey, interesting idea.
