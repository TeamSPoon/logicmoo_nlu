Do you like 1990's films?
That is a big question, I like them, maybe not all.
I think it was a really great time for cult classics.
Like Pulp Fiction?
Exactly. That show really holds its own.
You know I have never seen it!
No way. It is one of the best cinematics ever made. You have seen other films similar right?
Clock Work Orange, does that count?
I think it does. A fish named Wanda, seen that?
Yes. That one was super deep but super funny.
That is the same genre as Pulp Fiction. What is your favorite 1990's film?
I would go with, Saving Private Ryan. Deep and moving.
That film was touching. A lot of great war films in that time.
Like Forrest Gump.
That is not a real war film, but sure. That was a wonderful movie.
I hope they never try to remake it. You can not redo that right.
It is really a one of a kind film.
I liked a few of his films around then. You have mail, super cute.
That was one of my fav rom coms of all time!
He really pulls of the cute but sardonic in that film.
