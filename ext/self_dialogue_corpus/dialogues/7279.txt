Did you like Finding Nemo?
Nope. It's one of my least favorite movies Disney has made actually.
Yeah I didn't really like it either.
It seems like almost all the Disney movies are good except for that one.
Why do you think we don't like it so much?
It's probably because there's too much kiddy stuff, I don't know.
Well all disney movies are for kids! Haha.
That's true, but the characters in this movie are annoyingly kiddish.
Yeah, I suppose that's true, but the dentist scene was pretty funny.
I'd have to agrree with you on that!
