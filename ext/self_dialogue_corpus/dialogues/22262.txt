My boyfriend wants to take me out to the movies. What's showing in cinemas right now?
To be honest with you, I have no idea. I haven't been in ages!
Me either! I tend to just watch TV at home, but he really wants to go! Help!
Ok, let's look up something. What type of movies does he like?
Hmmm well I know he loves sci-fi type of movies, but I hate them
I'm sure you can find something else. Does he like adventure movies? Most guys do
Yes! Actually, you're right - he does
The new Fast and the Furious is out now.
I've already seen it!
I thought you said you don't go to the movies...
Yes yes, I know I said that but I took my two nephews to see it last week.
Oh ok. Well then that's out... The new Pirates of the Caribbean debuts this weekend.
Oh really? That would be perfect! I know he's seen the first two
I've seen them. I love Johnny Depp because he's so good looking!
He's not really my type, but he is definitely a great actor.
Oh he's amazing. Have you ever seen Sweeney Todd?
Yeah he was really good in that. I think he was nominated for an Oscar for that actually.
Yes but I can't remember if he won or lost. He should have won!
I think he lost.
Oh well, maybe he will get nominated again for this Pirates of the Caribbean, and win this time!
