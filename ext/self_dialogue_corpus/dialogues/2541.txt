NFL Season starts in exactly 2 months with Pats, and Chiefs. Who you got?
Come on man, you can't bet against Brady and the Pats.
That is true but it's the regular season, the Chiefs are winners of the regular season.
Ha, they really are, but I'm more looking forward to the Sunday night game with the boys, and Giants.
Dak and Zeek are fun to watch.
Mix that in with OBJ and it should be a fun watch.
Who you think will take the NFC east this year?
You gotta go with the boys, because Eli stinks, The Eagles are young, and who knows what you will get out of the Skins.
I was hoping Cousins and the skins turn it around.
He is getting a raw deal in Washington. I want to see him go somewhere else.
You mean like Cleveland?
HAHA! Now that is a funny joke.
Don't know when the Browns will turn it around, but it has to happen one day.
You would think law of averages would be on their side but them and the Lions always seem to be bad.
Yep, neither have been to the Super Bowl ever, and both haven't won a championship since the 50's.
Honestly I wonder sometimes what it's like to be a fan of those teams.
It has to be rough as you are constantly bad, or just never win.
At least the Lions have some talent and are bareable to watch. The Browns are just awful.
Lions actually have a decent chance to win a few games, but the Browns are still far away.
Yep. Which means the NFL is all the same this year and the Patriots will win another Super Bowl.
