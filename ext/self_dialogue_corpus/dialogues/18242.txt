What do you think of Bryan Adams?
Bryan Adams the singer?
Yes, that's the one.
Well, when I was younger, I really enjoyed his music.  In fact, he was one of my favorites.
Nice, what about today?
To be honest, I haven't listened to much of his music recently.
Did you know that he is still putting out music?
No, I didn't realize that.  Is the music still good?
Yeah, I like it pretty well.
Which album of his is your favorite?
I would have to go with Reckless.
Oh, that is a good one!  That is one of my favorites too!
I love the song Summer of 69
That's a classic, you have to sing along with it when it comes on the radio.
Same with Heaven!
Definitely.  I also like Waking up the Neighbours.  That has some great songs on it;
I agree, but I also think that was his last excellent album.
Oh, so the rest don't measure up?
No, they have their moments, but they are just good, not great.
Thanks for asking me about him, I'm going to listen to some of his music when I get home!
