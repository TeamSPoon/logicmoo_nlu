Did you like Bobba Fett from Star Wars?
Yes, he was a great character, but when he was introduced in the Empire Strikes Back he did not have that many scenes.
I agree. I wish they gave him more screen time. Even in Return of the Jedi, he did not as much time on screen as he should have.
I was really upset when he fell into the Sarlacc pit in The Return of The Jedi.
I thought that was terrible, also. Jango Fett, who was Bobba's father in Star Wars: Attack of The Clones, had a really cool look to his armor because it was nice and shiney.
Yes, but Bobba, I felt, had a better looking armor because it was more worn, like he had seen a lot of battles.
They both looked completely the same because Bobba was a clone of his father.
That's true because Bobba Fett and the Clone Troopers were clones of Jango.
Bobba Fett was closest to Jango because Jango didn't want him altered like the Clone Troopers were.
yep because Jango wanted a son and someone who was just like he was. Bobba and Jango were great characters and I wish they would have lasted throughout the entire second trilogy and they would have shown Bobba become a bounty hunter.
