Do you remember Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks?
Oh my gosh yes! That was from some time ago.
Yes it was. It is one of my favorites.
Its a good one.  What did you like about it?
The cast, the story, the animation, and music.
Yeah it was definitely original.
Almost like a Broadway play.
Well I think Angela Lansbury was a stage actress too.
So she brought that feel, I think.
I would say so. Now I'm feeling nostalgic.
