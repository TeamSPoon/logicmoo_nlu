Did you get around to listening to the Lady Gaga album that came out last year?
You know I haven't really listened to her since the "Bad Romance" days.
The new CD is definitely worth a listen! She's got a powerhouse of a voice.
Are there any standout tracks?
There's a beautiful ballad type song, "Million Reasons." But I do admit it's not quite up to the level of her older music.
How do you think she's maturing as an artist?
She's more restrained now, I think. Maybe a little less flashy? The huskiness of her voice comes through more now.
Her earlier music added a lot of distractions to her voice. I think I'd like this style more.
I think so, too! Also check out the track, "A-YO." That's a fun dancing song.
Could always use a good song to wake up to in the morning!
