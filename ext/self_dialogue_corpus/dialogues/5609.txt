Have you seen the third Toy Story.
No, but I have seen the first two.
You should see it. I think it's my favorite out of the three.
Oh really? I loved the first two. Woody and Buz are my favorite characters.
Ya three seemed like it had a great message for adults about how fast life goes.
Oh man that does sound interesting. I know Andy is getting older and going away to college.
Ya and then all the toys have to deal with that where they don't know what is going to happen to them.
Thanks for reminding me of that I guess I will have to watch it.
I think if you loved Toy Story and Toy Store two you would really like it.
Didn't they kind of deal with that in two with Jessy feeling sad about loosing the girl she had been with?
