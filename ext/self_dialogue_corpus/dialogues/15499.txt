Are you a fan of Gwen Stefani's music?
Yes, how did you know?
It was just a guess. It seemed like the kind of music you might like.
Yeah, I've enjoyed her music since her days fronting No Doubt.
No Doubt was a good band.
My friends and I used to dance to 'Just a Girl' and 'Spiderwebs' whenever it would come on the radio or MTV.
Do you prefer her solo work, or her work with No Doubt?
I'd probably say her No Doubt songs.
Why is that?
I think some of it is probably just my age when No Doubt was performing vs. when she was making solo music.
What does age have to do with it.
At least for me, music that I liked a lot in my teenage years is special for me.
OK, I can understand that. It's sort of the same way for me too.
It's a time when you're sort of trying to figure out who you are as a person, and how the world works.
Which can be a messy experience.
Right. And music can be the thing that makes you feel better when you're not quite succeeding.
And No Doubt was a band you leaned on in that respect as a teenager?
Oh, definitely. They were a big part of my musical adolescence.
I personally like Gwen Stefani's later stuff a little more than No Doubt, but I understand where you're coming from.
Her newer stuff is quite good too!
