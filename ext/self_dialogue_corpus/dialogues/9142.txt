I just got a bunch of really good rock the other day.
What did you get?
I was at this thrift store and bought some old floppy disks that had a bunch of music store on dhem.
Wow, that's a score.
Yeah, there were all sorts of classics on there.
Like what songs?
There were all sorts of songs,but a lot of rock classics by bands like Pink Floyd, the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Doors.
Yeah, I forget how good that stuff is.
Yeah, it never stops being good.
One of my favorites by the Stones was on there, Sympathy for the Devil.
