Have you been getting ready for the new Fantasy season?
Not really, I've got a lot of studying to do still.
You should get on that! Everyone's been getting really intense with it.
Ya, everyone usually does haha.
I'm still not sure who I want my first pick to be, There's so many good choices.
Ya, I'm not really sure either, I was thinking about maybe getting Gronk or Brady.
Those are good players, but I'm not sure if that's the route you should go.
What makes you say that?
I'm just not sure if they're good first picks ya know?
I guess so.
They just might not get as many points as some other choices.
Ya, you're right, I definitely need to do some research.
Ya, we're going to have a draft party in about 2 weeks.
Oh really? Is everyone going to be there?
Ya of course! We got a nice 4K TV just for this season.
Oh that sounds awesome! I guess I'll have to start doing some research, huh?
Ya, I would get on that, we're upping the stakes this year too.
Oh really? Are we putting in more money than normal?
Ya, everyone is thinking about putting in $50 so there's a huge prize pool.
That sounds cool, I'm definitely game for that.
