What kind of music are you listening to right now?
Oh I'm listening to metal.
Really? I love metal music. What band are you listening to?
You wouldn't know who they are even if I told you.
Why do you say that?
Because I'm listening to a Japanese metal band. They are not exactly popular here in the US.
You'd be surprised, I've listened to bands from all over the world. As long as it's metal, I'm a huge fan.
Okay, the band I'm listening to is called Galneryus. Ever heard of them?
Actually I have. Their guitarist, Syu, is insanely good. His speed and accuracy is almost legendary.
Ah! So are you a big fan of them as well?
Not really. Galneryus has more of a symphonic metal sound, I'm more into the hardcore stuff.
I see. So what bands would you recommend then?
Well, since you like bands from Japan, I would definitely suggest you give Maximum the Hormone a listen.
I've never actually heard of them.
Well, you're in for a treat then.
Where would I find their music?
You can always check them out on Youtube. Their music videos on there are pretty wild.
I definitely will do that later tonight. Any other suggestions?
Have you ever tried Baby Metal?
Oh no! I'd rather go deaf than listen to that drivel.
