Hey NFL Training Camp starts in a few weeks!
I'm pretty excited. Do you think the Packers can win the Super Bowl this year?
With Aaron Rodgers it's always possible.
I think he'll love throwing the Martellus Bennett.
That dude is awesome. Do you follow his Twitter?
It was funny when he had fans vote on his jersey number.
The defense doesn't look too good though...
I am hoping for a bounce back year from some of the young corners.
Do you think Dom Capers should be fired?
He is starting to get old.
I can't believe all the people who want Mccarthy fired.
He has one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL.
Or what about Ted Thompson retiring?
I would love if they pick up the old Chiefs GM.
Are you going to any games?
Maybe a preseason game.
We are going to Family Fun Night.
Awesome!
Go Pack!
Go Pack!
