Hey, you know who I've been listening to lately?
Who?
Cyndi Lauper!  I love her music.
Oh yeah, I love her too!  She kinda reminds me of Madonna.
Yeah, but their music is different.
I don't know.  They both were female pop artists from the same time period.
Yeah, true.  Well Do you remember her True Colors album?
Of course!  I loved that album.
Me too.  And Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was the best.
Yeah that was one of my favorites.
She did the soundtrack for The Goonies, did you know that?
No, but I know she got a Best New Artist Grammy award in 1985.  I remember seeing it!
Oh wow.  That's totally unsurprising though.
Yeah.  I don't think she had the same level of fame as Madonna though.
Yeah, Madonna was probably more popular.
Yeah.  Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was supposedly one of the best videos of its time though.
Yeah, and Cyndi Lauper did win an incredible amount of awards.
It's possible that they are neck and neck for fame.
Well, I like Madonna's music better, but I do love Cyndi Lauper too.
I guess I agree.  I would pick Madonna too.
