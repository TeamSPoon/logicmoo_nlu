Do you think the ghost of Yoda will be in the next movie?
I sure hope so, that little alien is my favorite.
Mine too! I love when he is in the swamp and he has gone slightly mad.
Right? Like, if I was Like and showed up and this slightly crazy alien was supposed to help me, I'd be a little worried.
Yeah, but he couldn't leave because his ship was sunk in the mud.
I love the part where Yoda is digging through his food.
There was probably not a lot of good snacks in the swamp.
Maybe Yoda was looking for Space Doritos.
He could use the force to make them appear.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Unless your midichorians are really off the scale.
