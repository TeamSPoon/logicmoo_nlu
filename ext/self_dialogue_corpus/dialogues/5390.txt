So did you see the Duck Tales movie from the 1990's?
I totally did. It was excellent.
I watched it again recently. All I can say is: I want a money bin!
Ha! And are you going to swim in a sea of gold coins? I think that would hurt.
It's totally doable. If Scrooge can do it, I can too.
Did the nephews ever swim in the bin?
I can't recall. Huey, Dewey and Louie right?
Yeah. I don't think Scrooge would let them near the money.
No, he was pretty guarded with it.
Well he's Scottish. He can't help it.
