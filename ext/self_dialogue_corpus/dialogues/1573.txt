I can't wait for football season to start.
Me too! Who do you think will be good this year?
I think the Steelers might be able to make a Super Bowl run.
Interesting. They'll have to keep Big Ben healthy for once.
Agreed. I also think the Packers can win the Super Bowl.
I don't think that they have a good enough defense to make it.
Yeah, it needs to be better but they do have Aaron Rodgers.
He always gives you a chance. What do you think about the Falcons?
I think they'll take a step back. I'm still surprised they made to the Super Bowl.
They really blew that game. I also think they won't make it back.
I am interested to see how the Cowboys do this year.
Me too! I was surprised by how well Dak Prescott played.
I'm afraid him and  Elliot will have a Sophomore Slump and they'll miss Romo.
What about the Patriots? They could repeat.
True. It's hard to bet against Brady.
He's just too good.
If I had to put money on it, I'd pick the Patriots to win it again.
Good bet but I would take a chance on a sleeper.
Who would be your sleeper?
I would pick the Broncos.
