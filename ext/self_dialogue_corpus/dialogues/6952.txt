Did you watch high school musical?
Yes those were really good.
I loved watching teoy bolton and his inner conflicts
And the music was really catchy
Yes it was
They were good, ive seen them so many times
Me too, they are addictive
And i know all the words to the songs
Me too
I womder if they plan on making another one
