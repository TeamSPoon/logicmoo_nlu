Who is your favorite rock band?
I grew up in the 80s so I like a lot of rock bands from the 80s.
Oh, what is your favorite band from back then.
I think I like Bon Jovi the best.
Do you have any favorite song?
I know it is the most popular but I liked Livin' on a Prayer.
Do you like anything else.
I like a bunch of them like You Give Love a Bad Name, Bad Medicine, Runaway,
I wish I could go see them play.
Not sure if they play any more but I saw a cover band a couple years ago which was fun.
