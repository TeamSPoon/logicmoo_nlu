Any chance you think the Celtics go to the Finals?
Who says theyre topping Washington?
Isaiah Thomas will make sure they keep winning.
Not so much, John Wall is going nuts.
He comes up small sometimes.
He might but this team looks better than most.
Crazy to think the Celtics might have a top 3 pick.
Oh they definitely will.
We dont know that for sure.
We find out in 8 days.
If they do they may be good for years.
The NBA is so hit or miss you never know.
I think they will have success for a while.
I dont know, free agency kills dynasties.
Tell that to LeBron James.
he creates his own
all conversations come back to him
you know that. hes the face of the NBA.
Well he wont win the chip this year.
Strangers things have happened
