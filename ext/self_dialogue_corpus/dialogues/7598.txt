I wonder in the movies would be like if the series just continued as movies
Like no more books
Yeah no more books just movies
Well that would be interesting
I mean they could take a more visual approach
I mean i guess it would be interesting
To bad we shall never know
I mean take what you got though
I mean you are right
Yeah i totally am
