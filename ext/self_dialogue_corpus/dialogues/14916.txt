Best comedy movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars?
There aren't that many.  Comedies are mostly ignored by the Academy.
Why?
I guess they figure making people laugh is easy and doesn't deserve recognition.  But if you make them cry while some kid stands up to a bully while dancing ballet and being raised by a single mother in World War II.. then you've accomplished something.
Tootsie is really funny and it got nominated for Best Picture.
Yeah but it didn't win.
A lot of good movies don't win, not just comedy movies.
Yeah but they're usually better than the ones who do.
Do you think we'll ever see a Will Ferrell movie or Jim Carrey movie get nominated for Best Picture?
Hahahahaha, not a chance
