I think the Cubs are starting to get a little too confident.  They got shut out again today.
It's only a matter of time before the bats start heating up.
I'm just worried that everyone is a bit too relaxed after the World Series win.  It's as if there's nothing to play for anymore.
Are you serious?
Yeah, I mean Javi Baez and Wilson Contreras are swinging at everything.
That's only two guys.
True, but Rizzo and Bryant aren't putting the ball in play very much either.  Tons of strikeouts.
I understand, I think it's just too early to judge.
And then there's the starting pitching problem.  Arrieta got destroyed last time out.
I'm afraid he might be on the decline.
Think he's getting a big contract cuz we shouldn't give it to him.
He'll probably find a suitor, but I think we got his best two years ago.
I agree.  Lester still can't throw to first base, huh?
Nope.  Absolutely incredible for such an elite pitcher.
It blows my mind every time I watch him.
You think he'd practice in the offseason or something.
I know, apparently the organization isn't too concerned.  I'm worried it will bite him one day.
I feel like it does one way or another in every start.
Good thing we have four other good starters.
That's for sure.
