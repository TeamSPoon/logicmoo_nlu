What is your favorite Lady Gaga song? Mine is Telephone.
My favorite Lady Gaga song is Born This Way.
I like that one too. She is a great singer.
She seems to be doing more acting lately though.
I think she is working on a new album.
I hope she is. Did you know Lady Gaga originally wrote Telephone for Britney Spears?
I didn't know that. I wonder why Britney turned it down?
It worked out for the best because Lady Gaga rocked it.
Telephone always puts me in a good mood.
I love how upbeat her music is.
