I just saw a Facebook memory the other day from high school. It was about some Scene/Emo bands I used to listen to.
Scene phase, What an embarrassing phase, worse than the 80's trends.
Yeah it was like Emo 80's vengeance,
So what did you listen to?
Lot's of weird myspace stuff, like Jeffree Star, Geoffrey paris, Millionaires, 3o3, Medic Droid, hollywood undead, blood on the dancefloor...
So much noise and color and candy and makeup and hair....wasn't really my scene. I listened to 303, gaga, kesha...whatever was on the radio.
speaking of kesha...what's she been up to lately?
well she got out of her contract or whatever with that weirdo producer, but I don't think I've heard any music from her recently, and it would be an opportune time to drop a single.
when I first hear of her, I didn't really like her. she was part of that remake of 'you spin me right round'...I hated it.
but, tick tock was catchy?
yeah, I can agree with that.
What is a Jeffree Star?
Don't be rude...Jeffree Star is a dude that feels comfortable presenting himself in a very feminine way. He's gotten famous as a makeup artist and even launched a rather successful line of cosmetics. He also performs, and sings.
Well I respect the success, I just don't like the look.
That's what caught my eye, but I feel that Jeffree star has Stagnated as a musical artist.
I do like his tattoos of Elvis and Kurt Kobain.
That's a true artistic homage that I think anyone can appreciate Two legends from very different ideas.
My grandmother used to faint at the sight of Elvis
My sister fainted at the sight of Kurt Kobain!
That is too funny!
