What did you think of the end of Cloverfield Lane?
It should have ended five minutes earlier, got a little hard to believe.
Would you see Logan in black and white?
Absolutely, with modern black and white effects, that movie would be amazing.
What do you think of old westerns?
They serve the purpose of being building blocks for modern greats.
Did you think Billy Bob Thorton played an adequate Davy Crocket?
Absolutely.  Even though the movie lost a great deal of money, he played a solid role.
Do you ever watch "B" movies?
When I'm extremely bored!  Titanic 2 was my favorite.
What is your favorite De'Caprio movie?
Definitely Shutter Island or Inception.  Shutter Island was such a dark twisted movie, I'd probably have to go with that.
Do you like it when they remake the great comedies?
Absolutely not.  Blues Brothers 2000 was awful as well as Dumb and Dumber To, Caddy Shack 2, Airplane 2, ect.
What do you think of the Star Wars Reboot!
This is the way those movies should have been the whole time?
Do you like documentary styled movies such as Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield?
I think they were cutting edge for their times, especially Blair Witch Project.  I remember not everyone was sure if that was fake or not.
Who is your least favorite actor of all time?
Kevin Costner.  He ruins almost every movie he is in with his accents.  Field of Dreams was a great movie, though.
