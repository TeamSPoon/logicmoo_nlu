I saw Pocahontas on a plane ride yesterday.
What'd you think?
Awful movie.
You're awful!  What did you hate it.
Mel Gibson did a horrible job as John Smith.
He wasn't in it that much really.
Yeah, but every scene, all I can think about was how I don't like Mel Gibson
So really, it's not about not liking the movie, it's about you not liking Mel Gibson.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
You should give the movie another try, just mute his parts.
