What is your least favorite part of Star Wars?
Well I guess I could say that the prequel movies aren't as good as the original trilogy, but that's a bit obvious.
Well yeah
I don't know. Maybe the Ewoks?
The Ewoks? Why?
Just felt like they never really fit. Like George Lucas just injected some teddy bears into the series to sell more toys, or something.
Now I kinda liked them. I wasn't obsessed with them or anything, but I liked some of their antics.
Well you were a lot younger when that movie came out than I was.
I guess. I suppose they definitely have a different feel than the rest of the series up to that point.
Yeah I never bothered checking out any of those Ewok spinoff movies. I had enough of them the first time.
