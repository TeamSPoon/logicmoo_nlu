Hey, have you seen the movie Logan?
Yeah what a great story.
I know, What an awesome limmo.
It was nice, He drove it like he stole it.
The other guys were getting old and he barely aged.
Right, the girl had powers like him and was even faster.
The guy hunting them down was a piece. He really was a psycho.
The equipment they used was awesome.
The girl was really smart and they made it to where they were going.
They had some really good fight scenes and some innocent people were killed.
I like how the arrogant farmer, had no idea who he was messing with.
Got what they deserved.
They showed some beautiful country up towards Canada.
Oh yeah, I would like to visit that part of the country sometime.
Too bad the heroes were killed but they took out the bad buys as well.
Oh yeah, I cried in a few scenes.
I liked how they had new vehicles like used vehicles.
Some nice rides for sure.
Maybe they will have a next generation of X-men from this.
That would be awesome.
