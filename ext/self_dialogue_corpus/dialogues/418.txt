Hey there.  You excited about the upcoming season?  What's your team?
You betcha I am.  Packers all the way!  I can't wait....
Actually, I was talking to that gentleman over there.  But since you butted in like a typical Packer fan, I guess I'll talk to you.
Better off anyway.  No sense talking about anything other than the Pack.  Goin all the way!!!!
Typical response.  How's the weather been around your place?
It's great weather for a game.  I can't wait for the Green and Gold to beat down the opposition this year and bring the trophy back to Title Town where it should really permanently sit.
I see you've brought it back to the Packers.  So you are confident this year?
Of course.  Nelson is the best receiver in the league; Rodgers is the best QB; the defense will be much better because we have more inexperienced rookies in the secondary; and we have a brand new running back that hasn't yet been physically broken down by a full season of games.
And the best always rise to the top, don't they?
Heck yes.  That's why they always make the playoffs.
But don't necessarily win.  Did they rise to the top against the Falcons last year?
That was only because of the bad call against the fullback when he supposedly fumbled!
What about that Seahawk game?  Did they rise to the top when they were up by 9 with 4 minutes left?
That's not fair!  They were ripped off.  There were so many penalties that weren't called!
Didn't they lead the league in scoring in 2011 but got stuffed by the Giants?  And if I recall, the refs were looking for ways to get the Packers back into the game.
The Giants stole all of our signals!  They cheated.
Nope, that was the Giants vs. Vikings.  Nice try though.  What about when Favre threw that late interception to the Giants?
I don't talk about him.  He's a traitor.
So you still think that they're destined to win?
After they've been hosed so many times, how can I not?
