I love Christmas music.
I do too, which is your favorite?
A lot of different kinds but one song that sticks out in particular is "All I want for You" by Mariah Carey.
I remember that! Such a classic.
Yes I even hear it on the radio around Christmas time.
I do too. I love her music.
She has such a soulful and beautiful voice.
She's not bad on the eyes either.
No she's not, she's gorgeous.
Remember her song "Hero"?
Of course I do. That was such a meaningful song.
Yes it really was, made me cry.
You know which song really made me cry?
Which one was that?
"One Sweet Day". Oh my goodness that made me bawl like a baby when my friend passed away.
Yes I remember that song! It was so touching.
I know, we played the song at her funeral and cried and cried.
She is really an amazing artist.
I know it! Wasn't she married to Nick Cannon?
Yes she was but they divorced.
