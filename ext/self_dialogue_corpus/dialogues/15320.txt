I wonder why Skrillex hasn't come out with a new album in years.
Yeah, that sucks.  I'd love to hear some new work from him.
Agreed.  He's so talented.
I think he's been working on random projects with other artists.
Like who?
Justin Bieber I think.
What a waste of time.  He should concentrate on his own music.
Totally!  The Spring Breakers soundtrack was great!
Yeah I think that's the last thing he produced.
I heard he came out with some cell phone case.
What does it do?
No idea, it never took off... hence why he should focus only on his music career.
He's so young still, he's got time to dabble in other ventures.
I guess but why bother, he's wasting his talent on cell phone cases.
Maybe he's just not inspired to make music right now.
Perhaps.  Maybe he used up all his beats rewriting the same tunes over and over again.
I wonder if he's dating anyone.
Not sure but I know he broke up with that Elle girl that was in one of his songs.
That sucks, I liked her.
Yeah, she really could have benefited from his stardom.
