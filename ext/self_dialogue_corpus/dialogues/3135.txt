Did you know that the Philadelphia Eagles started in 1933?
Really? I thought it was much later.
No the NFL tea started in 1933 as the Eagles, In 1943 changed their name to the Steagles.
The Steagles?????
Yes but that only lasted for one year then it was back to the Eagles.
They were bought for 25000 I heard.
yes. They ahd a great season in the forties as well.
Wow.
In the fifties they were not too great though and have had their ups and downs through the years.
Yes I guess so.
I guess all NFL teams have that happen.
Yea it has happened to the best, the Steelers, the Cowboys and others.
Did the Eagles ever win a superbowl game.
Yes they did a couple of times.
I would love to go to the Superbowl.
Me too.
Tickets are probably a 1000 bucks for that.
Most likely. Nothing is cheap anymore.
Well  guess I could save the money.
Probably, maybe we can go together.
