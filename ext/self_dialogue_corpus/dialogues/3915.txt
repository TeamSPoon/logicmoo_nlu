Have you seen Gone Girl?
Oh my, that is one freaky movie.
Yeah, I saw it in the theaters. I haven't watched in on TV because I think it'll freak me out when I'm alone.
Ha ha.  Just as long as you don't live in the Midwest.
But I do! I think the girl in that movie deserved an Oscar.
Yeah, she was great. Affleck was great too.
I feel bad for him at the end.  I mean, he's bad but not that bad.
I agree. I mean, she was a murderer.
And had tried to get him to framed for murder.
Yeah, that was a suprising movie.
