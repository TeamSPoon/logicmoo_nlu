So are you following the NBA playoffs this year?
Yeah, I've caught several of the Spurs vs. Warriors games.
Ooh, I hope you're not a Spurs fan.
I mean, I was, until these last three games.
Just a fair weather fan?
When you're getting beat that badly, yeah.
To be fair, y'all had a lot of injuries this season.
Oh I have some choice words for Zaza.
Him taking out Kawhi in game 1 like that was pretty brutal.
Brutal? It was completely uncalled for and Zaza should be taken out.
Taken out of the game, I hope you mean. His family received death threats over it.
For real? Look, I'm mad at Zaza but don't take it out on his family.
Yeah. Him missing games two and three pretty much wrecked the Spurs chances.
Warriors would have to mess up pretty badly at this point, they utterly wrecked us in game three.
They looked pretty chill on the bench at the end there.
I mean, give us a break. They've got three of the top players in the conference, and we're down one.
Did you hear that Zaza's likely to be out for game four?
Seriously? We're definitely not winning any games then.
Yeah. I think they figured there were no chances of the Spurs winning the match up so they might as well not risk injuring him more.
That's fair I guess. Safety and health first, even if it means losing games.
