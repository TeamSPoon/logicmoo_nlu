What do you think Luke's been doing on a deserted island for all those years?
I would think trying to find something to eat.
He had to have learned from Yoda how to keep his mind busy.
I bet he spent time standing by the shore seeing how far he could skip rocks with his mind.
Why do you keep coming up with weird thoughts?
I don't know, he was on an island with nobody and nothing around, there's only so much he can do.
I bet he thought a lot about his dad.
You mean Darth?
Luuuuuke, I am your father.
He doesn't even say that line!
