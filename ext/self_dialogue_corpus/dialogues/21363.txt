Have you ever watched the movie Lonesome Dove?
Yes, I've watched it several times. It came out in the 80's didn't it?
Yes it did. It was a miniseries on tv.
I don't normally care for Westerns, but this movie is a classic.
I think so too! Who was your favorite character?
Probably Gus, played by Robert DuVall.
I loved his character, but Tommy Lee Jones who played the Captain was mine.
Do you have any other favorite Western movies?
True Grit, probably.
It was good, but I hate movies where they show animals dying and that horse dying after he was run to death, just broke my heart.
Right, I had forgotten about that scene.
I can hardly stand to watch a movie when I see an animal dies.
Me either. I always watch for the credits at the end to see that statement they make saying no animals were harmed in the making of this film.
hahaha I thought I was the only person who did that.
Back to Lonesome Dove..... do you have a favorite scene? Mine is when Gus is dying and the Captain is by his bedside.
And Gus says...."By gol Woodrow, it's been quite a party."......
Doesn't that just tug at your heart?
Totally.
It's going to be on television again this Sunday. Want to watch the movie together?
Love to!
