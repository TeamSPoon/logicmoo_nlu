I was thinking the other day about the beginning of hip hop.
Yeah, what about it?
I was thinking about the spirit of Rapper's Delight
That was, and is, the ultimate get up and move song
The flow was so naturalu you didn't question what it was when you first heard it.
True
The words stick to your brain no matter how long its been
That is a part of the rounds of hip hop: words
Word form at and a story creation that you can relate to
The story flows on
