The Reds are officially in a slump right now.
Yeah the Rockies ran all over them last night.
What was the final score again?
The Rockies crushed them 12-6.
Yeah Alexi Amarista had a phenomenal game last night.
Yeah he hit a 3 run homer last night.
I think he ended up with 4 RBI for the evening.
Can you believe it? The Rockies have more wins this year than any other National League team.
No I can't believe it! I did not foresee this at the beginning of the year.
I don't think anyone did.
Lisalverto Bonilla got pounded last night.
Yeah this team is in trouble they have lost 7 in a row.
They need to turn it around fast because they are in a tough division.
Yeah and they are asking Tim Adelman to be the one to stop the bleeding.
Yeah he left his last start early because of a stiff neck
They better hope that he is feeling much better tomorrow.
They need a quality start from somebody in that rotation right now.
Yeah Bonilla is the first pitcher they have had to go more than 5 innings since the losing streak started
Yeah that won't win you many games in this league
No, it will have you at the bottom of the standings.
