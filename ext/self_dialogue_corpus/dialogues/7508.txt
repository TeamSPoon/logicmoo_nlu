What do you think the saddest part of the series is?
It's a toss up between the death of Dumbledore or Fred's death.
The whole Dumbledore death and lead up was phenomenally done.
Agreed, from the cave scene on I had a feeling but I didn't think it would happen.
Then Dumbledore begging for death when Harry forced the potion down his throat. Heartbreaking.
Oh that part killed me. Then when they get back and get to the tower.
Oh no! I always hated Malfoy, but in that moment I'm not sure if I hated him or pitied him.
Clearly he's despicable, but I felt for him a little too.
Then, with his final act of power, Dumbledore keeps Harry bound under the cloak.
And Harry only realizing he was free because Dumbledore had died. Oh, I hated it so much but it was so well done.
