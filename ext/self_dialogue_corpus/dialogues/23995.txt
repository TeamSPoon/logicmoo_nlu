Did you see the 2009 movie, Moon?
Yes
How did you like it?
It was sad
Yeah, they kept those clones ready to be brought to life
That was unethical in so many different ways
It was sad that they couldn't provide proper medical care for them
It didn't look like they aged very well or lived very long
They could have just had regular clones, not sure what the deal was with those inanimate bodies
It doesn't really have any scientific basis, those weren't normal clones
They were basically corpses
I am glad that the man went free at the end
It was really sad when the family member was not the real person
It made it more sad that it was a real person, but not the right age
It would have been lonely on the moon by yourself
It was chilling when the people came to check on him
Yeah, they just  said the one name, not knowing there were two of him
You would think that the clones would figure out what was going on right away
The robot had to be persuaded to tell the truth
The robot was the only nice thing about the cloners
