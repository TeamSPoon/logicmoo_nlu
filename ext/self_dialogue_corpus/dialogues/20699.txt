John Belushi was a great comedian,but what do you think of him as,an actor?
I think he was great.
Me too,even though most of his movies have been comedies.
And classic comedies at that.
The Blues Brothers is just all around good.
Yes,funny and fantastic music.
I know. Aretha Franklin,James Brown,Ray Charles.
Incredible musicians,all of them.
That's putting it mildly.
I could watch Animal House over and over again.
I have watched it over and over again.
I thought Neighbors was great too.
Not really critically acclaimed but I liked it too.
I liked 1941 too.
Me too. Big Belushi fan.
He's a big favorite of mine since Saturday Night Live.
It started his big career.
His career unfortunately was too short.
That was a shame with his problems.
It's happened to a lot of actors though.
