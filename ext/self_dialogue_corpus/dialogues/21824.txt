I went and saw that movie Split the other day at the theater.
Oh wow, I saw it couple of days ago.
Who was your favorite of the personalities that Kevin turned into?
I thought the best was Hedwig. The best part was when he was dancing to the Kanye West song in his room.
That part was pretty funny. James McAvoy was able to do a great job portraying each role, he was really believable.
I thought he did a good job jumping back and forth between the characters and making each one its own.
Im glad they didn't put all 23 personalities in the movie though. It would have been too complicated.
I agree, sometimes it was hard to remember between the names and personalites.
There were a lot of good parts though like when he killed the therapist.
I know right? I was kinda mad that she was so oblivious and went to his house.
I had a feeling he was going to let Casey go though, I thought it was a little predictable.
I thought all 3 girls were going to get killed when he turned into the Beast.
The part I didn't get was the ending where Bruce Willis talks about Mr. Glass. What was that about?
The reference is to another movie by the same director called Unbreakable.
Whats that movie about?
It has Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in it. Bruce has superhuman powers and abilities; he is able to see what crimes people have committed by touching them.
So unless you have seen the movie you wouldn't get the referance?
Exactly. You should go watch it, it is just as good as Split.
Yeah, I wiil have to watch it then when Split comes out on DVD I will have to watch that one again too.
Good idea!
