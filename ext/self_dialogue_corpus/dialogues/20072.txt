How quick of a career arc did Vince Vaughnn have?
Does it matter?
Yeah in terms of comedians, they usually have a bit longer.
Wedding Crashers is still a hilarious movie.
I understand it will stand the test of time.
Yeah so he can just ride that one out.
He did Dodgeball and Couples Retreat too.
Both phenomenal for their genre.
He doesnt have to do much after that.
But has he been in anything that has come close to Wedding Crashers?
No, but thats the point of film.
To make one good movie? Tell that to Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro.
Totally different genres, they were drama guys.
Meet the Fockers isnt drama.
Well you take breaks from stuff to do different things.
I just wished actors stayed in their lanes.
They dont because I am sure it gets boring for them.
I wouldnt be bored making millions doing the same kind of film.
They are trying to avoid being type casted.
I can see that, just dont see the big deal in it.
