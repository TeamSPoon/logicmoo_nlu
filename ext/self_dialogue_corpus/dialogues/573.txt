Do you think the Pittsburgh Steelers play dirty?
Regardless they are a successful team.
Yeah six championships since 1974 isn't to bad
Some teams go through such long droughts.
Exactly that franchise has tasted success several times.
They must want to end the current nine year drought though.
They should just focus on getting better each year.
Sure they can win next year but progress is the first step.
It all starts with improvement game by game.
Even if they have bad chemistry at the start of the season that can change.
I can't disagree with that.
Ben Roethlisberger helps their chances of success.
Yeah he has been a good Quarterback for them.
He has led them to two of their six total champions!
Wow having started his career in 2004 that is impressive.
Exactly a third of their championships in the last half century are because of him.
If he wins them another one before his career ends that would be special.
It really would be special for him and the franchise.
Well I'm excited to see the Steelers play next season.
I am also excited about it!
