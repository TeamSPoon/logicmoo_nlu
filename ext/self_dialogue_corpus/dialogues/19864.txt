You know CMA is in town next week.
Yeah, I know. I hate the traffic, but love all these free concerts around town...
Do you know who's giving free concerts?
I think Lone Stars, Keith Someone...the one married to Nicole Kidman...
Yeah, I know who yo mean.
And Maybe Justin Aldeen.
Awesome, I'll look into them. I'd love to catch some free concerts.
Besides, there are always some musicians playing at the Tooties and Honky tonk...
I saw Cat Stevens at some little place downtown last year...just by chance.
Was it at the Blue bird?
No, some little place by the Printer's Alley...
That's cool. I love that area...more Blues than country...
I know, after a while I get tired of country music and need some change.
Good thing living in Nashville. We are never short of music.
Except for the crazy traffic, it is cool. Music is everywhere.
Even our church worship team is pretty much professional musicians.
You know Taylor Swift lives here, too, right?
Yes, of course I never run into her...
I love her music though...
Me, too.she is so talented...
