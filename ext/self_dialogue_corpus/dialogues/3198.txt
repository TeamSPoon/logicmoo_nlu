I am so ready for NFL season!
I will be glued to my TV on Thursday, September 7th.
Oh yes, the Patriots and the Chiefs are playing the first game.
What teams are playing the second game of the season?
The Jets and the Bills have the first game on Sunday, September 10th.
Oh yeah, but the Eagles and the Redskins are playing at the same time on a different network.
I didn't realize the games were at the same time.
I guess I need to have two TVs up and running that day.
Yes, I have the NFL package, so I get to watch all the games.
Can I come over for some of the late afternoon games on Sunday?
Sure, Colts and Rams are on at 4:05 that day.
Sounds good. Seahawks and Packers will start shortly after.
Panthers and 49ers are at the same time.
Don't forget Sunday Night Football that night!
Oh yeah, Giants and Cowboys will be a great game.
My brother is a huge Dak Prescot fan.
I bet he'll have a great year.
Probably so. What time do you think that game will end?
It starts at 8:30. It probably won't end until close to midnight.
Maybe I better plan on spending the night at your house.
