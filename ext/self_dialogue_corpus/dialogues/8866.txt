Who was the band that did the song for the "More Cowbells" skit on SNL?
Blue Oyster Cult?
Oh yeah.  Did they have any other songs besides that?
Yeah, they had a few.
What were they?
Well, the most popular was probably "Burnin for You."
Right.  I have heard that before.
I know.  It's just you always associate them with The Reaper.
Yeah, The Reaper has that awesome guitar solo.
That's one of my favorite solos ever.  I love it.
