Gosh, i cant get that stupid song out of my head
Huh?  What song
You know - thaaaat song...goes da da da da
hahah - yeah, I think I know which one you mean.  it is catchy
Yeah but its by that singer.  You know, that popstar singer.  I don't like that kind of music.  I am more of a grunge kind of guy.
well - hey, I mean she has many platinum albums, so obviously a lot of other people think her music is catchy, too
Yeah, I guess - I just dont like that teeny bopper music
Well, I think shes like 30 now, but shes also been singing and stuff since forever.  Remember when she came out when were in high school?
Yeah, man - everybody looooved that first song.  It was all over the place.  I am humming it in my head now!
Well, I told you its catchy.  But I think shes a good entertainer.  I am not a huge fan, but I can respect what she does. She makes music that just makes people feel good.
Yeah, I can see that.  I think I read she went through a lot of bad things transitioning from child star to adult
Yeah, I remember that.  I think thats why I dont mind her music, shes been through a lot and I guess now she just wants to have fun
yeah, but I like artists who write their own stuff and make their own music
I mean, I do too, but at the same time, i can appreciate a silly pop song now and then.  I think its fun to just hear a song about dancing and whatnot, as an escape
Would you ever see her in concert?
No, I dont think so, but i think I'll just hum along with you, haha
But I looked it up and she has a new album coming out in like three weeks.
yeah, I think i saw she already released her new single
Lets find it online!
And we can hum along!
