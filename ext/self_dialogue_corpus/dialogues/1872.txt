So give me your favorite NFL memory.
Well, I'd say The Catch.  When Frisco scored on the Cowboys in the NFC Title.
Oh, yeah.  Montana to Clark.  Great one.
How bout you.  What's your favorite NFL memory?
Hmm.  The Fogbowl at Soldier Stadium with the Bears against the Eagles.
Yeah, that was a weird game.  You could hardly see the game as it was being played.
Then there was the Icebowl.
Was that the Thanksgiving game between Dallas and the Eagles?
No, it was Green bay against Dallas to see who was going to go to the first Superbowl
That's right and GB went on to beat the Colts.
Yeah, Baltimore Colts back then.
Did you see that one I was talking about on Thanksgiving where there was ice on the field at Dallas.
Yeah, against the Dolphins.  I think they call that the snowbowl. It was snow on the field.
Right and Leon Lett did the "Lett factor" again and Dallas lost the game.
I also loved the Superbowl moment when John Elway flung himself sideways over the endzone line for a TD.
He had a pretty good run those last two seasons to end his carrier that's for sure.
He sure did.  I wish that Manning had gone out that way.
Yeah, he was kind of like Montana in that he should have retired a year earlier.
Never want to see the legends decline.
Nope.  Rather see them go out on top like Elway did.
