I see there is a new movie coming out on June 30th.
Oh really which one?
Despicable Me 3.
Oh I love them.
I love the Minions.
Me too.
This one is the continuing adventure of Gru and Lucy and their daughters.
Maybe I will go see it.
I think I am going to take my grandkids.
Good Idea for a hot humid day.
Yea I took them to see the last one and they loved it.
Yea I love those Minions!
Yea and I am sure they will come out with all sorts of new toys based on the movie.
Oh they always do!
Have you seen any of the others?
Sure I have seen all of them.
I did not see the first movie.
Well maybe you should.
Yea I will  get the dvd.
I have it if you want it.
