So, what's your favorite sport?
Football is my number one.
I love the NFL as well.
Who's your favorite team?
I grew up in New York, so I've always been a Giants fan.
Wow, I grew up in New York too and I'm a Jets fan.
Who was your favorite Jet ever?
Ken O'Brien was my guy back in the day, and you?
Lawrence Taylor from the powerhouse teams of the 1980's.
Yeah, he was one of the best I have ever seen.
You can't be too happy with where the Jets are at right now.
Nothing but more pain as a Jets fan.
Who's going to be the quarterback this year?
Josh McCown probably, but who knows for sure.
At least the Giants have stability at the QB position.
I wish the Jets could find someone like Manning for themselves.
Maybe one of your recent draft choices can be the man.
I'd like to think so, but I'm not holding out much hope.
Anyway, good luck to the Jets this year.
Good luck to the Giants as well.
