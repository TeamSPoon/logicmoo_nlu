Do you remember the movie, 'Treasure Planet?'
I do! It's one of my favorites.
I know right, it's like no one remembers it though.
That's truely a shame, I mean the animation is-
Breathtaking!
Seriously!
All of the robotic parts are so intricately animated.
Yea, I think they used both 2D and 3D animation to pull that off.
Really?!
Yea, like with John Silver, his body was 2D but his cyborg parts were made in 3D.
