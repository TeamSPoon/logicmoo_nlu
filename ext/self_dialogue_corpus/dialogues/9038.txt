Do you like those top ten lists that people do?
It depends on that they are ranking...
I was looking at one for best frontmen of rock groups- guess who was number one?
Probably Prince... or Chris Cornell from Soundgarden.... or Michael Hutchence from INXS.
Nope, number one was Freddie Mercury from Queen, then Robert Plant and Mick Jagger.
Mick Jagger was rated higher than Prince or Chris Cornell?  They must not have been judging by their vocals.
I just looked it up on my cell phone. Prince was ranked 51. Hutchence was 53, and Cornell was 24.
You're kidding. So who was ranked at the bottom?
Number 100 was Syd Barret from Pink Floyd. Apparently even creepy Marilyn Manson was better than Pink Floyd since he came in number 88.
Now you see why I don't pay attention to those kinds of things. Everyone knows the lead singer of Pink Floyd was better than Marilyn Manson.
