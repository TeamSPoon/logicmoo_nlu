What about them Bears?
Yeah, to Bears!
I love to watch how Bears play defensive.
Me too, I like watching the big game.
Gotta play good d to win the game.
Yep, that's what the game is all about.
Wish I had more time to watch them play.
Actually I like the old tecmo Superbowl on the nes!
You don't say? Me too.
I love playing as No Jackson on that game.
That game is so sweet.
Yeah it is, I love that game.
The Bears are awesome on that game.
Yeah, that's my favorite football video game.
That game has the best catching receivers of all time.
Well, yeah, that's what makes the game so great.
They need to make am online multiplayer version.
I would play that for sure.
Where do the Bears play at?
They play at downtown Chicago, that's where they play at home.
