Remember Jessica Simpson?
Yes she had a one hit wonder kind of career.
Well she married a pop artist as well.
They never collaborated did they?
Not big enough to produce a decent song.
What was the song she had that was big.
It sampled John Cougar's song "Jack and Diane"
I think it was called Crazy for You
I dont remember but it was a huge hit
It got released in the summer so it was perfect placement.
