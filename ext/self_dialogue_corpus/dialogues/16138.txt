Do you like rap music?
Not really.
That is quite a shame.
I mean, I used to love rap but not anymore.
Why is that?
Because rap today is kind of trashy.
You think so?
Definitely! It is not as good as it was back in the 90s.
I like Biggie Smalls a lot.
That is what I mean! He was at the peak.
You don't even like Missy Elliot's new stuff?
Not really.
Oh I loved her song that came out last year.
Well besides that, that was decent.
It was very catchy and I kept listening to it over and over.
That is funny.
I also like jay z.
He used to be great but not so much now.
Why is that?
He is too influenced by Kanye.
