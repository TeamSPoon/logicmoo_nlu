I rewatched Snow White the other day.
I haven't seen that since I was a kid.
It's actually pretty funny. Though the animation's a lot worse than I remember it being.
Didn't it first come out in the 40s?
The 30s! 1937!
That seems so long ago.
I was looking at the cast list, and I couldn't even remember the names of any of the actors.
So Humphrey Bogart isn't in it?
No! But that's the right era though!
I was just kidding.
