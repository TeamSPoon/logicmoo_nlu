Who is your favorite artist?
I am a really big fan of Taylor Swift.
I know that everyone really likes her but to be honest I haven't even given her a fair chance.
You should I love her. She has a little bit of something for everyone.
Is she still country?
She started out as country, but now she is more the style of pop.
How long has she not been country?
Her first album was definitely country, and the more she went along the less country it got. By the time she got to the album Red it didn't sound like country at all.
Really? That's interesting. She writes all her own music right.
Ya, for the most part. She has other people that contribute as well.
Well at least she is involved deeply in her music.
Ya. Who's your favorite artist.
I am a huge fan of Demi Lavato.
I really enjoy her new song Neon Lights.
Ya it is a great dance song and super upbeat.
Ya, I feel the same way. Her music has definitely gotten better over the years.
Oh ya. I really like the song Cool for the Summer.
That also is a great one and super catchy.
Ya. I like music that has good lyrics and that I don't get bored of.
Ya and I need it to be original.
