What team do the Saints play first this year?
They play the vikings
That will be an okay game
Considering how well the vikings did last year it will be bleak I think
Yeah. The saints need a mix up
Brees is ready to retire I think
I don't think Payton will let him
Sean Payton isn't doing much either
Yeah, he's probably in his last coaching days.
Are there any new coaches you think will do well?
Anthony Lynn is building a pretty good team with the Chargers
I think the Rams coach is building up a nice team as well.
Sean McAvoy is good. We'll see about that QB though
He's got wade phillips to make jarred goff look like a star though
True. He's a great Defensive coordinator
Sean McDermott has a big job over with the Bills
Yeah. taking over after Marrone left will be hard
He's got to rebuild the whole structure I think
That's hard for a new coach to do
He seems like a good leader.
