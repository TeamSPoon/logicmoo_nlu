Who is the most annoying person in Star Wars?
I think it would be Young Anakin
Why do you say that?
Maybe it's just his acting but he is so over the top with everything
Oh, like during his pod race?
Yeah he seems so fake.
He got a little better though, he wasn't always so inexperienced with his acting
I wonder what that actor is up to now!
He hasn't been in any movies that I know of!
I liked him in Star Wars, he was just a little kid. I should cut him some slack
