Did you ever see Cinderella?
Yes, my sister used to watch it all the time when we were young.
Were you a fan?
It was okay, the step mother was scary.
Yes, and the sisters were pretty scary looking
Right, treated Cinderella very badly
At least she found her fairy god mother in the end.
That she did
And her glass slipper
Yes, the infamous glass slipper.
