Do you like action movies?
I loved Mad Max Fury Road?
Me too. Whose your favorite character?
Furiosa
Yeah, I can see that. Seems like it was more about Furiosa and Immortan Joe than about Max
I just like her character as she was really strong
I liked her mechanical arm
And her shaved head
Do you think they will make another movie?
I hope so. I love the post nuclear holocaust theme.
