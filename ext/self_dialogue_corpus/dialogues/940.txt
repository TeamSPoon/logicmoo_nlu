What is youtr favorite team?
I am a Cowbiys fan, but I worry they might have a down year.
Why do you believe that?
Their schedue is tougher, and I think other teams will be more fo them.
I wouldn't worry too much. They still have the same personnel.
What's your favorite team.
I have lways been a Saints fan.
They certainly have a soild offense.
Yes, but their defense is equally bad.
How you think they will do this year?
It is hard to say. They have had a lot of personnel changes.
Will their defense better?
It is really a matter of just wait and see.
Well I wish you the best of luck with them. Whao you think will win the Super Bowl.
I honrstly don't think the Patriots will win again, although they will be good. I think it may be some long shot.
For mysel, I think the Panthers will rebound and take it all.
I hope not. Given they are an archrival of the Saints, I can't stand them.
I can understand that.
I am going to need to go. Good luck with the Cowboys.
Thanks. Good luck with the Saints, too.
