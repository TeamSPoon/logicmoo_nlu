Have you seen the latest Star wars movie?
No, I didn't . Have you?
Yes, I saw it last weekend.
How did you like it?
I thought it was very good. I saw it in 3D.
How do you think it compared to the original star wars movie?
I didn't think it was anywhere as good.
Why not?
I thought the story line was much better in the original.
Was there a lot of action in it?
Yes, there was . It just didn't seem as well written.
Were some of the original characters in it?
Yes, there were quite a few. Mark Hamill was in it of course!
Would you recommend I see it?
Yes, it is a good movie. Just not as good.
Was it worth it to see it in 3d?
Yes, that made a lot of the action scenes look really cool.
Maybe I will try to see it. Where did you see it?
I saw it at AMC.
ok, thanks for the information.
