Hey, did you want to take the kids to see a movie tonight?
Yeah, that'd be fun, what's out?
There's a few movies out they might like, Beauty and the Beast, The Boss Baby, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
I'm not going to see Beauty and the Beast.
Alright, what about the other two?
Which one do you think they'd like more?
Probably The Boss Baby.
Can't we take them to see Guardians of the Galaxy or something?
No, they're too young for that.
Alright, The Boss baby it is.
Great, I think they'll really like it.
At least someone will.
I'm sure you'll like it too, Alec Baldwin voices the baby.
I do like him in 30 rock.
See, you'll probably like it more than the kids.
I doubt that, but I am interested now.
Great, what time do you get off work?
I'll be home around 5.
Ok, we'll go to the 7 o'clock showing in town.
Sounds good, see you when I get home.
