Have you seen the new designs for wedding dresses this year?
No! When did they come out?
Last week, I believe.  Would you like to see them?
Sure!  I can't believe it's only 3 months until my own wedding.
Are you thinking of a traditional wedding gown or a more modern look?
I like the idea of a simple, A-line dress with lace.
That sounds lovely.  Long or short sleeves?
I was actually thinking of capped sleeves.
Good choice!  Have you thought about adding a pop of color or will it be all white?
I was actually thinking of going with an ecru or ivory gown.  I want it to photograph well and I think it would look better with my complexion
What about the length?  I think tea length would look great and show off your legs.
I really like the idea of a floor length dress.  I think a little train looks best in pictures.
I got ya'.  Have you thought about the weight of the dress? Are you leaning toward one fabric over another?
I think I want a simple cotton or silk, as opposed to brocades and heavy fabrics.
Do you want any beading?
No.  I think it's tacky!
Have you thought about what the bridesmaids will be wearing?
Oh, yeah! Since the guys are wearing soft gray suits, I was thinking of having the girls wear Tiffany Blue.
That sounds beautiful.  I can't wait to see it.
Me, either.  Now, help me find the dress of my dreams!
