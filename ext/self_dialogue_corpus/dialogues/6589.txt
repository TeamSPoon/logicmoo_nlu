You ever see that old Disney movie, The Black Hole?
Seen it? I haven't even heard of it.
It's OK, kind of cheesy and very un-Disney like.
Oh yeah, who;s in it?
It starred Maximilian Schell and Anthony Perkins, that dude from Psycho. It's a space movie, and it has couple of corny robots.
Really?
Yeah, but it isn't all that bad
Are there any women in it?
Yeah, Yvette Mimieux, she was in a  lot of those old SF movies.
OK, Sounds good. I think I will check it out,
