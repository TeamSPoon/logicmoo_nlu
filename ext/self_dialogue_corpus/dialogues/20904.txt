Did you see the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Isn't it like Pirates of the Caribbean 5 now?
Yeah, but it's called Dead Men Tell No Tales. Did you see it?
No and I have no desire to see it.
I saw it and I liked it a lot.
Oh, well I guess I just thought the movies kind of wrapped up after the third one.
Did you see the fourth Pirates?
Yeah, but I don't remember much about it, so it must not have been that great.
The fourth one wasn't as good as the others because it didn't have Orlando Bloom in it.
Does the fifth one have Orlando Bloom in it?
I don't want to spoil it, but kind of.
What even happens in the fifth movie?
You really should see it. It has to do with Captain Jack getting himself into trouble again.
Of course it does. They just use the same plot over and over again for those movies.
I think this one is different enough. It has amazing graphics too.
Does it still have the same humor the others movies had?
Yeah, that never gets old to me.
To me it does.
I still think you would like it if you saw it.
Maybe I'll see it when it if it's ever on Netflix.
