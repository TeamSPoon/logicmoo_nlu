Do you think Colin Kaepernick will get picked up?
I do not think that he will. Which owner will want him?
The Cowboys of a history of picking up troubled players.
Do you really think that Colin Kaepernick is a troubled player?
Not in the traditional sense of troubled players, but he did create a stir in the league.
Yes, but the stir was about a positive message.
I think so to, but it did not look good for the NFL and they didn't do a good job at explaining it.
But Colin put his money where his mouth was and made some great donations.
I agree with that andthe NFL should have come out and matched those donations.
Why should have the NFL matched those donations?
It would have shown support to their players and the bigger social issues in society.
Yes, but they do not need to do that.
They do not need to and they didn't, but I think they would have looked better as an organization.
That is true, and I think it would have made the NFL being a nonprofit make more sense as well.
Agreed. They make billions and they really do not provide a public service
You do not think that what they do is a public service?
No, they provide entertainment.
Yes, they provide entertainment and their brand is suffering.
The entertainment is still good. If you like the teams that do well
I do not think it depends on the teams that are doing well.
