I went to the movies last weekend.
What did you go see?
I went to see that new Arthur movie.
Was it good?
It was I just didn't think it was much like the story.
I had heard that as well.
Yeah, the movie was action packed.
Was there much language in it?
Only slightly that I noticed.
They can go overboard sometimes.
Overall I enjoyed it.
I want to see the new Alien movie.
I am going to see that this weekend.
The previews looked so good.
I only hope they don't change the story line much.
From what I could tell on the previews it looked pretty true.
It's hard to believe the original is that old.
I was thinking that same thing.
I guess movies from the 80's are the best.
They truly are and will go down as classics.
