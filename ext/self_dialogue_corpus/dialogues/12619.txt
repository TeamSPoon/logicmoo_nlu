I think that The Empire Strikes Back was the best Star Wars film. How about you?
Most definitely, Irvin Kershner added some darkness to the series.
I would have to say that Kershner was the best out of all the Star Wars directors.
I would agree, Lucas is probably my number two favorite.
I hope as the series continues, we see some darker storylines similar to Empire.
Yes, tragedy needs to remain a part of the ongoing saga.
What do you think about Han being killed in The Force Awakens?
I was disappointed. He was my favorite character.
Yes, mine too, they killed the coolest dude in the galaxy.
At least Chewbacca lives to carry on his legacy.
