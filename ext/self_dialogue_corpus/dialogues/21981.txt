Hey, so what movies are you going to see this summer?
I don't know...maybe I'll watch Spiderman.
Spiderman has been re-booted three times now, right?  In such a short time span...
Yeah, but this time it looks good.  Ironman is going to be in it, so he's finally part of the Marvel Comics world.
I think there are too many action hero movies these days. Did you see the trailer for Black Panther?
Yeah, that looks like it is solely targeting the African American audience. It looks tribal...I probably won't watch it.
It looks like a lot of eye candy, but I don't think I will watch it either.
What movies have you seen so far this summer...
I just saw Cars3 this past weekend...
How was it?  I didn't know the series was already at 3 movies now...
Meh, I'm not into car racing, but I do like Pixar movies. I thought this was for the kids, with not much of a story.
I saw the Mummy with Tom Cruise a few weeks ago.
It got really bad reviews and didn't do well...what did you think of it?
Lots of CG and lots of action...it was a typical Tom Cruise movie, but that's about it.  It didn't have to be "The Mummy".  I could have been a Mission Impossible movie with Egyptian god themes tied to it.
Yeah, maybe I will watch it when it comes out on Netflix.
Did you see Wonder Woman?
Yeah, that was surprisingly good. After the horrendous Batman vs. Superman I had low expectations for it.
Definitely.  The story reminded me of the first Capitan America movie. But I had a good time watching it.
Did you know Gal Gadot was only paid $300,000 for her role?
Really?!  She was seriously underpaid for that!  I guess the studio is going to make a ton of money at her expense!
