I see there's yet another Transformers movie coming out.
Is there really?
Yep, think it's being released today in fact.
What's this one called?
The Last Knight.
Is it the final movie?
Probably not.  They will keep making these things until they start losing money.
Fat chance of that happening anytime soon.
This one apparently has Optimus Prime as the bad guy.
Is he really the bad guy or more of an anti-hero?
Hard to say for certain since I haven't seen it, but I would guess the latter.
I lost track of these movies.  Is the 4th or 5th?
I don't even know to be honest.  They all run together for me.
Is this one directed by Michael Bay?
I believe so.  I think he's done them all so far.
So if I see it, I should expect lots of explosions and corny dialogue?
And long tracking shots.  Don't forget about those.
Who could ever forget about those?
Maybe you want to go see it with me?
Why not?  Sounds like we need some escapism.
