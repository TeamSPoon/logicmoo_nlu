Did you see the Revenant?
I did. Leo was so good!
Decaprio is always good.
True. But he finally got his Oscar for that one.
About time.
I'm suprised he didn't get one for Django.
Me too. He was so evil.
I know! You know that scene where he cut his hand?
Yeah...?
That wasn't scripted.
He actually cut himself?!
Yup, and just rolled with it.
Hollywood needs more actors like that.
To be sure.
Well, I'm glad he finally is recognized by the acadamy.
Me too. Did you ever see Gilbert Grape.
Yeah, sooo good.
We should watch that again.
I'm game.
Cool.
