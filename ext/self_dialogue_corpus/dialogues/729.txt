Who do you think the greatest running back in Raiders history is?
I think it was Bo Jackson.
Really, I look at him as a one hit wonder.
He had great break out speed.
He did, but he wasn't fully committed to football, which hurt him.
He was still the greatest.
After he got hurt, it was all over.
Who do you think is the greatest?
Marcus Allen, no question.
Al Davis had a personal vendetta against Allen.
That's what they say.  Al claims there were just better players.
Allen was the greatest back who led them to a Super Bowl.
It's a shame what Al Davis did.
Yes.  I couldn't understand why he would not play him.
It was stupid.
He was hurting the team for personal reasons
He should have just let him go if he wasn't going to play him.
He finally got released to play a good season in Kansas City.
Well, he still made the Hall of Fame and had a great career.
For sure.
