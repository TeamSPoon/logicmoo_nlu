Hey what do you think about the Beatles?
I think they're one of the icons in the music industry.
it's amazing to see in some videos, when they performed some many years ago, the stage was pretty bare, unlike performers we see today.
I agree and their songs are very simple. You know the well known ones like Yesterday, Hey Jude and many others.
I thought it's cool that the movie That Thing You do, the song was made to sound like Beatles' at least in my opinion they do.
I can't remember which song but I know the song was so short, like maybe only two minutes when maybe Paul or John were recording in the studio they tried to add stuff to the intro, play a bit of harmonica solo or something to lengthen the song enough to be recorded.
Wow yeah i can't remember what song it was but i remember reading about it too.
I like McCartney even collaborated with modern artist like Michael Jackson.
Yeah i like that one duet they did together. What song was it?
The girl is mine.
