What's the funniest line from any of the Star Wars movies?
I'll go with "Let the Wookiee Win".
That's a great one!
I also think Darth Vader had some good lines in Rogue One.
For sure! "Be careful not to choke on your aspirations."
Its up there with the classic "I find your lack of faith disturbing".
And "You have failed me for the last time".
I like the humor and sarcasm/sass, I think it fits the character well.
It was great to see Vader at the end of the movie, attacking and going all out.
Definitely. A moment long time fans wanted for years and they delivered!
