Hey are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I am!
I've been waiting since last year when it ended.
So have I. I've been ready for it to start every since it ended last season.
I can't wait to see how the Dallas Cowboys do this season.
Yes me too. I'm anxious to see what's going to happen.
As well as they did last year, this year should be better.
I'm hoping it is. Last year Dak Prescott did an awesome job as quarterback,
I know he really did. He was only backup quarterback and looked what happened.
I know he became the Cowboys number one quarterback.
I know and he is awesome.
He really is. He really showed Romo up.
He did he put him to shame.
Romo started out being a good quarterback but started staying injured all the time.
I know. He cost the Cowboys a lot of games too.
He really did with all those interceptions he threw.
I know. He had started looking really bad.
I know he really looked awful and was making the whole team look awful.
I think he's going to do better with ending the playing career and moving to what he is.
I think so too. He's a likable guy. His playing days were just over.
