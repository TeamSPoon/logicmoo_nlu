Do you prefer single rappers or rap groups.
I've only ever listened to single ones.
So you've never been too fond of groups.
Not that. I just haven't been exposed to much rap groups.
Listen to NWA.
Why? Are they a big deal?
Well, they don't exist anymore, but they're easily the most influential rap group ever.
Wait. Now that you mention it, the name sounds familiar. Who was in it?
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella were all members.
Oh, okay. I know who they are then.
