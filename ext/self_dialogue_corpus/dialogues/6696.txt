Did you ever wonder if Snow White hates animals?
What are you talking about?
I mean, she thanks the animals for helping her, but seems like she's short on gratitude.
I swear, you're going crazy.
Hear me out.  Why didn't she take any of them as pets at the end?
How was she supposed to take them on pets when she was on the back of a horse?
She could have taken a rabbit.
She's not going to take wild beasts with her and the prince.
Or a cuddly mouse.
You need serious help.
