Which metal singer is your favorite?
That's actually a tough question as I have several. I would have to put Russell Allen as my favorite.
Yeah, he's great. How do you like Jorn Lande?
That's another one of my favorites, they are fairly similar so I guess it only makes sense.
Do you know if they've ever worked together?
Yeah, they have on several projects like Ayreon, Avantasia and they made a band called Allen - Lande.
That's pretty impressive. Do you know anything about each of their careers?
I'll start with Russell Allen, who's an American metal singer most known from Symphony X.
Has he ever done any solo projects?
He did make one album called Russell Allen's Atomic Soul
Know any other bands he has been a part of?
He was a part of Star One and Adrenaline Mob.
Sounds like he keeps busy. How about Jorn Lande you know if he has been active in other bands?
Think he started in Ark which is a progressive metal band, then he was a part of Masterplan.
Does Jorn have any solo projects?
His band Jorn has been giving out quite a few albums over the years, but it's more Heavy or Progressive Metal
Both of them sound like really accomplished singers. Do you have any others to recommend?
There are several really. It would be unfair of me not to mention Tobias Sammet as both of them have worked together with him.
Oh is that the guy who created Avantasia?
Yeah, that's right.
