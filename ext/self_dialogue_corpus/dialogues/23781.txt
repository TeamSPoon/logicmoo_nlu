Have you ever seen any of Jimmy Stewart's movies?
How can you not of seen a film with Jimmy Stewart in it?
True, he did play in some of the best.
He's an icon, he's still the reason I know what a filibuster is.
I loved Mr. Smith goes to Washington. He really does look like a Senator though
Well his voice makes him seem perfect for the job; I think Obama might have been a big fan of his work.
You know until you said that, I never reallised how much Obama does talk like Jimmy Stewart.
Well if you're gonna be president, you could pick way worse people to emulate.
Now that I'm thinking about it, Obama kind of looks like him too; they're about the same build and same kind of shaped head.
Well just be glad it's a Mr. Smith resemblance and not Rear Window Stewart.
Yeah, but that would be way funnier to watch at press conferences, "honey, those dang reporters are pack again."
I liked him in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with John Wayne.
I saw that one like ten times.
Well it's pretty cool watching him stand up against a gunslinger.
Especially when he wouldn't even pick up a gun.
I was so confused at the end when you find out John took the shot.
I know, but it did make more sense that he took him down.
Jimmy Stewart is like the best good-guy from movies.
Well he's usually a man in high moral standing,
Or a Dog in high moral standing like in Fievel Goes West.
