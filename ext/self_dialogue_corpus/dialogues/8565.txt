What pop artist would love to spend the day with?
For me ed sheeran. I love his music.
i wonder if he would serenade you or take you to a  buffet?
Why a buffet?
It is in one of his lyrics, thrifty so he enjoys a buffet.
Oh ya, lol. He seems so real and downto earth.
Well he is a super talent but not the best looking.
Many girls would disagree with you. he looks like prince Harry to me.
I think the red hair is the reason.
Ya, I doubt Harry can sign like Ed. I would pick Ed sheeran everyday.
