Hey, did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?
Um...yeah...the Beatles. One of the most classic bands of all times.
I like some of their stuff, like Help and Love Me Do. Very catchy.
Dig deeper. Eleanor Rigby is a good one, so is Norwegian Wood. Some of their lesser known songs, in my opinion, are better.
What is your favorite song of theirs?
Let It Be, or Norwegian Wood. So many to choose from!
Where should I start getting into the music?
Abbey Road is good. The White Album, maybe, or a greatest hits album.
Thanks. I'll check it out.
Cool.
