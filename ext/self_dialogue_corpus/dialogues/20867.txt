Did you see Wonder Woman?
No, but I have heard it is good.
I hear it is the best of all the DC comics movies so far.
That's what I heard too. Of course, the recent ones have not been that strong.
True, Batman vs Superman was terrible and Suicide Squad was disjointed.
Yeah, but is Wonder Woman better than the Dark Knight Batman trilogy?
I think that those were overrated, actually.
Really? You didn't like them?
I did like them, but the first one with Scarecrow was kind of forgettable.
Ok, what about the Dark Knight with Heath Ledger.
That one is the most overrated of all. Heath's performance was great but the movie was choppy and disjointed.
What! That is harsh.
I don't think so. I think that it clearly showed signs of being trimmed for time before it was released. Lot's of scenes seemed half explained.
Okay, What about the The Dark Knight Rises?
The best of the three, but still not my favorite comic book film.
Okay, then what is?
From DC it would still be Super-Man with Christopher Reeve and from Marvel it is Guardians of the Galaxy.
Those are both good.
Anyway, I do want to see Wonder Woman while it is still in theaters.
Me too.
