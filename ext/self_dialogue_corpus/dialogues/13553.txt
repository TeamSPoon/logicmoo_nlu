Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Personally I've always been a big fan of The Empire Strikes Back. That Hoth battle was really cool!
I think a lot of people also feel that way. I like Return of the Jedi myself.
Are you a huge fan of Ewoks?
I think they're so adorable. And I liked how they kicked some stormtrooper butt in that battle on Endor.
My other favorite part about The Empire Strikes back was the saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader. That was awesome.
It wasn't bad. The lightsaber combat is so hard to watch now that I've seen the flashier choreography in the prequels.
To me it will always be better, more real. I liked that The Force Awakens tried to kind of replicate that gritty feeling that the fights had.
It's almost like the prequels and the other movies aren't even in the same universe! They're so different.
That's true. But if we didn't have the prequels we'd have missed out on a lot of great characters. Like Qui Gon Jinn.
