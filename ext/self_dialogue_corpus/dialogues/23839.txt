You ever watched a movie, then watched it again years later?
Yes. I saw the movie "Clue" when I was a teenager.
Is that the movie based on the game?
Yes, that one. Anyway, saw it when I was a teenager and seem to remember enjoying it. Watched it with my wife a few months ago, and we both hated it.
What was wrong with it?
It's stupid. My wife actually enjoys silly comedies. And even she didn't like it.
But you liked it years ago?
I seem to remember liking it, yeah.
Any other movies like that?
Superman IV.
Really? I thought you loved the Christopher Reeve Superman movies.
I do. Or I did.
You don't like them anymore?
I don't like number four as much anymore. It had been a while since I saw. Watched it with someone else and well, all kinds of flaws started to show up.
What kind of flaws?
For one, the story makes No sense at all!
How so?
Well, Superman throws all of the nuclear weapons into the sun and everyone gets all upset. The governments of the world know how to build more.
YOu got a point.
And the hair. Superman's hair is in a museum holding up a huge weight. Luthor comes in and cuts the hair free with a pair of scissors.
