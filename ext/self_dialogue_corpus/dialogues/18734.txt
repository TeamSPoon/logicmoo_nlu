Hey you know that song by Jeff Buckley?
Jeff Buckley? Whose that?
You know Jeff Buckley, died in Memphis....one of the great voices....90's
Oh the Hallelujah guy. I know that song. I thought Lenard Cohen sang it.
It wasn't Jeff Buckley?
Well, no Leonard Cohen wrote and sang it first. Jeff Buckley just covered and made it famous.
So many people have covered that song.
Really like who?
Yeah, Pentatonix, Damien Rice, Tori Kelly, Rufus Wainwright, Katie Lang, Jone Cale, John Bon Jovi.
Wow, that's a lot of people. I guess they are trying to show how good they are by singing that song.
Yeah, even Justin Timberlake and Willie Nelson covered it. Talk about overkill.
Yeah, but I think the Jeff Buckley version is still my favorite.
Yeah, it is one of the best versions. I don't think Leonard Cohen was going to originally release it.
Really? That would have been a lost.
Yeah, I can't remember the story but he was convinced by someone to release the song and it didn't become famous until Jeff Buckley covered it.
It's weird because I don't think the song is about religion.
Well, listening to lyrics, I thought it was about sex.
That's probably why it's so popular and everyone wants to cover it.
Well, that makes it even cooler. It's still a great song.
Yeah as long someone like Brittany Spears doesn't cover it.
