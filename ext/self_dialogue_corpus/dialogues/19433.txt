What do you think of Ed Sheeran?
I feel like he might be too overrated.
Are you kidding?? His voice is amazing!
Well I feel like the songs they place of his on the radio are catchy, but just not that great quality wise.
Well you definitely have to listen to his other music, because I would agree the songs on the radio are more overrated than they need to be.
Well what songs should I listen to then?
I would suggest listening to his new album, divide.
I've heard Shape of You.
But there are so many other amazing songs on the album!
Like what?
Well there's Galway Girl and Nancy Mulligan for starters.
I haven't even heard of those.
Exactly and those are the even better ones!
Which song is your favorite from the new album.
Well Supermarket Flowers really is so sweet, but I'd have to say Perfect is my favorite.
Is that a really pop song?
Not at all, because it's slower.  It feels more meaningful and powerful.
I'll have to give it a try, can I borrow your cd?
Of course! I'll bring it to work tomorrow!
Awesome, I'm excited to hear a different side of Ed Sheeran.
