Hey, let's go to a baseball game. It's supposed to be a nice day.
Well, ok, darn it. Who's playing?
The Twins are playing blah blah blah.
Why do you phrase it like that? I kind of want to know.
Does it matter? The Twins could lose the Springfield Isotopes.
Well, ok, let's go. We're here already. Man, that was fast.
God bless the light rail that only travels in one direction. It was pretty fast though. But it did take us 40 minutes to get to the parking lot at the Mall.
Twins!!!!!!!!!! Let's go!!!!!  Aaarg! Actually, I want a hot dog.
I want some beer. Let's grab two or three or twelve. I brought my Mom's credit card.
We can't carry all of these to our seats. I guess we'll have to stand here and drink them. We can watch on one of the many high definition screens in this beautiful and still clean concourse.
Hey, everyone is yelling. What happened?
Man, look at that tight shirt. You say something?
I gotta go. Can you hold my beer?
I have to go too. Let's bring them with. The line will be long anyway and standing makes me thirsty.
Everyone is yelling again. What happened? Hey you, you know what happened? Mauer got on base!?! That calls for a drink.
He'll get tagged out. He's slower than Denny Green on salad day.
What happened? I can't hear over my own tinkle. Mauer's headed toward second?
Ohhh, he tripped. Well, he did get in sight of second base. He's improving.
Look at me. I'm drinkin' while peeiing. Weeeee! I'm a filter.
This is the best game ever.
