I'm so excited about the re-release of OK Computer!
What do you mean? What re-release?
Radiohead released a brand new 20th anniversary re-issue of OK Computer this week!
What's new about this release of it?
It includes 3 previously unreleased tracks, a few B-sides, and, of course, the remastered original.
That sound pretty neat. I didn't realize you were such a fan of Radiohead.
They're my favorite band!
Did you get to watch their Glastonbury performance yesterday?
Yeah I caught it. Did you?
Yep. They're still really solid performers after all this time.
Yeah I think it's great they're still together and performing.
How long has the band been around now anyway? It seems like they've been around for forever
Well they formed in 1985 so I guess that makes 30 years?
Whoa. That's impressive!
I'm pretty sure they've always had all the same members too.
I guess they must really get along to be able to maintain that for so long.
Yeah it seems they must work very well together.
Do they still put out new original music? Or is it mostly just touring around performing?
They still put out new music!
Cool. Sounds like I have some catching up to do then!
