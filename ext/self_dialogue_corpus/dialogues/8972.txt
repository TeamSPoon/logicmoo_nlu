One of my favorite rock bands is The Scorpions.
Great band.
Crazy World was the best album they had.
When was that out?
That was 1990. The year I got married.
Wind of Change is on that, right?
Yes. The whole album was great.
It's funny calling them albums.
Rock You Like A Hurricane was another good one.
I forgot about that one.
