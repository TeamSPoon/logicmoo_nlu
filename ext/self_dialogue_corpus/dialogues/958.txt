Have you seen the crazy money going around the NFL right now?
Yeh, can you believe how much that one quarterback got?
Yes, that was crazy for sure. Quite a lot of cash.
Something like $150 million right?
Close, he's going to get $125 million for 5 years.
That's insane, who is he?
It's Derek Carr of the Raiders.
I don't really know him that well.
He had a good season last year and they want to hang on to him.
Still, that sounds like a lot of money for a guy who's not a household name.
It actually makes him the highest paid NFL player ever.
You're kidding me right now?
No, I'm not, it's the most money per year ever.
So he makes more than Tom Brady?
At the current time yes.
That makes no sense to me at all.
Well, with the Raiders moving in to Las Vegas they need a great team and good leader.
So they're moving from Oakland to Vegas? Are you serious?
I agree, they move around more than a Bedouin tribe it seems like.
Well, it should be interesting at least. The Raiders in Vegas, that's a trip.
