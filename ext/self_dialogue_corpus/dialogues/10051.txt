transformers is a crap series!
why, i like it
its crap because they do not have consistent main characters
isn't thats what makes a good movie?
the plot is pretty much the same
that is true.
they just keep fighting megatron, who just doesn't die.
that does get annoying now that you mention it.
and now on the new movie. optimus is killing bumblebee
what? thats not right!
