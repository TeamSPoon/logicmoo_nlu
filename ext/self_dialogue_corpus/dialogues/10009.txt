I saw The Professional last night.
That was one cool movie.  Who was the young girl?
The great Natalie Portman.
Wow.  Who directed?
Luc Besson, who went on to do Taken and Lucy.
Both nice action flicks.  Who is the Professional?
Jean Reno.
He looks like a mean dude.
Gary Oldman was the bad cop.
He got his just desserts.
