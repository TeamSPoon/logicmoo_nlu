You ever listen to The Offspring?
I haven't in a while, but they are awesome!
Yeah, I like to listen to them when I'm stressed.
I can understand that.  I've played their stuff while I'm driving and screaming at the top of my lungs.
Yeah, it just helps you get the energy out.
They've been around forever, huh?
They've been around for a while.  I remember playing one of their cassettes in the nineties.
What tape was that?
I don't remember the name, but the case had a picture of a little boy swinging.
Oh, I think I know the one you mean!
