Can we talk about Will smith as deadshot in suicide squad?
Sure, I thought this was an interesting move for smith, not to be the starring role.
Ya, I think he was just so wanting to be a superhero in some movie, or maybe he really loved the script and role. But I did not care for it.
I didn't love him in this role either. Hard to admit because I have loved him for years.
I feel lately he has come across badly on screen and off.
how so exactly?
Well recall the whole boycott of the oscars?... I feel this was him throwing a tantrum for not getting a nomination,
I can see that. I myself thought oscars are given to films they cannot control what films are being made that past year to award.
Exactly, Smith could not  just accept that his performance was not deserving... certainly not in suicide squad either.
I think moonlight winning goes to show it is not an academy issue with race, I think it is more what films are being made in general. They are more than ready to award a good performance from anyone.
