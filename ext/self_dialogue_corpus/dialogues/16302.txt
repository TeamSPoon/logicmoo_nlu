What is your favorite band?
I would say The Beatles.
I think that is favorite for a lot of people. You have the beatlemania!
Yes, I think the world did and maybe still does.
Well are they not the top selling band of all time?
I think they very well could be.
Do you have a favorite? I doubt it is Ringo Starr.
Ha. No not Ringo, though he gets a bad rep or maybe not enough affection.
I won't pick on Ringo any longer, just for you. So pray tell who is your favorite?
George Harrison. I think he is the best one the more I discover.
Most people say Lennon, or Paul.
Ya those two are typically the most popular. But george was very interesting.
What do you find so interesting?
I think his spiritualism. He converted to hinduism at one point.
I did not realize that about him. I know they had done some indian influenced music at one time.
Yes that is true.  They followed a swami for a while.
That is pretty neat. I liked how experimental they were and open.
Yes agreed. I just want to point out george also wrote some beautiful music of theirs.
I know. People always think it was just john and paul writing , but all of them did at times.
I loved george's my sweet lord, so pure and melodic.
