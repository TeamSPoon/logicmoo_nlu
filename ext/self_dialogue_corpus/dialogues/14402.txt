Did you see the blood bath that was the Cleveland / Boston Game the other night?
Yes I did, what was the halftime score?
I can't believe Cleveland was up by 30 points at halftime.
I still don't believe they won't by almost 50.
What do you think is wrong with Isiah Thomas?
I think his sisters death is still effecting him.
The NBA released their first -second and third teams, did you see them?
Yeah, I agree with most but Curry should be first team.
Do you think David Stern was a good commissioner?
I really do, but he was also aided by the superstar players in the league: Shaq, Kobe, Young Lebron.
Who do you think will end up in the finals?
Thats easy, Golden State and Cleveland.
Who do you think will win between Golden State and the Cavs.
It will be a great series, probably the best this playoff but the Cavs will definitely win.
What do you think the series will end up being if they both make it?
Cleveland in 6.
Do you think Boston regrets trying to go small against the Cavs?
Of course they do, they tried it and lost by like 50.
Have you ever seen an uglier, one sided playoff game.?
No and I still can't believe it was in the conference finals.
