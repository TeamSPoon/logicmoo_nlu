Best female pop artist in the 1980s?
Easy, Madonna.
I was thinking of Cyndi Lauper or Whitney Houston.
Those are pretty different. What about Pat Benatar and Joan Jet?
We are all over the place now! So many really good ones then.
How about Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner, and Janet Jackson.
The voice range is so crazy. I really like Annie Lennox. She might be 90's
She has a great voice. Wonder what she is doing now.
Probably Vegas. That seems to be the venue for all of the 80's singers these days.
Yeah, they could do a pretty cool 80's mashup there. Love the retro music.
