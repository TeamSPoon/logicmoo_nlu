I just watched the SpongeBob movie again.
The first or second?
The first one. I didn't even give the 2nd a try.
The first is the best. Why didn't you watch the other one?
Because that is not SpongeBob. SpongeBob is 2d, not that other kind of animation.
I get it. The animation is fine with me.
The animation is weird and since it's new, that means the humor is weird.
What do you mean?
After the SpongeBob movie, the whole series went downhill.
It's definitely not as funny anymore. Why is that?
Because the creator quit due to a dispute. He wanted the movie to be the end of the show, but Nickelodeon wanted to keep it.
That makes sense. SpongeBob has got to be worth a billion.
But when the creator left, the writes did. Now it's awful.
Did you see any of the 2nd movie.
I turned the trailer off after 20 seconds.
You hated it that much?
Yeah, I refuse to watch that.
Well, the first one is great. I still think the 2nd is OK.
The first one is perfect. Some of Patrick's best lines are in it.
Patrick is amazing.
