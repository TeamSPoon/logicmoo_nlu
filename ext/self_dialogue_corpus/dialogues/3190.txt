Hey what do you think the 49ers will do to get their franchise quarterback?
I think they will stick it out with hotter and reassess next off season
Any names you think will be in the conversation?
The obvious one is Kirk cousins because of his past with Kyle shanahan
Who else? Any college abs?
Sam darnold from USC is widely considered the best qb prospect for next years draft. And their will always be a couple new names that you will hear about come April.
Back to cousins, is that a real possibility in your opinion?
Absolutely. If he had it his way he would have been here back in march but the redskins are making things very difficult.
How so?
For starters they keep using the franchise tag on him not allowing him to find a new team. And if that's not bad enough they can't agree to a new deal and refuse to trade him. It's a mess.
I've also heard that Dan Snyder won't trade him to sf out of spite of the shannahans when they coached there.
I know I heard the same thing and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was that petty. Either pay him or let him walk or trade him!
My thoughts exactly. What are your expectations for Hoyer?
Not much honestly, but he did win like 7 games with the browns..THE BROWNS..of all teams so who knows. I think he can win us 4-5 games.
I think cj beatherd is gonna make some noise in training camp and win the job.
No way. Hoyer knows the offense very well and was brought here for that reason he's the starter week 1 and his job to lose. If he gets injured  that's when you see beatherd
Given his injury history it's almost guaranteed we see beatherd then!
It give you that. O line needs to step up keep Hoyer on his feet or we're done.
One name to watch for?
RUEBEN FOSTER! He's a beast and will be D.R.O.Y. I can't believe we got him at the end of round 1. By the end of the season you will see a lot of foster jerseys around Levi's guaranteed!
