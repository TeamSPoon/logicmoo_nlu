Hi.
Hello.
What's going on?
Not much you?
Same.  You into basketball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have a team you like?
I tend to like the Clippers.
Cool, I like the Celtics.
Nice.
I always thought the Clippers would be better.
Yeah they had the talent just didn't go anywhere.
Do you think they all stay again for another year?
I can't see Blake and Chris Paul staying together no.
I can't see that either.
They are going to go for more money elsewhere.
That's what I think too.
Hope they can rebuild.
Nice chatting.
You too.
