What's up?
Not much, you?
Oh the usual, but I have a funny story for you.
Oh?
Yeah, my husband was listening to music the other day on YouTube, while I was blowing bubbles for our son.
Kay...
Well, he's just started talking, and "You're welcome" is one of the things he's saying.
Your husband?
No, my son silly.
Ha ha ha, I knew that.
Anyway, the "You're Welcome" song comes up as part of the mix.
The one from "Moana."
Yeah, that The Rock sings.
He's so cool!
Anyway, my son bolts for the computer and watches the whole song even repeating, "You're Welcome," a few times.
That's so cute.
Speaking of The Rock, do you plan to see the "Baywatch" movie.
I like The Rock, but that one looks stupid.
I wasn't going to see it in theaters with the other stuff I'd rather see, but I miht rent it when it comes out.
Check it out from the library, and then it would be free.
