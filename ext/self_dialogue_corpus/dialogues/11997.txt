Who do you think is the last jedi in the next Star Wars movie?
I think it is Rey.
Why do you think the last jedi will be Rey?
Because at the end of The Force Awakens, Rey hands the light saber to Luke.
That makes sense. So in The Last Jedi, do you think Luke will train Rey as a jedi?
Yes, I think so.
Do you think Luke is Rey's father?
I am thinking so, but I haven't read ahead in all of the books by George Lucas.
I think The Last Jedi is coming out in theaters in December 2017.
Yes, and I am so excited!
