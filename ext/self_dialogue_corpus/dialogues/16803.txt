So do you listen to music often?
Yeah, I almost always have Pandora running while I work!
Cool, do you have any stations you like a lot?
Well, I have several devoted to soundtracks that I think are pretty perfect.
Wow, multiple ones just for soundtracks? How come?
Well, they all have different moods. Some are soft, some are exciting, etc.
Okay, so what's your favourite of those?
Honestly I really like sad soundtrack pieces, they always feel so rich.
What's the station based off of?
The sad one is songs based off of Lily's Theme from Harry Potter and the Finding Nemo theme.
Very nice, I like both of those songs!
Yeah, they're great. I also have a station based off of Harvey Two Face from the Dark Knight.
Oh, I bet that's a great station. The violins in that piece are amazing.
Agreed. Zimmer and James Newton Howard did such a good job.
Oh, was that a collaboration? No wonder it worked so well.
Yeah, I think it worked so well because Zimmer is great with action beats but Howard can do the emotional beats, so they complemented each other well.
Agreed, those are two of my favourite soundtrack artists.
It's a shame they stopped after that one, Howard didn't work on Rises.
That explains why that soundtrack wasn't as good.
Yeah, collaboration just makes for better art pretty much every time.
