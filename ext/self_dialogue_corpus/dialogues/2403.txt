Hey, when's the NFL season start?
The season opener is September 7th!
Awesome, I'm so excited.
Same, who do you think is gonna win MVP?
Tough to say, if I had to guess I would say Tom Brady
I think he should too, but they hold him to a higher standard
Yeah, I know what you mean. He really has to limit his mistakes if he wants to win it
Yeah, and if any other QB has a really good year they'll lean towards him
Kinda like coach of the year
Exactly. Belichick is definitely the best coach but they never give him the award
Yeah, it normally goes to a coach with a decent roster that makes playoffs
Or a team that gets a lot of injuries and still plays well
Yeah, that too
How about rookie of the year, who's gonna win that?
It's gotta be Myles Garrett
Really? I think it's gonna be Christian McCaffrey
Why?
He's gonna get a lot of opportunities to make big plays
But the Panther's offensive line is so bad
Yeah, but he can catch passes too
