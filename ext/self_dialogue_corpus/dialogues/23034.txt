Do you like animated movies?
Yes
Have you ever seen Coralina?
Yes
Did Tim Burton do it?
No
It's an amazing movie though
I agree
It seems like Alice in Wonderland , but darker
It definitely is
Some people say it's a horror movie for young kids
That sounds right
Adults like it too
The atmosphere is dreary
I liked the main character
I was rooting for her the whole time
I'm glad she got away
Me too
What is your favorite part?
I like the part when she first goes into the wall
