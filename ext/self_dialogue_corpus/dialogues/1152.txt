Do you get excited about watching NFL games on TV?
I guess a little.  It depends on who's playing.
I know what you mean.  I used to like watching a lot, but I wasn't ever a die-hard fan.
I like watching the Cowboys.  We used to go to their games when I was younger.
Going in person is so much better then watching on TV.
Yes.  The atmosphere in the stadium is so different.
I have to say that I always liked going to football watching parties.
Yes.  Those are always fun.  I especially like SuperBowl parties.
I really get into those.
Do you have a favorite player?
I always liked Emmitt Smith.  He was such a class act.
I agree.  I liked him, but I was never a real fan of Michael Irvin or Deon Sanders.
They were both such showboats.
I can't say that I really know a lot of the players now.
Yes.  I doesn't seem like there's enough time to sit and watch too much.
I still think the games are exciting.  I just watch more for a team to win.  I don't pay too much attention to most of the players.
I think when I had kids, I didn't have enough time to keep up with it, and now I just haven't taken the time again.
Maybe this fall you can get back into it.
Sounds good.  Maybe I'll have some parties and get back into it again.
Sounds good.  I'll bring some chips and dip.
