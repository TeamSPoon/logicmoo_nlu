Are you going to see the latest Transformers movie?
I'm not sure.  When did it come out?
It came out yesterday.  We went to see it for my son's birthday/
Was it any good?
It got really bad reviews, but it was OK for a movie about Transformers.
Was Mark Walberg in this one?
Yes, and Anthony Hopkins.  The girls were different though.
What about Josh Dimel?
He was in it and a couple other soldiers and officers from the previous ones.
Is it long like the other ones?
Yes, it was 2 and a half hours long.  I suggest you see it in IMAX if you go.
Why IMAX?
It's a bigger screen and the 3D is awesome.
Do all the original Transformers show up?
Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron for sure, but you would have to ask my son about the others.
I can't believe they've made 5 of those movies!
I know, but as kids grow up, they get more fans and sell more toys.
Good point.  Hasbro loves it, I bet.
I hear that this is Michael Bay's last Transformer movie, but they left the door open for another one at the end of this last movie.
I wonder who will direct the next one.
