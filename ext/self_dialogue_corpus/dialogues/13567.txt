What did you like about Rogue One?
I liked that it was a different tone. Everything was really consequential.
Yeah, everyone died.
It was one of the few times Star Wars felt like an actual war.
You mean that scene on the mining planet?
Yeah. That ambush wouldn't have looked out of place in a World War II movie.
The end was reminicent of the D-Day landing.
In a way. It definitely felt like a do-or-die situation.
It had tension even though we knew how it was going to end.
And I thought it dovetailed into A New Hope nicely.
