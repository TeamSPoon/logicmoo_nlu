Did you see the live action Beauty and the Beast?
I did and I loved it!
I loved that the story line was just like the animated feature.
Yes and it was amazing that they could pull off all those animated scenes that seemed like they would have been impossible.
They did an amazing job with the Gaston song where they are in the pub.
Yes, and Gosh Gad's character was fantastic.
Yes, it was funny when he turned on Gaston in the end.
Yes, that was one thing I didn't remember from the original.
I didn't either but it was great.
The beast sure turned handsome when he turned human again.
