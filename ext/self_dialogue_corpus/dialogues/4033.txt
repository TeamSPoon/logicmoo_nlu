When was the last time you saw that movie Signs?
Man, a long time ago.  Why do you ask?
I was just thinking about it the other day.  I really hated the ending.
Which is sad because the rest of the movie is constructed pretty well.
Why on earth would the aliens come to a planet that's 75% water?
Because they are stupid.  That's the only logical reason.
My wife keeps cups of water lying around the house too like the little girl.
Is that due to laziness or aliens?
Both I think.  All I know is that I just keep dumping them out.
The aliens are gonna get you then!
