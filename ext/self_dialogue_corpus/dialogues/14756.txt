What is your favorite Jim carrey comedy film?
I would say the mask or ace ventura.. you?
For me is is dumb and dumber. I think it is one of the greatest comedies out there.
I did enjoy jim carrey in this film a swell. all of them show off his particular style so well.
He does have a very distinct type of humor performance. I think it is what makes him popular.
You can't just plug in any actor, it has to be jim.
Very true, none of these films would be what they are without him. his facial expressions and delivery are so unique.
You know more or less what to expect when you go see a jim carrey film at least a comedy.
Man on the moon was a different style for him, but still very character driven.
Yes the character role itself had a lot of quirks of his own similar to carrey on some levels but oh so different.
