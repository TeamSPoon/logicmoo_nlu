I can't believe they just showed Dirty Grandpa on the bus.
Seriously. Not quite a bus-appropriate movie!
You're so right. But that doesn't stop it from being hilarious.
Like the funniest. Zac Efron is the man.
You can't forget Robert De Niro.
All things considered, it's a horrible movie. If we're being critics.
It only got 11% on Rotten Tomatoes.
But are we movie critics? Noooope. Can't we just enjoy a movie.
Depends on where we are! Film class, not quite. Long range Greyhound, yes. Definitely.
One review even called it "a new low" for Robert De Niro.
But I bet that reviewer was still laughing!
Obviously. Also it had Aubrey Plaza. That's a good sign for the movie.
Okay, so we're agreed it's a movie you can't think too much about.
