Do you think Drake is as good as everyone makes him out to be?
I mean, he has more Billboard hits than The Beatles. That says something.
That's insane to think about. Music is a lot different now, though.
True. Rappers churn out hits every week.
Yeah it seems like I hear a new Drake song every two weeks.
I do think he's got a good voice and clever lyrics.
He does seem to be able to make anything catchy.
He's got pop and rap music influences, so that helps.
When he released "Hotline Bling" it felt like everyone in the world instantly knew it.
I agree. I think I heard that song over a thousand times.
