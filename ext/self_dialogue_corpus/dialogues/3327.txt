Have you seen any creepy movies lately?
Well the last one I watched was Split.
Oh, was it pretty creepy?
Yeah kinda.
Did you jump a lot?
There was one part I jumped real bad, toward the end of the movie when he turned into the monstor.
Oh wow, that does sound creepy.
But overall it was a really good movie. There was several parts I liked.
Yeah? I realy like M Night so I'll have to try it.
Yeah, you should!
