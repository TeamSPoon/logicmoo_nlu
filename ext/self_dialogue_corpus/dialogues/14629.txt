Hey have you caught any good basketball games lately?
Yeah, I just watched the Duke versus KU game last night. Did you watch?
No, I didn't get to. What happened?
Well it was a great game! Duke ended up winning in double overtime.
Oh man, I wish I would have seen that! They have a stellar recruiting class this year, so I bet they will be great again next year.
Of course, they always do. But KU's recruits are not to shabby either.
They need some good new post players.
I think they recruited two or three big men that really have some good post moves.
Who does Duke play next?
I think they have a home matchup with North Carolina.
That ought to be a good one. I love rivalry games.
I think KU is playing Kansas State which is their rival next.
That should be an easy win for KU.
Maybe, sometimes K-State's team can really show up and be good.
True. Who do you think will win between Duke and UNC?
That is anyone's guess. I will be pulling for my Blue Devils.
Of course you will, though I would really love to see a little bit of an upset with UNC winning.
We shall see. The game is at 8 o'clock Thursday.
Ought to be a good game
Yes, I love a good ball game.
