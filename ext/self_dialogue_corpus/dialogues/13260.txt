Do Wookies and Ewoks come from the same evolutionary background?
I have no idea. They are both furry and can speak. They're both intelligent creatures.
If you shrunk a wookie and made him a little pudgy, he'd look just like an ewok.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
They both live up in the trees don't they?
Yes, they share that characteristic.
Do wookies worship all things golden like ewoks?
I don't think so. They are definitely smarter creatures.
They are both mild tempered in most ways and can be a little vicious.
That's right, I bet they do share the same origins.
