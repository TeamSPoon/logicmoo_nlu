Hey do you ever listen to Norah Jones?
Yeah, I think she has some great stuff.
Me too, which album is your favorite?
I really like Not Too Late, but i think a lot of her albums have some pretty great songs.
Yeah, I've found one song at least I like on pretty much all of her albums.
I do have to say, the album she did with that guy from Green Day - not so good.
Wait, she did an album with the guy from Green Day?
Yeah, Billie Joe Armstrong, I think?
I really dont like Green Day.
Yeah, they were kind of cool in the 90s.
I suppose that's true, but have you heard Daybreaks?
Yeah, there's one song on there I thought was awesome.
Which one was it?
I liked Flipside.
Yeah that was pretty catchy.
There's a newer artist that kind of reminds me of Norah Jones I also like.
Who is that?
Her name is Alina Baraz
Oh, interesting - I've never heard of her.
She's making some really great songs, I think she's got a lot of potential.
