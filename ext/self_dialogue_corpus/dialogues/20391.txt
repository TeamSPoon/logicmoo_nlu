Did you ever hear of the movie On Borrowed TIme?
No , did it just come out?
Oh no, it came out in 1939.
Who was in it
Lionel Barrymore, Cedrick Hardwicke, and Bobs Watson played the little boy.
What was it about?
A little boy named Pud, his parents died and he went to live with his grandparents.
Then What?
He became inseparable from the grandfather, they were very close and he was to inherit his fortune when Gramps died.
Sounds good, then what?
There was an evil aunt who wanted to adopt the little boy so she could get the inheritance when Gramps died.
Did she?
No when death came to get Gramps in the form of a man named Mr Brink, gramps trapped him up a tree.
Why?
So it would give him more time to figure out the boys future so the evil aunt would not get her hands on the money
SOunds pretty good!
It was really good, had some sad parts and some really funny parts.
Do you have the dvd?
Yes I do , I bought it recently online.
I would love to borrow it sometime!
