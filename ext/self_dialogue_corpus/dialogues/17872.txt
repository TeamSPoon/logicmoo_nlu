I heard Modest Mouse will be playing here in September. Probably my favorite indie post-rock band.
Aww sweet! I have always loved their music, especially the album Good News for People Who Love Bad News.
That's a good one, probably the album that made them really popular.
I liked Sad Sappy Sucker too.
Oh yes. You know who else you might like? Courtney Barnett.
Who is that?
She's Australian. She plays guitar and sings sort of an alternative rock style.
Is she a solo artist?
Pretty much. A singer-songwriter.
I'm trying to think of something I've heard by her.
Well, I think her most well-known track is If You Can't See Me I Can't See You.
Yep, I've heard that. Kind of urbane and witty.
Her latest single is called How to Boil an Egg.
Sounds like the Seinfeld of alt-rock. Songs about everyday stuff.
Yes, and she has a lovely, clear, stong voice.
I'll check that out.
I think you'll enjoy her songs -- great sounds for laundry day, driving, cooking, etc.
So are you going to the Modest Mouse concert?
Maybe, if I'm not travelling for work at the time.
If you aren't travelling, let's go together.
