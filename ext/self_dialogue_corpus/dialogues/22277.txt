Who's your favorite actor?
Adam Sandler, why?
I was trying to think of some movies to watch tonight and can't think of any.
Well, if you want to watch an Adam Sandler movie, I can give you some recommendations.
I've seen a lot of them, but he is pretty funny.
Have you seen Jack and Jill?
Yeah, i thought it was terrible though.
Alright, maybe not the best suggestion, what about The Longest Yard.
I actually haven't seen that one, is it any good?
Of course it is, but I may be partial.  What type of movies are you looking for?
I wanted something scary, but I could go for comedy too.
Actually, have you ever seen Flight of the Conchords?
No I haven't.
It's a comedy show about 2 musicians from New Zealand that write songs.
That sounds pretty cool.
Yeah, it's good, but anyways, the one guy has a movie that came out in 2014, called What We Do in the Shadows.
Is it a scary movie?
It's a horror/comedy, I think you'd like it.
Alright, I'm trusting you on this one.
You'll like it!
