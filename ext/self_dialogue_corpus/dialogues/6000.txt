Did you know the Haunted Mansion was based around a Disney ride?
That was the movie with Eddie Murphy right?
Yes it was.
Yeah I heard it was based around that
I just dont know how you make an entire plot based on that.
Well it worked for a long time
Was the movie well received?
It really was hit or miss
Murphy has done some good films for Disney
This one though wasnt one of his finer works
