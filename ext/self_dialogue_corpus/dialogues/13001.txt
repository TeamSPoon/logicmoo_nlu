What did you think of The Force Awakens?
I didn't like Rey.
Why not? I liked her.
I thought she was too powerful and had a flat personality.
Did you like Finn?
Yes, I liked him a lot more.
He was pretty funny.
His actor has a knack for comic timing.
What about Kylo Ren?
I was worried he would just be a copy of Darth Vader. It's interesting that he is so much more than that.
