I've been listening to music from the 1950's lately.
Really?    Why stuff so old?
It started when I was watching that show about Sun Records.
That was where Elvis Presley was discovered, right?
Yes, not just that, but a lot of popular artists that are the foundation of rock.
Who are some of these people?
Well, there is Ike Turner.
Tina's former husband?
Yes, he had a career before he started with her.
That's cool.    Who else?
Johnny Cash started there.
I've been meaning to see that movie.
It is good, but the soundtrack does not touch the real thing.
What should I download it I want to try him out?
He did a record in San Quentin prison, and it is amazing.
That must be something to hear!    Who else.
Well, Jerry Lee Lewis, the piano player.
There's Great Balls of Fire I know.
He is an amazing piano player, and his cousin is the preacher Jimmy Swaggart.
Well, I guess you can't have everything in life!
