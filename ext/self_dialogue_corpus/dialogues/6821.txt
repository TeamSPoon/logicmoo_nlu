My favorite Disney movie is Aladdin.  What is your opinion of that movie?
I can't believe the sultan was making his 16 year old daughter get married.
A lot of Disney movies are like that though.  What did you think of the songs?
A Whole New World is my favorite song.  I love it when Jasmine and Aladdin sing.
I really like that song but my favorite song is Prince Ali.
That is a really good song too.  Robin Williams made a really good genie.
Yes, he was a really good genie.  My favorite character is Abu.
Who doesn't like a monkey they are mischievous and funny?!
That is true my favorite part of the movie is when Carpet keeps playing tricks on Abu and scares him.
Carpet is the true in this movie.
