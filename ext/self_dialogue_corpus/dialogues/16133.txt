What have you been listening to lately?
A bunch of oldies, mostly.
Really, like what?
All different stuff. For starters, a ton of Elliott Smith.
Ah! I love him.
Yeah. I never get tired of his albums.
Me neither. I was doing chores around the house the other day, and I just listened to his album, Figure 8 on repeat.
That one's great. Is that your favorite?
Eh, that's a tough call.
I know. They're all good.
What's your favorite though?
X/O. Hands down. It's incredible.
I agree! So many people prefer either/or, but I like X/O the best.
Why do you think?
Ah, the production is just insane. What about you?
Totally! I also really dig how much you can hear the Beatles' influence.
Me too. I read this review one time, the reviewer called Elliott Smith derivative of the Beatles.
No way! He was definitely inspired by them, but it's not like he was constantly ripping off their tunes.
I know. It's ridiculous. They compared his song, "Now you're just somebody that I used to know" to "Ive just seen a face".
They're nothing alike. I'm so glad you agree though. Let's listen to XO in the car.
