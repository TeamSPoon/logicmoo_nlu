Splash was another one of his movies.
That movie was great, Tom Hanks is a good actor.

I like the part where the mermaid was trying to adapt with city life.
I can't believe Tom Hanks didn't figure out sooner that she was a mermaid.
She hid it very well.

I liked it when he was swimming in the fish tank.
That was the funniest scene!
