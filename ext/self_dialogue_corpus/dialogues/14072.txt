Lady Gaga was on Saturday Night Live last night. Did you see it?
Yes, and I loved it.
I know! A-yo is so fun and catchy!
Yeah! But it has a more stripped-down feel to it.
I heard the new album was going to be like that.
I loved the second one, Million Reasons.
I know. The lyrics just really resonated with me.
Me too. It perfectly captured the feelings I had when I went through my last breakup.
Her songwriting is so raw like that.
I can't wait to hear the whole album.
