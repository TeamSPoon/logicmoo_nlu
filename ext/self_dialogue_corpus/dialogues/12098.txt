I heard that Lucas wanted Luke to fall to the Dark Side at the end of Return of the Jedi.
It would have had a certain symmetry, but there isn't enough setup.
Luke wasn't ready to confront Palpatine and Vader.  Yoda said it himself.   If Luke left at the end of Empire Strikes Back, he was guaranteeing his fall.
Audiences wouldn't understand that, though. They'd take Yoda's warnings as being overly fearful.
Yoda knows what he's talking about, though.  Everything in the movies confirm that.
I think that audiences would have needed it to be more explicit, and there would need to be more buildup.  What does Palpatine have to offer Luke?
Nothing.  But that's the point. The Dark Side isn't rational. It's insane.  If you flirt with it, it'll make you insane, too.
It's still difficult to grasp-. No one really wants there to be a giant force of insanity out there. They prefer rational villains.
Lucas didn't, apparently. He liked the Ming the Merciless type of evil for evil's sake.
That's his mistake, I think.
