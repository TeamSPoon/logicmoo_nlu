Do you think rock music has to be subversive in order to be good?
I think it plays a part, but 'good' is very subjective.
I think the really good stuff always has a political message.
Sure, but there's also a formula for it being successful.
Like Korn's song 'ya'll want a single'?
Exactly like that. There's a whole industry built on formulating how long's should be and how fast.
That detracts from the work of the artist.
Of course it does. You will notice that after they become popular and money, then the artist has more freedom to be subversive.
At that point, though, they have already become part of the system.
That's the music industry and capitalism for you. Take art and make it commercial.
