Hi. Would you like to come over tonight to watch a movie and have dinner?
That sounds like a lot of fun, what move are we watching?
I was thinking "A league of their own."
That is one of my favorite baseball movies, Geena Davis is so good.
She is. My favorite is Tom Hanks as Jimmy Duggan the coach.
Who doesn't love a falling down drunk?
Do you know who directed it?
Penny Marshall did.
Penny Marshall from "Laverne and Shirley?"
That's her. She made a great movie.
I have heard they want to make a sequel.
I hope they don't, the movie is so perfect, it does not need a sequel?
What was the name of the woman who played, Dottie's sister, Kit?
Her name is Lori Petty.
I think she was in "Orange is the new black"
Yes, she was.
This movie is kind of old, do you remember what year it was made?
It came out my first year of high school, which was 1992.
My favorite line from the movie is "Avoid the Clap, Jimmy Duggan."
That's good advice.
