Hi, do you watch NFL?
Sure, I watch a few here and there. I live in the Chicago area, so I guess I have reason to root for the Bears.
So, you don't say?
Yeah, but I don't have much time to watch, I work a lot.
It would be nice for the Bears to get a championship.
Yeah, I remember that one time when they last made it to the Superbowl.
I remember that to, they made it all the way that far but lost.
Yeah, they should have one that one, they did really well that year.
I like the Bears too, just wish they were more competitive.
Me too, if you play for a big city like Chicago, you should go out and play well.
They still talk about Urlacher and he's long retired.
Yeah, I mean he played defense right?
Yes, he was like a defensive back.
We just need a better overall team.
Yes, I agree with that.
Yeah, its a tough sport.
I like the Colts.
You do? That's cool.
Yeah, I live in the Indy area, so I go to their games when I can.
That's cool. Sounds interesting.
