Do you like Opera?
I love Opera.  Do you like to listen to Opera music without words
Sometimes.  Especially music from Carmen.
Carmen was the first Opera I ever saw.  It was great.
Have you seen Carmen Jones?
Yes.  It really helps to understand the story.  And I like Hammerstein's lyrics.
Do you like Madame Butterfly?
The music is great.
I love La Traviata.
Those arias are spectacular.
But, the first time I saw it was at a small Opera company that had only a five piece orchestra.
You need the whole orchestra to make it worthwhile.
I really liked Faust.
As a production, yes, but the music isn't as memorable as Carmen or La Traviata.
I am going to see La Boheme this next season.
Oh, I envy you. Those songs are amazing.
I like Rent too, but the original is the best.
I agree with you.
Did you know that the guy who plays Joe West on Flash was in the first production of Rent?
No!  That's neat.
