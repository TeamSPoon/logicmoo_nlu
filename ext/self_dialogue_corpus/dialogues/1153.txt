Did you hear about your favorite player?
No! What?
He just got knocked out on the field.
When?
It just happened.
Where was I?
In the kitchen.
Oh no.  Is he up?
Nope.  Still out cold.
This is scary.
They're taking his vitals.
He doesn't look good.
They're putting him on the stretcher.
Great.
But he's still out.
Man, this sucks.
He's doing the thumbs up sign!
And the crowd goes wild.
I'm glad he woke up.
Yeah, me too.
