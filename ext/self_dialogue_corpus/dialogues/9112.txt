Who is the greatest rock and roll band of all time?
That is a tough question.
I think it's Led Zeppelin.
That's now a bad choice. What about Metallica?
I loved Metallica until they went crazy about the Napster thing.
Can you blame them for being mad at Napster?
Not really, but it's funny how all music is digital now.
Metallica was ahead of the curve on trying to get paid for digital music.
I still feel like 'Enter Sandman' is one of the greatest songs ever.
That is a great song.
