What are your thought on he new UFC fight kits?
What do you mean , what changed from the last ones . I have honestly not been keeping p with anything
Well, let's see the fighters no longer have the ability to design their own figh gear, like the shorts or the womens tops
so what does the FC have in place now?
The company standardized the uniforms through a reebok deal to try to make the fighters a little more uniform and look like a legit sport .
are you telling me that the fighters no longer have the ability to add sponsers logos on the fight kits ?
yes , the sad part is that , through this new deal the fighter make less money because on average most of them would bottom out at around eighty thosand a fight for the sponsed gear.
That does not make any sense , not the fighters are getting paid less and have accepted a deal with reebok ?
yes
what do the kits look like ?
they have two types, in year one it was the fighters name on the shirt and the name on the shorts with a white on black colors and a triangle accent on the bottom of the fight kit .
whas there a reebok logo on it ?
of course !
what did the second generation look like ?
it was based on the same concept , but now it was more bolder colors instead of the whie acents, entire kits were designed to be yellow or green for brazil and all blue for the nited states . It basically took more of the white highlights from the first generation and replaced them with black.
do you have a pictre you can show me on your phone ?
yes, take a look !
These are ok but not the best design , why is there a monster logo on the champions fight kit ?
so the UFC can have hand selected brands to partner with reebok.
Thats so unfair but a really good business play .
