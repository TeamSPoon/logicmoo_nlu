Do you like acapella music?
What's that?
It is music with voices only, no instrumentation.
Oh, I've heard some of that.
Really, what have you heard?
Pentatonix
Yeah I've heard them too
What do you think about them?
They sound overly processed to me?
Are they?
I don't know, I just know that I don't like them as much as other bands I've heard.
Which ones do you like?
I like Street Corner Symphony
Where are they from?
They are from Nashville, TN
Anyone else you could suggest?
Mike Tompkins, kind of...
Why kind of?
He uses a lot of electronics so it's not "really" acapella.
Ok, thanks, I'll check them out.
