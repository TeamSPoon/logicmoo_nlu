I just saw The Others.
That's an oldie, no?
2001, Nicole Kidman.
Neat.  What's the plot?
Nicole and her two kids are holed up in a spooky house, post WW2.
Is the house haunted?
Yes, it is.  She tries to get rid of the ghosts.
Does she succeed?
No.  In fact, she discovers she and the kids are ghosts!
Wild, interesting.
