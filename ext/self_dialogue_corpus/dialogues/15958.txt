Do you like Rick Springfield?
Do you mean that old 80's singer who did Jesse's Girl?
Yes, but he had other hits besides Jesse's Girl.
I don't remember anything besides Jesse's Girl.
Do you remember a song called Human Touch?
Oh, yes.  I remember that one, but I didn't think it was by Rick Springfield.
He also had State of the Heart. Souls, and Hard to Hold.  That's just a few more.
You must be a huge fan of Rick Springfield.
I am.  I have seen him in concert many times .
He still performs now?
Yes, he does.  He's older but he still sounds great.
That is great.  I hate it when I see somebody from the 80's but their voice sounds different.
Rick Springfield's voice is bit rougher than it was in the past, but it makes his sound interesting.
When did you see him in concert?
I saw him at the Arkansas State Fair last year.  Before that, I saw him in Atlanta several times, and I saw him first in Little Rock in the 80's.  I also saw him in Las Vegas.
He has a Vegas show?
He did have one.  He was in a show called EFX for a few years.
I thought that show was headlined by David Cassidy?
It was.  It started out with Michael Crawford, then David Cassidy.  Rick Springfield had a stint in the show, also.
I did not realize Rick Springfield was so busy for all of these years!
