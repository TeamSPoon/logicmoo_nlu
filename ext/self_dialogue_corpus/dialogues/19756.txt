Have you heard of The Birthday Massacre?
No I haven't, what kind of music do they make?
It's synth pop. Or rock, if you will. They've actually been around since 1999.
Where are they from?
They're a Canadian band from London, Ontario.
I'll definitely have to check them out. Who would you compare them to sounding like?
Hmm... I would say maybe a mix of Evanescence and Sneaker Pimps (when they had a female vocalist), with a hint of Marilyn Manson.
Sounds pretty interesting.
Oh, I just remembered. They were actually originally called "Imagica" when their band first came out.
Ohhhh ok I do know who they are! It's Chibi who is the lead singer, right?
Yes! The reason they changed their name from "Imagica" to "The Birthday Massacre" is because they didn't want people to confuse them with the California death metal band with the same name!
I did not know that. I don't think I have heard of that death metal band. Although it's probably because I don't listen to death metal...
I agree. Do you remember what songs you heard from the Birthday Massacre when they were Imagica?
I think it was one song called "Happy Birthday".
Oh. ok. That was actually one of their first songs. It was originally titled "The Birthday Massacre" but they changed it to "Happy Birthday" later on!
What are some of your favorite songs from "The Birthday Massacre"?
I really like "Movie", "Red Stars", and "To Die For". But they're my favorite band so I really love them all!
They sound like a unique band and I will definitely be checking them out. Any specific albums of theirs that I should listen to first?
I really liked "Pins and Needles" and "Walking with Strangers". I like their older stuff better than their newer stuff.
Great! I will check them out and let you know what I think! Thanks for letting me know about them!
