Who is your favorite NFL announcer?
I don't like any of them
Why not?
They're all not that smart
I agree they don't add much to the game
I like Terry Bradshaw
He is entertaining in the pregame shows
Who did he play for?
I think he was a Cowboys quarterback
I'm happy there are more and more people of color becoming quarterbacks
The NFL and the college level are certainly making strides
They need to get more minority head coaches as well
I agree. It's important
I like that Sarah Thomas is a refferee in the league
Oh me too.
I wish there were more females represented in general
Right and not just as sideline reporters
Though Erin Matthews is great
I like her reporting
She knows what she's talking about
