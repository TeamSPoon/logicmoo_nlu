How do you think the Cowboys defense will be next season.
It should be great compared to last season!
Huh? They lost several key defensive players over the season.
Like who?
Nolan Carroll and Barry Church are two that come to mind.
Yeah they were ok last season but they gave up big plays. The team didn't lose much.
How are they going to make up for those guys and the others they lost on defense?
Did you not watch the draft this year?
Not really. Who did the Cowboys pick up?
They used their first pick on Taco Charlton a defensive end out of Michigan.
Never heard of him.
He is a beast! Taco will be an impact player his first league in the year.
That sounds promising. Who else did they pick up?
Chidobe Awuzie! Say that five times fast. He is a cornerback from Colorado.
That is a strange name. So they used their first two picks for defensive players. That's a good sign.
Yeah they made great choices with those two and they also picked up two more cornerbacks and a safety with their remaining picks.
Wow! They did go defense heavy in the draft.
The Cowboys are not dumb. They saw the problems last year and went out and got what they needed.
It seems like it. How good do you expect such a young defense to be?
There will be some growing pains for sure but I think they will step up and get the job done.
