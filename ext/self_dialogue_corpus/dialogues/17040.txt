Hey , have you heard any new music lately?
Not really. I've been listening to a lot of classics.
Why classics? Don't you like new stuff?
I do but new music just isn't as good.
Could you explain what you mean?
I just like the way that lyrics in classic music carried more emotion in them.
That's your opinion but I can see how you might feel that way.
For sure. I've been listening to a lot of classic rock and rap.
Oh really? Which artists have you been listening to?
I really like ACDC and Metallica when it comes to rock.
Wow, I really like those bands too.
As far as rap I have been listening to Tupac and Biggies as well as DMX.
Those are some classics for sure!
Yea, I have liked them since I was a kid and the new rap just doesn't hold up.
I can imagine it comes back to the lyrics again huh?
Yep. This new stuff doesn't really have meaning to me. Just mindless words that are flashy and hyper.
That's a good way to put it. I don't listen to much rap.
You should check out some of the classics, you might change your mind.
OK I will do that and let you know next time I see you.
Awesome! Have a good day.
