So, how was work today?
It was fine, me and my co-worker were debating about music all day.
What were you guys debating about?
We were talking about the most iconic song of all time.
What song did he say that it was?
He feels very strongly that it is Billie Jean from Micheal Jackson.
That is a very popular song. What did you say?
I argued that it is Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
That is a pretty good pick actually.
I feel like everyone knows that song. While Billie jean is a great song, I think more people know Sweet Home Alabama.
I think you are right about this one. However, there are a lot of other songs that could be considered most iconic.
You could be right, which ones?
What about Stairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin?
I did not even think about that one,nice choice.
It is a song that I feel most people are at least familiar with in some type of way.
Do you have any more that could be considered in this category?
What about Smells Like Teen Spirit?
I do not know much about that song, who sings it?
Nirvana! I thought everyone knew that song!
Well apparently not! I never really listened to Nirvana though.
