It's funny how some songs sound better playing on old, poor fidelity equipment.
Like what?
Well, I had fond memories of hearing Dionne Warwick's songs on the radio back in 1968.
On a car radio? AM radio, mono, not stereo, right?
Yes, exactly.
Dionne Warwick had some big hits back then, like "Do You Know The Way To San Jose", and a lot of others.
Right, right.  And I had fond memories of hearing them all on a crummy quality car radio back then.
So which songs didn't hold up for you?
Well, I got "The Very Best of Dionne Warwick", and hadn't heard some of the songs in years.
I remember hearing "Walk On By" a couple of weeks ago, and it still sounded good.
Almost all of them sounded great with my headphones on, except one song.
Which one?
"Trains And Boats And Planes". It sounded fine, years ago, on cheap audio equipment.
Did it sound too old-fashioned or corny or sappy or maybe depressing, like her "(Theme From) Valley Of The Dolls"?
No, no. I still loved the song, but there was one feature in the way the song was recorded that ruined it for me.
What was it? There's a lot of songs ruined by too much high cymbal-playing or muddy bass...
It was an awful wah-wah pedal off to one side of the song! It sounded like an elephant sneezing. For the whole song.
Could you get rid of it by turning down the treble or something?
No. I even tried running the song through some noise reduction software to get rid of that awful, disturbing sound.
You've got me wanting to listen to that song now just so I can hear what you're talking about.
