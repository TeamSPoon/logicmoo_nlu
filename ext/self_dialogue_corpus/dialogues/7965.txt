You like pop music right?
I do!  I'm really into some of Fifth Harmony's stuff.
I like them too.  I love "Work from Home" and I play it all the time!
That's one of my favorites too!
Do you like Ariana Grande?
I do.  She's pretty good.  Her music is good to dance to. How do you feel about Taylor Swift?
I love her!  I think her music is great and she's such a nice person too!
I like it when stars are good people.  Lady Gaga is really nice too.
I've heard that.  I know someone that met her and they said she's super sweet.
I believe it.  I love her music.  I can't help but sing along to "Poker Face"
