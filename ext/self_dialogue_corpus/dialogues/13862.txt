Have you seen BORN THIS WAY?
Yes it is by Lady Gaga.
I liked the black unicorn.
It had the manifesto of MOTHER MONSTER.
She talked about aliens or something.
She talked about a new race.
And it was without judgement.
And also boundless freedom.
I guess she was the first in the new race.
It is a strange video.
