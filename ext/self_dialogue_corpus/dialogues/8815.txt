I've been a fan of rock music since the 1960's.
What were your favorite groups from back then?
The Rolling Stones and Cream were my favorites.
Cream had some good albums, but their live album "Wheels of Fire" was recorded terribly.
Yeah, live recording technology has come along way!
Did you like southern rock?
Yes, The Allman  Brothers were fantastic. They had a tragic history.
For sure. Duane Allman  and Berry Oakley died within a year of each other---both by motorcycle accidents.
Rock music has changed so much over the years. I wouldn't classify today's rock music as rock---most of it is pop.
Yes, I agree.
