Is Sum 41 still a band?
I dont remember them doing anything after the song Fat Lip
That was a huge pop hit
I would say it was rock
You could say it was pop punk if you wanted.
Yeah I just remember the video for it was pretty good.
It was an anthem at the time.
So they dont tour anymore?
I think they do just their fanbase is older.
Its a shame because they sounded like they could write a huge hit.
