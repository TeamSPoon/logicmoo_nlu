So you think there ever be another Superbowl Team like the 1985 Chicago Bears?
No. Sometimes greatness and sweetness In the NFL is a once in a lifetime thing.
Sweetness? You talking about Walter Payton. He died didn't he?
Yes he did.
Is he the only of the 1985 Superbowl team that has died.
No, Dave Duerson has passed.
You now that I think about it, they have and are experiencing some rough times.
Yeah. They're saying McMahon might have the same thing Duerson had.
Aw no. I also heard Big William Perry was sick.
Yeah I heard that too but I don't think that was the concussion disease.
Then what is or was it?
I think I heard he has diabetic issues.
That's sad. I heard he lost a lot of his money too.
I don't if it's true but I heard that also.
How did Payton or Sweetness  as everyone calls him die?
I think he had a bad liver or something like that?
You think they will ever call Ditka back to coach any football team?
I don't think he wants to coach anymore.
I wonder where Richard Dent, Mike Singletary and Otis Wilson are these days.
During Superbowl season they can be found commentating on different sports shows.
