Ever seen Elton John live?
No,that's one pop singer I really want to see.
I saw him once.
Nice,did he play all his hits.
Probably impossible to play them all.
He's got a ton.
He did play,Goodbye Yellowbrick Road,Daniel,Candle In The Wind.
I love candle in the wind.
Yea,it's about Princess Diane.
I know,it's so sad.
