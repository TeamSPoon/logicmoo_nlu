What is your favorite current pop song?
Bruno Mars That's What I Like. Such a good beat.
I enjoy the beat but those lyrics...
What is wrong with the lyrics, I love them!
I feel like they are just one cliche after another.
I don't think so. I think it is a fun song and he really probably likes all those things.
He very well may, but who doesn't?
I am not sure most guys enjoy strawberry champagne.
Maybe have me there, but just feel this songs lyrics are too generic for me to appreciate.
Fair enough. But I find them super catchy and fun.
