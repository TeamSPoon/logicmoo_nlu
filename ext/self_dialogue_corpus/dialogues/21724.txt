What's up?
Not much. Just watching movies. You?
Coincidentally I'm doing the same. What are you watching?
Ouija: Origin of Evil starring Elizabeth Reaser, Lulu Wilson, and Annalise Basso.
Isn't that by director Mike Flanagan? I really liked his movies Oculus and Hush.
Yeah, but I much prefer Absentia over hush but Oculus was absolutely fantastic! What are you watching?
That one Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling movie. The Nice Guys.
Oh? How is it?
It's Ryan Gosling. It's great!
Big Ryan Gosling fan then?
I'm starting to be. Have been binge watching some of his films back to back?
Like what? What are some of your favorites?
Always hard to choose between good movies but probably Lars and the Real Girl, Murder By Numbers, and Fracture.
Oh I loved Fracture! That's the one with the guy that played Hannibal Lector right?
Yeah, Anthony Hopkins. Another great hollywood and theater actor.
I'd imagine. His film credits start all the way back to 1960's tv show A Matter of Degree and his first film was...
A Flea in Her Ear if you count televised movies or Red, White and Zero otherwise.
I don't normally watch black and white movies but Red, White and Zero was really good. What'd you think of his 1969 role in Hamlet?
As Claudius? Pure perfection of course.
That man can do no wrong. Going to be a dark day in Hollywood and much of the world when he passes.
