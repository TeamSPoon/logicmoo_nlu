Would you consider Get Out a horror movie?
No it was more suspense
Some of the themes sort of beg to differ.
Thats true but I dont think anything was scary
Sure it was, the actors did a great job of that.
This is true, I guess you could say it was a horror movie.
There were elements of that movie that were so scary

How the townspeople seemed so convoluted.
I think its really subjective but I am leaning towards agreeing with you.
