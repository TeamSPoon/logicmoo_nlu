How do you feel about Reggae music?
I don't mind it. Why do you ask?
It is my favorite type of music.
Interesting. What kind of artists do you listen too?
My favorite is Bob Marley. He was unbeatable.
I know some of his music!
You do? What songs do you like?
I absolutely love the song No Woman No Cry.
Oh my goodness, me too!
I am sure I know of more of his songs but don't recognize that he is the one who sings them.
Do you know the song One Love?
Yes! He sings that?
Yeah, and he also sings I Shot The Sheriff.
Oh wow, he had a lot of hits.
He really did. His music is still so relevant.
Are there any newer reggae bands around?
Actually Bob Marley's son is a reggae singer and he is also very good.
Wow, that is awesome. What is his name?
Ziggy. Ziggy Marley.
I will have to check out some of his music. Thanks!
