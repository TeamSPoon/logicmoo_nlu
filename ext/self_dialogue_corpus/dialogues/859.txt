Hey, what's up?
It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
It's not that I hate on Manning, it's just Brady is obviously much better.
You seriously can't acknowledge that 0-4 isn't the best the NFL's has seen in a long time.
I can acknowledge Brady can kill that record with very little effort.
What he could do and what he can do are two different things.
This is true, but 4-0 is really no big deal.
You say Manning's record is no big deal, but no one has beaten it.
It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about.
Well, what has Brady done on the field?
What has Brady done? He's done multiple Super Bowls.
No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?
That team would have never seen a single Super Bowl without Brady. That's his contribution.
Again, that's a team effort. Brady does not stand out of the pack.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
Fantasy football doesn't win Superbowls. Players would kill to get a ring.
What good is winning the Super Bowl if everybody's going to focus on poster boy Brady?
They'd still have their place in history as Super Bowl winners and not fade into the sunset like miserable Manning.
