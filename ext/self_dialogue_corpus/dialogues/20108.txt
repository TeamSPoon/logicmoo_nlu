What's your favorite western movie?
I like True Grit a lot. That's probably my favorite.
Have you seen the Coen brothers' version?
Yeah, it was really good, but I still prefer the original.
I have a hard time getting over how bad Glen Campbell's acting was in the original.
It wasn't great, but I've seen much worse. It doesn't take away from the film that much.
That's pretty huge though isn't it? He was a country music superstar and he got to star in a classic western film with John Wayne.
Yeah, it doesn't get any better than that.
My favorite western is Big Jake.
Yes, another John Wayne classic.
I think that film has some amazing dialogue.
Definitely. There are a bunch of memorable moments.
I still say little quotes from that movie here and there.
That's funny. I do the same thing sometimes.
I guess we both prefer John Wayne over Clint Eastwood then?
I definitely do. Clint Eastwood was always cold and unrelatable I thought.
I know. I feel the same way. John Wayne was cool while still being relatable and fun.
Clint Eastwood is still making movies isn't he?
Yeah, he's mainly a director now.
That's right. He came out with that movie about the airline pilot last year.
