What movie did you end up seeing this weekend?
I finally ended up watching Braveheart, believe it or not.
Braveheart?! That movie is pretty old!
I know. I just never saw it before, somehow.
It's a long one if I remember correctly.
Yes. I think it was like three hours long.
So, did you like it?
Definitely! I can see why everyone always says such good things about it.
I loved it. I think it's really what made Mel Gibson such an unforgettable actor.
He was great in it. The whole thing was so well done.
I recently saw a scene from another movie where the guys are in kilts and they have sword fights.
Oh yeah?
Yes. I think it was Rob Roy.
I heard of that. It's with Liam Neeson, right?
Yes. I saw a scene where he actually is about to lose a sword fight.
Don't ruin it for me.
I won't.
Liam Neeson was in Star Wars, too, I think.
Yes. He's had lots of roles.
He was in an old movie called "Nel" too, I think.
