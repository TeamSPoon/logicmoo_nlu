Those stars seem great together.
Do you think so?
Yea, they have been in many movies before.
Yea, they do seem to have great chemistry.
I agree. They just seem to click.
What kinds of ways do you see their chemistry?
Well, they seem to know their lines and are confident in them.
Do you like movies with just one of these actors?
Yea, any of them have good movies alone, but they are better together.
I agree. Sometimes more is better.
The more the merrier. I know.
I wonder if its weird being Jennifer as she is the only girl.
I'm sure its not weird cashing the checks.
Yea, I'm sure that she loves those.
Yea, who wouldn't
Well, nobody I guess.
Yea, I agree with that one.
She is definitely a star.
She is, but so are the others.
Yea, they are all amazing.
