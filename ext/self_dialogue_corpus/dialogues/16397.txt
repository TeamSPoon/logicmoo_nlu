Hey, do you like drum and bass?
Yeah, I love drum and bass!
Did you know the genre was created from a drum sample? It's the most used drum sample in the world.
Really? I hear it all the time, not just in drum and bass. I always wondered where it came from.
I watched a documentary on it called "The world's most import 6 second drum loop."
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, it's on Youtube.
I love Youtube! Can you send me the link?
Here's the link.
Thanks, this should be pretty interesting.
After you watch it, you'll realize that sample is used everywhere!
It's amazing that drum sample was used to implement hip hop, drum and bass- so many things!
Yeah, it's so cool how art can inspire more art.
I felt inspired just after watching it.
Who would've guessed, right?
I like that the name is called "The Amen Break"
Most of my favorite songs contain that sample.
Mine as well. I have a whole playlist of them.
Cool, can you send me the playlist!
Of course, thanks for sending the link!
