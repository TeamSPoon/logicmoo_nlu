What do you think the final side film for Star Wars will be about?
I hope Boba Fett.
Yeah, I always wondered what happened to him.
Yeah, and he was a total stud too.
I like how we saw him in the prequels.
Yeah, and how he had a tragic death of his father effect him.
Yeah but his father had it coming.
He doesn't care about that.  That was his origin story.
That would make for an awesome movie.
Yeah, it would make for some good gap filling.
