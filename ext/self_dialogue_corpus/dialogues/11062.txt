Do you remember when Wayne Gretzky used to play?
Yes! He was and is a legend!
Did you watch the Canucks game last night?
I missed it - did they win or lose?
My favorite player is Kirk McLean. Who is your's?
I love Pavel Bure. No one is better than the Russian Rocket!
Did you see that goal that Linden scored last night?
Yeah, it was a classic move going around that goal post.
That save Brodeur made in tonight's game really saved the game for the Devils.
I know, I couldn't believe he was able to stop that puck.
I think that hockey these days isn't quite as exciting as it used to be. There's too much fighting and not enough focus on the game itself.
Really? The only reason I watch hockey is for the fights!
The referees are ruining tonight's game between the Kings and the Oilers. Way to many penalties.
I know, what is going on with the penalties tonight? The refs should just let the players play.
I was listening to tonight's game on the radio and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
Yeah, I was in the bleachers and nearly bit my nails off. It was a nailbiter but we pulled off the win in overtime.
Man, I wish those Canucks could win that Stanley Cup one day, but they always seem to choke in the playoffs.
Yes, I was a huge fan back in the day but their lack of execution when it really counts is a real disappointment. The riots don't help either.
I used to play hockey as a kid but it's so hard on your body. It really is a game for young folks.
I hear you. It's just amazing that a legend like Gordie Howe was able to play into his 50s.
