Pinocchio was kind of a scary movie
it was at some parts, like when he was swallowed by the whale
and when he went to that place with those bad boys
Geppeto was always telling him to be careful
I guess he was just a curious boy
that is true, without guidance how would he know how to act
his nose grew so big at one point
I know that part was so weird
how did a puppet know what a real boy was anyway
I know, if he was never alive how would he know !?
