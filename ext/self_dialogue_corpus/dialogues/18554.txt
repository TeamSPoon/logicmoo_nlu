Do you like Florence and the Machine?
I like "Dog Days are Over." But I like the video more than the song.
For me, it's the opposite. All that makeup is creepy.
The song was recorded without instruments in a studio the size of a bathroom, according to the band.
It's a popular video on youtube, more than 1 million views.
Yea, The video has 1 million hits. Do you know the history?
The song came out in 2008.  They filmed the video in London.
Florence Welch filmed the original video on a cheap video camera in the forest with her father and Marks & Spencer sandwiches.
I didn't know that.
I know you didn't. When they re-released the song in 2010, the song soared on the charts and a lot of critics believe it was because of the artistic vision of the new video she created .
I still think that the song has good lyrics.
Me too, but getting back to the original video, her father put on a clown costume and her nephew dressed up as a baby clown. It was eerie
Do you remember when Slumdog Millionaire was coming out? That was the theme song.
It was used in the trailer for Eat, Pray, Love too.
I guess that any video is better than the official video.
Drop it already. The 2010 video is completely professional; it was directed by Geremy Jasper and edited by Paul Snyder.
Well, it should have won some awards then. Why didn't it?
It did. The video won the MTV Video Awards for Best Art Direction in September 2010.
In 2010, I remember seeing the band perform live on Saturday Night Live and the Colbert Show.
They were on the Colbert show in 2011, actually.
