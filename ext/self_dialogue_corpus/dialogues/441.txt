What do you think about the NFL's age limit for the draft?
Remind me again what it is.
The rule says they can't draft a player who isn't equivalent to a junior or senior in college.
Ooh, this rule. Controversial, I remember.
Go ahead.
They should be able to draft anyone they want. If someone is 20 and able to transition easily, go for it.
What about education?
What do you mean?
They basically abandon their education.
So what if they do? They'll make $10 million and then finish as they retire.
It sets a bad example.
If you're letting your kids use NFL players as role models, you're a bad parent.
Ha, that's actually mean but kind of true.
A lot of these kids need to get drafted sooner because their family is so impoverished.
But if they get hurt?
If they get hurt early and ruin their NFL careers, so be it. It's a sport, not a job.
You're harsh.
I'm opportunist. A company should be able to hire whomever they think will do the best. So what if they're 19?
I don't know. Their bodies aren't ready for it.
The only issue is they CAN'T return to college after declaring. I hate it.
