Hey, haven't talked to you in awhile!
I know man, sorry I've been so busy with work.
Oh trust me I know that all too well.
How have you been?
I've been great! Had a few days off and was able to catch some movies with the wife.
See anything good?
Yes we watched Split last night.
Never heard of it!
Oh man, it's a crazy bizarre movie.
What's it about?
It's about a guy with tons of personalities who kidnaps some teenage girls.
Oh I think I saw something about that, like they have to figure out his personalities to escape.
Yes! It's really creepy and a little controversial.
In what ways?
There's some abuse and I guess mental illness stigmas.
I bet it is thought provoking though.
Oh for sure! It has some very taboo issues in it.
I like movies like that because as a culture it gets us talking.
Yes I think that was sort of the intent of the movie was to get us talking about issues we don't talk about enough.
Well I'm definitely going to have to put that movie on my watch list!
