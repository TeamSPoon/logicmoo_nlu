How do you like these new artists like Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper?
Oh they're some of my favorites. They've got this new flow that I really enjoy.
Yeah I get what you're saying, it's not like as aggressive as some of that stuff from back in the day.
What are you talking about? I mean the way he speaks his raps -- who did you know that was aggressive?
Well I mean, just off the top of my head? Three Six Mafia, 'Slob On My Nob' was downright dirty!
Haha, you're right about that. But don't forget about Lil' Wayne, he was one of the greatest, and had some chill songs.
Yeah you are right, I remember listening to 'Hustler Musik' and just kicking it.
Oh that was a really good one. But honestly even his more hype stuff was great, remember The Carter?
How could I forget? 'This is the Carter, so hold on to your teenage daughters!'
Haha! Lil' Wayne has got to get back to that level.
