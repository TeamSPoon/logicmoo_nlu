Have you seen the new Guardian of the Galaxy movie yet?
No, but I'm going this weekend.  I can't wait!
I take it you were a fan of the first one.
Yes, I thought it was excellent.
What is your favorite movie you've seen so far this year?
Probably Beauty and the Beast.  It was visually stunning.
There look like a lot of good movies coming out later this year.  Which one are you most looking forward to?
The remake of Aliens.  The first one was so scary!
I agree. Did you see all the originals?
Yes, but I think the special effects are going to be even better this time.
I really liked Promethieus.  Did you see that.
Yes, I did a couple of times!
What other types of movies do you like?
I really like the young adult books that have been turned into movies.
Which has been your favorite?
Probably the Hunger Games series.
Jennifer Lawrence was great in those.  Did you see Passengers?
Yes, I thought it was okay but I was kind of disappointed.
Agree.  At least Chris Pratt can make up for it in Guardians 2!
I expect he will!
