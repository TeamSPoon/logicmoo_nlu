So have you been listening to any new music?
Not really anything new, mostly the same bands I've been listening to for a while.
Oh yeah? Like what?
I've really been on a Blue October kick lately.
Have they even put out anything new?
I honestly haven't checked. I didn't like their last album much.
But you like the rest of their stuff?
Yeah, mostly. I really like their album "Sway".
Me too! I didn't care for a lot of their early stuff, though.
I agree, some of it was sort of rough.
I really enjoyed some of their darker albums though.
Did you like "Any Man in America"?
Mostly. You?
It was alright. I think that the best years were between "Foiled" and "Sway", though.
I can see why you'd think that. They had a much more honest sound.
I'm happy that Justin got his life together and seems happy, but I do think that his music has suffered a little bit for it.
I just couldn't relate to "Home". It was too upbeat and family-oriented for me.
Not really what you'd expect from the band, right?
Exactly! It was just so different from the sound they sold us on for so many years!
Yup! You're the first person I've talked to who has agreed with me about that!
