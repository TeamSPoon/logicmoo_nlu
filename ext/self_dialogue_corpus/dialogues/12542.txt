What was your favorite Star Wars Villain?
Is there any other answer than Darth Vader?
Yes, I liked Darth maul the most.
What?! Darth Vader is iconic, Darth Maul is already forgotten about.
He is not! People still dress up like him for Halloween.
Yea, but it's been what, 10 years since his movies have come out?
Yea, so what?
Well its been over 40 for the original trilogy.
I don't see your point.
My point is, even after 40 years people still dress like Darth Vader, they wont be of Darth Maul in 2040.
