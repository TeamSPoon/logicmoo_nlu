Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
101 Dalmations.
Which one?
The original, there is no other one in my book.
Well you'd be wrong, there are sequels and remakes, but ok.
Yea, but those don't capture you in the same way as the original animated movie.
I agree, I think Cruela Devil plays an amazing villain.
Yea, you really learn to hate her, she's despicable.
Who was your favorite dog?
Poncho, for sure!
