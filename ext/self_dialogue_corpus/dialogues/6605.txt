Did you get a chance to watch Toy Story 3?
Yes, I did. It was my favorite Toy Story.
That ending at the incinerator was pretty dark for a kid's movie.
I agree with you. It was so emotional.
Do you remember what it was rated?
I think it was rated G.
It should have been PG.
I can see what you are saying. Lotso himself should have made it PG.
Seriously, what a horrible character!
And yet I've seen Lotso dolls at the Disney store. Go figure!
