I'm going to be watching all of the Harry Potter movies at my place today.
Really? That sounds fun.
Did you want to join me? It's going to be pretty laid back.
Sounds great, thanks!
Which movie is your favorite?
I really like The Half Blood Prince as far as the books go, but The Prisoner of Azkaban has to be my favorite movie.
Oh, wow, cool. My favorite movie is definitely The Goblet of Fire, but I think the book is absolutely better than the movie.
Yeah, for sure. They left out so many details in the movies that would have been awesome to include.
I really hope that someday they make the books into a television show and put in all the details.
I'd watch that for sure!
