Hey do you want to go to the movies this weekend or something else?
The movies sounds like a good time.
Do you know any good movies that are out in theaters now?
I heard the new Spider-Man movie is suppose to be really good.
I don't know. Is a sequel to one of the other movies?
No it is a whole new cast and plot.
That is good, but I wish they would stop switching casts and just make a few good movies.
This one is suppose to be better than the other two casts that the movies have had.
Who plays Spider-Man in this version of the movie?
It is a guy named Tom Holland I believe.
I have never heard of him. Have you?
i think I have seen him in a movie before, but I am not too sure.
Any big name cast members?
I heard that Robert Downy Jr is in the movie playing as Iron Man.
That should be good, He is a great actor. Anyone else?
I am not too sure, but it is another Stan Lee production.
That is great to hear. That man makes many great movies.
He is really good at what he does in the making a movie.
So I guess we are going to see Spider-Man this weekend?
Yes I will see you there then!
