Who is your favorite rapper?
I really like Eminem. I can relate to him a lot.
He hasn't put anything new out for a while though, right?
Actually, he's got a new album due out this year.
I had no idea, I thought he was totally done with rapping.
No, I think he just needed a break. He's been through a lot.
I remember reading that he's had health problems.
Yes, he had a bad addiction to pills and I've heard he's bipolar.
Well, good for him if he's able to move past all that. I'll look for the new album when it drops.
I'll let you know as soon as I get a release date.
