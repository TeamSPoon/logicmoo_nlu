Are you going to see that new Frozen movie when it comes out?
No probably not.
Aw, why not?
I've never been a big fan of animated films.
Those are the best kind of Disney films though!
They're good for some people, I just prefer the live action approach.
Because it feels more real?
Yea, that and it's easier to connect to a character when it's someone giving human emotion and reactions on screen.
That makes sense.
Maybe one day if you're being nice I'll go see one with you.
