I saw the Exorcist when I was young.
Oh really. It's too scary.
I was terrified. I shouldn't have seen it.
The part with her head spinning around is scary.
It is scary because demons exist.
Yes, according to the Bible.
Possessions really happen in real life.
I've never heard of one.
It's documented.
That would scare me.
