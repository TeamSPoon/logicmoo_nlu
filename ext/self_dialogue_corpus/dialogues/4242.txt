I saw Panic Room the other day.
Another Jodie Foster strong girl movie?
Yes, directed by David Koepp.
Isn't Kristen Stewart in that?
Yes, at the tender age of twelve.
She was great in the Twilight movies.
She sure was.  She was good in this one.
Anyone else in it?
I liked Forest Whitaker as the soft-hearted crook.
He gets to play complex roles sometimes.
