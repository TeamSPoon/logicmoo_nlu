What was your top scene with Darth Vader in all of the Star Wars movies?
I really liked his appearance in Rouge One. That was incredible.
He barely had any dialogue in that movie.
Yes but we kept hearing about what a powerful user of the dark side of The Force Darth Vader and I feel like his scene in Rogue One finally showed that off.
How about your favorite Darth Vader scene from the original trilogy?
You definitely have to go with the icon scene in Empire Strikes Back where he reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker's father. Nothing tops that scene.
That was such a good scene. On top of that, it was also right after an emotional lightsaber duel between Vader and Skywalker.
Don't forget that Luke also loses his hand in that scene.
Did you like anything about Darth Vader in the prequal movies?
Well technically he wasn't Darth Vader then, he was still Anakin Skywalker. He didn't become Darth Vader until near the end of Revenge of the Sith.
