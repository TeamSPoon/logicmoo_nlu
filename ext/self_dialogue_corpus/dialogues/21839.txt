If I were to ask you, what is one of the greatest movies of all time, what would you say?
At this moment right now, I cannot help but go with Back to the Future.
I completely agree with that one. Back to the Future is one of the all-time great comedies.
To be honest, I probably could watch that movie several times a week and never get sick of it.
I understand that view point. What was your favorite scene?
I always enjoyed the scene at the end where Mart and Doc are at the clock tower and trying to do all they can to succeed in their mission.
I agree. That was a very intense scene but also a lot of fun to watch.
What scene stands out to you from the movie?
I love the scene where George finally takes a stand and punches out Biff.
That was another great moment. I found myself cheering when he actually punched him.
Another thing that makes Back to the Future so great is it's more than just a comedy.
What do you mean by that exactly?
It could also be considered a romantic, science fiction, and even dramatic film.
Okay, I can see that. Especially the romantic aspect of things.
I just think as far as a film goes, it has it all and a little bit for everyone.
So I think it is safe to say the movie still holds up all of these years and years later?
Definitely. I truly do not know anyone who dislikes that movie.
Is it just the original that you love or the entire trilogy.
Don't get me wrong. They are all great films, but I think the original was the best.
I agree. There is denying the amazing chemistry Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have.
