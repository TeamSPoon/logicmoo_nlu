What do you think will do big this year at the box office?
Oh, well, you know Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is definitely going to do well for sure.
Well, that's true, but I'm not going to see it in theaters, I'll wait to stream it.
I never watch movies via streaming. I prefer to watch my movies on disc.
Oh man, I could never give up Netflix. They make the best original films these days.
Well, I will admit that their Death Note movie does seem interesting.
Yeah, they have a ton of neat movies coming out, like To the Bone.
Wait, is that the movie with Keanu Reeves?
That's the one.
It's been forever since I've seen him in anything. I think the last thing I watched he was in was Knock Knock.
You didn't watch John Wick?
John Wick? I didn't watch The Matrix!
You gotta be kidding me! Tell me you're joking!
I will tell you that, because I am. Though, actually, I always preferred Johnny Mnemonic.
I forgot about that movie. We could use more cyberpunk films like that.
Cyberpunk movies went out of style 20 years ago.
True, but maybe the new Blade Runner will rekindle the genre?
Sequels made so long after the original are never good. For example, Zoolander 2, Anchorman 2, Blues Brothers 2000; need I go on?
I see your Blues Brothers and raise you a The Force Awakens.
Debatable my friend. Though, if you had said Rogue One I'd give you that, even if it is more of a spin-off than a real sequel.
