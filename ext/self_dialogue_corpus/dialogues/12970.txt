Hey, can you help me out here?
Sure. What are you doing?
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.
Oh, I'm not very good at those.
This one is different. It is a Star Wars crossword puzzle.
Oh, awesome! How can I help?
Well, I''m on my last word.
What's the question?
Dark Vader's mother?
Shmi Skywalker, of course! That was an easy one!
