What do you think of Madonna?
Do you mean the Queen of Pop?
Umm, I'm not sure she's the Queen of Pop
That's one of her nicknames
Really? I had no idea.
Yes, and I think she deserves it.
How come?
Think of all the hits that she's produced
Yeah, that's true. She does have a lot of good songs. From Like a Virgin to Hung Up.
Yes, they all hold up.
And she's been around for a long time.
Yes, she's been able to adapt her music from generation to generation.
How old is she anyway?
I believe she's 58.
Wow, good for her for still going strong.
Yeah, I think her last album was in 2015, Rebel Heart
Hmmm, I think I missed that one.
Yeah I don't think it received much praise.
Well it had to be better than Hard Candy
Yes, that one wasn't very good at all.
