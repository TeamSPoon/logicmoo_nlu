I love the Cubs!
They'll never win the World Series again.
Please, they are going to win it all again this year.
Never happen. Their pitching isn't good enough.
Yeah, but they have minor league guys they can trade for better pitchers.
Maybe, but they got lucky a lot last year.
I'd rather be lucky than good.
I'd rather be lucky and good. The Nationals are the best team this year.
The Nationals are all right. Bryce Harper is such a showboating player.
If you were as good as Harper you'd showboat too.
It's bad sportsmanship. If I hit a home run I would just run the bases like it was no big deal.
If you hit a home run you would cry with happiness.
Yeah, but I would do it while I was running. Besides the Nationals don't have good pitching either.
Good enough. Better than the Cubs.
But the Cubs have guys to trade. The Nationals don't have a good farm system.
I admit, the Cubs have a very good farm system, but the Nationals have a lot more money to spend on free agents.
The Cubs have a huge payroll!
But will they spend as much this year now that they have actually won the World Series?
Yes they will, because they want to win again.
The Cubs will win the World Series again in about a hundred years.
