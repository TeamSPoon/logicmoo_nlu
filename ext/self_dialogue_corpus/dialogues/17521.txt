So, what do you think of Elvenking?
i dunno... Is that like an LOTR thing?
Nah man, it's a band.
Oh? Could be interesting, what kind of music?
It's... well, it's Italian Folk Metal.
That's new... It could be interesting, what's your favorite album?
The Scythe, hands down, but they have some really good songs.
Oh? Like?
Well, The Scythe of course, but have you heard Skywards yet?
No, I'll look it up, any others?
The Cabal's their new one, give that a listen too.
I will. Can you buy this stuff or...?
Sure, itunes has it all.
Hmm... Good, I think I'll look em up.
When in doubt, they have stuff on youtube. I can't get enough of them.
Because of the music?
Yeah. Well, that and the hair.
What? Why?
It's like... think '80's hair, long and stuff.
Ah... I'll look them up.
