Was the movie "Maleficent" about "Sleeping Beauty"
Well in a roundabout way.
What do you mean?
Well it is told from the perspective of the evil fairy.
Oh and she is named Maleficent.
Right - the character played by Angelina Jolie.
She is pretty - but a little scary looking in that movie.
Yes the horns were pretty crazy looking.
But she is a great actress, she probably did a good job.
Oh yes.  She was great in that movie.
