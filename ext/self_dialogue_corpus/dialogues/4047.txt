Did you ever watch the Birds?
When I was a kid. Scared the crap outta me.
That movie isn't scary at all!
It's horror isn't it?
I'd classify it more as a thriller.
Hitchcock was a genious.
There'll be no replacing him.
"Master of Suspense"
Did you see the movie.
Yeah, with Hopkins playing the "Master". To good!
