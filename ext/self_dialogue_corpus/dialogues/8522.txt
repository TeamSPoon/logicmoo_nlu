Let's talk about pop music we like, would you like to go first?
I suppose I'll join in. Although I like older pop music, like 1980s. Rick Springfield is someone I like.
He was a big hit in the 1980s. I remember Jessie's Girl was his big hit.
Springfield had over 8 top 40 hits, and won multiple Grammy awards!
I did not know that. He was popular with my sister, I remember that. What do you think of Justin Timberlake?
Timberlake is really talented, and super funny on Saturday Night Live. I liked that song I'm Taking Sexy Back.
That whole album is amazing. I used to work out to Love Stoned also. He has a simmering intensity.
Surprising really, he looks kind of shy until he starts dancing, which he's really talented at.
I heard Janet Jackson and Timberlake were romantically involved. Now Janet Jackson, she kicks it!
Bet they had amazing chemistry. So much raw talent between them!
