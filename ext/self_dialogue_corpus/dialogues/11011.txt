You been watching the Stanley Cup?
Yes, it's been pretty good.  A lot of overtime games, so it's been fun to watch.
Yeah, I think Pittsburgh and Nashville are going to play for the championship, but I'm rooting for Ottawa so Canadians can have team win the first cup for them in a while.
Yeah, I don't really care one way or another.
I don't that much either.  Ottawa is a small market team with a smaller than average payroll and I like underdogs.
They are underdogs, but they do have a good team.
Yeah, that Karlsson guy is great!
He is absolutely one of the best.
Did you see that hit on Crosby the other night?
Yes.  He really hit boards awkwardly.
I was surprised he continued.  The way he went into the boards it looked like it would rearrange his spine.
It's amazing what these guys do to themselves sometimes and just go back into the game as if nothing happened.
Having played and knowing what it feels like, I especially find it amazing that they do it a such great speed and they're so big.  It's sometimes hard to comprehend how they come back from some of those hits.
Yeah, crazy game.
Who do think is going to win.
I don't know.  I kind of like Nashville because of their defenseman.  They have a half dozen of 'em that get into the offensive play, and Rinne is a good goalie.
I think you might be right.  Those defensemen could easily be the difference against any team they play.
I think Pittsburgh will win the East, and wouldn't be surprised if they win the cup again.
You're right.  They have a strong and very experienced team.  I hope someone else wins, but I think Pittsburgh has as good a chance as anybody.
I agree.  We'll see.  Later.
