Have you heard of Hiromi?
What is Hiromi?
Hiromi is a She. Her name is Hiromi Uehara.
Is she Japanese?
Yes. She's a Japanese jazz pianist.
That's interesting. I like jazz, but I never associated that genre with Japan.
I don't think there are any other prominent Japanese jazz artists, at least not known in the United States.
Is she very new on the scene?
She has been performing for quite a while. She signed with Telarc, a major record label, several decades ago.
Would I have heard anything of hers or recognize it?
If you watch anime you might occasionally hear some of her music in the score. Other than that I think it's pretty unlikely that you will encounter it.
How would you characterize her style?
She is known for having great technique and a very energetic style. She plays complex riffs with great speed, but it's still musical and nice to listen to for the most part.
That sounds cool. Is she cute?
I think she is what you expect of an attractive Japanese girl. She has a petite build and pleasant features with a soft, fair complexion.
I find Asian girls attractive. That coupled with the musical talent is intriguing.
Her virtuoso ability on the piano is really stunning - I would say even enough that you completely forget she's a cute girl.
Does she play with any jazz musicians I've heard of?
Yes. She has recorded albums with Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke to name a couple.
That's pretty impressive.
