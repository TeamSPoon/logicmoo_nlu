What is your favorite play in baseball?
Ooh, that's a tie between a "little-league homerun" and an "inside the park homerun".
Why is that?
Well, these are all highly-paid super athletes. Yet these two situations rely on gross incompetence.
How so?
Well, the little-league home run is based entirely on errors. It's usually a bases-loaded situation and the team just over throws or misses their targets, letting everyone continue to run.
So, it's not a home run, then.
What?
It's a series of errors, not a home run.
You know what I mean. But the best part is a little-league grand slam.
I saw that the other day! It's hilarious.
So what's more exciting, the inside-the-parker or the little-leaguer?
I like the inside-the-park, because it's less on human error, minus a judgement call, and more about a massive sprint.
It's especially funny when the batter is fat.
Yeah, an easy inside-the-park homerun would be barely a triple for Frank Thomas. If not, an out.
So, hypothetical situation:
Ok, go.
Let's say two outfielders are both going to the ball, but collide and are both knocked out. Is it an error or a hit?
No idea, but I'd pay good money to watch that. That seems hilarious.
Yeah, even more so if the third outfielder runs up to get the ball, and trips over them. Just a series of injuries.
