HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE BAND THIRTY SECONDS TO MARS?
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR, MAYBE SO.
THEY WERE PRETTY POPULAR ON THE RADIO QUITE A FEW YEARS BACK, THEY HAVE HAD A FEW BIG HIT SONGS.
WHAT WERE SOME OF THEM?
I THINK THEIR MOST POPULAR SONG WAS THE KILL.
THAT SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR.
IT WAS ALL OVER THE RADIO, AND IT HAS A REALLY COOL VIDEO.
WHAT MAKES IT COOL?
IT WAS FILMED IN THE HOTEL WHERE THE SHINING WAS FILMED.
WOW, IS IT A HORROR VIDEO?
SORT OF, IT'S NOT SUPER SCARY OR ANYTHING, JUST REALLY INTERESTING.
OK, I'LL LOOK IT UP.
THE LEAD SINGER IS JARED LETO.
ISN'T HE AN ACTOR?
YES, HE STARTED OUT IN MY SO CALLED LIFE BACK IN THE NINETIES AND HAS GONE ON TO DO SOME PRETTY BIG MOVIES.
WHAT MOVIES?
HE RECENTLY PLAYED THE JOKER IN A BATMAN MOVIE.
WOW, THAT WAS A REALLY POPULAR MOVIE.
HEY, WATCH THEIR VIDEO FOR THE SONG FROM YESTERDAY, IT RUNS LIKE A SHORT MOVIE.
WOW, THEY SOUND ARTISTIC.
