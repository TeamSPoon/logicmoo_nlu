What do you think of the Harry Potter movies?
I loved the books and the movies are pretty good also.
Do you like the acting?
Snape is great and so is Daniel as Harry.
I agree. Snape couldn't be better.
He really has the character down.
I think the casting people did a great job.
They picked great actors.
What do you think of Emma Watson?
I love her. She's in other great movies as well.
