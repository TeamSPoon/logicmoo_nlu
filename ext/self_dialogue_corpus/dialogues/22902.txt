Have you seen the John Wick movies?
I saw the first one.
Oh okay I've seen both. Saw the second in the theater.
Was it good?
It was really good!
I know I liked the first one. His character was ruthless.
Wasn't it crazy how he had pretty much put his hitman lifestyle behind him just to go back to it?
Yes. People knew not to mess with him.
They should have never messed with his dog.
Nope. They did that to themselves.
I liked his style though.
I did too. He didn't care.
He was a man on a mission.
Yep, he even had to go and unearth all of his weapons.
That part was interesting.
No matter what they tried to do they couldn't kill him.
I know. I don't think I would have kept trying.
He wasn't about to back down.
I know. That's what I really liked about the movies.
His dog was pretty cute too.
