Did you hear the latest Katy Perry single?
Is that 'Swish Swish'? Yeah, it's terrible.
Not even Nicki Minaj featuring can save it.
What's up with Katy Perry?
I don't know, but I feel like her marketing team is making some big mistakes.
Agreed, she seems to have changed direction out of nowhere.
She had the candy bubblegum pop princess thing cornered, and then she switched.
Exactly! There was no-one doing that shtick and now she's kind of hip-hoppy.
The first single from the new album kind of flopped, too.
Was that 'Chained to the Rhythm'? I saw the video but I only heard the song a few times.
Yeah, it was kind of universally panned. Do you her politics damaged her?
I'm not sure, maybe. Perhaps a combination of politics and image change?
Yes, that seems right. She went from super political during the election to this kind of weird pop hip hop thing.
And she did a song with Migos, right?
Yes, that's what I mean. She's trying to get hip hop credibility and it isn't working.
It looks kind of desperate, I guess. It's such a sudden change in branding for her.
She isn't a bad singer but she isn't an amazing one, so her brand has always been more important than for others.
Exactly - when I think of her Super Bowl performance, it was sunny and bright and what I think of when I think Katy Perry.
Whereas these new songs featuring rappers just don't sound like her.
Yes, people can tell when something is very forced and fake, and that's how this new album feels.
