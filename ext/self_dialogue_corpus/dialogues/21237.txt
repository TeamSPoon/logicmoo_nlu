Hey, what do you think of all of the Star Wars movies?
Well, I prefer the originals when George Lucas directed them.
Oh, he didn't have anything to do with all of the newer ones?
No, he just created & directed parts 4, 5, & 6.
Wow, I thought that he at least had something to do with episodes 1 thru 3 as well.
Nope, and the originals will always be the best.
The originals from the 1970's were really awesome!
Yeah, they were using what was cutting edge special effects & make up.
I heard that to make it look like the sand cruiser was flying, they just smudged up the film strip with some Vaseline.  Is that true?
Yes, that is the truth! There were quite a lot of different effects that Lucas had to dream up.
I'll never understand why Lucas sold the rights.
He made a fortune plus made a mint by putting a clause in the sale that he gets to keep money from all future merchandise.
Yeah, that was a genius move on his end!
No one would have ever guessed that merchandise sales would be that big especially back in the 70's.
Have you seen any of the new Star Wars episodes?
No, after the debauchery that the studios passed off as parts 1 thru 3 tanked so bad, I'm just afraid the other movies will be just as disappointing.
Well, i kind of liked the first 3.
You're kidding! What on earth would make you say that?
I guess I just like the story lines. It was the beginning even if it was written horribly.
Well, I suppose everyone has something they like!
