Have you seen the movie Gifted yet?
Yeah, I did! What did you think?
I thought it was really great.  I thought it had a lot of heart and that made up for how straightforward it was.
I completely agree.  That little girl was amazing.
Yes she was! What was her name again?
The actress is McKenna Grace.
Was she in other movies? I don't remember seeing her before.
I think she was also in the new Independence Day movie.
Oh I didn't see that so that would explain it. What did you think of the movie?
I thought it was a good mix of comedy and drama, and it didn't make me cry too much.
Oh, I cried like a baby, but I always do.
Did you think it addressed the moral dilemmas enough?
I thought it was okay, but I could have had a little more.
Yeah, I wanted there to be a little more sincerity in the troubles the characters faced.
I can see that. I can't complain though because Chris Evans was in it.
I know! He's always great.
Especially in Captain America!
Yes, I love those movies.  He's so good at playing different roles.
Yes he is. I think I might watch Captain America now!
I might too!
