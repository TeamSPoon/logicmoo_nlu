Did you ever like Michael Jackson?
Yeah, I was a big fan back in the day.
Did you have the Thriller album?
My brother did so I listened to a lot of the songs when I was younger
What was your favorite Jackson song?
I really liked Beat It
Oh yeah, that was a good one.
Yeah, had a good music video as well.
I don't know if I saw that one.
Yeah, Thriller was a fun video as well.
Of course. One of the classics of all time.
Honestly I didn't really care much for Jackson's later work.
Yeah, it kind of went a different direction
And then there were all of the personal problems.
Yeah, but in the end he was still the King of Pop
Yeah, do you remember when he performed at the Super Bowl
Oh yeah, what year was that?
I believe it was 1993
Yes, chartered in a whole new type of half time show
Yes indeed
