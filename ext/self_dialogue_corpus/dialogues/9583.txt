Have you heard any of Schoolboy Q's new music?
Yeah. His newest album is pretty good.
What was that one called, again?
"Blank Face" was the name of it.
Oh yeah. That's my favorite by him so far.
It had some of those old-school type of beats on it.
Yeah, I'm really into stuff like that.
It was cool how he did the extended video releases on Youtube with the album.
Those were fun to watch. I loved the one that featured the song "Tookie Knows pt. II"
That has to be one of the best songs on the whole album.
