Have you heard any of Ed Sheeran's work before?
Yes, I am a big fan of his.
I just checked one of his songs online, and noticed that youtube had over 1.4 billion hits on one video.
Which video was that?
The song is Shape of You and it literally has well over that hits , amazing.
That sounds like its on the top 100 billboard then.
It's about a young man finding love in a bar.
I wish him luck! That doesn't happen often!
No, seriously, that song is so famous now. What album of his do you like the most?
I love his album X which was released in June 2014.
What label did he release that under?
Atlantic Records released that album for him.
I think that one was nominated for Grammy of the Year for that album.
That does not surprise me one bit.
What songs do you like from that album?
I like Take It Back, Nina , and Think Out Loud the best on X.
I enjoyed Photograph and Sing on that album.
When you bought that album, did you buy it online, or get it at the store?
I bought it online and downloaded it.
I have a few that I buy physically.
