Which league is better, the NFL or the NBA?
It is the NFL without a doubt in my opinion.
I agree with you about that. Television ratings feel the same way!
Yea the NFL always draws great TV numbers.
Have you been able to check out any Chicago Bears games lately?
I watch them on TV every Sunday, but I have not been able to attend a game live in a few years.
Me and my dad went to a few games last year for the first time in a while.
Did you guys have a pretty good time?
We had about as much fun as possible watching the Bears play!
I sure know what you mean about that!
I just wish we could get back to the playoffs at the very least.
Do you think John Fox will do a good job?
I do not know, I am just hoping at this point.
Well, he did take the Carolina Panthers to the Superbowl before.
I know; I am going to be patient and hope for the best.
At least we finally got rid of Jay Cutler!
I know but I am not sure if that will help us in the long run or not.
What do you think about our draft pick?
I could not believe that Mitch Trubisky was the pick!
Who knows, maybe he will be the franchise quarterback we have been missing.
