what artist has put out the most awkward song or video?
Do you know jewel?
I love jewel.
Well did you like her intuition song and video?
I enjoy the song.
I thought it was so far from who she really is.
I do think she changed her image a lot for the video.
A ton, and it was so awkward.
It didn't suit her style, true.
It was awful, hard to watch her  that way for me. It was almost degrading.
Female artist do way more degrading things in video than that.
I agree, example nikki minaj I love it. But for jewel she was classier than that.
Jewel core is more a soul sister , folky feel.
Ya not about a sexual image. I just hated that video and song for her.
Don't recall the show or what but I saw a clip of her at bar in disguise.
It was at a kareoke bar right?
Yes, And everyone freaks out.
It was so funny.
I would have loved to have been there.
Me to. Imagine if you got to duet with jewel!
