What is the best Superman movie of all time.
There are so many good ones it is hard to choose.
There are not not that many, only three different actors.
Well, all of the Superman movies have been at the very least , decent.
Who did you think played Superman the best?
That would have to be Christopher Reeves.
Circa the seventies?
Yes, he looked like how I imagine Superman and Clark Kent would.
I think he had that sort of farm boy charm, but also the other world look too.
I like the chemistry between him and Louis Lane in his films.
His Superman movies really set a good base line for Superhero films.
I think so too, we would have not had it not been for him.
Do you think the new Superman is any good?
You mean Henry Cavil?
Yes, him and his movies.
I think he is ok. He just does not feel as sort of home grown hero as Reeves.
Superman is from another planet.
Yes, but he is shown to be more human than alien.
I hope they make more Superman movies.
I know he will be in the Justice League film.
