I don't understand the music the younger generation is listening to.
What do you mean?
Well, it's all rap and it's terrible. The lyrics are almost always about drugs or sex.
I guess so, but isn't that what every older generation says.
Maybe, but to have kids rapping along to a song about "Molly" and "percoset'.....
Yeah, that's a problem, and people wonder why we have a drug problem now.
Plus, they all rap like they have a mouthful of cotton.
Lol maybe they do...they are rapping about drugs after all.
On a different note, I do like some of the newer artists with the different sounding voices like Daya.
Oh yeah, me too, that Chainsmokers song is awesome.
Have you heard Noah Cyrus' song?
I have, I don't think I'm really that impressed, maybe it's just knowing she's related to Miley.
I do miss some of the good classic rock stuff though. Nothing compares to Zeppelin and Floyd.
Talk about singing about drugs and sex lol
I guess you are right. But at least they could sing!
True.
Speaking of singing, why the heck is Beyonce still around. She literally shrieks like a cat in heat.
Lol, I totally agree, but I think most people like her because of her looks more than her voice.
I guess, she is a dang good dancer, but I am not a fan of her music at all.
I like a couple of her songs.
