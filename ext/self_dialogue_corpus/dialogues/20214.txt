What is the best fantasy film ever made?
That would have to go to with Avatar.
I thought that was more of a Science Fiction movie.
Common misconception.
But, it is set in space.
Yes, but with magic and so on.
So, it is sort of like a hybrid movie.
Hybrid movies, like the whole Underworld franchise.
Jeez, that is a dumb fantasy.
You did not like it?
I thought it was too dark for its own good.
I liked the way they portrayed vampires in that movie.
I thought the wolves were good, but the vampires were a bit silly.
I thought the main actress was actually really good in it.
Kate Beckinsile?
Yes. You know he husband was in Twilight.
There is another one I think is nuts.
I thought it was sweet.
It was creepy, the old teen liking the young girl.
Hey, he loved her !
