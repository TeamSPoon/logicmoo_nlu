Are you a fan of Kevin Smith?
Yeah I like some films more than others but overall he's makes enjoyable flicks.
What do you like about him?
He has this unique ability to make films that are sure to become cult hits. They have this raw "independent" vibe, even though many of them have large budgets.
What are you favorites?
My favorite is probably Dogma. I think it is his most complete film.
I really enjoyed Red State.
I see. You know, I enjoyed his older work more.
Are you not a fan of horror and thrillers?
I like thrillers, but I think Smith's strength lies in dialogue and comedic situations.
Well those occur in Tusk and Red State as well.
I suppose you're right, but I think the thriller aspect draws attention from them.
Fair enough. I also enjoy Smith's older films. Clerks is a classic.
Yes! I also think Chasing Amy is very underrated.
Chasing Amy is unique because it's kind of like a romantic comedy designed for a mostly male audience. A very bold idea.
Exactly. It's funny how he's able to make thought provoking films like Dogma and Chasing Amy, but also mindless laugh fests like Mall Rats and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
I can quote almost every line from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back!
Don't get me wrong, I love those films too. I even love Clerks 2!
I think we're just fan-boys at this point.
Probably so.
