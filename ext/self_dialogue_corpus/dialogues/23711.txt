I am starting a diet.
That's nice.  What's the diet?
I saw it in the movie Forks over Knives.
Is that a documentary?
Yes. It was great.
What can you eat?
Plant foods.  Whole Foods only.
What's that mean?
Non processed foods. Mainly vegan.
Are you trying to lose weight?
Yes and it prevents disease like cancer.
Does it really?
Yes.  People in Asia have been doing it forever.
I guess that makes sense.
The movie follows people around doing th diet.
What does it show?
They get so much healthier
I'll have to try it.
We can do it together.
That sounds good.
