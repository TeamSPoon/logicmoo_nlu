If you could be in any Star Wars vehicle, what would you choose?
Like land or air? Either one is fine?
Yeah, whatever you want!
I would want to be in a pod racer!
Why do you say that?
They go so fast and can even fly sideways!
Would be as fast as Anakin?
Even faster! I'd be the champion!
Who would build it for you?
I'd get the Anakin's rival to make it, he had a cool one!
