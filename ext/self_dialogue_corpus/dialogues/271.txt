Are you excited for the new Spider Man movie?
I sure am. Going to the theater?
Absolutely! We should go together.
Agreed. What is most appealing about it?
Probably the new Spider Man.
Yeah, Garfield didn't do much for me.
Yeah, he should go back to eating lasangna!
Ha! I think that was the cat.
Spider-Cat?
Now that would be something!
