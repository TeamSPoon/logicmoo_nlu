Do you listen to Katy Perry?
Not really, but she is a great singer.
Why don't you listen to her?
It's not that I don't.  If she's on the radio, I'll listen.
Oh, you just don't have her CDs?
No, but she has a ton of songs I like.
Oh, which ones are your favorites?
I like Roar and I really like the one from the Disney movie.
Oh, the one from Malificent?  That one was awesome!
Yeah, now I want to hear it!
