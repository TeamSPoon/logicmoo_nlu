Did you ever watch the spiderman movies?
No I didn't care to fill me in?
You sure there will be spoilers?
Yeah I don't mind.
Well Spiderman is Peter Parker for one and he gets bitten by a spider in a laboratory that had been kept in there to run tests on.
Alright sounds cool so far.
Well then he realizes he can climb walls shoot webs out of his palms and the webbing is very strong.
That does sound epic.
Well he starts helping people and swings around on webs he shoots up high and becomes the superhero we all love.
Alright booting up Netflix right now to watch it.
