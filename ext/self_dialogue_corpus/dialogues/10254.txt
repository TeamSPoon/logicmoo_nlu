Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?
I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?
yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?
No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed
