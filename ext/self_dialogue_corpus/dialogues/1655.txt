Let's go see that game next weekend.
You mean the Patirots game?
Well, of course.
Okay. Where are watching?
I can get us tickets to go.
Oh, that would be awesome.
Yeah, my friend has a connection.
Okay. I am in.
I will let you know that ticket price later today.
Awesome. I will drive us.
Perfect.
Is it just us two?
No, my friend with the hook up and another buddy is coming.
That works for me. I have the SUV, so we will have plenty of room.
That works well. Do you want to tailgate before?
Yes, NFL football tailgating is the best.
I agree. I will get the others to chip in and help out with food and stuff.;
That works. I have a grill we can take.
Yes, that is the coolest plan ever.
I am so ready.
