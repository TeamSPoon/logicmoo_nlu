What is your favorite comedy?
Grandma's Boy, definitely. Have you seen it?
Yes, I have. I love it! I love the old people.
Yea, the old people getting stoned are hilarious. I really like the part where the Monkey drives.
Oh yea, and the lion? That was great. Have you seen any other of their movies?
No, I haven't, but it does remind me of Super Troopers.
Oh yea, Super Troopers is awesome! Did you hear they're making another one?
Yea, I thought that was in the works for a while. I'm beginning to think that's not going to happen.
It's supposed to come out this next year.
Oh yea, I heard they had to do a Kickstarter for it. I guess we will find out.
