Have you ever seen Scary Movie from 2000?
Oh yeah, that is the one with Carmen Electra right?
Yeah, that's the one. She played the character Drew.
She was a student at B.A. and her friend was killed by Ghostface.
Two of the Wayans brothers also played in that movie, Marlon and Shawn.
They are hysterical. If a movie has a Wayans brother in it you know it's going to be good.
It was directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans. So yet another Wayans brother in the mix.
Oh, that's right I forgot that he directed it.
Have you seen any of the other Scary Movies besides the first one?
Yes, I've seen them all, one through five.
