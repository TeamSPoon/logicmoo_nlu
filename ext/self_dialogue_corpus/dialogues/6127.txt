Remember the Disney movie Alladin?
Of course I remember Alladin!  That was one of my favorites as a kid.
Mine too.  I always said I'd name my first daughter Jasmine, and then I did!
It's just a hilarious movie, especially with the genie.
Wasn't it played by Robin Williams?
Yes, he's hilarious.
They actually made a few sequels but none of them were as good as the original.
Oh really?  Like what?
Well, I know Return of Jafar was one of them.  I watched it but it wasn't too great.
I never heard of that one.
