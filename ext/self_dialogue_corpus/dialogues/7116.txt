What is your favorite Disney movie from your childhood?
I would have to say The Fox and The Hound.
Oh, I loved that movie too! Todd the fox was so cute!
He was. It was actually a really emotional movie for me, and still is!
I know, I love watching Disney movies from my childhood now that I'm an adult. I catch all sorts of things I missed when I was a kid.
I know! It's like watching the movie for the first time again.
The part where Todd and Copper rescue the old dog gets me every time.
That movie does teach kids a lot about compassion.
It does. I feel like a lot of Disney movies have great teaching tools like that.
They really do. I'm glad we grew up with them!
