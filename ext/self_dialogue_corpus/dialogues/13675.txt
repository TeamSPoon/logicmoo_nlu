Have you seen any of the "new" Star Wars movies?
I have, but I don't think that they are half as good as the original trilogy.
I mean, I can see where you are coming from, but I think they are pretty good.
Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character there has ever been.
Well, true. I really like Darth Maul as a villian though.
Oh definitely, I just wish they had done more with his storyline. It was so short.
Yeah, I know. I think the last two movies that have been put out have been better than there first attempts at reviving it.
I will say that they have improved. I like how Luke Skywalker is back into the plotline here recently.
I think that it helps bring the movies together more. I really liked Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon being back.
The Millenium Falcon is still the coolest ship in the Star Wars Universe, in my opinion.
