I am so excited for the Cowboys this season!
Me too! They are going to be so good.
Dak Prescott had such a good rookie season last year he may only be able to go backwards.
I doubt it. He looked so confident on the field I don't see him moving backwards this season.
I really hope you are right. The Cowboys offense is so good they just need a half decent quarterback to score.
No doubt. All Dak Prescott has to do is not be bad and they should be able to win.
How do you think Ezekiel Elliot will do this year?
Well he had over 1000 rushing yards last year so it may be hard to beat but he ended the season strong.
He was amazing. He should have gotten the MVP last year.
I have to disagree about the MVP but he was insane for a rookie running back.
Ok but this year if he puts up similar numbers there is no way he does not get it.
I have to agree there. If he puts up the same or better numbers this upcoming season he deserves to be MVP.
I think the offense can carry the Cowboys to the Superbowl this year.
I don't know about the Superbowl. I would just be happy if they made it to the conference championship.
For sure. Last season's loss to Green Bay was gut wrenching.
It was but that game was probably the best playoff game out of them all.
That game was so great. The Cowboys looked like they were out at the begining but fought back to almost take it.
They came really close. I was on the edge of my seat to the last minute of that game.
Aaron Rodgers played lights out. I don't think any team could have beat him that game.
You are probably right. Without his extreme performance Green Bay does not win that game.
