Did you see that the Spurs lost to the Rockets?
I did, but I still think that the Spurs will win the series.
I saw that the Utah Jazz were eliminated last night?
They were, but they showed a lot of heart.
I think that the Lakers will be bad next year.
Probably, but maybe they will get a good draft pick.
Russell Westrbrook should win the most valuable player award this year.
I disagree, I think that James Harden should win.
Who do you think will win the sixth man of the year award?
I think that James Johnson will win.
Do you think that Lonzo Ball will be a good professional basketball player?
I think he will be average at best.
Do you think that Chris Bosh will ever play professional basketball again?
I think that he will retire.
I think that Kawhi Leonard should win defensive player of the year.
I think that Draymond Green is more deserving.
I hope that The Cleveland Cavaliers do not win the championship this year.
Me too,  I hope that the Spurs do.
I was sad to see that Tony Parker is injured for the rest of the playoffs.
Me too, he was playing really well in these playoffs.
