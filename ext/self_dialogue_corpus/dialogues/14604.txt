Did you see that Warriors game last night?
Yeah Draymond was absolutely ridiculous.
Well yeah but how about that fourth quarter by Durant?
That was so good.  I'm really glad he is over that leg injury.
Yeah. Hopefully he stays healthy all the way through the finals.
So you think they are a shoe in for the finals.
I mean yeah, who is going to stop them?
I thought maybe the Rockets.
Yeah I could see that but it doesn't even look like they are going to get past the Spurs at this point.
Yeah who would have thought that. I do not understand how the Spurs keep being good.
Yeah especially with that bum Aldrige being one of their "stars"
I don't think he is that bad.  I think he is just catching a lot of hate from everyone.
Yeah maybe.  Some games it feels like he just does not show up at all though.
I could see that.  He definitely is all over the place in terms of his performance.
Either way the West has been so much more fun to watch than the East.
Definitely.  I'm sick of Lebron just running through the East.
Yeah, I wish someone would challenge him.
No kidding.  I don't see the Wizards or Celtics having a real chance.
No way the Cavs will crush either of those teams.
So I guess we are headed for Warriors vs Cavs again.
