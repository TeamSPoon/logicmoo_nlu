Do you like music from musicals?
You mean Broadway musicals?
Yes, or just classic musicals like Sound of Music, or even the new La La Land.
Sound of Music, not so much, but musicals in general, yes!
Do you have a favorite musical album?
No way. That would be so difficult.
Okay, any you really like then?
I love the music from Wicked, but then you have the classics like the music from Phantom of the Opera that is amazing.
What about the music from Disney movies?
I think that's great too. And I love that Disney is making more musicals again.
I think they saw how big of a hit Let it Go turned out to be and realized that market was ready to grow.
Definitely. Now you have the song How Far I'll Go from Moana.
I wonder what will come next.
I don't know but I think having music in movies, if it is done rights, can really enhance it.
For sure. Have you heard the music from Hamilton?
Only once. I wasn't a big fan.
I think you are the only one in the country!
Probably. But I'm not a huge fan of rap so adding rap to a musical really does nothing for me.
I think people like it because it is unique.
That's probably true.
