Good morning.
Morning.
How are you.
Good and you?
Not bad.
Good.
What kind of music do you listen to.
I like a lot of jazz and some classical.
Oh interesting.
Yeah not a lot of people are still into it but I am.
I think its nice to listen to sometimes.
It really does set the mood.
I do like the atmosphere that it creates.
I see what you mean.
It also makes me feel introspective and peaceful.
Anything without lyrics like that lets me drift away.
Yeah exactly.
Right.
Well good talking to you.
And you.
