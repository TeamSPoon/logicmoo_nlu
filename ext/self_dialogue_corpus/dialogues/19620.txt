Have you ever listened to the Eagles?
My dad used to listen to them.
You never did though?
I don't think so.
Their music is awesome.
It's classic rock, right?
Yeah, they have a kind of countryish sound to them too.
Kind of like southern rock?
Not quite.  I'm surprised you've never heard them before.
What songs did they have?
Hotel California was one of the most famous ones.
Oh, that was them?
Yeah, see, I knew you had heard them.
What are some of their other songs?
Tequila Sunrise, Desperado, Take It Easy, Life in the Fast Lane.  Those were all the Eagles.
Oh wow.  I definatey have heard a couple of those.
Do you want to borrow my CDs?
I'm pretty sure I will.
You'll love them!
Oh, I know I will!
