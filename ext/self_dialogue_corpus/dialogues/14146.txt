Hey cousin did you have a great time at the skating ring tonight? as they kept playing repeats of Lady Gaga's hit song Poker Face. over and over and over.
yes I enjoyed myself they did play her hit too many times but I like Lady Gaga's music you do to right.
Yeah but she dresses awfully weird did you see those outfits she was wearing in the video they were showing?
That's just how Lady Gaga dresses she would not be herself if she didn't. She never looked too bad she never does.
Yes she don't her style is like American fashion and punk rock mixed she likes being different.
Cool I liked the white long bob style wig she wore in Poker Face. Have you ever seen Bad Romance you are to see how weird she dresses in that video.
How much big of a fan would you say you are of Lady Gaga? If i were to win ticket's or purchase some to go see her concert would you be willing to go with me?
Of course i would. I would be very overwhelming that you got us the tickets.
What would you like to see that you haven't seen her perform? I might surprise you in a few weeks.
I would like to see lady Gaga's on Tour and anything else i'm quite sure I would enjoy it Thanks I will be looking forward to those tickets if you get them.
