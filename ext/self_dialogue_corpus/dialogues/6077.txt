Have you watched Toy Story?
Of course, who hasn't!?
Doesn't it make you wish your childhood toys could have come to life?
Yes, definitely!
Did you have any of the same toys as in the movie?
I had a Mr. Potato Head and a slinky, but just a plain slinky, no dog head or tail. How about you?
I had both of those too. I even had a cowboy doll, but it looked a little different than Woody.
Do you think it would have freaked you out to see your toys come to life?
Maybe at first, but then it would have been pretty awesome!
Who knows, maybe all our toys really did come to life but we never knew about it just like Andy didn't!
