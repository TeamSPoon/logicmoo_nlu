Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cardinals.
The Arizona Cardinals?
Yes
I think they are decent
They are. I don't see them winning any title though.
I agree. Glad you admitted it.
I am a realist.
Who do you think will win it?
The Patriots
Again?
Yes
I doubt they will repeat.
The Penguins did in hockey.
It is harder in the NFL
I see what you mean
Do you like Brady?

He is. Will he win the MVP?
Maybe
