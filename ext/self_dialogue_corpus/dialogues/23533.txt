Dont you just love to find a sleeper movie
what is a sleeper movie?
It is a movie that does not get a lot of recognition, but is wonderful
Oh, yes I do like finding those types of movies
I like how you do not expect to like it or even know what it is about and it is just great
Yes, One movie I saw like that is Corrina Corrina
who is in that one?
Whoppi Goldbure and Ray Laoita
what is it about?
It's set in the 50's and Whoppi becomes a housekeeper for a man and his daughter
sounds interesting
yes and the mans wife had recently dies and the girl refused to speak
is it a drama
no not really more of a comedy
I would like to see that one
It has a wonderful message about loss and family and love
It is hard to find now, you would probably have to buy it on dvd on Ebay or something
I will look for that tonight
It is a classic sleeper
thanks for the suggestion
