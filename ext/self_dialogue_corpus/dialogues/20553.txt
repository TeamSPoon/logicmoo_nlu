What do you think will be the general plot of Star Wars Episode 8?
Ooh, good question. There's so many places this can go.
Luke Skywalker better start manning up. He's been a child who runs when he gets emotional.
Yeah, he pretty much caused the death of billions through his lack of intervention, but throwing it off as everything being part of the force overall.
Seriously, and now he wants to end the Jedi?
I'm not sure that's what it means. Jedi is singular and plural.
Right, perhaps HE wants to die.
Ooooooh, I like that. Maybe he feels he has turned bad and the way to balance the force is for him to die.
Who do you think Snoke is?
I've read lots of theories: he's Plagiues, he's Windu.
I have a great theory about who he is.
Really, what's that?
Supreme Chancellor Snoke is ...
Yes?
A guy named Snoke. He's not anyone from the past Star Wars universe. He's just a guy.
While that would be refreshing, the whole saga is about Palpatine manipulating the Skywalker family.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with it.
Who do you think Rey's parents are?
Probably Luke and Leia's baby they had together. They kissed... so why not?
Don't be gross.
