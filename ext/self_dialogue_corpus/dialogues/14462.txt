Man I hope that the Houston Rockets play better in the playoffs next year
Yeah this was a bittersweet year for the Rockets
I agree. I mean a lot of people didn't think they would have a good year
Yeah most pundits predicted they would finish toward the bottom of the standings.
Yeah they really surprised a lot of people with their play this year
I mean most people didn't foresee them winning 55 games in the regular season.
True and a lot of people didn't like the D'antoni hire as head coach
Yep. But he proved them wrong. They have a great system.
Yep it is a fun brand of basketball to watch
But in the playoffs they played a bit mediocre
They really did. I mean they got passed the Thunder, but not in typical Rockets fashion.
True. They struggled a bit from the outside, but they did find a way to win that series.
The most disappointing part of the playoffs was the Spurs series.
I agree. I truly believe they should have beaten the Spurs
James Harden did not play well down the stretch
No he didn't I don't know if the guy just ran out of gas
I don't know either, but he shrunk in the big moments.
You can't have your best player fail to step up during those times.
Yeah, but maybe they can build off of this experience and be stronger next year.
I hope so. It was a successful year for that organization.
