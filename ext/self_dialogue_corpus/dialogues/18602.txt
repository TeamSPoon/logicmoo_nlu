Do you like AC/DC?
I do, but I think they're a bit cliche by now.
I agree, they've definitely been used to death in movies.
Yeah, they're still using Back in Black in like all of the family movies coming out.
Definitely, that one or Highway to Hell.
I'm very tired of hearing those two songs.
Same here. They should play some of the other ones.
Like which ones?
Hell's Bells would be good, or Dirty Deeds.
I like Dirty Deeds a lot.
That one is one of my favorites, the singer gets very silly here and there.
Yeah, I liked how he seemed to have fun with it.
They definitely had a huge influence on the music community though.
That's for sure, they proved a lot of things.
Like what?
Well, they proved that you don't have to have a lot of technical skill as a musician to write good music.
I guess that's true, their guitarist tends to play simpler stuff or at least writes simpler stuff.
They do say that less is more.
True, though sometimes it is nice to have a very complicated guitar riff in rock music.
As long as it's musically tasteful I don't care what they write.
