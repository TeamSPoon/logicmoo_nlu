Speaking of pop music, do you think the format of it has changed over the years?
Most definately. Just look at pop music songs over previous decades.
Why do you think it has changed?
Well, less restrictions in wording in music for starters.
I don't understand.
Well, 25 years ago saying "Bitch" or "Damn" or "Dick" was an offence the FCC would come down on you hard for.
Really? That's crazy!
Yes, and even farther back you couldn't even give a hint of sexuality.
No Way! I find that hard to believe,
Yes, There was quite the controversy when Donna Summer had a pop music smash where she moaned in a sexual manor.
