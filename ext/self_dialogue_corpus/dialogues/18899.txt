I was listening to a radio show the other day and they played an old song that I really liked.
What was the name of the song?
I knew it sounded like Frank Sinatra so I looked it up and sure enough I found it.
If it was a Frank Sinatra song that must be an oldie but goodie.
Yes, it was called, "Time after Time".  Not to be confused with Cindy Lauper's song with the same title.
I remember the Cindy Lauper song.  But, I'm not familiar with this one by Frank Sinatra.
It is such a sweet love song.  Talking about how he is so lucky to be loving you.
Aww..I like a good love song.  I bet it was nothing like today's love song.
Yes, for sure it sounded so pure.  There were no mentions of anything crude.
When was the song recorded?
I believe it was from 1946 and actually was from a movie called, "It happened in Brooklyn".
I haven't heard of that film, it was before my time.
I haven't heard of the film either, but I think I may have to look it up as it is probably a good wholesome love story.
If you do find it you will have to tell me about it.  I may even want to watch it.
I really never got into Frank Sinatra type songs, but this one has made me have a change of heart.
Have you found any others that you like?
I did find another one that I liked it was called, "Once Upon a Time".
What was that about?
Another love song.  Talking about sitting under the willow tree..you know something you would do way back when.
Well, you have certainly educated me about Frank Sinatra that's for sure.  Thanks!
