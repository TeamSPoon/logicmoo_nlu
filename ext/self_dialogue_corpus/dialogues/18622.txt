Did you ever get into The Smashing Pumpkins?
They were pretty cool.
One of my favorites.
Are they still together?
I'm not sure.
Hmm. I should look it up.
Which song was your favorite?
1979.
Mine too!
They were a pretty interesting group.
Why do you say that.
They stopped a concert once because people were moshing.
Why would they do that?
Apparently, some people died doing that at some other concerts.
That's terrible!
You hadn't heard about that?
No.
I was a pretty big deal.
Well, yeah!
I thought that was pretty cool of them.
