Have you seen any star wars movies recently?
I saw number three.
Oh cool, were you into that one?
Yeah it was interesting.
What was your favorite part?
I loved the part where anakin became darth vader.
That was so cool. I keep replaying that clip.
It was awesome hearing the voice for the first time again.
Oh yeah totally.
I had a blast talking to you.
