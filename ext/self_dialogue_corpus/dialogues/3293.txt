What is the scariest horror movie you have ever seen?
I don't really like horror movies.
Really? I love them.
Ya they are just not my thing. The scariest one I have probably seen is Scream, if you count that as a horror.
I guess you could count it, although it is not the scariest.
Ya. They were ok movies. I just don't like a lot of violence.
Ya I get that. Which one is your favorite?
I have to say number 3. I really like Courtney Cox
Oh ya she is one of my favorites. If you aren't to afraid you should check out I Know What You Did Last Summer, its not to scary.
Ok. I will definitely think about it.
