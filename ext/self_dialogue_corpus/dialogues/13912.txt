what is your favorite lady gaga song?
i would have to say the applause
that is a kind of an obscure one as lady gaga songs go
i can't get it out of my head once i've heard it, its so catchy!
my favorite is poker face
everyone knows that one!
the video for poker face is so crazy
definitely. her costumes are always way over the top
do you think gaga's music is danceable?
It definitely makes me want to dance!
