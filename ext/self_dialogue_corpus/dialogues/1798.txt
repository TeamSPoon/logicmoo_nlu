Hi, do you play fantasy football by any chance?
Yes, I've been playing for many years and I have two teams.
So do I!  Football season is like 20 weeks of Christmas for me.
Same here. I live for the NFL and the NY Giants.
I will always be a Niners fan and the Jets are my favorite N.Y. team.  I will usually root for the Giants in their division.
I'm starting to put together my top fantasy picks. Which running backs do you like?
I'm trying to get Ezekial Elliott this year. That dude is going to go off.
He great but I don't like drafting anyone from the Cowboys.
I totally understand that feeling.  I'm no fan of the Dolphins.
Well at least you don't have to worry about the conflict of drafting a Dolphin this year.
Ha ha, that's true.  It's been years since I've paid any attention to their roster.
Speaking of Florida, there is some good talent on the Bucs this year.
I had Jameis Winston as a back up last year.  When he was hot he could rack up some points.
I agree, and with another year in the NFL under his belt he should do even better this year.
I like Cam Newton but he doesn't have enough quality receivers.  the Panthers need some studs.
Yeah, that's been a problem with him since his rookie year. We still haven't been able to see what he is really capable of.
Who do you like in the QB position?
I still believe in Aaron Rodgers. He's one of those guys who still puts up points even when he doesn't put up a win.
I like watching Drew Brees but I'm afraid to draft him anymore.
Truth. He is no spring chicken anymore, a big hit could take him out for the season.
