I wonder if the Patriots will be able to hold their title this coming season.
I doubt it, they've got big egos now.
I really wish the Packers could make it to the SuperBowl again.
Yeah it's been a while, but I think they still hold a record number of titles.
That's cool.  What commentators do you listen do for game-day coverage?
I don't, I usually watch the games on mute while I get some homework done.
So did you actually watch when the Patriots beat the Falcons?
Yeah, went to a local sports bar to watch the game.
You like Tom Brady?
Yeah, he's a great player, but he doesn't seem too bright.
I don't think being smart is a requirement for playing in the NHL.
True, some of the other Hall of Famers aren't working with a full deck.
I don't think Tom Brady is in the Hall of Fame.
No, not yet.  But I bet he will be.
True, he'll probably be the most notable Patriot in the NHL Hall of Fame.
There was Troy Brown back in 2007.
I'll tell you though, I'm really not a fan of the Patriot's uniform colors.
How come?
I just expect more stars and stripes for a team that calls themselves Patriots.
Haha, I think that would be distracting on the field.
