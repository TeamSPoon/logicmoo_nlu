The Empire Strikes Back will always be the most overrated Star Wars film.
That's blasphemy.  It's still the best.
Everybody says that, but I just don't see it.
It has it all.  Best action, best ending...
Not saying it doesn't have redeeming qualities, I'm saying it's overrated.
Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  To me, the original is overrated.
Now you're being silly.  That's the movie that kicked everything off!
It's also a bit weak outside of the special effects story-wise.
We obviously have different tastes in our Star Wars picks.
Would seem so.  We should have a mock lightsaber battle to settle this.
