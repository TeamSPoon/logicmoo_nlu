Which Beatles album do you like best?
I'm very fond of Rubber Soul.
Is there a reason that one is your favorite?
Well, it has Drive My Car and Norwegian Wood, which are two of my favorite Beatles songs.
That makes sense. I've always liked Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band the best.
That one's also a good album.
It has so many of their most iconic songs-- Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, When I'm Sixty-Four.
Don't forget the best one!
Which one is that?
