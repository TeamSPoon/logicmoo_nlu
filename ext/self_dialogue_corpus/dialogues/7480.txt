Did you see the movie Moana?
No, not yet.  What's it about?
It's about a girl who keeps finding herself drawn to the ocean.  She goes on a quest to find a demigod named Maui.
Maui?  Like the Hawaiian island?
Yes, exactly.  He is a shapeshifter who stole the heart of Tafiti.
Who is Tafiti?
She's almost like the Hawaiian version of Mother Nature.
Why did he steal her heart?
He wanted to give it to the people, but it backfired.  Stealing her heart started to make nature die.
Sounds cool.  Maybe I'll watch it.
