Remember Katy Perry and her music?
Yes I do! I really like her song "Dark Horse."
That's a good song! I enjoy it also.
She's a little out there these days but I did really like her songs.
I think one of my favorites is "Roar."
That song gets me pumped!
Oh me too! I love to listen to it when I am exercising.
That's a great idea!
Yes it gets me motivated.
I agree, it would me too!
