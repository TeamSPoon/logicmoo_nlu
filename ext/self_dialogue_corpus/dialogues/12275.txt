I heard that Han Solo actually improved some of his lines.
I think you mean Harrison Ford.
Yeah, sure, same guy.
What lines are you talking about?
For instance, in the second film, he improvised the line 'I know'.
You mean after Leia said she loved him?
Yep, he thought it up on the spot.
That's very interesting.  I was not aware of that.
Well, I'm full of useful trivia.
Full of something to be sure!
