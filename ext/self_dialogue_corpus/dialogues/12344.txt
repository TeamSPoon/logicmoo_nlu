Do you like the older Star Wars movies or the newer movies?
I prefer the older movies.  I'm older and they were really big when I was younger.
Who's your favorite character?
I really like Chewy.  He doesn't say much but gets the job done.
He and Han are great together.
It's almost as if they can read each other's minds.
What is your favorite scene in the three older movies?
When Luke finds out that Vader is his father.
What is your least favorite character ?
I really don't like the Sand People.  I find them really creepy.
