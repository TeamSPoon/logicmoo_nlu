What did you think of that new Harry Potter Movie, Beasts from Within?
It actually surprised me, I thought it was pretty good.
Really, I didn't think you'd like it.
What's that supposed to mean.
Well you didn't like the Harry Potter movies.
Well this isn't a Harry Potter movie.
It's in the same Universe.
Yea it is but it's not about little kids doing magic in some far away land.
So the storyline happening in the real world changed it for you?
Yea it did, it was nice to see humans and wizards co existing.
Some historical context?
Exactly!  It was fun to see how the relationship developed.
Yea it gives you a better understanding of the reason they are so secrative.
So you agree with me then.
I guess I do, but there is one thing.
What's that?
I have no idea why they hide, I know they were hunted but their power would seem to out weigh armies of humans.
So you consider that a plot hole?
A pretty big one in my opinion.
That's fair, it was still a good movie though.
