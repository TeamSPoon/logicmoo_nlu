What is your favorite comedy?
Baby Mama! I love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler especially together!
Yes! I love them. They made another movie Sisters.
Oh yeah! I am waiting for that to come out on DVD to watch it.
You should it's super good.
I also read Tina Fey's autobiography Bossypants. It was really good.
Have you seen Date Night? You would probaly like that too.
No I haven't I'll have to take a look.
You should! It's older but still really funny.
I love anything Tina Fey!
