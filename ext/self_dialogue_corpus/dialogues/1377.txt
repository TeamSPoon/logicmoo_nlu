What was the worst play in NFL history?
The worst play?
Yeah, the worst play!
I know what was the best play, but I don't know about the worst.
Ok. What was the best play?
The Immaculate Reception.
Th immaculate what?
The Immaculate Reception, which is one of the most famous plays in the history of NFL football. It happened during the 1972 AFC divisional playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders
Did that involve Mean Joe Green?
This was the play where Terry Bradshaw, with only seconds left in the game and down by less than seven points, threw a bomb to John Fuqua.
Last minute plays happens all the time.
Not like this!  The intended receiver missed the ball, and it bounced off the defensive guy, only to be scooped up by the Stealer's fullback, Franco Harris, just before the ball hit the turf.
Really?
Yeah!  And with only seconds remaining in the game, Harris takes this gift--this ball that bounced into his hands from nowhere---and strolls into the endzone to win the playoff game!
Sounds wild!
It was!  But to this day, Raiders fans dispute the play, saying that the ball bounced off Fuqua, which means the catch was no good.
And then the Raiders would have won the game?
Exactly!
Sounds like one of Aesop's Fables...
Yeah, well the moral of the story is this: "That's just the way the ball bounces!"
