Did you see Moana.
Yes, I loved it. Dwayne Johnson is so cool.
Totally. The soundtrack was so awesome.
It just makes me want to sing!
I thought the pig was so cute!
And the chicken always getting into trouble was hilarious.
It was nice to see a strong female character.
I agree. It's visuals were really nice too.
Yep, it was beautiful.
That was a really good movie.
