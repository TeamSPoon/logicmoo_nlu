So, I watched the Force Awakens, I am lost.
By what? Good film.
I liked it, but was the force sleeping before?
No, it just means that a new Jedi had emerged.
Well, if it is Rey, then why did it not wake when Klyo came into power.
Klyo went to the dark side, he is not a Jedi.
If he is not a Jedi, why was he at Jedi school.
He was Luke's Padwan, but he turned. It has not been shown why. He is no longer Jedi, he is sith now.
Wait, I thought sith was a race.
No, Vader was human, well pretty much, but went from Jedi to Sith. Like Yoda is whatever he is, but is also a Jedi.
