I love lady gaga so much!
Really? What is your favorite song of her's?
I love Bad Romance, it's old but it's the best.
You know I didn't really like that one.
I'm surprised. It seems like something you would like.
It just seemed really repetitive to me
So what's your favorite song of hers?
I really liked Joanne.
But you hate country.
I know but that album is just incredible.
