What's the last movie you saw in the theater?
Believe it or not, I think it was Jurassic World.
Okay, one, you don't get out enough. And two: that movie sucked.
It did not!
For crying out loud, it had the woman running in heels!
I admit that's bad.
It's not just bad, it's unforgiveable.
Okay, fine.
And then there was the raptor-whisperer.
Okay, that was stretching the bounds of being able to suspend disbelief.
It was horrible.
But didn't you like Jurassic World anyway?
What? Are you crazy?
No. It was a big, loud summer movie with dinosaurs and a fair amount of blood. That's like the definition of a blockbuster.
Well, that's true. But why does it seems like every blockbuster has to have a women running in heels?
Yeah, the Avengers had Scarlett Johannsen running around in a leather suit she couldn't breath in and heels.
It has to suck: fighting the forces of evil with your breasts hanging out.
And they do it every time. Guardians of the Galaxy: the two main femaie characters are sewn into their clothes.
Yeah, I forgot about that. It was just so stupidly sexist.
Let's not even talk about Cat Woman.
