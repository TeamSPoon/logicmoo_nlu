what pop music do you think is the best for a work out?
bruno mars!
okay, aside from bruno mars. he's overplayed
a little. okay, i guess the chainsmokers are pretty good. very upbeat
upbeat is good for a work out, but they're not quite my thing
not even roses?
nah. that song is pretty good, but not for a work out!
honestly, i listen to the killers when i work out.
what? how?!
i don't know! pop rock pumps me up more than just pop
