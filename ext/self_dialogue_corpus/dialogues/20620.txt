You know what movie was funny?
What?
Look Whose Talking.
Oh yea, it was funny.
Kirstie Alley was Mollie and John Travolta played James.
They make a good couple.
Well first Mollie was with some businessman who was a complete jerk.
I loved the baby and the way he thought things aloud.
I wonder if babies really think like that, ha ha.
Maybe.
Well eventually Kirstie Alley 's character and John Travolta's got together.
I know.
I think at the end She got pregnant again.
I think I remember that.
Yes and that is what made headway for Look Whose Talking Too
Oh yea, I forgot about that one.
That was funny too.
I love those two, they are really funny together.
I have not seen that movie in a long time.
I have the dvd if you want to watch it.
