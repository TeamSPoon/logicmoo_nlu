Did you see the Fast and Furious 7?
Yes! I saw it in the theatre. It was one of their best yet!
I know. I can't believe that Paul Walker's brother finished his character out for him.
Yea I know, I could barely tell which brother was playing Brian.
I loved the last scene where they sort of did an homage to Paul.
Do you mean where Dom went to race him one last time?
Yea and then they showed a video montage of Paul Walker and Brian.
It had me crying! It was so sad.
Oh me too, I am going to miss that character in the movies. He was so great.
I agree it is very sad to see him go.
