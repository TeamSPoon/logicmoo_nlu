What are your thoughts on suicide squad?
I thought parts and certain performances were good.
I thought the script or maybe pacing of the film in general needed a lot of work, it was like the released a rough draft.
I don't find many superhero films to have the best scripts, it is a lot about the action.
I disagree, I think many superhero movies are have strong scripts and are great because of this fact.
Maybe true. I think what saved suicide squad from complete disaster was jared leto.
I thought he was a different take on the joker, I also thought he was one of the saving graces on this film . The other being Margot Robbie.
Margot was great, she is so sexy and portrays the insanity yet vulnerability that made this character come alive for me.
Without these two I feel the film would have no legs to stand on at all.
So many poor choices. I did not care for them each having a song intro, especially disliked will smiths.
