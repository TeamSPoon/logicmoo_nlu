Have you ever seen One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest?
Yes, easily one of the top 5 movies ever made.
Best Screen play, best picture, best director, best actor, best actress.  Just swept the Oscars that year.
Jack Nicholson was hilarious in that, and made a good guy out of a bad guy.
And Louis Fletcher as Nurse Ratchet.
She was horrifying.  Don't forget Christopher Loyd and Danny Divito were in it.
That movie was overflowing with talent.  Great comedy and such a tragic ending.
It made me want to cry when Cheif picked up the fountain.
It looked impossible for anyone else.  But he did it.
One of the funniest parts was when they went fishing.
That was great.  Especially when they said "Mr. Harding"
Yeah, and the way they all nodded, being called doctor.
Of course they were all nuts.
At least Nurse Ratched would have them believe that.
I know, I hated the way she manipulated everyone.
Horrible person, she was brilliant in that movie.
All those one liners from Jack were great too.
I know, they just came one after another.
Perhaps the best one liner came from Chiefe.
Mmmm Juicy fruit.
