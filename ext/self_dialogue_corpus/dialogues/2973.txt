When do the NFL training camps start?
I think they are doing the OTA's right now and then camps start sometime in July after that.
I am going to try and make it out to see some of training camps this year.  Tickets are free.
Yeah, the Seahawks have their camp in Renton right on Lake Washington.
I went to the Cowboays training camp last year and it was cool to see Dak Prescott before he became the starter.
I try to go to camp and maybe a preseason game.   Tickets are generally more affordable for preseason.
I know, tickets for regular season games have gotten so expensive.
They go for hundreds of dollars a game here per ticket.  I can't afford that.
You should come out to see a game in Dallas sometime though.
I know, the stadium there that Jerry Jones built looks incredible.
Are they still having Thursday Night Football every week this year?
I think so.  I don't like Thursday night games either.
The NFL is so overexposed.   It used to be just Sunday and Monday.
Now it's 3, sometimes 4 days a week when they have those Saturday night games.
I'm not into the NFL games in London either.
Tell me about it.  Games have started at 6:30 AM on the west coast!   I'm not waking up for that.
It's such a disadvantage for teams to have to travel to London anyway.
The NFL definitely wants to put a team there.  I don't get it.
It's all about money for the NFL owners.
The NFL says they care about fans, but how is a team having to give up a home game to play in London caring about fans.
