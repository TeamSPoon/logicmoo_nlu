Do you remember "Clue"?
Wasn't that in the mid 80's?
Yeah, it was 1985! Doesn't that seem like forever ago?
Well, it was, but it doesn't change the timelessness of that movie. I loved Tim Curry in that too.
I can't believe there was 10 years between those too. He made a great butler.
I also laughed so hard at Miss Scarlet...I think we all walked around saying "Well communism is only a red herring."
I remember that. I don't know why it was so funny but it was.
The movie gets really good as people start dying and the plot thickens.
It's the best when they are all running from room to room trying to figure out who will be murdered next.
I know. And then there's the six weapons.
Yes, a wrench, a candlestick, a lead pipe, a knife, a revolver, and a rope with a hangman's knot.
We all were guessing and screaming at the TV. It's a great movie to watch with a crowd.
Yeah, even after seeing it several times, it's still good.
The movie made the game even more fun.
I know. We played it a lot too.
It was great how they revealed how they were all connected.
You mean like the cook being hired by Mrs. Peacock.
And the motorist was Colonel Mustard's driver during the war and knew of his involvement with the black market.
But then Wadsworth reveals that he arranged the thing for the revenge for his wife who had committed suicide after being blackmailed by Mr. Boddy.
And  for Mr. Boddy having Socialist friends.
