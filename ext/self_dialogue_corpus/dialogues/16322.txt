Have you hear of Joe Bonamassa?
Yes I have. Great blues musician.
Exactly. He is awesome.
He's a great guitar player. Smooth style.
Very smooth style. And he's young.
What's he in his thirties?
I believe maybe mid thirties.
He started playing pretty young.
I thought I read he played on stage with Clapton when he was twelve.
Is that right?
I'm pretty sure that's what I saw.
Wow,that's unreal.
I think some people are born natural musicians.
Yea,I agree with that.
The great ones however are always practicing and trying to be the best.
Like the Beatles for instance. They practiced everyday.
They worked hard to get to the top.
A lot of people think they were an overnight success and they weren't.
I know they started out young and playing small clubs.
Yes,like the Cavern Club in England.
