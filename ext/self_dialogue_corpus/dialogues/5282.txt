I need help finding a good DIsney movie
Do you like the ones with princesses or not?
Not really, I have a young son so he's not into that
Oh okay. Try watching Toy Story and see if he likes it
I think he will love it!
If he enjoys it, there's like 3 more to watch!
He will start to think his toys are alive like Woody though
That's normal though, every kid does that!
Be sure to get him some toys that were used in the movie
Good idea! I'll look online for a Woody doll and maybe Buzz too!
