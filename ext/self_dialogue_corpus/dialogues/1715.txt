Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah sure who doesn't?
Well, my wife for one.
Oh, bummer.
She doesn't like many sports.
I guess that is pretty common.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Jaguars.
Oh interesting.  You from that area?
Yeah, why do you ask?
It's just they're not very good, so you must be from around there.
Oh.  Yeah I see what you mean.
I like the Chiefs.
Cool, you from around there.
Yeah.
I don't know much about the chiefs.
That's okay I don't know much about the Jags.
Gotcha.
