The Phillies ended their 4 game losing streak last night.
I saw that. It's about time, they needed that win in the worst way.
They got a good pitching performance from Hellickson last night.
Yeah he really got into a groove after that 1st inning.
He retired 16 out of 17 batters at one point. He was feeling good out there.
Yeah he had started the year out so strong. He had posted a 1.80 ERA in April
Yeah the Phillies need him to find that type of performance more consistently.
The guy is 5-1 this year, so they play pretty well when he is out there
There is a little concern over him though because his back tightened up in the 6th inning.
Well it wouldn't be a Phillies game if everything went right
The crazy thing is that it tightened up after he helped his own cause with an RBI double
Yeah, but they have already said that this will not cause him to miss his next start.
Yeah I know, but it is still something to monitor going forward
For sure. But this is the type of win that you need over another ballclub that's struggling.
Yeah the Pirates have their own slump going right now.
Well their ace Ivan Nova will be on the mound tomorrow.
Yeah he was the NL pitcher of the month in April
True, but he has not won a game in May
Baseball is a funny game that's how it works sometimes
I agree, but I think the Pirates win tomorrow.
