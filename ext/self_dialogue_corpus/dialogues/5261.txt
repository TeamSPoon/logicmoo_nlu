Did you go and see the new live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?
Yes I did, it was amazing.
I agree. What was your favorite part?
It has to be the music.
I agree. All the dancing and singing parts were done so well.
The costumes in all of those scenes were insane! I loved them so much.
Oh I did too. Dan Stevens as the Beast was incredible. His costume was by far the best.
I agree, but we can't forget about Gaston.
You're right. Luke Evans as Gaston was really cool.
I agree, and so was Emma Watson as Belle. I love her as an actress.
