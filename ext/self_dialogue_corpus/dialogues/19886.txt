Do you like country music?
Yes, I do!
Have you heard the song "There's got to be something more", by Sugar Land?
No, but I do like Sugar Land's music.
What is your favorite song?
I guess my favorite is Stand by your man!
Oh, That is a great song!!  Did you watch the Country Music Awards this year?
I missed some of it.
Did you see Reba McEntire?
Yes, her new song is outstanding!!
Yes, it is. I would love to hear more songs like that!
Yes.  Me too.  She is the greatest!
Is Josh Turner still around?  You hardly hear anything about him anymore.
I believe he just released a new song, but I didn't really care for it.
There will never be another song like Would you go with me.
I know, did you see the video of this song?
Yes, I loved it.  He has an outstanding voice.
Yes, he does.  I also love to hear Martina McBride.
I agree.  Her songs have a deep meaning, and are encouraging; and Joe Nichols " If nobody believed in me".
That is the type of songs, I love to hear.  We don't need more drinking songs, we need good morals in songs.
