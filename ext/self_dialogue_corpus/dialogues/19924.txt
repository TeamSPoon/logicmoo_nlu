Who is the best guitar player?
Probably The Edge.
Who is that?
He plays in U2.
I love U2.
They are from Ireland I think.
How did they get so big in America?
Probably from radio play on popular stations.
What is your favorite song by them?
Probably The Streets Have No Name.
I like that one too. But it is not my favorite.
What is your favorite then?
Probably Beautiful Day
That song is wonderful.
But many people do not like their new music.
Those people are crazy. Their new music is great.
I agree. Not many bands have their kind of longevity.
Everyone in the group still performs so well.
I hope I can see them on their next world tour.
Me too!
