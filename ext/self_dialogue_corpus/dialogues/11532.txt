Did you ever hear Sgt. Pepper's Band?
Yeah, that was a weird song.
It's catchy though.
I guess it kind of is.
Yeah, with all the instruments.
Kind of has a marching band feel.
I guess that's what they were going for though.
Well, I'm sure it was.
I guess.  That's what they look like on the album cover.
Yeah, that's a weird album cover.
