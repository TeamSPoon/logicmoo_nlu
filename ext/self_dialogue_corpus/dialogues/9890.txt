Nas or Jay-Z, who's the King of NY?
That was already settled man. They're friends no anyways.
It wasn't settled! People still disagree to this day.
Okay, well I think Nas is the best because he put out Illmatic.
You're wrong, Jay-Z is the best.
What has Jay-Z done better than Illmatic.
That's a good point, Illmatic is better than any of Jay's albums, but Jay's catalog has way more quality stuff in it than Nas.
I judge artists primarily by their master work. I don't see any of Jay-Z's master works (The Blueprint, Reasonable Doubt, et cetera) coming close to Illmatic.
So consistently great stuff counts for nothing?
Not for nothing, but the peak is the most important to me.
