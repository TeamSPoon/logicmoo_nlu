Any good thrillers come out recently?
We can watch Get Out, that new movie!
What's that movie about?
A black guy visits his white girlfriend's family and suspects evil things are going down
That sounds weird. I dont like it.
We can watch Secret Window with Johnny Depp
What happens in that movie?
There's a schizo author guy who thinks someone is after him
Where does it take place?
In a secluded cabin in a small town. Creepy!
