Did you hear that Modest Mouse is going to be playing here next month?
Do I know them?
Yeah, I used to listen to them all of the time- you probably know some of their songs from me.
Like what?
You probably know 'Float On'.  It was really popular when it came out and it's been used in a lot of TV commercials.
Where are they playing at?
I think they're going to be someplace downtown.
Downtown?  Like in one of the bars or smaller clubs down there?
Yeah, I'd really like to go see them at a small place.
Why, don't they play in small spaces?
Well, they used to, but then they got really big for a while and were actually playing arenas.
Wow, really?  How do I not recognize them then?
I mean, they're kind of an indie band, originally.
Maybe I'll think about going to see them with you.
That would be awesome!
When is it again?
Some time next month - I'll look it up and let you know exactly when it is so you can plan.  I'm excited!
I'll wanna brush up on them first.  What albums would you recommend I download?
I'd say 'The Lonesome Crowded West' and 'Good News for People Who Love Bad News'.  Both of those will be more recognizable to you.
Cool, I'll check them both out.  Text me and let me know when the show is.
