Have you seen the movie Hesher?
No. I haven't. What's it about?
It's about this anarchist living in an abandoned building who meets a boy, and he moves in with his family.
Go on...
He is really harsh and mean at first, but as the story unfolds you see that inside he is a good guy.
Is he really mean in the movie?
Yeah. He's this anarchist with long hair. He does whatever he wants.
Who is in it?
Joseph Gordon- Levitt and Natalie Portman.
Wow. Those are some big names. Did it win any awards?
I don't think so, it's different and unique. Great movie but not popular or proper enough to be award material
I see. Did you like it?
I love it. I own it on blue-ray.
Ok. Natalie Portman huh? She must look really pretty on blue-ray.
Of course she does. All the actors have great chemistry in this movie.
It's good to see a movie like that, where all the actors have a chemistry and blend together.
Is is similar to other movies you have seen?
Yes and no.
What do you mean?
It's very unique, but it based on a character who acts mean but is actually noble, and we have seen movies like that before.
