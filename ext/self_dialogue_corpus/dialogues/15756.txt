I hear Rush isn't touring anymore.
Whaaaaaat?  Are you serious!
Yeah I just read it on their web site.
What's the problem?
Neil and Alex both have some medical issues and think it's time to retire.
Yeah I heard they did but can;t they still do and occasional concert?
No they decided not to do one nighters.
That's understandable.
I've been a fan since 2112
My fav is Moving Pictures
Yeah Tom Sawyer put them on the map.
I did read that they'd still be recording
Well that's good news.
Let me know if you hear about any new tunes available.
Sure will, in the mean time we can catch a Rush tribute band
Nah, I'll pass
Why it's be the next best thing
Funny- it would be like washing your feet with socks on.  I'll pass
I'll still wear my Rush t-shirts
Still the best band EVER!
