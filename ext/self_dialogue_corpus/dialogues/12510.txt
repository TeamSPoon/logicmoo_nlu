I saw the trailer for the" Star Wars 8" movie that is coming out soon.
Did it look like a good episode?
Yeah, I cannot wait till it comes out in theaters, Luke Skywalker is going to be in it.
I hope Yoda will be in that episode, that would be cool.
Yeah! Yoda can fight, he fought Darth Sidious.
Darth Sidious cannot beat Yoda.
Yeah! just like when "Anakin  and Obi-Wan fought.
I like the first episode when Luke Skywalker join forces with Jedi knights.
Yeah, I do too, in the movie "Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan almost dies.
I know, I like Obi-Wan he is a great fighter.
