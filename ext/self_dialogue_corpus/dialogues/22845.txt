Did you watch the old Nightmare on Elm Street movies?
The Freddy movies?
Yes those ones.
I've seen some of them why?
I was thinking for halloween we could watch them all together for a movie night.
That sounds fun, but why that movie.
It's an old classic and in my opinion the best horror/thriller movies ever.
Yeah but being scary doesn't make them great.
You're right it's also the humor and the hilarious scenes like the water bed scene.
I do remember that one and yeah they're pretty funny.
Do you think the humor fits in them?
It does in this case but wouldn't in a Jason movie he's too serious.
Freddy reminds me of Joker from Batman.
That's a pretty good comparison I think.
So you're game to watch them again?
Yes, I also haven't seen them all how many are there.
A lot.
I guess it's going to be a long night should I bring food.
Good Idea.
Chips and burgers.
