Did you like Mad Max?
Yes, it kept me on my toes the entire time.
What did you like best about it?
I just like the world development. The world was its own character.
What did you think of Tom Hardy?
He did a great job, but he wasn't required to talk much, so it was easy for him to get lost.
Did you like the chase scene?
Yes, it was very well shot. I found myself hoping that the other group would die.
Do you think that will be our future one day?
I hope not. I don't think I could survive.
