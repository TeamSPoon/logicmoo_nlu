What is the best western you've ever seen?
That would have to be Once Upon a Time in the West.
That's an interesting choice. What is that movie about?
It has a typical theme for westerns, which is basically how technological advancement is bringing to an end the wonder and freedom of the wild west.
But it also reduces the lawlessness and brutality.
That's true, and I think the film expresses this as well.
How so?
Well, it would be much harder nowadays for Henry Fonda's villain to get away with the things he does.
At least in the straightforward way in which he does it.
Exactly.
Who else was in that film?
Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale.
Is that Bronson's best role?
I think so. He never did anything afterwards with as much weight or substance.
That's probably true, as the Death Wish movies were pretty straightforward.
Yeah, those were not very good.
Who does Bronson play in the film?
He is a harmonica-weilding wanderer who is out for revenge.
That is a pretty unique-sounding character.
It really is, and the final showdown is a joy to watch.
