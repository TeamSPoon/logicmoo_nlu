Do you watch superhero movies?
I am a big fan indeed. I have watched quite a few DC comic and Marvel comic superhero movies.
Great. Do you like Avengers movie?
Well, there are two Avengers movies. The first one is really great, but the second one is somehow boring.
I totally agree with you. The second Avengers movie has too many action scenes.
I heard about that the next Avengers movie will come out next year.
I hope it is better than the second Avengers movie.
Marvel Studio changed the director of the next Avengers movies. So I think the quality could catch up.
That is great to know. Who is the director?
The same director of Captain America Civil War.
