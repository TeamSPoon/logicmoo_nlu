Have you seen tangled?
Yes
I love that movie
It was really good
I enjoyed it alot
I love how she got to see her parents at the end
Me too
It was sweet
Yes it was so sweet
I also loved how excited she was to see the laterns
I know she was so happy
It was adorable how he had two laterns
Yes one for him and one for her
I know it was the sweetest
Hes a good person
At the end
Yea he started out not so good
But he changed so much
He really does
He does
