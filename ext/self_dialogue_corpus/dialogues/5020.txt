Alright, dude, I got a beef about baseball.
I'm trying to eat...
Anyway, why aren't more baseball players in jail?
Again, I'm eating here. But go ahead. What are you ranting about this time?
Well, we see baseball players get into fights on a semi-regular basis. At least every week or two the benches clear, there are punches thrown.
Yes, and?
And they take bats and destroy them, they break water coolers when mad, they throw bases around.
Yeah, they're playing kids games. They're kids, pretty much. What's your point?
What are the penalties that they get from MLB?
Usually a $5,000 fine and a 2- to 3-game suspension.
And if this happened in real life? Someone throws an object at your head at 95 miles per hour, and people get into a big fight?
They... oh...
Yeah, they go to jail. And pay fines that actually cost a lot of money, relatively, instead of the amount they get paid per inning played.
So, why do you think they don't go to jail?
I don't know. They should, especially if they are supposed to be role models for kids.
I'd love to see cops on the field actually putting these players in handcuffs and tasering them.
Their personalities alone deserve it. But anyway, the other problem is that MLB doesn't do enough to dissuade the fights.
The fans cheer it heavily, too.
So, they are promoting violence while not showing any true consequences.
Yeah, they care more about what players put into their bodies than actual crimes. Kind of weird.
