Did you hear the Insyderz got back together?
Yeah, but I haven't listened to any new stuff of theirs.
Me neither, I'm pretty much stuck in the 90's as far as music is concerned.
That's when they were best! I still listen to my Fight of My Life CD.
Ahh, man that one's good. Jigsaw gets stuck in my head all the time.
Same here. Which do you prefer, Fight of My Life or Motor City Ska?
I kind of prefer Motor City Ska. The overall sound plus is has a few of my favourite songs on it.
Which ones?
I like Carnival and I say.
I think those are some of the best written and arranged songs of theirs.
Definitely. I really admire Joe Yerke's musicianship even if his other ventures are disappointing.
What you do mean?
Well he became a cop, sadly. But I still like his music and listen to Motor City Ska all the time.
Have you listened to Skalleluia?
Yeah, and Skalleluia Too! Though I prefer the first one.
There were a lot of good ones on that.
I really like their rendition of "Lord I Lift Your Name on High" and "True of You".
True of You sounded a bit dark to me.
To me too, not in a bad way.
Gosh I love the Insyderz.
