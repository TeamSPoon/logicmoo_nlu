What team in the AFC can beat the Patriots this season?
In a playoff game, I don't see it happening.
On paper, that's probably the right answer.
If I had to pick a team, I'd go with the Raiders.
They do have a lot of nice pieces.
I'm a little concerned about the running game, though.
They have an elite offensive line, between Donald Penn, Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson, and Gabe Jackson.
True, those guys can help open up holes for Marshawn Lynch.
The key will be to make sure Derek Carr is healthy for the playoffs.
Not going to the backup quaterback seems like a requirement for all teams.
That's fair.
Oakland's defense is improving too.
It helps to have arguably the best defensive player in the game, Khalid Mack.
He should theoretically improve too, since he's still so young.
Yeah, but I'm still concerned about the rest of the pass rush.
Oakland had the fewest sacks in the league last year, so I get the concern.
Hopefully one of their young players will step up, most likely Mario Edwards.
The passing game should continue to grow, as well.
I like the additions of Cordarrelle Patterson - who will also help in the return game - and espeically Jared Cook.
I'm interested to see how the team does in 2017!
