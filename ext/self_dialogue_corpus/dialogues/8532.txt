Who do you think was the actual pop prince?
Well, they say Micheal Jackson.
You know, I do not even like his stuff that much.
He was one of the mot successful artists ever.
But most his songs sounded the exact same.
How so?
Well, Billy Jean sounds just like Man in The Mirror.
But, the lyrics are so different.
Not really, every one of songs are just the same, varying words.
Well, there is always Prince.
