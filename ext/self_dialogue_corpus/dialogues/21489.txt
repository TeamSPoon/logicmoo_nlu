What movie do you want to see right now?
Wonder woman, definitely Wonder Woman.
Why would you pick that?
Have you seen my desk at work?
No, what does that have to do with Wonder Woman?
That is how I have it decorated, in Wonder Woman. I am a huge fan of comic books.
Oh, So who is in Wonder Woman again?
Gal Gadot plays the lead.
Never heard of her.
She has been in some of the Fast and Furious franchise movies.
I am not a huge fan of movies that don't have mega named leads.
The biggest Batman flop in history had a huge name as a lead.
Who was that?
Uh, George Clooney, A.K.A. Bat-nipples.
Oh yeah, I try to block that movie from my brain.
So does Clooney.
I wonder why they thought that was a good idea.
Hollywood will forever wonder.
So do you think you will see it in theater's?
Hopefully, but if not, I will get it when it comes out on blu ray.
