Do you like the Rolling Stones?
Are you kidding? Who doesn't!
I've been listening to them more lately.
They're such an iconic band.
And they still play together!
They do?! Aren't they like 90 by now?
Something like that. They still jam though.
Unreal. I couuldn't imagine playing for that long.
They really do love their music though.
Others seem to really dig their music as well.
I wonder if they still put out music.
I know Mick does on his own from time to time.
Do you like his solo stuff?
It's actually not bad at all.
Wow no kidding.
Yeah he's actually quite talented on his own.
I'll have to listen to some of it.
You really should. I think you'd like it.
I will once Im done with their 3rd album.
Okay do it!
