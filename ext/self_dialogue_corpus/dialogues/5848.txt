DId you like the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
I'm not really sure! I love the original so much.
I know what you mean. That movie is my childhood.
I really loved the way it looked though. I also loved all the background that you got in the new film that you didn't get in the original.
I agree. The background on her mom was pretty cool.
I also thought the enchanted objects of the palace were beautiful but I kind of missed the animation.
But, the live action movie had Emma Watson!
I know! I liked it. Really, I did. But, I will always like the original better.
I think I liked the live action one better.
I totally get that.
