What did you think of the new movie Split.
I thought it was thrilling.
Did you enjoy the plot?
I thought it was a bit played out already. Been there and done that.
I thought it was fresh.
The acting was good, the James Mcavoy played all the personalities well.
There was a lot of cliff hangers.
But it was predictable.
I still enjoyed the movie.
I think it had a too short ending.
