What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's such a hard question there have been so many good ones, like Up or the classics like Snow White.
Ya I recently watched a documentary about Disney I didn't know with the classics like Snow White all the scenes were painted by hand.
That's really cool when think about all the work that went into each scene.
I think my favorite is with the wicked witch some of her scenes are so detailed it's hard to believe everything was hand painted.
I would love to watch the movie again thinking of that.
I know some of the scenes in the forest are very detailed too.
I think the music is really good in that movie too.
Ya most of those songs are still really popular today.
Whistle while You Work is still one of my favorites.
