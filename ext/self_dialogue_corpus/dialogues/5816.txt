Do you remember when the Little Mermaid was released?
I kind of remember when it was popular.
I'm thinking it was in the late 80s?
Yeah, that sounds about right.  I was in elementary school.
Did you like it?
I never really watched it.  They did show it one time on a free day at school.
So you watched it then?
Not really.  I didn't really care for it.
You must have been the only kid not watching it.
Yeah, pretty much.  Everyone loves Disney.
