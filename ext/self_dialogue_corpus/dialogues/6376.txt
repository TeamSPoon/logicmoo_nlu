My favorite Disney sidekick is definitely Mushu.
He's okay, but not the best.
So who do you prefer?
Timon and Pumba!
Wait, why?
Hakuna Matata is a good song and a great life philosophy.
Not a bad point. Mushu can breathe fire though!
Ok, hardly. I prefer the horse from Mulan, honestly.
Haha you're right, that horse is great.
Way better than Mushu.
