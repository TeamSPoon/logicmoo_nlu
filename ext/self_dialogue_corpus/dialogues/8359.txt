How do you listen to most of your music?
I stream nowadays, but I have an iPod as well.
Oh, cool. Put your iPod on shuffle and see what we get.
It gave me Kylie Minogue.
I absolutely love Kylie. Do you know if she has any new singles coming out?
I heard she's back in the studio.
Is she still with Roc Nation?
No she left after Kiss Me Once underperformed.
To be honest, that album deserved it.
It wasn't up to her usual standards.
