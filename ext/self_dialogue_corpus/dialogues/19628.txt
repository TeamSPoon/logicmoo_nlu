Have you ever heard of Mariah Carey?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I just discovered her the other day.
Are you serious?
What am I missing?
She's the top-selling female singer of all-time. She's worth half a billion dollars. She's been on the radio for over twenty years.
Well, then I live under a rock.
You sure do. Why do you bring her up?
She was on Carpool Karaoke and I was wondering if my opinion was correct, given your musical expertise.
So what do you think?
Her voice is terrible. She didn't even try.
Right, there's a reason why.
What happened?
Well, she had a great voice. She can even sing five octaves because of her vocal chords.
That's insane.
She blew out her voice in the 90s due to poor maintenance and not studying with an actual vocal coach.
What about her not trying?
In that case: she's just a diva. She's obnoxious.
I kind of got that--very entitled.
Well, she IS worth more money than the entire state of West Virginia.
