I love the Star Wars franchise. Do you?
Oh yes I absolutely love the Star Wars movies.
They are just the greatest, aren't they?
Totally agreed.
Which actor do you like best?
I love Carrie Fisher in the movie.
But she was not that major though.
Are you kidding?
She was not in my opinion compared to Harrison Ford and Marc Hamil.
That is somewhat true.
