Have you heard Katy Perry's new songs?
Yeah, I think I've heard two of them.
What do you think about them?
I'm still undecided about whether I'm into them or not. What about you?
I feel the same way! Like, when I first heard her three new singles, I didn't think I liked them, but now a couple of them keep getting stuck in my head.
I kind of felt the same way when I heard Bon Appetite and Chained to the Rhythm. Was uncertain at first but now they're always stuck in my head.
Yeah, I can definitely see how those two songs would get stuck in your head.
They're just so dang catchy!
I agree. Have you heard the other single she released recently.
I don't think so. What is it called?
It's called Swish Swish.
Oh, that one! Yeah, wasn't that the one that she performed on Saturday Night Live last week?
It was! That performance was entertaining, I think, but also kind of weird and crazy.
Yeah, I agree! I don't know if I like that song yet. I heard it for the first time when she performed it on SNL.
I had heard it once before then, but I feel the same way. I'm undecided.
What was up with that kid dancing in her Saturday Night Live performance?
I don't know, but that was funny! Actually, my girlfriend told me that he is some sort of Instagram star or something.
Oh, that makes sense! It seemed so random to me! Maybe I'll look that kid up and see what that was about.
You should! Let me know what you find out!
I will!
