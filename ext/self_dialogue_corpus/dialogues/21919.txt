I just saw "Roman Holiday" again. I adore that movie!
Who's in it again?
Gregory Peck, and Audrey Hepburn! haven;t you ever seen it?
No, it's an old movie in back and white, right?
Yes, but it's timeless! I don't even notice that it's in black and white after a while.
I don't know if I'd like it. What's it about?
Gregory Peck plays a reporter who is looking for a great story, and Audrey Hepburn plays a princess who gets lost in Rome after she runs away from the palace.
Why does she run away? How does she meet Gregory Peck's character?
She runs away from her obligations, like having to preside over awards and committees, but it's an accident. She was tranquilized when she got too rambunctious.
So then what happens? Just don't tell me the ending...then I won't need to watch it.
The princess wanders and falls asleep near a park, and Gregory Peck's character finds her and takes her to his apartment because he doesn't want her to get in trouble.
Doesn't he know she's the princess?
No, not until later, Then he decides to try and write a story about her adventures, and gets a friend who is a photographer to take pictures all the while.
Doesn't she know he's a reporter? Wouldn't she stop the photographer?
No, he doesn't tell her, and the photographer has hidden cameras.
Well, it sounds kind of interesting. What really makes the likable movie for you?
I just can't keep my eyes off of Gregory Peck! He was so young and handsome, and Audrey Hepburn was so beautiful...
I might try it. Peck was pretty impressive in "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Yes, wasn't he? I love the sound of his voice, too.
You've convinced me. I'll check it out tonight, with a glass of wine and some chocolates!
