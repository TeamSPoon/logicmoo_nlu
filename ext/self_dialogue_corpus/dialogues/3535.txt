Did you ever see The Grudge?
Yes I did and that's one of the scariest movies ever.
You're so right about that. Did you ever see the Japanese original movie called Ju-On?
Yes but I relate to the American version better. But it was really good.
I agree. I was into Asian horror for a good while there.
Me too. There's an Asian horror called Audition which is pretty creepy.
I've seen that. What's your favorite Grudge movie?
Part one of course. It was the scariest and really laid out the story.
Yeah that creepy voice of hers gave me many nightmares.
I played a prank on my uncle over the phone once using that voice. He didn't want to admit he was scared but I know he was.
