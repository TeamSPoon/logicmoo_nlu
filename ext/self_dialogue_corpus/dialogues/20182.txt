My favorite movie is Gran Torino.
I don't like that movie.
Really? Why?
I thought the acting was really bad.
Are you kidding? Clint Eastwood was great as Walt.
He was just alright, and the supporting actors were even worse.
I think you're being too harsh.
Maybe so.
What Clint Eastwood movies do you like better?
My favorite is Unforgiven.
I've never seen that one.
It came out in the nineties.
Wow, that's a long time ago.
I know, but I love older movies.
I like more modern movies.
It just doesn't seem like newer movies these days have good stories.
You can't be serious. Twelve Years A Slave was great and that came out only four years ago.
I guess you're right. I think I just like the nostalgia of watching old movies.
I know what you mean. Everytime I watch Jeremiah Johnson it reminds me of watching it with my grandpa.
Jeremiah Johnson was a great movie. It made me wish I lived in the woods when I was little.
