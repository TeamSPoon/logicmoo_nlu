What did you think of the Born This Way video?
You know, I don't really know if I like it.
I loved it! It was crazy to see her dancing that well.
I'll give you that, but I guess I just don't like the song.
Don't tell me you're one of the ones who thinks it sounds like Madonna.
Come on! It totally sounds like Madonna.
Yeah, but Lady GaGa is clearly inspired by Madonna. I don't think that's a bad thing.
I agree, but she should do something new with it.
I think she is.
I think she could do a lot more with all her talent.
