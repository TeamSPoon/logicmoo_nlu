Have you heard about the Pro Football hall of fame for 2017.
No I have not heard yet,  Who is in it this time?
So many good ones this year.  Very deserving!
When is it?
August 6th I believe.  Jerry Jones is gonna be in this year.
I heard his wife was going to be a presenter?
She sure is!  She will be only the 3rd wife to present to her husband.
Oh I remember when Farve wife did that last year.  I think it is a good idea.
I like to see the wives get some recognition and I think being a presenter is just the way.
Oh look here it says that Kurt Warner wife will also present this year to him.
That is such a good idea.  I really support that decision.
The Cowboys should have a good team this year dont you think?
Yea they really stacked the house with the draft.
Even with all the trouble they are having with some players I really think they will come out swinging.
I will not miss Tony Romo?  He was a good guy but couldn't quit geting hurt
I hear that everytime he went down I closed my eyes.
I think we will have a good season with Dak at the Quarterback position.
As long as he shows up like last year he will be good for our team.
I guess we will have to wait to see when it all gets going.
Lets plan a few season games this year.  Just let me know when you are free!
