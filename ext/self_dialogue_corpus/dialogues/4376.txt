Have you seen the movie Orphan?
Yes that movie was messed up.
For sure I thought the girl was just ill until it showed what she really was.
I know I can't believe she was in her 30's.
She killed the nun, tried to kill the boy and made the mom look so bad.
The movie had me not wanted to even get a drink I didn't want to miss a second of it.
I am going to show it to my mother in law.
She will like it.
The dad on there was so naive and didn't see what she was doing.
I know the poor mom was getting all the blame.
