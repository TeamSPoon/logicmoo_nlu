High School Musical really launches some careers
Most notably I guess you could say Zac Efron
Vanessa Hudgens was in that too.
And you have to add in Ashley Tisdale.
It was almost filmed with an ensemble cast.
The plot to it wasnt that bad either.
It was a standard Disney movie thats for sure.
It was but it connected with audiences
And made them alot of money
Its the starting point for a lot of the kids in it
