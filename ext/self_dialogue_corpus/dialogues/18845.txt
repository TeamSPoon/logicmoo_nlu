What type of music do you like to listen to while working out?
I like rock or hip-hop rap.
What is your favorite.
Probably hip-hop rap.
Do you have a specific song you like to listen to?
Anything by Flo Rida usually gets me going.
I myself like to stick with rock.
Rock is good but something about rap keeps me motivated.
What song do you listen to by Flo Rida?
Anything really.
The only one I know from him is "Welcome to My House".
Yes, that is a good one.
What are some of his other songs?
One of the new ones I like is called "Cake".
Is that one you listen to while working out?
Definitely.
That is kind of ironic.
I guess it is, I have never thought of that.
I will keep him in mind the next time I go for a run.
You won't be disappointed.
