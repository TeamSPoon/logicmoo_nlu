What are you doing today my cyberpal?
Just being the best music geek I know how to be. Looking for obscure stuff...well at least for me they will be.
Sounds interesting. Let me see if I can come up with some one you may have not heard of.
Ok shoot I am all ears.
Telephone Man by Meri Wilson..you won't be sorry!! much
Super cheese???
Oh of the highest quality. it's going to get stuck in your head. HA HA!
Yeah well it won't be the first time. Got any more?
Oh you probably know this one . Brand New Key by Melanie.
Yes I do know that but it's one I had not thought of in a while.
I was just looking it up and it listed Katherine McPhee
Yes I know I have heard it before
Well I'll have to see if I can up with some more.
Ok sounds good.
Did you ever get your yard done?
Yeah looks good. Ooooh that was something else I want to do  the plants hooked up to a midi and the play music
Thought sounds pretty awesome. Did you ever see the Secret Life of plants?
The time lapse movie?
Yeah that's the one.
Well I got to slide. I have company that just walked in....later
