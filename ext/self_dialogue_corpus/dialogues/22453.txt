I feel like watching Wedding Crashers.
Remind me who is in that again?
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm not sure if I've seen it.
What?  It's one of the best comedies ever made?
Who was in it?
Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rachel Mcdams, Christopher Walken, Will Ferrell, and Bradley Cooper.
Oh that's right. I remember seeing it when it came out.
You need to watch it again and again.
I don't remember Bradley Cooper being in it.
He wasn't really known yet.
What year did it come out?
I believe it was 2005.
What was his part in the film?
He was the guy Rachel McAdams was going to marry. He was a jerk.
The one who tackled Vince?
Yep. And shot him while they were quail hunting.
Oh that's right. He got sick at dinner.
Yep. They put eye drops in his water.
Oh that's funny. I do have to revisit that film again.
