So you lived in Germany. How's that polka?
Um, I think Polka is technically Polish...
But don't they have that accordian-y stuff and slap their shoe dance and stuff?
Well yes, there is regional folk music that is like that... and Schlager.
Schlager?
Yes, it's regional and folky but more a 1960s invention I think. Kind of like Lawrence Welk but more German-y
Like the stuff you see at the Eurovision Song Contest?
Yes, very often that will be a piece of Schlager.
So tell me more.
It's very polka-like, often has a married couple dressed in dirndl and Lederhosen trilling about love. or country.
Hahaha sounds absurd.
It is many things haha - silly, goofy, parodiable, charming, cultural and happy.
Sounds like Oktoberfest music.
Yes - a lot of Schlager is covered in the tents of Oktoberfest.
I went to it back in 2000. There was a popular song at the time - "Anton aus Tirol." they played it in all the tents.
YES, I lived there then, but we didn't know each other yet! Too bad. We were probably in the same tent haha.
And Anton aus Tirol is considered Schlager?
Absolutely. A bit of a modern parody of it, but Schlager nonetheless.
Do you miss Bavaria?
Yes, like I said stuff like that is goofy but a charming part of the culture.
