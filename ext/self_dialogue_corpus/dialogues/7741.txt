I know you love Harry Potter. Is there anything in the movies better than the books?
Well for one the music. It might seem a small thing but it really adds to it especially the song "Double Double Toil And Trouble!"
I love music so that sounds about right. Anything else?
Of course! The Hungarian Horntail dragon in the books stays close to her next. Not in the movies and it is a great scene!
Which movie was that one?
It's the book and the movie The Goblet of Fire.
Which order is that one in?
That's actually the fourth book and movie in the series.
But I should still watch in order and look for all the extras right?
Yes, you won't regret the time, I promise!
