Wasn't the 80's the best era for music?
It sure was.
Who did you like the best?
Duran Duran, of course.
Really, not Howard Jones?
Ho Jo was great, but doesn't nearly have the resume of D squared
Doesn't quality outrank quantity?
But Duran Duran had both.
Is see your point, and you've always liked the New Romantics.
That was were it was at in the 80's
Yes, it was new and fresh.
And it pushed the envelope, but was still reasonable.
As long as you didn't try to figure out what the songs really meant.
Yes, that could just ruin things.
And we really wouldn't want that.
I hear that Duran Duran will be touring soon.
Will you go?
Only if they come to Pittsburgh or Buffalo.
Not Cleveland.
No, won't go there.
