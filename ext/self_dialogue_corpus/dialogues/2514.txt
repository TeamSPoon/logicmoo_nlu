Let's talk about wide receivers for awhile.  I throw a name out there and you tell me what you think.
Sounds like fun to me!
Antonio Brown
Quick, fast, great hands.  The best all around receiver in the league.
Odell Beckham JR.
Very talented. He has the potential to be one of the greats, but is his own worst enemy.
Julio Jones
Awesome talent, I wish he wasn't hurt all the time.  He'd set records if he was healthy.
Jordy Nelson
Extremely fast and gives 100% all the time.  It helps having Aaron Rodgers throwing to you though.
Dez Bryant
The X man!  He has matured over the last few years.  Studies hard and wants to win.
TY Hilton
Not a very big receiver, but plays big.  Very quick and exciting to watch.
Michael Thomas
Plays with Drew Brees. had a great rookie year, I think he'll be even better this year.
Mike Evans
Solid receiver, I think he scores 12 tds this year.  He's a touchdown machine.
AJ Green
Very underrated.  Probably the best receiver behind Antonio Brown, OBJ, and Julio.
