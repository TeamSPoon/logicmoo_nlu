Dude I cannot get over the movie Split. I watched it like 3 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.
Split? That's the movie with Brad William Henke as the guy with 24 different personalities correct?
Yes! Like jesus!! I haven't watched an intense movie like this in a long time. Words really cannot describe how I feel about it.
I saw it when it came out in theaters, and had the same reaction you're having now, lasted like 3 weeks for me. It was actually pretty scary.
Those poors girls! I was rooting for them the entire time, I never really lost hope that they wouldn't escape that house until Henke turned into the beast and ate the two girls.
Haha! Omg man, I thought he was full of it until he literally crushed his doctor lady with his bare hands.
Exactly! But the fact he spared the last girls life was so satisfying, the emotional rollercoaster of those last 20 minutes almost gave me a heart attack.
More like the last 5 minutes for me, did you even see Bruce Willis sitting the cafe?!?! Like What!
You really think I missed that part? I've been reading up the final scene since the movie ended. Word of mouth is that M Night Shyamalan is going to make the sequal to Unbreakbale with the premisis from Split.
I'll believe it when I see it but how epic would that be? M Night Shyamalan is making a serious comeback.
