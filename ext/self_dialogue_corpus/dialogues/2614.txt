Who do you think the top players in the NFL are right now?
That's a good question, players are so crazy right now.
I know, but if you had to choose, who would be your top players?
Well, definitely Tom Brady.
Yea Tom is a beast, he has to be in the list.
Yea, the patriots would be nothing without him.
I don't know about that, but he's a great pick.
Next would be Antonio Brown.
What position does he play again?
Wide receiver.
Oh right for the steelers.
Yea, he's amazing.
Ok, who else?
Cam Newton
The Panthers QB?
Yea, he's up there.
I guess he's pretty good. I'm just not a Panther's fan.
Well you didn't ask what teams I liked, you asked who the best players were.
Yea true, I just find it hard to think someone is good when they are on a team I hate.
Well, that's just narrow minded.
