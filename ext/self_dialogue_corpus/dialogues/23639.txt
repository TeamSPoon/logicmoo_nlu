Do you want to talk about movies?
Sure, love them
Great do you have a favorite kind?
All of them really
Same here
One of my favorites is the fast and the furious
Those ones are good, I love vin diesel
He's a good actor
He is, and he's so hott
I can't believe Paul walker died
I know that's so sad
Have you seen the fate of the furious
No, I can't being myself to watch jt
Me either. I was wondering if it's sad
Same, I can't imagine a fast and the furious movie without Paul walker in it
Me either, he was nice to look at
Yea i liked him better than vin diesel
Not me, but he was good to look at
It was so tragic, I didn't believe it at first
Me either
