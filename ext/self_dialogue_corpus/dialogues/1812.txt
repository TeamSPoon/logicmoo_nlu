Why didn't Peyton Manning win more Super Bowls?
He won two.  That's pretty good.
Yeah, but he is suppose to be a football robot.
You got to remember the Colts were terrible for his first 4 or so years.
The Colts were pretty good for the next 10 or so years.
True, but the Colts never had a great defense.
That's not true.  They had a dominate defense a few years.
The Colts defense was fast but they were all small guys.
Would you rather big slow guys?
You need some size on defense or you can't stop the run.
I guess that is true.  The Colts run defense was never great.
The whole defense was never great.  The Colts offense was just so dominate that it didn't matter.
So, back to the question.  Why didn't Peyton win more Super Bowls?
Well the easy answer is because of the New England Patriots.
Man, those were some good games Colts vs Patriots.
Yeah, but the Patriots won the majority of them.
The Colts never really could figure out the Patriots in the playoffs.
Well we'll look back and realize that the Patriots are having one of the best runs in NFL history.
I think Peyton should have won 4 Super Bowls with those teams.
Hey, he won 2 and got to 3 Super Bowls.  That's pretty good in my opinion.
