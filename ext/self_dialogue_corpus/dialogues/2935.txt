Are the Carolina Panters going to turn it around this year?
What a difference last year was compared to the year before.
They were unstoppable until the Super Bowl.
I like Cam Newton but he takes a beating out there.
He sure does.  That is not good for longetivity in the NFL.
Look at Tom Brady he barely runs and has been around for years.
I think he is 40, or close.
Peyton Manning was the same way.
Well I can't wait for the season to kick off.
What teams do you follow?
I like the Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.
I don't know much about the Dolphins, but I do like Arizona.
The Dolphins haven't been the same since Marino left.
They have had a hard time finding his successor.
That and they play in the Patriots division.
That's tough because if you have good season it's probably still not as good as the Patriots.
Well now Arizona's division has gotten tougher with the emergence of Seattle.
I like their defesnse it's old school.
I know they don't back down from anyone and are intimidating.
They remind me of the Bears defense in the 80's.
