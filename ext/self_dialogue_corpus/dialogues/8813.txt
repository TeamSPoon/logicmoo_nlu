I love good old-fashioned rock music.
What do you mean?
The stuff from the 50s and early 60s, before the Beatles.
I didn't know there were any any rock bands before the Beatles.
Not just bands! Great solo acts like Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochrane!
Never heard of them.
Of course you haven't. The Beatles pretty much blew those guys off the map.
What about Elvis?
Elvis was around.
I like Elvis.
