Have you ever played that game Songburst?
Where you have to guess the lyrics of a song? I've heard of it.
Yeah, it's just funny to realize you didn't know the true lyrics of songs you sing a lot.
What do you mean?
Like in one song the lyrics were 'you and me endlessly'.
Sounds pretty straight forward.
And my friend guess 'you and me and Leslie'.
Ha! Who's Leslie?
That's what we wanted to know!
I actually used to think that 'put me in coach' song was about a plane flight.
That's hilarious. Why?
I don't know. I guess I thought the guy was really frugal or something.
But the other lyrics make it clear it's about baseball.
I know. I guess I never really listened closely to the lyrics.
And that's kind of what I meant when I said it was funny to find out how many lyrics we don't actually know.
It's true. There have been some songs I've bopped along to and been shocked when I really paid attention.
Oh, like that song Pumped Up Kicks.
Perfect example. It's a great beat, but...
A pretty horrifying subject.
Yep. I guess the moral is to really listen to the lyrics.
