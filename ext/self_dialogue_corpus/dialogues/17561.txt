So, I started listening to k-pop recently.
Oh yeah? How did you hear about k-pop?
A friend I  spoke with a couple weeks ago introduced me to k-pop.
Oh you never heard of the genre before then?
No, I never have.
That's to bad. I'm glad your getting into it now. I listen to a few k-pop bands.
Which ones are those?
My favorite is 2NE1 but i also have some music from SHINee and Exo.
I've listened to 2NE2,  I think they are great. They are an all girl band.
Yup, they have been around for awhile too. I think since 2009 or so.
Yeah, you're right. It has been awhile for them. And they are still rocking in 2017.
Which song do you like from them?
I think I would have to say Lollipop. I think it just has that beat that I love.
I agree, like that song as well. what do you think of the vocals? Who do you think is better?
I think they are all great and their intonations are on par with the others' But out of them all in the 'look' factor, i think Sandra Park is the cutest.
They are all pretty hot, but I have to agree. Sandra is hella sexy.
I wish they would come to the States, I would definitely go to their concert no matter where it was.
You would have to count me in to that. Cause so would I.
I'm going to check out more k-pop bands, I will let you know if i find anything else worth listening to.
Okay, that sounds good. Thanks.
