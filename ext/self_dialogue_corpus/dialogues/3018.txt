I'm glued to this interview.
Who is the player?
Eddie Smith.
I love Eddie!
He's a tank.
I concur.  What'd he say?
Talked about his childhood and college years in football.
Is he from Johnston, Ohio?
Yes he is!
My cousin is from there.
Oh, they might know him.
They went to school with him.
Really though?
They were friends.
I wonder if they still talk.
They lost touch, but are FB friends.
He's talking about his wife now.
It's getting juicy.
Not yet.
Keep listening!
