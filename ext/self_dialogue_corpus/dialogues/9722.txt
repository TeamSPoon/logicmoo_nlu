Can I borrow your copy of Malice n Wonderland? I've been on a real Snoop Dogg kick lately.
For shizzle my nizzle. haha Yeah, its not problem.
Great thank you.
No problem. You know, I just found out that Snoop is a moderator on Reddit,
Really? What sub is he on?
He's one of the mods on r/trees.
Oh, that's not surprising at all.
Apparently, he's actually really active in the Reddit community.
I didn't know that! I'm going to have to look him up.
You should. He participates in gift exchanges and everything
