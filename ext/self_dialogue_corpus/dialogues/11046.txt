Who is your favorite hockey player of all time?
It has to be The Great One - Gretzky.
Boooring! I was always a fan of Messier.
I suppose he was good. Those New York teams gave people something to be proud of when their basketball franchise struggled.
What country do you think produces the best hockey players?
Well, I am of course partial to Canada, but there have been people from all over.
Do you think we will ever see more diversity in the professional leagues?
Hard to say. Hockey is just not a sport that is played all over the world because of its tie to winter.
I suppose that's similar with a lot of winter sports.
Well, I guess if there was a Jamaican bobsled team, we could see more hockey programs sprouting up.
What do you think is more exciting, hockey or soccer?
I like both for what they are, but hockey is definitely fast paced and exciting.
Do you think the fights help with that?
Maybe a little, there is something about watching a fight that keeps some fans coming back.
I remember when I saw a minor league hockey game live, there were 5 or 6 fights.
That's funny.
I think they did it just to entertain the crowd.
And were you entertained?
Well, years later I don't remember the score at all, but I remember that.
I guess that's your answer.
