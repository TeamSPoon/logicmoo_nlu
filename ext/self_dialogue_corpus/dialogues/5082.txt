Did you catch the Mets game last night?
No, I was busy at work. How did it go?
The Mets won, 5-0. It was a complete shutout.
Yeah, the Mets have been doing really well this season.
I've actually got tickets to see one of their games next weekend.
Oh, really? What day?
Saturday. It's in the afternoon, so it should be a great game for the kids too.
That sounds like a fun family day.
Yeah, the kids are really excited. My wife, not so much, but you know how it is.
Actually, my wife is really a bigger Mets fan than I am.
Really? Have you and she gone to any games yet this season?
No, but she keeps on bugging me to go. I think she might just give up and buy tickets without me.
No, you should go too--they're really good this season, it would be fun.
Yeah, I've been really busy at work lately but it's dying down now, so I think I can make the time.
We should go together with our families sometime.
That would be fun! I'll check with my wife when we're free.
Sounds good. I'll email you a list of games so we can coordinate.
That would be great. Have fun on Saturday!
We will! See you at a game soon.
Yes, see you soon.
