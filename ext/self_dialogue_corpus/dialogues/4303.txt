Did you like Taken?
Not really.  I'm not into that kind of movie.
Oh, I loved it.  Liam Neeson was awesome in it.
I really don't care for him either.
So, I guess you didn't see the sequel.
Nope.  The first one was enough.
It really had me on edge.
I mean, I guess it was exciting, but I don't care for it.
Do you like anything else Liam Neeson is in?
I honestly couldn't tell you anything else he is in.
