Did you get home from work in time to catch the Golden State Warriors at the San Antonio Spurs game last night?
Almost, I missed the first quarter but I was able to catch the rest. What a game!
It sure was! It was pretty close the whole time.
Yeah, the Spurs struggled a little bit in the 2nd and 3rd quarters it looked like. Cost them the game in the long run.
I know. I was kind of rooting for them to pull through.
Me too! I'm usually a Dallas Mavericks fan, but I'll root for the Spurs, too.
They're playing again tomorrow night, do you think the Spurs can pull it off?
I don't know man, I sure hope so!
Me too, I think it will be tough though. Predictions are favoring the Warriors to win the series in 5 games.
You're right, it's gonna be a tough one. Even if they win, it will be pretty hard to come back and win 4 in a row.
Yeah, the Warriors are up 3-0 in the series, aren't they?
They are. They're a tough team to beat!
Durant and Curry are pretty unstoppable!
You got that right!
I just don't think the Spurs are going to pull it off, I hate to say.
Yeah, sadly I've got to agree with you. I think the Warriors are going to sweep it Monday night.
Me too. At least the Spurs still have home court advantage tomorrow.
True. Didn't help them last night though!
You're right, I guess we'll see! Want to come watch it my place?
Sure, sounds great! I'll see you there. Go Spurs!
