I love conspiracy thrillers. They're my favorite kind of movie.
Did you see Operation Avalanche? It has guys from the CIA faking the moon landing in 1967.
Yeah, I streamed it. Wonderful special effects, though the acting wasn't always top notch.
It was good enoough for me. Did you see the Manchurian Candidate?
Yes, a true popcorn movie. The Manchurian Corporation brainwashes an entire platoon in Iraq to get their guy elected vice president.
They fail, of course.
Right. If they'd succeeded, nobody would dare to make a movie about it.
Or maybe they suceeded, and made the move to make us think they failed!
Only you would think that. What about the original version?
The Manchurian Frank Sinatra? I actually liked that one better.
