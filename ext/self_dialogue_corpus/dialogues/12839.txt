Was Bobba Fett the greatest Star Wars character of all time?
Quite possibly. He was really cool looking
Yeah, what was his back story?
Well, they tried to address it in the prequels, but I didn't follow it too much
His dad was the clone for the stormtroopers
Something like that
His death was a little underwhelming
Yeah, I heard some people are trying to say he survived the sarlaac pit
How could he survive that?
Who knows. Maybe he blasted out with his rocket pack.
