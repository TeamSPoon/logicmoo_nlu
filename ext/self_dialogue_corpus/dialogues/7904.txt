Who is your favorite pop artist?
I am really enjoying the tracks drake is putting out.
Energy by drake is a great track.
That is a very catchy track and one of my favorites next to hotline bling.
He is really good in feature tracks as well, as he has a good depth of song types.
yeah, the phases of drake. I like Forever featuring Drake, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Eminem.
That is a great song as you would guess considering the artists on the track.
I think Eminem and lil' wayne had the best verses but Drake pulled the whole thing together.
I think they all had good verses including Kayne West.
I hope we get to hear more collaboration tracks with big name artists working together like Forever.
