There are a lot of great young running backs in the league.
Yeah, the position is kind of in vogue again.
Used to be a team was scared to draft a running back high.
They had a lot of busts at the position in the last 20 years or so.
Right, and a lot of money tied up in those busts.
True, but that was back when a top five pick made more than anyone on the team.
Yeah, the new salary cap rules are much better.
If you could take one running back right now to start a team, who's your workhorse?
Ezekiel Elliott, end of story.
Well, I was going to say the same thing.
Young, tons of mileage on the tires, no holes to his game.
He's probably making teams rethink their decision to draft guys in later rounds.
Yeah, his line helps, but he's got everything in place to be a MVP candidate.
How do you like Le'Veon Bell's chances?
Also tons of talent, most patient runner in the NFL.
But how does that translate to wins?
See, his line, while pretty good, just isn't the same as EE's.
I do think he's a step quicker and faster than Ezekiel.
Possibly, but he's not somebody who can grind you down.
Yeah, a real weapon in the passing game though.
