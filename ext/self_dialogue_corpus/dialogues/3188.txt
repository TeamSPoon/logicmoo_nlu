I can't wait for football season
Me either
Pre season is only like a month away
Yea, but it really means nothing
I know and the first strings only play the first quarter
Well, they do have to check out the rookies and see who is in and who is out
Yeah, it will be interesting to see who makes the cut
So, do they let some people go after the first couple games and then the rest after the next two games?
I am really not sure how that works, I do know that they have two cuts before regular season.
I knew that, I was just wondering when the cuts are.
So, now I just read, that instead of two cuts, it is now only going to be one cut.
Oh, still the same 90 to 53 all at once?
Yup, I just read that on the internet
Oh wow, I wonder why they are doing it that way now
I am not sure, it states that the rosters will be down to 53 no later than 4 pm ET on Sept 3rd. right before the regular season.
Well, those rookies are going to really have to play their butts off then
Yes they well, must be really nerve wrecking to wonder if you are going to stay or go
I bet, when they play they are sweating two fold.
Yes, I bet they are.
Well, all I can say is good luck to all the NFL rookies.
