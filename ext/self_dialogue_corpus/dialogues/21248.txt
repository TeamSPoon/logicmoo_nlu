Do you like movies
Yes I love them.
My favorite ones are all the DC hero movies.
I like captain American and thor, those were good movies
Did you see the Avengers?  Yes I like how they brought everyone together.
All the DC movies were very well thought out and they made them so you have to watch them all.
Yea, it was very smart.
What other kinds of movies do you like?
I like suicide squad.
I can't wait for the second one to come out.
I hope it's as good as the first one.
Me too, maybe joker will have a larger role in this one.
I hope so.
I was a little disappointed that his role was so small, I wanted to see more of him.
Wonder woman is coming out soon. I'm excited to see that.
I dont I now if I want to see it, I'm not sure if it will be that good.
I think it will, I hope superman is in it too.
It might be a lot more interesting if he is.
I agree with that. I'm going to see it in the theaters.
I might too now.
