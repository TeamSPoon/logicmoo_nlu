I want a movie that will change my life.
Have you ever seen Dr. Strange?
Nope. What is that movie?
It is about a surgeon who can't perform surgery anymore so he becomes a superhero.
Really? What is his power?
He is able to manipulate time and space.
That sounds far out. I want to watch this now.
You should. It will open your mind to many new concepts.
What is the best part of the movie?
The graphics. There are some scenes that are beautiful.
