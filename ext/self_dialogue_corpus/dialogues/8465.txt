how do you like the chainsmokers?
i hate them to be honest.
how come?
because they are not original and they have no substance.
they are overplayed, especially closer
i like halsey though
she has a good voice
she does, it is very sensual
yeah. she sings well
the dude from chainsmokers doesnt though
