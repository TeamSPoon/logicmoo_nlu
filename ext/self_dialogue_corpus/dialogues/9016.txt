I thought that Van Halen was good after David Lee Roth.
So did I.
Sammy Hagar can really get down.
He has a raspy voice but he can get up into those higher registers.
5150 was one of their best albums.
I wonder if they are still together.
I don't know, but you could Google it.
It would be great to see them live again.
Eddie Van Halen is probably one of the best guitarists in the world.
Without a doubt he is.
