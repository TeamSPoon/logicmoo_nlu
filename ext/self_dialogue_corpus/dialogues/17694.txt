Did you ever listen to boy bands?
Yea, every now and then.
I guess it's pretty hard to avoid them.
Yea, they are everywhere.
Who was your favorite?
Back in the day? I guess New Kids on the Block.
Yea I guess they were everyone's favorite for a while.
Do you remember Milli Vanilli?
Yea, but were they a boy band?
Yea I would say so, I mean it wasn't their talent that made them famous.
Haha yea I guess that's obviously true.
What about Vanilla Ice? Would you consider him a boy band.
Certainly not. He was more like a pop rapper.
I see. Well after New Kids I was into backstreet boys for a while.
Yea I loved backstreet boys. But I was more of an NSync person.
I always thought it was weird that people had to choose between the two.
Yea especially since they are basically both the same thing.
Exactly. It's amazing how easy it is to make people like a band.
Yea. well just look at today's boy bands.
Yep, nothing has changed.
