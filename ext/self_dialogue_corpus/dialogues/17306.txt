Hey what do you think about dub step?
I have mixed feelings about dub step honestly.
How so?
Well on one end of the spectrum I think it's terrible and on the other I think it's great.
Ok explain each side of the spectrum for me.
Ok sure. Take a dub step song by itself. It just sounds terrible most of the time.
Alright and the other?
When dub step is combines with a good song it always sounds awesome.
Ah I see so you like mashed dub step songs and not actual dub step.
Thats exactly right. I think dub step on it's own is just noise.
I feel the same way actually. I don't enjoy dub step unless it's paired with a song I like.
I just don't see the appeal if it's not paird with anything.
I agree.
I wonder if there are any individuals who feel the opposite in terms of our opinion.
I can't say anyone I know actually likes dub step.
I have a few friends that do but they are just like me.
They don't like it unless it's paired with another song?
Yeah exactly.
I can't argue with em. I've tried listening to straight dub step and I just couldn't get into it.
Yeah, it's just awful.
