One of the most silly topics of the Star Wars films is, who shot first: Han or Greedo.
I know! It is a little silly, but here we are years still, still talking about it.
That being said, I know we have both seen New Hope, many times. Do you have any thoughts on who shot first?
Call me crazy, but it actually looked like Greedo shot first! I would have to go back and watch, though.
I think you are right, honestly. I want to say the idea they were going for is they both shot at the same time, but perhaps Greedo missed?
It may have very well been a production error. I guess we will never know!
Or perhaps it was all part of George Lucas's master plan. Intentionally film it that way to keep the fans talking.
This is also a possibility that I have swung around over the years.
I remember reading the newer released version of the film, they added in a CGI head of Han Solo actually moving his neck to avoid the fire.
I heard that, too and I also heard it looks kind of silly and obviously fake.
