Do you think The Little Mermaid is good?
It is one of the all time classic Disney movies!
Really? I have to check it out.
You really should. I suggest purchasing the original from 1989.
Wow. Is it that old?
Yes, but it is a timeless classic.
I heard there is a modern version, is this true?
Yes, there is a film coming out in 2017.
Wow, I want to see the original now before watching the 2017 one.
Yes, highly recommended.
