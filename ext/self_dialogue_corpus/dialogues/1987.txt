Hey, what's the most remarkable thing about football?
I think it is how in shape all of the athletes are.
Oh yeah, they are machines.
What do you think they do for workouts?
I imagine they are not very intense because they need to save energy for the game.
Then how do they get so massive and strong.
I am not really sure, maybe it is genetic.
Well, most of them are black.
Yeah I have heard black guys are genetically better at sports.
I think it is just the way they are built.
I think that it stems from them not having much growing up.
Sports is all they can afford to do when they are little huh?
Nowdays all of the white kids have ipads and other expensive things.
Kids in the ghetto only have minimal things like a football.
Do you think it hurts the receivers hands to catch the ball?
The QB throws the ball so fast and hard. Id imagine it stings a little.
Well, they wear gloves, but still I think it hurts too.
Plus, they are running as fast as they can, the timing to catch the ball is amaing.
I think the receivers are the most talented players out on the field.
I just might have to agree with you after thinking about all of that.
