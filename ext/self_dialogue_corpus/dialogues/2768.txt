So who's the worst team in the league?
The very worst team?  I don't know, NFL is funny that way sometimes.
What do you mean?
Well, you can say a team in the preseason, but it seems like the worst teams always do a bit better.
And some good teams really shoot themselves?
Right.  All about staying healthy.
If I had to pick a team to get #1 next year, I would go with the Jets.
Yeah, they are a straight mess.
They probably have the worst stable of QB's in the league.
Who's their starter, isn't it Geno Smith?
Nah, he's on some other team now.
Oh, I remember, it's Josh McNown.
Wow, that is pretty bad.
They've drafted some guys too.  I think a few picks the last few years.
Yeah, they took the guy out of Penn State a couple years go.
Hackenburg I think.  They're hoping he can be something for them.
Whatever the case might be, that's a team in disarray.
Like I said, probably the worst team in the league.
If so, at least they'll be able to do something with the high pick.
Provided they don't blow it!
