Do you want to have a girl's night and watch some movies?
Yes, that sounds like a lot of fun!
Great, do you have any good thrillers that you could bring?
Have you ever seen The Client?
I am not sure, who is in it?
It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon.
What is it about? It is a thriller, right?
Yes it is a very tense movie. It is about a boy who accidentally witnessed a murder.
Sounds like we should watch it!
Great, I hope everyone enjoys it!
