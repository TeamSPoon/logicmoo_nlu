What movie did Kurt Russel have the eye patch in?
Escape From New York
Cool. I like his character
His name is Snake
Even cooloer
I loved that movie when I saw it.
I saw that and Blade Runner at the same time

Not really. Blade Runner is more science fiction
I like older films.
Blade Runner and Escape are both pretty old
Excellent
They both have really good themes
I bet and they were both made by great directors

Ridley Scott
Who did Escape From New York?
John Carpenter
They are both good directors
I think so too
