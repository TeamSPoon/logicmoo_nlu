I watched The Incredibles yesterday. It was a mind-blowing movie.
You didn't watch it in past?
Yes, my kid was watching it and I joined him.
Mr. Incredible was such a funny guy.
Yes, the movie kept me captivated for 2 hours.
A normal looking family turns into a superhero family. Isn't it cool?
Yes, are they planning for a sequel?
I guess that they are planning one in March 2018.
I just can't wait for it.
Yes but still a long time to go.
