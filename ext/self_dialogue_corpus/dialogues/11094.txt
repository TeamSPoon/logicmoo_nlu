Do you know what kind of sandals will be trendy this year?
Arent they all the same?
Not really.
I think they all are pronounced enough to not have a difference
They do vary sometimes you have the Roman look that is big in style.
Well lets move on thats kind of boring, sandals are sandals
OK how about hat-wear.
I think the Kentucky Derby is the only time women wear those.
I see them at the beach all the time.
Well I wont wear hats they look terrible on women
I agree, I dont know why they wear them to begin with.
Do you have any styles you wear no matter what.
I dont pay attention to the white after Labor Day rule.
I agree, I wear what I want when I want.
Men get it easy they can wear whatever they want whenever they want.
Jeans and a T Shirt will always be in
Very much so
I think that men should vary a little bit
They were wearing capris for a couple of years
I think that was Russians only
