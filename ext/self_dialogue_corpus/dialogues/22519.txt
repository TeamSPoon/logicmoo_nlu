Have you ever seen the Wizard of Oz?
Of course. Everybody has seen that.
Well, I hope people will continue watching it. It is one of the all-time classics.
I love Judy Garland!
Me too. The studio originally wanted to cast Shirley Temple. I think they made the right choice with Garland.
Oh, for sure. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of my favorite movie songs and she sang it so well.
They almost edited that song out because they movie ran long.
I can't imagine that movie without that iconic song.
I just read a book about the making of this film. It was so interesting.
I bet!
Did you know the Cowardly Lion's costume was made of real lion skin?
Ew. How horrible.
Yeah. It weighed over 100 pounds and it made the actor sweat terribly. They said the costume stank so bad.
Gross. I can't imagine weighing a 100 pound costume.
Especially under those intense lights. Remember Toto?
Of course.
Toto made more money every week than the Munchkins. .
I heard Judy Garland loved Toto.
Yes. She tried to adopt Toto but the owner would not give him up.
Yeah. I would never give my dog away.
