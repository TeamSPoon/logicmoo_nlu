Do you have a favorite Steven Spielberg movie?
Oh that's a really tough one. Do you?
I don't think I have an all-time favorite, but I do have favorites within genres.
That's the thing - Spielberg has done such a massive array of movies.
Exactly, I'm not sure any other director has done as many different types of film.
So what's your favorite Spielberg action movie?
It has to be 'Saving Private Ryan', but 'Jaws' is a close second.
I saw 'Jaws' in the theater a few years ago, and it was so much scarier in that environment.
I'd love to see it in a cinema. I saw 'Saving Private Ryan' in a cinema.
Me too, and that was quite an experience. I'll never forget it.
I've always loved the partnership with Tom Hanks, too.
Hanks is my favorite actor still working, so I couldn't agree more.
Do you have a favorite Spielberg movie with Hanks in?
Again, difficult, but 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Catch Me If You Can'.
DiCaprio was great in that movie. Did you see 'Lincoln'?
I didn't, even though I love Daniel Day-Lewis. Was it good?
I really liked it, even though it was kind of slow.
Some Spielberg movies are though - 'Schindler's List' is somewhat slow.
Such an incredible movie though.
Oh completely. The slow place makes it so much more emotional.
