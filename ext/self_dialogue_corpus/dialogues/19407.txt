I pulles out some of my old music cassettes last night.
You still have them, wow.
Just my favorites.
So which ones?
Well, I have a bunch of Judas Priest.
That's right. You loved them.
Hell Bent For Leather was one of my favorites.
Breakin' The Law was great too.
It was.
Are they still making music?
I think they just released a new one a year or so ago.
Good for them.
Rob Halford looks so different now. So old.
Well maybe because he is getting old.
He still has that great voice.
Do they still tour?
Yes.
I never got to see them.
I went a few years ago with my husband.
Glad you finally saw them.
