The Beach Boys are one of my favorite all time bands.
Would you consider them rock music?
Well, technically they are what you'd call "Bubblegum Rock" and they were still in the early years of rock music.
Anyways, what makes you like them?
Well, for one thing I like how they use their harmonies together. And they sound like they have so much fun singing together.
Like in "Barbara Ann?"
Yes, like that. They also have a fun way of singing about cars.
That's true - though some of the time I have to look up the terminology they use.
Like "pink slip" and "four on the floor"?
Yes, and "flat head mill".
