have you had a chance to see gone girl?
yes i did, it was crazy
so many twists and turns, i haven't seen an honest to goodness thriller like that in a while
totally. it was a psychological thriller!
that was pretty intense movie, not exactly something you want to watch if you wanted to unwind
no kidding, the Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) really had me on edge as the story progressed
did you find that believable though?
I mean not really, but it was still a somewhat original flick
the elaborateness of all of it is what was impressive
yes, it would have been close to impossible to pull off.
