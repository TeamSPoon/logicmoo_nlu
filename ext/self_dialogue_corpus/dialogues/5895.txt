What is your favorite Disney movie?
That's a tough one. I love them all!
Yeah, but if you HAD to pick just ONE Disney movie that is your absolute favorite, what would it be?
Hmm....... I guess I would have to say Alice in Wonderland.
That's such a great movie! What do you like about it specifically?
I just like the whole story line. It's so interesting and most of it makes no sense and that's what I love about it!
Any favorite characters?
I love The Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. What's your favorite Disney movie if YOU had to pick?
Don't make me choose. I love them all too! I guess I would have to say The Sword in the Stone.
That's another one of my favorites too! Great choice.
