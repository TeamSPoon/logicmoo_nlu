I really want to watch some good mermaid movies this summer, but I can't think of any.
Well, there's Splash. It's from the 80's but it's pretty good.
Splash? Didn't that have Tom Hanks in it?
Yes, Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah.
I forgot about Daryl Hannah! She was really beautiful.
She was. And in Splash she's a mermaid who falls in love with a human man, Tom Hanks.
Well of course Tom Hanks. Splash definitely goes on the list, what else?
What about Aquamarine. It's more geared to kids, but it's really cute and does have a mermaid.
I haven't seen that one.
It's based, loosely, on a short story by Ann Hoffman. A mermaid is washed ashore during a storm and befriends two teenage girls.
That's sounds pretty cute.
It really is! The two girls are best friends, but one is moving away and the mermaid falls in love with the lifeguard at the beach.
Ok, well that's two mermaid movies. Why aren't there more mermaid movies?
I don't know. I think you should add Deeply starring Kirsten Dunst to the list.
I don't think I've ever heard of that one.
It's definitely more obscure, and not exactly a mermaid story, but it is about an island cursed since the time of the Vikings.
Ooh, that actually sounds pretty good.
Kirsten Dunst plays a teenager sent to this island to grieve the sudden death of her boyfriend when she hears the story of a girl named Silly and the curse that island has been under forever.
Even if it's not technically a mermaid movie, it sounds like something that would be great to watch with mermaid movies.
Exactly, now all you need is some movie snacks. Maybe some seaweed?
