Do you like pop music?
Not really
What about classical?
Yes. I love Mozzart
I enjoy classical music without singing.
Yes. I do too.
A good composition is hard to come by
Do you like any new music?
No. I like 90's music and anything older than that.
So, Bob Dylan is good to you?
Yes. He is a great artist.
I don't like the newer stuff too.
The older stuff has better melodies.
That is true
The Beatles are probably one of the best and and they were in the 70's
I agree. The best music is from the 70's
I am not sure about that
What do you think?
The 50's is the best decade for music
There were some great artists back then.
