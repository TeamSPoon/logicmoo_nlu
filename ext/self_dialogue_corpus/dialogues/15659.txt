Do you like classical music?
I love classical, especially Mozart.
I think Mozart had too much going on in his music.
Too many notes like they say in Amadeus?
Yes. His music is all over the place with note structures.
What do you think about Beethoven?
Beethoven was the greatest of all the classical composers!
Wow that's quite a statement. Why do you feel that way about Beethoven?
I think he was the most original when it came to his compositions.  He was like the Heavy Metal composer of Classical music.
Like heavy like Metalica or more like Megadeath?
I think both of those bands are nothing in comparison to Beethoven.
So what makes you say Beethoven was like a Metal Musician?
His music was just really strong and powerfully composed.  It has a driving beat that makes you want to bang your head along with the conductor!
I've never banged my head to classical music.
You should try it, while listening to Beethoven's Ode To Joy!
I bet that would be fun.
It's a great song, and beautifully composed.
True, but I wouldn't say it's like Heavy metal.
What would you compare it to then?
Ode to Joy by Beethoven is more like a Rock Opera written by Pink Floyd. It has a lot of layers.
