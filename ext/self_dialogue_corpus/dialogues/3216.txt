The 80s was definitely the best year for horror. They gave us iconic slasher villains like Freddie Krueger and Jason Voorhees!
I'd have to disagree. I'm more partial to the Alfred Hitchcock era, he was a true master of suspense.
I've never really heard too much about Hitchcock, but I've seen The Birds. Black and white movies aren't my thing though.
I highly recommend you check more of his movies out! Without Hitchcock, the horror genre would never be the same.
What kind of films would you suggest to me? Obviously I've seen The Birds already!
There are so many out there! A few of my personal recommendations include Psycho, Dial M for Murder, and The Man Who Knew Too Much.
Sounds good! Are there color versions of any of these films? Black and white is quite dull on the eyes.
Some of the best movies ever made have been in black and white, but I'm sure there are some remastered colored versions out there, if that floats your boat.
I see what you're getting out, I'll check some of those movies out. Any newer horror movies you looking forward too?
None really, I feel that newer horror movies are too clich√© and rely too heavily on overused jump scares.
