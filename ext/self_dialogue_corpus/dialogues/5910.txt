Okay, what was you're favorite Disney movie growing up?
Alright slow down, are we talking Disney Channel Original Movies or you know, the classics like Cinderella.
Ha, well let's say any Disney movie.
Wow this is a lot. For some reason 101 Dalmations is really standing out the me.
Oh for sure, that's a classic! But I'll admit I preferred the live action one to the animated flick.
That's how it seems to go these days. Well what was your favorite?
That's easy -- A Goofy Movie.
I completely forgot about A Goofy Movie! Remember when that guy had this break with reality or something.
Yes I remember it well! "Why are we always wearing these gloves all the time?"
Haha that shattered my world watching that as a little kid. I was like, why DO they where gloves all the time?
