How do you feel about deflategate? Did Tom Brady really do it?
Yes. Tom Brady did engage in deflate gate. He is trying to make up for getting older. He is 39 and competing with guys way younger.
Who is your favorite football team? Mine is the Lions?
Mine is the buffalo bills. I know only a sadomasachist would like them because both always lose.
Are the Lions going to make it past game one of the playoffs ever?
No. They never will in a million lifetimes. The thought of uplifting Detroit is impossible.
What was your favorite team of all time?
I would have to say that would be the Chicago Bears back when they went to the super bowl. They used to have a song that was cool.
Who is your favorite quarterback of all time.
It has to be Jim Kelly because he was my neighbor when I lived in buffalo. I used to toilet paper his house when I was 12.
Who is your least favorite quarter back?
Of course Tom Brady for being arrogant. Him and his wife appear to be complete narcissists.
I read that the Detroit Lions will beat the Green Bay Packers this year online.
That is a delusional fantasy. That will never happen in a million years.
What is your opinion about Matthew Stafford?
This is why the Lions never go beyond the 1st game of the playoffs. That and their inability to keep a coach.
Who is your favorite Lions player in 2017?
Of course Marvin Jones the only good one on the entire team.
Who is your favorite Buffalo Bills player?
They are just going to lose the entire season so not worth even mentioning.
