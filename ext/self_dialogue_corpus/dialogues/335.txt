What do you think of Green Lantern?
That movie was horrible.
Yes, most Marvel movies were better than Green Lantern.
Most Marvel movies are better than DC movies.
Except for Suicide Squad.
I really liked the Joker in that.
He was almost as good a joker as Heath Ledger.
Dark Knight rises will never be beat.
Batman was great in Dark Knight rises too.
I really like some of the old Batman portrayals as well, but Christian Bane's is by far the best, I agree.
