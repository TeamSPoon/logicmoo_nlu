Peter Pan is one of best Disney films.
Oh, I saw the new live action movie the other day.
I think it's one of those Disney movies that translates well to a more adult movie. Like Cinderella.
Yeah, I think it would be hard to adapt Bambi to attract a more adult audience.
Oh don't get me started on Bambi. I don't feel like crying today.
You mean when mom dies?
Yes, when the mom dies. Okay?
Don't think about the mom. You should think about Thumper.
Oh, I adore Thumper.
Eating greens is a special treat, It makes long ears and great big feet. But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
