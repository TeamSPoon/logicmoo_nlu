Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I grew up listening to the Beatles.
How old were you when you first heard them?
I was four years old.
That's really young.
Meet the Beatles had just been released and my older sister had a copy of it.
What's the first song you remember?
I Want to Hold Your Hand was the first one, I think.
Did you ever see them perform?
I saw them on Ed Sulivan, and later on the Smothers Brothers show.
