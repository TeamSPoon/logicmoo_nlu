Did they high school have their last ball game last night?
Yeah, I can't believe you missed it!
Yeah, I totally forgot about it.  How did they do?
We won.  By two points in the last inning.
In the last inning?  Was it tied until then?
Yeah, neither team had scored since the fifth.  We had been tied 4-4 for half the game.
Wow, so what happened?
Well, the other team had used their pitcher all game, and I guess he was worn out.
Oh, so that must have screwed them up.
Well, it ended up costed them the game.
Oh, what happened?
Well, first he threw a ball and beaned the batter.
Oh, that sucks.  Why didn't they take him out then?
I don't know, but then he walked the next batter.
So there were two guys on base?
Right.  Well, the pitcher lucked up and managed to strike out the next batter.
But there were still two on base with only one out, right?
Exactly.  They could have still switched him out.
But they didn't.
Nope.  And the next guy hit in both runners.
