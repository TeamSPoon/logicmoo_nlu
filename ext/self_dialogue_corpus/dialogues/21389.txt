I'm really looking forward to the new Dark Tower movie.
I don't know much about it.
Did you ever read the Dark Tower series by Stephen King?
No, I hadn't. I'm surprised they haven't already made a movie out of it if it's a Stephen King book, all the others become movies!
Haha, this might be the last one that wasn't a movie yet.
I've found Stephen King adaptation movies to be a mixed bag.
Agreed. I think Dark Tower could be cool, though.
What's it about?
It's about a mystical desert land, and a gunslinger who is chasing an evil sorcerer.
Whoa, sounds like a genre clash! You don't usually get guns and magic in the same movie.
Yeah, the world is kind of unique.
Who plays the gunslinger and the sorcerer?
I'm not sure who plays the sorcerer, but Idris Elba plays the gunslinger. And he's awesome!
Yeah, Elba is pretty cool. I liked him in Luther.
And the Wire!
Yep. I heard they might make him the next James Bond.
I could see it. But for now, he's Roland, the gunslinger.
I'd probably go see this Dark Tower movie. I like Elba.
Do you want to go see it when it comes out?
Sure, I'm up for it.
