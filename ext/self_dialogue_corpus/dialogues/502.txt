Let's talk about the NFL.
Okay sounds good to me!
What team is your favorite?
Chicago Bears.
Mine too!
What player is your favorite?
Eddie Jackson.
Oh mine is Jordan Morgan.
Oh interesting.
Yeah I always make sure I go to games when I can.
Oh lucky, I wish I could go to some.
I used to just watch on tv but now I go to them.
We will have to go together sometime.
I agree.
I also want to go to the next super bowl game.
Me too!
Let's make a plan to go.
Sounds great.
