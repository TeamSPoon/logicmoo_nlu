You know what else is gonna be a great movie about Russia?
Yep. I do.
What?
You first.
Ok I think it will be a great movie to see how the Soviets collapsed.
We already have a ton of movie about that. They're called documentaries.
Well, I haven't seen any.
Well, that doesn't surprise me.
ok what's your idea?
Life and death of the last Tsar family.
They already made that. It's called Romanov's.
Yeah I know, but I want it to be an English epic saga. Based on facts until the executions, every action recreated. And the burial and the finding of their bones in... when was that?
2015. They found the bones belonging to the Alexei and Maria. Those were the missing bodies.
That's just so sad.
Even the Russian government tried to give them a proper burial, which they did in 1991. But they just couldn't find these two bodies.
That's even sadder.
No kidding.
But in the end, all family members that's been murdered are buried together?
Um, i think so.
We should go watch that movie. The Romanovs. It's in Russian. We have to read the subtitles. I love to read at the movies.
