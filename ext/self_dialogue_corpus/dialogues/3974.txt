Did you ever see that movie Misery?
About the author?
Yeah, based on a Stephen King movie, had Kathy Bates.
I remember it quite well.
That scene with the blocks and the hammer just frightens me.
Oh geez, that's the worst part of the movie.
It gives me chills everytime I see it in the wrong way.
It's one of the more punishing things I've ever seen in film.
Quite frankly, it gives me pause to ever being an author.
Or having a caretaker that's a complete psycho.
