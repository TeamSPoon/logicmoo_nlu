What do you think about superhero movies?
I like them tremendously.
What are some of your favorites?
Let`s break them up by Marvel and DC ok?
Ok, so first who has the better superhero movies Marvel or DC?
A tricky question.
How so?
Marvel all around has the best superheroes movies,but DC has the best super movie.
Care to explain?
Sure. On average the Marvel movies are better,but DC has the best movie with The:Dark Knight.
Yes, I can see what you are getting it.
Overall the the average Marvel movie is better than the average DC movie,but DC hit a homerun with  The:Dark Knight.
Yes, didn't the late Heath Ledger win an Oscar for his portrayal as the Joker?
Correct he won Oscar for best supporting actor.
I loved  The:Dark Knight not only for Heath Ledger,but Christian Bale as Batman as well.
Yes,Bale as Batman is as good as it gets for a superhero being realistic.
One thing though about the Marvel movies is though they are not as realistic you can take your whole family to them to enjoy.
That`s the secret of the Marvel movies family fun, and that is why they overall win out over DC.
Yep,the DC movies like Suicide Squad come off very dark.
Agreed, and that is why Marvel wins in the end!
