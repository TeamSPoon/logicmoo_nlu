Remember the original Star Wars?
Yep, a New Hope, totally revolutionized the film industry.
Yeah, it's amazing that it's still relevant today.
I know what you mean.  Things are out of fashion in five minutes now.
But Star Wars holds up.  My daughter and I watched it together recently.
Oh yeah?  How did she like it?
She loved it.  Which is awesome, my dad shared with me, I shared with her.
Yeah, truly cross generational.
It's interesting to see that first movie and how everyone develops.
Especially Luke, so whiny in the first one but awesome by the third.
