Have you seen that Cars 3 is coming out??
Yes! My son is so excited for it to start!
Mine too! It's all he can talk about.
I'm a little worried though. He's still young and Cars 2 wasn't that great.
True, I haven't let mine see 2 yet, but the reviews for 3 are great!
I've seen that too!
Do you want to go together when it comes out?
Sure!  When does it release?
3 days from now.
Ok, want to go on Saturday?
