How did your brother do in his ball game last night?
Well, it actually almost got rained out.
Oh, I forgot that the weather was a mess.
Yeah, but they ended up being able to play.
Yuck.  I bet the field was nasty as heck.
Yep.  Those boys didn't care though.  They got as filthy as could be.
I remember those days.  Just playing in the mud.
Yeah, we had to hose off the guys before they left.  No one wanted them in their vehicles.
No kidding.  So how did they do?
It was a close game.  They got ahead and pulled it off though.  Score was 9-7.
Wow, must have been a hitter's game, huh?
Pretty much.  Mud made the defense hard.
I could understand that.  How'd your brother do?
He went 2 for 3 and had a walk.
Not bad at all.  Where'd he play?
He was third base last night.  Saw a good bit of hits, but like I said, the mud.
Eh, so he wasn't able to make all the plays.
Not all of them.  He actually lost his shoe in the mud once!
That's funny!  I wish I had been there!
Oh, you definately would have loved it.
