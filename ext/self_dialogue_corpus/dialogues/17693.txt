I have a soft spot for the Beach Boys.
You are not the only one. I had bought all their cassette tapes in high school.
I remember forcing my parents take me to see that at an amusement park when I was 16.
Oh my gosh I know what you are talking about. I saw them that year too.
I thought Mike Love was a little weird.
I know with all his strange behavior.
But he ended up being the most normal maybe.
I think Kokomo brought them back into people's minds in the late 80's.
Sure but I love the original beachy music.
California Girls is a classic.
So is Help Me Rhonda.
Help me Rhonda, help, help, me Rhonda.
The music was so catchy.
Great songs and they were so short.
Sometimes I think the best songs are the ones that draw you in and are short.
They have to be really good if you like them and they are like a minute and a half long.
Sure like Surfin' USA.
Or Surfin' Safari. I don't think those are long at all.
Their harmonies are hard to duplicate.
They were a talented group of men.
