Do you feel like listening to some music tonight?
Only if you want to listen to a bunch of country!
You have always loved country music!
I know, do you still love R & B and hip hop?
Yea, I am listening to some Usher songs right now.
You have liked him for as far back as I can remember.
I got hooked when I heard that song U Got It Bad!
That song was released a long time ago! What year did that come out exactly?
I think it was around 2001, I was a sophomore in high school at the time.
That is around the time that I was thinking.
I just love his music so much!
Which songs do you enjoy the most?
I love that song Burn, as well as DJ Got Us Fallin In Love.
I do not think I have heard either of those before.
You should give them a try, you could become a big fan yourself!
I think I will stick with my Conway Twitty and Waylon Jennings.
Hey I actually really enjoy one song from Waylon Jennings.
I am surprised! Which one would that be?
It is one my grandpa used to listen to called Mama's Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys.
That is my all time favorite song! It is a classic to say the least.
