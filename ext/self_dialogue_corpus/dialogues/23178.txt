You know what one of the greatest Christmas movies is?  A Christmas Story.
I think I saw it a long time ago, but don't remember much about it.
You should check out again.  It's memorable.
In your opinion, what makes it memorable.
Mainly the story, because it's so unique.
What's the storyline?
It's about a boy who wants a BB gun for Christmas, but his mom has told him it's too dangerous.
Is it a comedy?
Yes, it's a comedy, but there are so dramatic moments, too.  It's extremely funny, though.
Who's in it?
Peter Billingsley plays the boy, but Darren McGavin is so funny as his father.
What is the father character like?
He is pretty sarcastic and grumpy, but he's nice deep down.
That sounds like a good layered character.
The film is set in the '40s which makes it fun.  You get to see all the old looking toys.
I'd definitely like that.  I  like toys from back then.
The direction is pretty good, too.  The first time I saw it, I was never bored with the direction.
That's an important thing for a film.
It really is a great classic Christmas film with a lot of heart.
You've convinced me.  It sounds like a unique one.
