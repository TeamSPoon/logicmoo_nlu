What is your favorite Horror movie franchise or one that's always stoodout to you?
The Nightmare on Elm Street movies were always great to me, how about you?
To be honest, that was going to be my response as well! What was your favorite movie from the series?
I don't think you are going to top the original. That was great stuff.
Agreed. I feel the first and third were by far, the best.
Those were before Freddy Krueger became a bit more silly and he was still a very scary force.
I always felt the third movie was a good blend of dark humor and horror.
Definitely. That was where the one-liners were first introduced, but not necessarily being over-done at that point.
Agreed. At the end of the day, Freddy Krueger is one of the greatest horror icons ever.
For sure. Robert Englund is the only man who can play that character, in my opinion.
