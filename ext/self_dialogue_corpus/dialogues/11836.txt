What do you think of the White Album?
It's perfect.
Really? I don't like it.
Are you nuts?
It has too many songs.
But they're all good.
No they aren't. They could've left off a few.
But then it wouldn't be the White Album.
I just find myself skipping a lot of songs.
I love them all and so do most people.
