How do you feel about movies that were based on books?
What are some examples?
Like, Pride and Prejudice is a movie based on a book by Jane Austen.
I think they're okay. It helps if I've read the book before seeing the movie, though.
Yeah, that's true. Sometimes it doesn't matter, though.
What do you mean?
Well, sometimes I see a movie and then find out after the fact that it was a book. So the fact that it was a book first didn't impact my viewing experience.
Which movie was that?
Coraline. It's this stop-action movie that's based on a book by Neil Gaiman.
It wasn't hard to understand?
No. The story was super original and fun.
Nice. With something like Pride and Prejudice, though, I feel like I'd struggle.
Why do you think that?
Well, there's a lot they have to cut from the book to make it into a movie, right?
Sure. You can't get everything in the movie.
So, like, I'll be missing a bunch of information that people who have read the book would catch onto.
Yeah that makes sense. Pride and Prejudice is a much longer book than Coraline, so there's probably more story missing.
Exactly. So I tend to avoid those kinds of movies.
That's too bad. It seems like every book is being made into a movie these days.
I know, right? You go to Barnes and Noble and every book says something about how it's the basis for some upcoming motion picture.
