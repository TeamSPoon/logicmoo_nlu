Did you enjoy the Force Awakens.
I did, made me cry though.
Oh, when Han died?
Yes, the whole scene. Him meeting his son again.
And then boom, he died. It was really anticlimatic.
I think that was the point. That death was easy for Kylo Ren, even patricide.
I cried when the Wookie wailed.
Chewie? That was the saddest part, he did not want to leave his friend.
I was sad Rey did not get to know him better, she admired him.
I was glad she did a little bit, she got to meet and know him.
