What have you thought of the NHL playoffs thus far?
Amazing! The Penguins have been playing great.
That's good to hear, even though I don't like the Penguins.
I know you don't! Sorry for the Penguins beat down of the Blue Jackets.
It's ok.  I really do like where they are going.
You are right and they should continue to get better and better.
I am hopeful.  This is the first time they have actually looked good and are going places.
Yah I agree.  Only took them fifteen years.
You're right and the trend should continue.  Are you worried about the Penguins loss last night though?
I kinda am, but I think it was just a hangover game for them.
I would agree with that.  That was a wild and hard fought series against Washington.
Always great to see Washington lose, but the Penguins are certainly banged up.
They are banged up, but they aren't missing anyone too big besides Letang.
You are right and last night we could have used Letang big time.
Letang might be one of the best defense men in the leauge.
He certainly is and can score on whim.
I would expect them to bounce back tomorrow though.
Me too and I love how Fleury is playing in goal right now.
Oh he's been amazing.  I bet you're glad he wasn't traded.
Extremely.  Their GM is looking pretty good right about now.
