What is your favorite Lady Gaga album?
I know it's new, but I love Joanne.
Why is that?
She still maintains her awesome vocal prowess, but has stepped back a bit with the crazy.
Yeah, she's an actual person now.
What do you mean? That's not nice.
Before she was an image, or an act. Now she's a person.
Sort of. But yeah, this album is very personal, very stripped-down.
Is "The cure" on it?
No, that's an independent song.
