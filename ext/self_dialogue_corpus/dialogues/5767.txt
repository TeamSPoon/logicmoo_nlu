Did you ever see the remake of Fantasia?
No, but I've rewatched the original recently.
Did your kids like it?
I think they were kind of bored.
Really?
Yeah, kids today are used to too much talking and action.
I see what you mean.
I wonder if they would have liked the remake.
My kids were okay with it.
I might have to get a copy of that one.
