i also dig cooper 's outfit
oh really,i thought it was too colorful for a guy like cooper.
i wouldn't think so,as the jacket had patches of black
true though.
do you think will smith was too casual ?
oh not at all, i just felt he wanted to keep it simple and just do the white long sleeve and black pant,
i felt its a terrible way to dress for an event like the oscar.
that's how you see it,but what you'd call casual is well worth $6000
nah it can be that expensive,i would say $2000
oh no way,do you think will smith will rock a sleeve,black pant,a Paul smith shoe and Hermes belt for a piety $2000,it should be way more than that.
if what will smith wore you think would cost $6000 then what would you say of Daniel Craig who was just so stunning and stole the red carpet.
oyeah Daniel was actually the man on the red carpet , that jacket was way too cool,his stylist must have put a great deal in making him look that way.
stylist?i heard he styles himself.
if he does then he could make some extra more money being a stylist.lol
oyeah. so about the purse you want to buy which have you decided to purchase.
am still  indecisive
why don't you check out the CHANNEL  purse Jenifer Lawrence had on for the Oscars i think it was lovely
yeah i love that purse jenny had, would have been a good choice but then i reckon it would be  too expensive.
true though but you should check for the price first as CHANNEL purses are not that all expensive
OK i would check to see if i can afford it.
