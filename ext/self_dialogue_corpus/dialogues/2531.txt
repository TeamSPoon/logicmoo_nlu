Hey do you know when the Steelers first game is?
Let me look it up.
Awsome.
Yes it is September 10 at 12:00.
Does it say who they play?
Yes Cleveland Browns.
That should be an easy win for us.
I hope but i have seen them struggle before.
I hope not it would be awful if we lost our first game to the Browns.
I know it rarely happens.
I remember when the mayor of Pittsburgh and Cleveland would bet something for the games as a kind of riverly.
I remember that it was a fun thing to do.
Is the game at home or Cleveland?
It looks like its at home.
When is the next game
It is September 17 against the Vikings and it is also at noon.
I would like to go see the Pittsburgh Cleveland game.
Maybe we could go up for the weekend.
Yes a weekend vacation for us girls.
Good lets start getting things in order.
