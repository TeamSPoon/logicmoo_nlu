They're doing another Friday movie.
No kidding.
Seriously. Ice Cube confirmed it last night.
That's the best news I've heard all day. Is Chris Tucker in it?
I don't know. Ice Cube didn't go into any details.
If Tucker's not reprising his role as Smokey, then I'm not going to get too excited.
I know, right? The last few Fridays weren't as good as the original.
Tucker made that movie. Can you imagine it being as popular without him?
Nope. But don't get your hopes up on him returning.
Why not?
I heard he was looking for more serious roles and not comedy.
Is that why we haven't seen him in a movie since Rush Hour?
I think so. He still does stand up comedy, though.
Sounds like Chris has been typecasted.
If that's true he may as well return for another Friday movie. He needs the work.
What's the name of the new movie?
Last Friday.
Sounds final.
It will be for me if Chris isn't in it.
I heard that.
