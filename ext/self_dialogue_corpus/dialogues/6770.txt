I miss old-school Disney animation.
I can see that. Which do you mean?
Stuff like The Little Mermaid or 101 Dalmatians.
You're right. No cartoon films look like that anymore.
I like their 3D stuff, but I just miss the classics.
There is something to be said for appreciating the old way of doing something.
I can't even remember the last time I saw an animated film that wasn't all 3D.
Even the ones I have seen look like they were all done with computers.
I miss that hand-wrought style of the 80s and 90s.
I wonder if Disney will ever go back to it!
