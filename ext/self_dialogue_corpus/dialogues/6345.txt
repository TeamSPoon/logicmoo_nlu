Are you looking forward to watching Spider-Man: Homecoming?
Absolutely! I really like the addition of spider-man to the marvel universe!
Right?! I can't wait to see Spidey fighting side-by-side with Iron-Man!
There could not have been a better choice for Iron-Man than Robert Downey Jr.
I'm very curious as to how Spider-man will influence the rest of the Marvel movies.
Not to mention the roster of exciting villains that Spider-man will also add.
Speaking of Villains who is the main villain this time?
The Vulture! He is a lesser known villain,but I'm sure Michael Keaton will make the character shine.
Sounds so exciting! Did you get your tickets already?
Tickets and some souvenirs.
