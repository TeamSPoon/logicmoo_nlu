Hey have you ever heard of chiptune music?
Chiptune? Isn't that like electronic?
Yeah they're fairly similar.
What's different about chiptune?
Well it's called chiptune because the sounds are based on old arcade machine sounds, like computer chips.
Oh, that's interesting.
Yeah, think of classic Nintendo games.
Ok, I think I have a better idea of what do expect.
Sometimes you hear stuff that sounds exactly like a video game, but sometimes you hear some modern sounds mixed in too.
What are some good chiptune artists?
Dubmood is probably my favorite.
What do you like by them?
Most everything, certain albums have different flavors of chiptune though.
What would you say the different flavors are?
You have like traditional chiptune, which sounds like a video game and is mainly like the older sounds. Then you have newer stuff which is probably more electronic that chiptune.
Which do you like?
I like both, but the modern stuff is especially cool to listen too. It can be really calming.
Is all of it calming?
No some chiptune can sound like rave music, which can even get scary aggressive.
Wow, that's very cool. I'll give it a listen.
