Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?
Yes, somewhat who do you think will win it all?
I like the cavaliers chances a lot, with lebron its just hard to count them out.
Yes thats true, but the warriors may have even more power seeing that they just added kevin durant.
Yea, true that was a crazy move by them they have like three stars now it's crazy.
That's true it seems like lebron is better at getting his group motivated.
True, I believe the warriors gelled pretty well though seeing that they made it to the playoffs.
I think they did as well but we are yet to see how they can come together on a big stage.
Yea thats true, also lebron has most of the people he won a championship with back for this run.
Yes, and they all have experience with winning the championship so I believe it will be less nerves.
That is true, Steph has a lot of experience with this too as well as his teammates.
Yea, but kevin durant has not even been to a championship before so how do you think he will fair?
I didn't think about that, he has usually choked in the playoffs so hopefully he can get it together.
I don't think he will, I believe if they do win it all he will have to get carried by the team.
I hope not, that would be a big embarrassment, I believe he will be able to turn it on if it came down to it.
Maybe he will, Draymond Green does hold him accountable they have been seen getting into arguements on the sideline.
Oh yea! I saw that, yea he is not having it this looks like it will be a good championship if they are both in it.
Definitely, I can't wait how many games do you think it will go to?
It would be very surprising if its a sweep, I see it going seven games.
Yea, I hope it does I know I will not want it to end.
