How long has it been since you're seen the movie Aladdin?
Much too long.
I watched it again recently in remembrance of Robin Williams.
Oh yeah, he played Genie didn't he?
Yep, one of my favorite characters.
I think my favorite character had to be Jafar.
Why Jafar? He's a bit of a creep.
Imagine having that amount of magic! Obviously I'd use it for good and not to get young princesses to marry me.
You better not!
Cross my heart.
