Who do you think is the best running back in the NFL?
Adrian Peterson!
This isn't 2012, man. AP is pretty old.
True.
How about Ezekiel Elliot?
He had a great rookie season last year.
Yeah, he was electric.
I'd be a little nervous about saying a 2nd year player is the best in the league, though.
The position is a young man's position, though.
I agree with that. But what about the Cowboys' offensive line?
True, they are really good.
It makes a lot of players look good, running behind a line like that.
So if not Elliot, then who?
What about Jordan Howard?
Of the Bears?
Yeah. Another second year player.
He was a nice surprise, but I think Elliot is the clearly superior talent.
Jordan Howard had nothing going for him, though. The Bears offense was basically just him.
He was pretty much their only weapon, true.
I give a player a lot of credit for that.
