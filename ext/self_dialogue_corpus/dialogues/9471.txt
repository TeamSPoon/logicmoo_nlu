Did you hear Lupe Fiasco's newest cd?
No, when did that come out?  He's not one of my favorite rappers so I don't really keep up with him.
It came out this February.  It's called Drogas Light.
Is it any good?
I liked it.  The song Promise was definitely the best I thought.  I heard the album was a lot of old songs he had written and reworked.
So its not really new stuff?
Apparently only a few songs are new, the rest were stuff he had thought of previously but didn't really get around to recording.
That's kind of lame.  I thought his best album was Lasers so far.
That one was good but I thought only one or two songs were really worthy of being singles.
My favorite was The Show Goes On.  That one was all over the radio.
