Who do you think is the greatest artist of all time?
Obviously Beyonce
Beyonce is great and is probably the best artist out now, but I wouldn't say she is the greatest of all time. At least not yet.
Who is better?
Michael Jackson, for one.
True! I forgot to think back in time to people who have already passed away
Well, I did say of all time, not just of our generation
In that case, I'm going to say Bob Marley was the greatest of all time.
Even better than Michael Jackson?
Let's put it this way - who is more widely known across the world. Bob or MJ?
That's a tough question. I want to say Michael Jackson.
I was recently in Indonesia on vacation, and I was suprised to see Tshirts selling all over Indonesia with Bob Marley's face on it.
Did they know any of his songs?
They knew more than you would expect. Music really connects people
That reminds me of a time I was in Mozambique and they apparently love Madonna there.
Madonna hasn't had any new music in ages though
They don't care! The radio kept playing all of her old music.
That's so random.
A local told me the obsession started when she had two concerts there. No other mega artist had concerts there in the 1980s except her
Oh, that explains it. Sort of..
