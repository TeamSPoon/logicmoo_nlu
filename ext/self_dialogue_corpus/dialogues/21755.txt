Have you seen the movie The Incredibles?
Yes, it was amazing!  I actually own that movie.
So do I!  I watch it every couple of years with my family.
Me too.  Our kids loved it too.
Yeah, it's totally hilarious.  The characters are just great.
I know!  I wish they'd make a sequel.
Who knows, maybe they will?
I think it was a movie that we could all relate too.  My husband and I loved it as well as our kids.
Well it was just so funny!  When did that movie come out?
I don't know, it was sometime back around 2005 or so I think.
Yeah, I think you're right.  My youngest was a toddler when we first watched it.
I swear, even our toddler enjoyed it.
Yeah, well it has that cute baby in it!
Yeah it does, I had forgotten that!  I like to think that my husband and I are like Mr. and Mrs. Incredible.
That's funny!  What if there really were superheros amongst us?
Yeah, well you never know.
Either way it was a great idea.  I wonder who made that movie?
Wasn't it a Pixar movie?
I don't know, I think you're right.  It had some funny shorts in the beginning that I think were Pixar.
Yeah, they seem to produce a lot of the best animated movies.
