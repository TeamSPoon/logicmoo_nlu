my eagles will have a rough go of it this season.
they have a rough go every season.
naw not really.
yeah, really. they shouldn't have gotten rid of chip kelly.
man chip kelly wasn't the savior.
dude, two winning seasons in three years. and y'all let him go.
i think he had a problem with the owners.
that's because he wanted to be coach and general manager. this ain't college.
chip kelly ain't n f l material.
exactly. but anyway, what does the eagles' schedule look like?
they got the chiefs, seattle, the rams, the raiders.
man, that does seem like a tough stretch. but y'all can beat the rams.
i know right. but then we still have the division foes.
well at least you know the giants and washington won't do much.
you never know. i never count the giants out.
yeah, eli manning is a beast.
somewhat. and i do think kirk cousins might have shot his load.
yeah. the skins was good like two seasons ago.
they won that division didn't they?
i think so.
