Hi there.
Hey what's up.
Not much.
Cool.
Are you into rap at all?
Yeah I listen to a lot of rap.
Who's your favorite rapper right now?
It usually goes between a lot of people, but right now it's Kendrick Lamar.
I hear people talk about him a lot, but I haven't listened to him.
You should listen to some of his songs, great lyricist.
