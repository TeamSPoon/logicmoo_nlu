Did you watch The Happening?
That movie kind of freaked me out!
It was pretty good right?
Yeah, I didn't know what was going on.  M. Night Shyamalan is good.
Yeah, his movies are pretty good.
Were you able to sleep after watching it?
Oh, sure.  I was more aware of my surroundings though.
I know!  I felt like the plants were watching me!
Exactly!  I felt like that for like two weeks.
I feel the same way.
