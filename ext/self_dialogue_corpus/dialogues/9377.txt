Do you ever listen to rap music at all?
Sometimes I do. Depends on my mood.
You're right. Sometimes I'm in the mood for other music myself.
Who's your favorite artist when you do listen to rap music?
I'm not exactly sure but I do love but I do like Jay Z a little bit.
Yea I like him too! Good rapper.
Which of his songs do you like the best?
I think "99 problems" is one of the ones I like best. It's a pretty great song.
I know that one! It's pretty good.
I like "Dirt off Your Shoulder" also.
