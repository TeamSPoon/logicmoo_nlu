Have you seen the latest Aliens movie, yet?
Alien Covenant? No not yet, have you?
I saw it last weekend.
What did you think?
Meh. A waste of my time and money.
Another failed Alien attempt, I take it.
It's not a complete failure, but there's something sadly inevitable about Alien: Covenant. It feels more like an exercise than it does a movie.
That's not good and not a surprise. The commercials didn't make it out to be very interesting to me anyway.
It's an  awkward marriage between intellectual exercise and suspenseful creature feature.
Yikes. Brutal.
It's not as good as the original.
Neither was the last one. You'd think they would learn from past mistakes.
They haven't so far.
Yeah the franchise took a backslide with the undercooked Prometheus and now this failure.
It's like Hollywood does not know how to write a good story anymore.
You'd think, for a franchise known for things bursting out of people's chests, that this movie would be worth talking about.
It isn't?
This one will barely elevate your heart rate.
These films have run out of ideas.
In space, no one can hear you yawn.
