Hey did you see the titanic 2 movie trailer?
What? Titanic 2? How can there be Titanic 2? didn't the titanic sink in first movie?
Yes, I was also surprised when I heard it for the first time.
So are you serious that there is titanic 2 coming?
I am not sure but I definitely see the trailer of titanic 2 and it was not fan made?
Oh, so did you get any idea about story of titanic 2 from the trailer?
Well, all I can see is that jack is coming back.
What? seriously? Didn't he die in last movie?
Yes, but it seems they are bringing him back. It seems like its going to be a love story between returned jack and rose.
That sounds so absurd! I feel that this whole titanic 2 is a really bad idea.
I agree, I hope the producer and director is not stupid enough to actually make titanic 2.
Well, they did make trailer of titanic 2, which means they are giving it a serious thought.
That would be really foolish if they do actually make titanic 2.
I don't know what's going on with directors and producers these days.
I still can't believe they are actually thinking about making titanic 2!!
okay, too much about titanic 2. Let's talk about something else.
Yes. so any new love story in theater?
As far as I know there isn't any going on in theater right now.
That's strange. Let me guess, Is the theater flooded by superhero movies?
Yes, you guessed it right, It's superhero movies all over!
