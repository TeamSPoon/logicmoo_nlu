Who do you think was the best female pop star.
There were a lot of really great female pop stars, that is hard to choose.
I think most people would say Maddona.
She did have a lot of hits.
Material Girl, Like A Virgin.
I think she laid the way for other pop stars.
I think Lady Gaga draws a lot from her.
Some of her songs are very similar.
I think the song Judas is just like something Madonna would sing.
I think the one called Given Me a Million reasons draws hard from Madonaa.
