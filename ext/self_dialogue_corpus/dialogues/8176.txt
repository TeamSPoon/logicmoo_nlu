What would you say is the best pop song of 2017?
That's a tough question.  Especially because there have been so many memorable and catchy ones thus far.
If you had to pick just one though?
I think the title has to go to 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran.  Right from when it came out in January, it's been dominating the charts.
What do you like about it the most?
I love the dancehall element of it, and the fact that despite his ability to reach high notes, Sheeran keeps his voice lower for it.
That did definitely add to the impact of his song and lyrics.
Also, the song didn't just do well here.  It hit number one on the charts of 30 other countries.
That's impressive.  I feel like I still hear that song all the time.
That makes sense, since it's the second most streamed song on Spotify still.
