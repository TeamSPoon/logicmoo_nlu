What outfit of lady gaga's do you want to wear most.
The meat dress of course!
Oh gross! That is my last pick.
What it is awesome. So iconic and fun.
I would feel so sick , I bet it smelled awful and would be super heavy.
You bring up some good points. what would you want to wear?
I would go with her outfit in just dance.
Why?It is a little boring considering all her looks.
Well I think it is like an 80s superhero almost rainbow brite like and I love it.
I suppose the fabric sheen is shimmery and fun and that bow. It is an iconic Gaga look.
