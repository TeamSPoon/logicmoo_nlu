Who do you think is the greatest singer of all time?
Wow that is tough. What kind of music?
Any and all kinds of music. Just the best singer.
I have to go with Whitney Houston.
She did have an unbelievable voice.
Yeah, she did. I would say either her or Celine Dion.
Oh Celine is an excellent choice too. I love both of their music.
You know. I would also have to include Christina Aguilera.
She is very good at singing too.
Those three all are just complete power houses.
I totally agree. They have amazing voices.
I feel like Christina Aguilera will never be an iconic classic singer like Whitney or Celine just because she sings pop music.
Agree. People will always see her in that way.
It is a shame though because her vocals are amazing and her ballads are on par with the others.
I do love listening to a good ballad that is sung really really well.
Me too. Jennifer Hudson is a very good power house vocalist too.
She is very good. She is the one from American Idol right?
Yeah she is!
Did she win?
Nope, she lost American Idol but she still was so good she became so famous.
