Do you watch superhero movies?
Absolutely, i try to watch them all when they are released?
Do you have a favorite one?
I have a couple. I love Guardians of the Galaxy and Antman.
Oh, so you are more into Marvel than D.C?
D.C is cool but Marvel is more established and been having better story lines lately.
Yeah that is true but i'm still looking forward to the new Wonder Woman movie.
Oh yeah that looks promising for sure, i will definitely watch it.
I just seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 a few weeks ago.
I haven't seen it but i heard it was just as good as the first.
I like the first one slightly better but this one was a good continuation.
Did they have any cut scenes at the end of the movie that Marvel is known for.
Heck yeah they did, they actually had 5 of them.
Wow that is crazy! I gotta go see it this weekend, i'm sure it is still in theaters.
The have one end scene with Groot where he is being a typical teenager.
Oh wow that's funny, i hope we get to see him as a teenager in Vol 3.
They also set the stage for the next villain being introduced in the the Guardians Universe.
Who is it going to be?
You sure you want to know? It's Adam Warlock.
Oh man, these movies just keep getting better and better i tell you.
