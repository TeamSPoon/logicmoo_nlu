I am making a movie for college. Want to be in it?
I've always wanted to act. Sure.
It's about the Salem witch trial thing.
Awesome. I've seen the Crucible movie.
It will be like that but obviously different too.
The Crucible was good.
I did like it.
I'd like to play anyone in this.
I was thinking you'd make a good Abigail Williams.
Really?
Yes, I see you playing her.
Is that the one played by Winona?
Yes.
I would like playing her.
That's great. I need to get you the script.
I'l study it and will work hard on this for you.
I appreciate that. Making a film isn't easy.
I'm sure there's a lot to it.
There sure is.
I'll help with other stuff if you need me too.
