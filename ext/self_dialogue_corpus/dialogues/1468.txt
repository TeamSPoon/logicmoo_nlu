Did you catch that Raiders vs. Saints game last night?
No, what happened.
Man, you missed a good one.
What was the score?
Raiders won 35 to 34.
Oh no. I fell asleep before the game came on.
Yep, Derek Carr had a good game.
How many yards did Carr pass for?
He passed for 319 yards.
What did Drew Brees do?
Brees played well himself. He had 423 passing yards.
How many rushing yards did the Raiders get?
I think it was about 167 yards.
What about the Saints? How many rush yards did they get?
The Saints had 88 rush yards.
Wow, they could barely run the football.
Yep, Oakland's rush defense shut them down.
Oh well, I guess the Saints will have better luck next time.
Maybe so but they will have to make some adjustments.
Yep, I expect the Saints head coach to review the film and learn from any mistakes.
