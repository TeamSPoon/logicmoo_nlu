Do you listen to Bieber?
Justin Bieber?  No, I am not a fan.
I don't like him that much either, but his song 'Love Yourself' is very catchy.
I agree with that sentiment at least.  It's a pretty good song.
Do you know who wrote it?
Justin didn't write it?
Nope.  It was Ed Sheeran.
Oh wow.  No wonder I liked the song so much.
Are you an Ed Sheeran fan?
I am.  I think he is so talented.
What's your favorite song by Ed?
I absolutely love "Shape of You."
It's such a good song.  The lyrics aren't great, but the music itself is well-written.
Agreed.  I wish Ed sang "Love Yourself" though instead of Bieber.
That would have been much better.  Apparently, Ed actually wrote that song with Rihanna in mind.
Wow.  Now THAT would have been truly great to hear.
For sure.  Rihanna has such range.
That version would be better than Bieber's any day.
I wonder if she has done a cover of it.
I guess it's time to go online to check!
