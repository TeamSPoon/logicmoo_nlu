Do you remember the Blair Witch Project?
Yeah, I saw that in the theatre.
Did you like it?
I wouldn't have categorized it as horror.
Really, you weren't scared?
The whole theatre was laughing.  We were nauseated by the camera.
It didn't look real?
The day before it came out, the "missing" crew came out to give interviews.
Oh, that ruined it.
Yeah, I think it would've been scarier if we thought it was real.
