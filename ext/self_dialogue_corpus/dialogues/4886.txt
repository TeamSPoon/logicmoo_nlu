Did you watch the game between the Braves and Blue Jays the other night?
Are you talking about the one where they almost started fighting?
Yes.  The Jose Bautista bat flip.
I did not see the entire game, but I watched the highlights.
What do you think about this whole bat flipping thing?
I guess it kind of depends on the circumstances.
So when do you think bat flipping is okay?
Well I don't mind it as much when it's a big moment, like a walk off home run.
Yea, but this game the Blue Jays were losing and Bautista just did it for show.
I agree, that's the impression I got.  That he was doing it more to show up the Braves than to actually celebrate.
You remember Bautista got in a fight because of all this stuff last year.
Yea, with Odor.  That did not turn out well for him.
Yes, I think some Braves players were saying Bautista shouldn't want to fight after that.
Yes, that was kind of funny.  But you know what, Bautista can't be afraid of anything either.
Well anyways, last night Bautista got hit on the thigh with a pitch, and that was that.
Yea, probably justified.  I don't mind those pitches too much as long as you don't go after a player's head.
And you know Bautista is not going to stop flipping bats.
No way.  There's almost pressure on him to flip his bat now.
That's true.  If he doesn't it almost seems like he is giving in to public pressure.
Exactly.  And you know, he can keep doing it as long as the situation warrants it.
