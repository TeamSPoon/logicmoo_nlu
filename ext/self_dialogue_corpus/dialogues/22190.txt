Do you like western movies?
Yes, actually I do. They are different than so many Sci-fi or horror films.
Yes, they are. Have you seen A Million Ways to Die in The West?
No, what is that about.
It is actually very funny and a western.
Who is in it?
Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron and even Liam Neeson.
All of them in a comedy?
Yes, there a lot of other good actors too, but they are the main ones.
Are they actually cowboys?
Yes, well Seth MacFarlane is a sheep herder and Neeson an outlaw.
Do they have a problem with each other?
Yea, Seth falls in love with his wife, and they end up having a gun fight.
Is it more of an action movie?
Not really, it is so funny, the things that happen in this town. Sarah Silverman is in it too.
I gotta check it out.
You really should, there are just too many funny things to explain, but I watch it everytime it's on HBO.
I will definitely see if it's on anywhere.
Seth Macfarlanes character is great in the movie. He's a good actor.
Yes, his stuffy is funny.
