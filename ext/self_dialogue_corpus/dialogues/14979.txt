Do you think today's comedies are as good as some classics?
What do you consider a classic comedy?
Stripes, Blazing Saddles, movies like those.
I love both those movies, but times have changed and I prefer newer comedies, as well as ones from the 90's and 2000's.
Do you like slapstick comedies or others?
I like any comedy. I was a huge fan of Sandler's early movies, especially Happy Gilmore.
I liked that one too- the more over-the-top, the better for me.
My new favorite is Kevin Hart. Just listening to his voice cracks me up most of the time.
I love him too- at first it seemed like he was trying to be like Eddie Murphy, but found his own way. I love him and Ice Cube as a team.
Similar to me with Chris Tucker years ago with the "Rush Hour" movies. Just listening to him talk is worth the admission price.
