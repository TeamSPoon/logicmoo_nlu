Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
Good, you?
Same here.
Good.
Seen any good movies lately?
Like in the theaters?
Sure there or anywhere.
I saw guardians of the galaxy 2 recently.
Oh cool, how was that.
I really enjoyed it.
I have been meaning to see it.
You should, I had a great time.
Did you go with anyone or go by yourself?
I went with my husband.
Oh nice.
Yeah we had a good time.
Good talking to you.
You too.
