I think my all time favorite Disney movie is Alice in Wonderland.
Oh good one! Do you like the animated one or the live version better?
I'd have to say the animated version.
Really? Why?
I thought Johnny Depp was really creepy as the Mad Hatter.
I thought he was awesome!
I also just really don't like Tim Burton's style, like I don't like how his movies are directed.
I get that, it's definitely a really creepy vibe.
Yeah, I like the colorful, playful animation of the original.
I think that the Tim Burton version fits the book better!
