Only a month til preseason starts!!
I got it marked on my Calendar man!
This is going to be  Brady lat year right?
Oh man I hope so!!! Give someone else a chance!  I got not his but respect for him, but please go so we can catch a  break!
I don't think the Falcons can rebound after that Superbowl loss man.
Naw, you can't come back from that!
True. Just look at how the Panthers did last year after losing the Superbowl.
Yeah, they drafted Mccaffrey.  They going to run hI'm into the ground!
They better. AND I hope the  refs protect Cam a little this year!
True! I'm thinking the Saints are going to rise back up this year.
I can see that. One last run for Drew  Brees.
He deseve's one more good playoff run. If their defence can hold.
They still doing extra point from 30 yards out this year?
Oh yeah. I didn't think id like it, but I do.
Yeah, it has added so.ething to the games. Until it costs my boys a game! Then it'll be the dumbest rule change ever.
Haha! I feel you man! We agree on the Saints and Falcons. But whis bringing up the rear in the NFL South?
Oh we gonna agree on that too! The Rams!!!
You right!!! The Rams in last place. Goff should start week one and they will go 6-10
Yep. So that my rankings . NO, ATL, CAR, and LA in last
Agree 100 % my man.
