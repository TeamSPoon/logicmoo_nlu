Have you seen Jupiter assending?
Yes, Channing tatum and Mila kunis are both talented.  The story of saving earth and them falling in love while fighting the bad guys is exciting.
Tell me about the movie Troll, what you liked and disliked.
I love the songs, and the story line, I did not like the part where poppy headed to the castle alone and the song she sang. It slowed downt too much.
The movie Gaurdians of the galaxy, what is a whitty line you liked?
I like the dialog between peter quill and rocket after the crashed after the metor field fight.  Peter called rocket and trash panda.
What is Drax's character to you?
I think he symbolizes a person with autisum.  His inability to get jokes, showing feelings, to say exactly whats on his mind with not thought of what it could make someone else feel like.
Did you like the movie Moana?
It was not my favorite.  The part with the crab and his horrible song.  The spinning made me dizzy.
Did you see the twilight movies?
Yes,
Which was your favorite and why
I like breaking dawn part 2 and I also like eclipse.  They both had huge fighting scenes. The wolves and vampires are powerful.  It had the drama of a love triange and who would bella choose. Edward and jacob either one would die to protect her.
Who is your favorite character in the twlight series
I am fond of charlie, he is a human that finds out the truth and can still handle it.  He is brave. He kind of knows there is something off about his town and just never wanted to make a huge deal about it because no one was getting hurt.  When the bad vampires came around he started a hunt.  There was not enough scenes with charlie in them.
Did you enjoy the movie Zootopia?
Yes. It is a good feeling movie.  Get up and go kind of music.
Who is your favorite character in Zootopia
Judy, She is determined to be a police officer and show everyone that with a little more hard work she can do anything that bigger stronger animals can do.
