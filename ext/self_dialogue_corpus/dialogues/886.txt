Do you watch NFL football?
A bit.  Why?
Who do you think the best quarterback is?
Out of any team?
Yeah, any team.
I'd have to say Drew Brees.
Wow.  I just think he's totally overrated.
What!?!  The guy holds tons of records!
I know he does.  I mean, his single season stats aren't on point lately.
He's still pretty awesome.
Seriously?  The Saints haven't done well in a while.
Well, maybe it's more the rest of the team than it is him.
Really?  The guy is getting old.
Look at how old Tom Brady is!
Tom Brady isn't that much older than Brees.
How much older is he?
Maybe two years.
Really?  I though it was more than that.
Probably because Tom Brady has been in the limelight for longer.
That could be it.
