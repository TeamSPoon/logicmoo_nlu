Hey, could I get that CD back from you?
Which one?
The one I lent you a week ago.
Drawing a blank...
For crying out loud! Sublime?!
Oh, sorry. I forgot I had it. The self title?
No. 40 oz.
Oh, yeah. Fraid I can't let you have it.
What?!
It's my favorite.
Stop messing with me.
OK, OK. Just kidding. It is good though.
Yeah, that's why I want it back.
Wish Bradly was still around.
Yeah, they have a new front man, but it's not the same.
Yeay, Rome is OK, but definitely not as good.
I'd still go to a show if they came around.
Me too.
Well lets see if they have any tour dates.
Cool!
