What would you say is your favorite Disney character?
There are so many to choose from, but if I had to pick just one, I think I'd say Robin Hood.
Wow, that's an oldie but a goodie! Why Robin Hood?
Well, he seemed to have a lot of morals as well as charisma with the ladies. I kind of like that.
He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. I don't know if that's great morals or not.
True, but the rich he robbed from where all kind of jerks. Not that it's right to steal from anyone.
True! I wonder if they will ever re-make that one.
I don't know, I haven't heard anything in years about Robin Hood.
That would be something though, don't you think?
With today's technology and graphic ability, it could be amazing!
