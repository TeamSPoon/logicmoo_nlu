Did you know that the movie  "Annabella" is based on a true story?
is it really? I didn't know that.
Apparently they have a museum with the real doll there.
That would freak me out to have a demon doll around, even in a glass case.
It has a warning sign on it to never open the case.
Who would want a homicidal doll?
I guess folks that don't believe it. I have trouble believing a doll is possessed by a demon.
I heard that in the movie, she would keep coming back even if they through it out.
one time they even burn it, still showed back up.
That had to be someone messing with someone else.
Probably, but still its creepy.
Agreed, but I wonder why people kept it around in the first place?
Who knows, maybe they planned to use it somehow.
For what? revenge?
I have no idea, but the movie itself, was a good flix to watch at home, in theatres not so much.
Why not watch it in Theaters?
It was too cliche for me to spend money to watch in theaters.
So it is not a good date movie?
It is just captivating enough to watch, but again its a better Netflix and chill movie.
I will just wait for Netflix to release it.
