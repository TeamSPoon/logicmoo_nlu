Do you like Pirate's of The Carribean?
I love those movies!
Johnny Depp is so hot!
I know, him and Orlando Bloom.
Have you seen the new one?
No, have you?
Yes, I saw it last night.
Was it any good.
It was great!
Did it stack up against the first four?
Yeah, it was just as good.
Are Bloom and Depp in it?
Yep, so is Kiera Knightly.
I need to go see it!
I think I'm going to go see it again next weekend. Want to join?
Now that I'm thinking about it I don't know if I can wait that long.
Haha, well if you decide to wait let me know.
Yes, lets go see it next weekend.
Great sounds good. You will love it!
I'm sure I will.
