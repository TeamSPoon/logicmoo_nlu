What is your favorite kind of movie to see in theaters?
I would say a nice action movie.
Thats probably the answer for most, mine is suspense.
Yeah thats a good one to see.
I just think the darkness of the theater and the gigantic screen blend well.
I agree I just like the action movie with how loud it can get.
Just not a fan of how loud it is for me, I am the opposite.
Cool I guess we can disagree on some stuff.
Yeah true but what kind of movie do you least like to see in theaters?
Probably cartoons. Just doesnt do anything for me.
I hate cartoons period. Waste of money.
Some are funny, did you see Sausage Party?
I did but thats the exception to the rule.
Yeah not alot of those kinds of movies.
Did you enjoy the flick?
I thought some stuff was funny, some of the jokes were lame.
Its hard to write a cartoon with those guys.
Sometimes Rogen keeps the same cast together and its annoying.
How about comedies?
More of a rent from home or Redbox for those. Miss alot of stuff while laughing.
