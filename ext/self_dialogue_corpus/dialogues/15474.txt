What's a style of music that you liked in the 80s?
I was actually a Clash fan back then.
Really? I didn't know that about you.
Their music was great to listen to.
I know it was like a moment of rebellion.
They seemed very anti establishment.
They had alot of tension. They broke up very quickly.
It's always hard to keep the band together.
They made great music though in the short time.
I liked how they slammed their guitars.
They played some loud music.
Where they from the US?
No, they were from England.
They could have been the Beatles.
Oh, nobody could ever be them.
I know but it's cool we are talking about the Clash 30 years later.
What's your favorite clash song?
I like Should I Stay or Should I go.
That song gets stuck in my head.
I know it's a great tune.
