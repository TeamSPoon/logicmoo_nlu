Dude. I love this stuff.
Stuff? You mean that noise streaming out of your headphones?
Its not noise! Its great!
What do you even call that?
Its called EDM. Its rad!
Its trash.
How can you even hate on something so beautiful?
I dont know, how can you stand to listen to robots for hours at a time?
Ok mister cultured, what do you listen to?
I listen to NPR.
No you idiot, what kind of music.
I dont like music.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE MUSIC?
Its for kids.
For kids?!
Music is for the youth. I am old.
You are never too old for music!
I am.
Open your mind, give it a chance!
I'll consider it, as long as its not robots talking. I need some earplugs.
