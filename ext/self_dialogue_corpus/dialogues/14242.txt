Did you see the match between the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs last night?
Yeah! The last 15 seconds in overtime was the best!
They were trailing by three and put the ball in James Harden's hands thinking he was going to make the shot.
They've been using that gameplay all year.
But it didn't work this time. Manu Ginobili blocked him from behind.
That was the play of the night!
That's probably the last big moment of his career though.
What makes you say that?
Well, he's already 39 and he's been looking old this postseason.
I guess your right, but I must say, crafty plays is what he's done best over his 15 year career.
Yeah, I agree. And he finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and five assists.
True. The Spurs needed all of his performance, especially in overtime.
You can say that again!
Did you see what happened to Kawhi Leonard?
No, I saw him sitting on the bench but I didn't know why.
He hurt his ankle early in the game and never returned.
Oh. I didn't know because I missed the first 30 minutes.
Oh. Harden played a great game this time.
Yeah! He recorded a triple-double with 33 points!
Do you know when the next match is?
