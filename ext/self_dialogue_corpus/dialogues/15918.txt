yes. But, BUT! there is one caveat.
oh great, what?
The rule 2.
`About not repeating stuff?
yes that.
Ugh We just did a whole exercise on it!
yes. about a note not repeating. But, is a whole C same as a quarter C?
um... no?
Yeah. So there is some wiggle room here beside repeated notes are beautiful. Why would Shconberg just ban it entirely?
Mayeb that's why there are other schools of thoughts about it
And most other composers have developed their own systems.
Now I'm more confused than ever
Think of it as a suggestion rather than a rule where if you break it, you go to jail
Hah. That's stupid
But anyway. So we have the transformation down right?
Yes. Retrograde(R), inversion(I), retrogradde inversion(RI), and the prime(P) which is doing nothing
Now think of a row, and think of how many different ways of applying those transformation are there. There are R, I, RI, And P
Um. I have no idea.l I don't even know where to begin to think about that.
it depends on the length but let's just say one single row.
Ok... There are 4 things. so, 16 combinations that are possible.
