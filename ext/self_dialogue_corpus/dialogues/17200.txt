What was that song that you used to sing all the time?
You mean Tubthumping?
Yeah that was the one.
What about it>
Well I was talking to someone the other day and I couldn't remember who sings it.
It was by Chumbawamba.
Right, I don't know how I forgot that, you only sang it every 5 minutes.
Hey it was a catchy song, then and now.
It's an addicting song and you always got it stuck in my head.
Like you have any room to talk about getting songs stuck in someone's head.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
So you're gonna sit there and say you don't remember your song choices.
All the music I listen is amazing, people tell me I have great taste.
Is that the story you're sticking with Barbie Girl?
Now that's not fair, Barbie Girl was a great song, even you liked it.
It was a cute song, but it was like verbal terrorism when it came on.
Don't blame Aqua for your lack of taste.
There is such a thing as being played too much.
The world is better off for having one hit wonders and infectious music.
I guess, but now I'm gonna be singing those all day.
