Man, I always thought Longbottom was a wimp until the last movie.
Dude, he totally owned that film.
Where did he find the bravery?
Who cares?  He looked great with that sword.
Most people look cool with a huge friggin' sword.
Right, but he cut off the snake's head like it was easy.
And screamed while doing it!
No kidding.  Total hero at that time.
I hope he gave the sword back at the end.
They wouldn't let him keep it since it was such a heirloom.
