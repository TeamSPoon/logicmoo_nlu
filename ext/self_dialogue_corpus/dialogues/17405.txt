Do you listen to pop music?
I do sometimes.
What kind of pop music do you like?
I really like Britney Spears.  I grew up on her.
I'm a little older than you so I grew up on Madonna.  But I like Britney, too.
I've heard Madonna's older stuff.  I enjoy her, too.
She was really great in the 90s.
I don't really like her newer stuff.
Yeah, I don't either.  I don't think she adjusted well to the newer way music is made.
I can tell.  Her new stuff sounds so forced.
Yes!  Like she's still trying to be young.
Still, she's had some classics in her career.
No doubt that she's a legend in music.
Right up there with Micheal Jackson!
I wonder if they ever hung out or collaborated.
I don't know.  I guess it's something to google.
I really loved Michael Jackson.
Yeah, it's a shame that he died.
Even his new stuff was really good.  You can't beat that.
An actual legend who could adapt, it's rare!
