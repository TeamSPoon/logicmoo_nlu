Will you watch the NFL this year on TV?
You bet.
What team is going to win the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Patriots?
Wow, I would have said the Steelers.
You wish.
I sure hope so.
When's the last time the Steelers won the Super Bowl?
It was 2009.
Who did they beat.
They beat the Arizona Cardinals.
Yeah that's right.
It was a close one.
Wow, now I remember that.
I would love to attend a Super Bowl.
I think you need a lot of money to go to those.
You probably need an invitation as well.
Tickets seem to be hard to get, aren't they?
Yes, I think the president even goes to the game sometimes.
I want to be President!
