Have you seen Moana yet?
I have! Isn't it great?
It was amazing! I loved the music.
What was your favorite song?
How Far I'll Go was easily my favorite.
So good! I did really like Maui's singing voice.
I was so surprised The Rock could sing that well!
Me too. Maui was my favorite character.
Mine was Heihei the chicken!
Such a goofy character!
