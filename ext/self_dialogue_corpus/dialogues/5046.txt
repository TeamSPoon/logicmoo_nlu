How do you like the Detroit Tigers?
They are pretty good.  Did you catch their game yesterday against the Angels?
Oh yeah, brutal huh?
Yeah it was.  I can't believe they lost 0-7.
Yeah, but their game on May 11 they beat the Angels 7-1
Detroit's pitcher,  Fulmer is top notch!  He's partially why the Angels lost I think.
Detroit has a lot of good players, it just seems like sometimes they're hot and sometimes they're not.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Upton.  You?
I think Kinsler is pretty good.
How do you like Verlander?
He's awesome!  Tigers are lucky to have him.
Yeah, he's been with the Tigers for a long time now.  He's got to be one of their best players.
How do you like Wilson?  He's pretty decent.
He's okay.  I like Verlander better.
Wilson is still pretty new, but I think he shows promise.
Do you know who the Tigers are up against next?
Yeah, they play the Angels again tonight and then again tomorrow.
I wonder how that will play out.
I know.  Seems like they're really on top of it or they get beat pretty badly.
