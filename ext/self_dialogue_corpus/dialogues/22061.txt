What is your most underrated comedy?
Probably Hot Rod, it gets no love.
Oh Hot Rod is a great choice, nobody I know has seen it.
It's so quirky and dumb I can see why people might not like it, but I love it.
Yeah Andy Samberg put together such a great cast for that movie.
Ian McShane alone makes the whole movie worth it.
Yeah seeing Ian McShane wrestle Andy Samberg is worth the price of admission.
Danny McBride was great in his role too, was the first time I've seen him actually.
This was the Lonely Island's first big movie I think right?
I don't know enough about that to answer but it seems like it.
I wish Andy Samberg and the guys would do more movies.
Yeah comedies are kind of lacking these days.
Yeah they like trying to capture the 21 Jump Street magic by making stuff like Baywatch.
Yeah which looks really bad.
Not even The Rock can save that one.
Not at all, we need more stuff like Hot Rod and Step Brothers.
I can't remember a single good comedy in the last year or two.
I kind of like the Vacation remake.
Oh my god are you serious?
Yeah it was fun, I also liked We Are The Millers.
