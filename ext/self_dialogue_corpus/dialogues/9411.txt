I absolutely love Eminem how about you?
Yes I like him.
I like his older stuff my favorite song is When I'm Gone.
That is a good one but sad.
What about Cleanin Out my Closet?
Yes I like that one too, they don't play it much though.
He don't like it played anymore because he made up with his mom.
Really is that why?
Yes and he doesn't like to be reminded of that song anymore.
Wow that is surprising.
