Did you see Finding Dory?
I did! I went with my daughter.
What did she think?
She thought it was really cute.
And what did you think?
I also thought it was really cute, but had some more serious parts to it.
Like what?
It takes Dory's memory problems seriously as a disability.
That's interesting.
And kind of weird, but ultimately really touching.
Was it just a rehash of the first film?
There were some parts that were similar, but it had a lot of original moments.
What happens in this movie?
Dory goes to look for her parents, and searches an aquarium for them.
Does she find them?
That would be a spoiler! But it has a happy ending.
What did you like most?
The octopus they meet is great. And I love Dory in this movie.
Maybe I'll take my kids.
You should! I bet you'd all have fun.
