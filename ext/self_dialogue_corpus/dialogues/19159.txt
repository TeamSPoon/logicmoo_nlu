I want to make a Summer playlist for the party on Saturday.
What kind of songs do you want to put on it?
Well, at first I was thinking about some pop music.
That's always easy.
But I'm leaning towards something a bit more relaxed.
It is going to be a lazy kind of Sunday party.
Right. So, do you have any ideas for that?
Um, maybe Daft Punk? Doin' it Right?
I can add that.
And then maybe some jazz.
Jazz might be a good idea.
Post-rock is also usually pretty laid back.
Got any recommendations?
Maybe toe?
Hmm. Okay. I was also thinking, what's that song at the end of Lost in Translation that you recommended?
Kaze wo Atsumete?
Yeah. That was nice and breezy. Do they have other songs like that?
Happy End? Yep. Should I lend you the album?
Please do!
I'll go get it!
