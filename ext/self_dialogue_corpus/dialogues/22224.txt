I just saw Brick Lane.
Never heard of it,  Is it a foreign movie?
Yes, it's about people from Bangladesh living in England.
What happens in the movie?
A young woman gets sent to England for an arranged marriage with an older man.
Bummer.  Is she sad?
She misses her family.  She has two kids, but is unhappy.
Is her husband a jerk?
At first you think he is, but he turns out to be ok.
What do you mean?
He's actually nice to the kids, although he yells a lot.
What else happens in the movie?
The wife has an affair with a stud.
Cool.  Do she leave her husband?
Surprisingly,no.  She ends the affair and confesses she loves her husband.
That's unexpected.
The husband ends up going home to Bangladesh, and she stays in England with the kids.
That's good for her.
Yes, a sort of happy ending, but not Hollywood.
Not Bollywood either.
