Were you a fan of the Jaws movies?
Now I am!
Did you used to not be?
Well, once when I was young, my friend and I watched it and I cried.
Yeah, it could be scary for a kid.
I was terrified!
Did it make you scared to go into the water?
I never really liked going into the water, but that didn't help.
Do you think they should remake it?
I don't know.  I'd probably see it though.
