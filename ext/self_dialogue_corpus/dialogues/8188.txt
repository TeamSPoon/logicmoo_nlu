What do you think about Selena Gomez's new single?
Bad Liar? I really like it. It gets stuck in my head all day.
Yes, I wonder if she wrote it about Justin Bieber.
Speaking of Bieber, I love his new song with Daddy Yankee "Despacito"!
Oh me too, who knew he could speak Spanish?
I think that is one of my favorite songs on the radio right now. Along with Halsey's song "Now or Never."
Yes, she has such a beautiful voice.
I always get her voice confused with Alessia Cara, to me they sound very similar.
I saw Alessia Cara perform on the voice and loved it!
I saw that too, she sang "Scars" and was amazing.
