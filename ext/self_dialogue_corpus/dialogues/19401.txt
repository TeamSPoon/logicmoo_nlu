What do you think of popular music these days?
I have mixed opinions.
Me too, some of it is good but a lot is just repetitive.
Yeah, true. I've really been liking I'm the One, but I've not listened to it very often.
It's so catchy! And such good features.
Right, who's on it again?
Well, DJ Khaled put it out, but it's featuring Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne.
Wow, that's a lot of people on one song.
True, I think they speed it up on the radio sometimes because it's too long.
That's funny. I like Chance a lot.
He's so good! I saw him live last year and it was awesome.
I have too, the crowd is always so crazy.
You're right, people are so into him. He's just a happy guy.
I know, his music is so fun.
What's your favorite song off Coloring Book?
That's tough, but probably Finish Line/Drown.
That's a good one, and I love Noname.
Yes! She's great and they work so well together.
I know, do you remember Lost on Acidrap?
Yeah, one of my favorite songs.
