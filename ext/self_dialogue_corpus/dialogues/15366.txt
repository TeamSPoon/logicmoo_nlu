What do you think of showtunes?
Is that a new rock group?
No, I mean the genre of music. Showtunes.
Oh, I think they're okay but can get old quickly.
What are your favorite scores?
I love the original recording of Cabaret as well as the film version.
Liza Minnelli did an amazing song on that LP. Her voice was incredible.
She's one of my absolute favorite performers.
If you like that one, have you heard the score to Chicago?
I have, and I love it. It's so blues and rich.
Not to mention Bebe Neuwirth has another incredibly memorable voice.
I thought Catherine Zeta-Jones performed the material well in the movie as well.
I agree. I also loved her singing Send in the Clowns.
That's not one of my favorite pieces. I prefer quickly paced songs.
In what vein?
Like in Little Shop of Horrors, where it's all rockabilly and doo-wop and Motown-inspired stuff.
Oh I get you! Kind of like the soundtrack to Grease.
Exactly! I love when it kind of sounds like something Buddy Holly would have written.
Should I ask you about the floral stylings of Wicked?
It's probably best if you don't.
