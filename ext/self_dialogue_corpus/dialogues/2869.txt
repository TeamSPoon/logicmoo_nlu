I have such a big crush on Matt Wolfe.
Yes, he is cute.
He scored 10 points in yesterday's game.
That's impressive.
I couldn't believe it.
So he got them a win?
Basically.
Wow.
He's also cute and single!
And living 10 hours away in Columbia.
I can travel....for a "game."

Actually, sounds like fun.

Only because you're crushing.
Of course.
