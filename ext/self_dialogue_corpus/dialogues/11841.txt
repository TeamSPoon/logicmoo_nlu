Do you listen to the Beatles?
They are one of my favorite groups!   I like how their music progresses and changes as they grow older.
Me too!  Their music definitely evolved over the years.  You can tell that the most with the White Album.
Yes!  What is your favorite song on that album?
Helter Skelter.
That's a good one!  You know it's about a slide at a playground, right?
Yeah.  It's got such a unique, hard rock sound to it.
It does!  Then the album has a track the complete opposite like Mother Nature's Son.
I used to listen to that song when I was ready to go to sleep.
It's a good one for it!  Good Night is a good one, too.
