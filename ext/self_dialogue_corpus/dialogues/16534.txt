Did you see our band perform last night?
Yeah it was pretty insane
I know right it was fun though.
You guys killed it honestly
Glad to hear it wanted to have a good time
Well i for sure had a great time
We plan to play some more music again soon
I will be their then for sure
You should play some music live though.
I am not sure about that
you are good at music trust me
i know but its not easy for me to do.
Why is it not easy for you to play music in front of people
I got anxiety and get anxious about things so i am not sure about it
Just gotta hold some belief in yourself
I might try one day
Music is life gotta remember that it is a passion do not forget your passion go on and do not stagnate
Well maybe if i practice alot one day i will play live and be as good as you guys
You are good bro trust me just gotta get over your public fear of being on the stage
that might happen one day.
