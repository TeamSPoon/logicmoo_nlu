Did Disney make any sci fi films?
I think Tomorrowland counts. Good flick.
Very entertaining. Time travel, right?
Well its a little more than that. It covers all kinds of technology.
And scientific developments.
George Clooney was cute the way he'd get bent out of shape.
He was good in that. Good father figure.
And there was a little girl robot!
Who dreamed that up? She was awesome.
I love the scenes. I'll never get tired of them.
