So, what other covers do you like?
Well, I liked Johnny Cash's version of "Hurt"
Yeah, that was pretty cool.
Although I do have to admit, I like the original just a bit better.
What?!?  Blasphemy!
Yeah, I know, I know, but I just like the darker edge of the original.
But JC's version really puts a new spin on it.  I mean, Razor's just kind being angsty in general, but Cash, he puts the perspective of a man truly facing the end of his life.
Yeah, I Know, and it's a really powerful part of the song, but still... I prefer the older one.
Well, fair enough.
oh, interesting trivia fact about that video, by the way...
Wait, which video?
The one with Cash.
Oh yeah.  Go ahead...
Most of it was improvised.  At the scene where Cash is playing the piano and his wife is watching him
June Carter.
Oh, yeah!  Anyway, June is watching from the... the stair I think, and she's got this concerned look on her face.  None of that was planned or rehearsed, they just capture how she was really looking at him
Yeah, that's pretty interesting, and a bit sad. I think at the time Johnny wasn't in the best of health, so you're she was probably always worried about him.
That's true but, crazily enough, she ended up passing away before him.
Imagine that must hav ebeen quite a blow.
Definitely.
