What are your go-to karaoke songs?
Why do you ask?
Well, we're renting a machine, and I want to make sure everyone has something they can sing.
Hmm. Well, I like to sing Simon and Garfunkle. But that doesn't always make for great party music.
Got a favorite?
The Sound of Silence.
Yeah. That might be a little strange for a karaoke night.
Well, what's your go-to?
I like to sing Sweet Home Alabama.
You are a Southern boy at heart.
Yeah. And it's the kind of thing everyone in the room can get really into.
Well maybe I'll do Rolling Stones or Aerosmith then.
I can make sure the machine has at least one option then.
I don't really like to sing karaoke much, though.
You don't?
Yeah, I get stage fright.
Well, why don't you sing Sweet Home Alabama with me then?
You sure?
Yeah. We'll just make it a duet!
Sounds good!
