Who do you think is going to win the SuperBowl next season?
I don't know yet, there are so many good people who have recently come into the NFL.
I know, like John Ross and Jamal Adams.
Yeah, Jamal Adams is a beast.
He is. I love the Jets but I am a Giants fan.
I don't like either of them; Steelers, baby!
Lame! I hope that the Giants get to the SuperBowl next season.
That would be interesting. I wonder how everything with Odell Beckham JR. will pan out.
Same. I think that everything will be fine.
Who knows. There is a lot more behind the scenes than we know.
What do you think about the return of Marshawn Lynch?
Beast Mode! I think that it will be cool although I do not think that it will be the same.
Have you seen his training footage?
Yeah. He killed it in that beach workout video.
He is so quick. I admire his work and training.
Yeah, he makes it look easy. I think that I'd be able to keep up though.
In your dreams! Even NFL defensive backs couldn't keep up with him.
I'm excited to see what he does with the media this season.
I don't think that he will be too rowdy. He has a good head on his shoulders.
Yeah, he is nice but he takes nothing from no one.
