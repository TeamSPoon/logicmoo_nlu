What did you think of Phantom Menance?
I loved it!  I think the prequels have a lot of depth.
Oh I hated it! I thought it was so boring.
But you get so much background! And Yoda is so great!
I don't watch Star Wars for Yoda!
But he's awesome!
Yeah, but I watch it for the Skywalker family stuff.
Then what about Anikan and Padame?
Super creepy because she's a teenager and he's a kid!
Eh. Maybe.
