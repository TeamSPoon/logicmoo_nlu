Hey , Let's go watch a movie tonight.
Sure , which movie do you have in mind?
I was thinking Beauty and the Beast.
Nice, do you know who the actors are in this one?
Emma Watson is playing Belle and Dan Stevens is playing the Beast.
Cool, they are both nice actors , who is playing Gaston?
It's Luke Evans.
Okay. Is Dan Stevens wearing make up for his Beast costume?
No, they are using full body CGI suit , which will imitate his every action and emotion correctly on a Computer Generated Image.
Wow , Nice technology!
