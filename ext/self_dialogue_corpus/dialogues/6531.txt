What's your all time favorite Disney movie?
Oh, that's a tough one...I guess I'd have to say The Lion King.
Really? I would have thought you'd be more of a Disney princess fan.
Oh I am, but the Lion King is probably my all time favorite movie. It's a masterpiece!
Mine too! There are so many powerful moments. Like when Simba sees his father in the sky, or when Nala and Simba finally reunite.
So true. My favorite part is when Simba is with Timon and Pumba though. It's so whimsical and takes away from the pain you feel for Simba after he loses his Dad.
Oh I hated Scar for that. And for locking up Zazu. And pretty much everything. Scar was the worst!
He really was but in the best possible way. He's the type of villain you love to hate.
I have it on DVD, you should come over and watch this weekend.
Definitely! We can have a sing-along! I can't wait!
