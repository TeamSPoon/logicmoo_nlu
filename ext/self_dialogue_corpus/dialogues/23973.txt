Who would you say is the best Western actor?
John Wayne, no contest.
So you'd pick John Wayne over Gary Cooper?
As a Western actor, yes.
How is John Wayne better than Gary Cooper?
I will agree that Gary is an outstanding actor and is far more versatile than John outside of Western, but not when there's outlaws up to no good.
Gary Cooper put down bad guys just fine.
That may be, but if it's time to saddle up, the Duke is getting a Winchester and strapping on a six-shooter.
Gary Cooper could hold his own against anybody.
I agree he's good, but not on horseback. Life after Westerns is a different story.
What do you mean?
Well John Wayne is the better cowboy, but modern was not his style.
Yeah he didn't really evolve well.
Take Big Jake, it was still John Wayne gunslinger, but he was around automobiles and semi auto pistols.
I will agree that he should only have be around revolvers, or at most a lever action rifle.
Yeah I couldn't see John Wayne in a movie today holding a digital zoom, lazer guided sniper rifle.
Not even a little bit, Though he was ok in The Green Berets.
It wasn't horrible, but I stand by what I said, Now Gary Cooper I could see coming back in like a mobster movie, or even a high tech spy.
Ok I see what you're getting at, yes Cooper is the more well rounded of the two.
Agreed, but John Wayne is definitely better with a ten gallon hat and a set of spurs.
