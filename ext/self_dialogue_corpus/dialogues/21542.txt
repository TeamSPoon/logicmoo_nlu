Hey
Hello
How are you
I am doing okay
Good good
What about you
I am great thinking of going out
What did you want to do
Well i want to go out to see a movie
Movies are okay i guess
You not a big fan?
Not really my thing
Why not
I do not know i just cannot seem to enjoy them
I want to go see some foreign movies
Definitely not for me
Why those your least favorite
I like to be able to hear the movie
I guess i can relate but i like the movies though
Good for you
