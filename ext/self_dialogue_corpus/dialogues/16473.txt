So what is your favorite type of music?
I like most types honestly.  But if I had to pick one, it would be Rock N Roll
Classic or newer stuff?
Both really.  It just depends on the mood I am in.
Yeah that's true, sometimes the oldies are goodies.
What about you?  What do you like?
I am a rock fan as well.  Mostly newer stuff but I do like classics to.
What are some of your favorite bands?
I like Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N Roses, Linkin Park, Aerosmith among others.
Those are some really good bands,though I am not sold on Avenged.
Yeah, I didn't care for them at first.  But they grew on me
I may give them another chance.
I would suggest it.  Their newer stuff isn't as good but it still rocks.
Do you like any other genres
I will listen to just about anything.  I can't listen to Rap anymore though
Yeah me either.  They all rap about the same stuff it seems.
Yeah and they are very derogatory towards literally everyone and everything.
I know!  Lil Wayne is just the worst
Right?  I don't get the infatuation with him.
Me either!
