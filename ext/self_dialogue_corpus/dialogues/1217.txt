O.K. the other day we talked about the greatest NFL team of all time--who was the greatest player?
You know, I've actually thought about this, and I think you have to do it by position.
Why is that?
Well, the quarterbacks have the biggest impact these days, but they are not the best athletes.
O.K., who are?
The running backs.
All right, I'll go with you.  Who is the greatest running back of all time?
Well, Jim Brown would say it is Jim Brown.
He might be right, but since we didn't see him that much, let's eliminate him from the discussion.
Agreed.
I'll throw out O.J. Simpson.
Because of his troubles?
No, I didn't mean discard him--I meant consider him.
Oh, pretty darn good--playing in the Buffalo weather on poor teams hurts his ranking.
Well, if all the games we're on artificial turf, I'd go with Barry Sanders.
Agreed.  Dickerson has the most yards, but I was never a big fan.
Yeah, big and powerful, but the elusive backs are more fun.
For sure, like Gale Sayers.
Oh, my; he scored, I think, six touchdowns once against my Niners.
Let's consider Adrian Peterson and move on--I'd take any of the guys we've talked about.
