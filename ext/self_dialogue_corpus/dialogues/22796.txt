I'm trying to think of a movie from when I was young, it had a fish in it.
That's not saying much, what do you mean?
It was animated and really cute. About a fish and his father.
Oh oh you mean "Finding Nemo"?
Yes that movie!
I've seen that too, who hasn't?
It was so cute. I loved the characters.
Remember Dory?
Of course I do. She was so funny and cute.
Yes she was. One of my favorites.
You know that she came out with one of her own movies right?
You mean the movie called "Dory".
Yes! It turned out great.
I saw it in the theater at the time with friends.
I took my boys to see it last summer.
The whale was so hilarious.
I know and a good friend to Dory.
I felt so sad for her trying to find her parents.
I did too. I was relieved when she finally did.
Yes it was so heartwarming.
