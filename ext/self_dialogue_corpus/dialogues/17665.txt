what do you think of hurt
the song by johnny cash?
no...the song by nine inch nails
well, they are the same song
well, it is nine inchs song because it was their original
trent reznor admitted johnny did it better
thats only because he was about to die
but he still said it was better
that doesnt mean its his now
trent said the song was literally cash's after he heard it
well, then i dont know.
i like johnnys better because it was so sad
especially when paired with the video
it was his last single
and he was just reliving all his mistakes and his past
its more sad than a 20 something year old being angsty
yeah, i wonder why he covered it
i dont know either
he never seemed like a metal fan
he really did not
