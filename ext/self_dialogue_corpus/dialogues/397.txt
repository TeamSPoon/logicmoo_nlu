Who do you think is the worst Avenger?
Hmmm, based on powers, I'd say Hawkeye.
My vote is for Black Widow.  She doesn't have any powers either, and not even bow.
I always like to identify actors by the roles they've played in superhero movies.
Go on.
Well, Thomas Jane played the Punisher, and Alfred Molina played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2.
Ok.
Well, they appear together in Boogie Nights, and it's fun pretending that Doctor Octopus shoots the Punisher.
Haha, that is interesting, but it can get tricky, I'm thinking.
Yeah, like which actor is which hero if they've played multiple roles.  I usually go with the better role, like Halle Berry is definitely Storm.
