We watched Frozen last night for about the twentieth time.
That's funny. I saw it once.
I liked Olaf, did you?
Of course. Which sister did you like better?
I don't know. They both had issues.
I liked Anna better.
It would be cool to be able to live in such a cold environment.
Not for me.
I don't know, obviously a fairytale but a neat idea.
Yes it is.
