Have you seen Ninja Assassin?
No, what's that?
You'd love it, I'm sure.
Probably, the title is great.
Basically, there's a clan of ninjas.
Let me guess, one's an assassin?
Well, duh. But more specifically, he is kicked out of and then hunted down by his clan.
Oooh, nice. How's the action?
Completely hilariously over-the-top, but overly-edited.
I'll have to check it out.
