What's going on Brian? Aren't you a Raiders fan?
You better believe it! Raider Nation!
You think they can make a run with the new quarterback?
Man our defense is scary, I don't care about offense.
Really? You guys have some pretty good weapons in your receivers and running backs man.
Listen, I'm in it for the hitting bro, not the flash f touchdowns.
But you can score on defense and most times it's flashier than an offensive score,
Ha, because it's such a magnificent play to strip your opponent of his goal and run it in their faces.
Your clearly biased towards them, I don't know why I even brought up the Raiders.
A lot of hostility in that tone Eagles fan.
Ha, whatever bro, you want to go to the game this weekend?
I'm not sure man, it's not a good time for me to buy any tickets.
I didn't ask that bro, I asked if you wanted to see your bum Raiders get whooped?
Ha ha, more hostility I see. Let's see if those bum eagles can match your enthusiasm.
Ha ha, whatever man. My former teammates gave me some cool tickets and I knew you were a bums fan.
Really? On who's team?
Your bum Raiders but you don't pay attention to offense.
I know my team man, what's there names? I know every Raider I'm sure of it.
Ha, we'll see when you meet them. Don't get all star struck and pee your pants asking for an autograph.
Wait, so I HAVE to know him right? I know every Raider man come on!
