Do you like hockey?
No too much.
Did you know the finals are on at the moment?
I did not.
They sure are.
That is quite interesting, who is your favorite to win?
The Ducks
Oh a Mighty Ducks fan huh?
Sure am. It is just Ducks though, this isnt that movie.
Well I wasn't referring to the movie.
Oh that is my mistake. PLease forgive me.
Ok I forgive that mild trespass.
Thank you, who do you think will win?
Oh i guess the Predators
The ducks scored 5 points on them the other night
Oh wow, how many did the predators score?
Only 3
Well that isn't much of a contest at all.
You should watch the next round with me.
Ok that sounds like fun.
