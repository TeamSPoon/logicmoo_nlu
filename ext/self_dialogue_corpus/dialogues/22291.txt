Oh yeah! Channing Tatum too?
Yes, but that's kind of a surprise.
What do you mean?
He's hiding and it's a surprise reveal.
He's hiding where?
Under the floor.
The entire movie? Wow!
Yeah!  He pops out and it shows the entire thing was a set up.
What's the point?
He's trying to save his sister.
Oh, that's the woman being arrested?
Yes, she is being brought to justice by bounty hunters.
Is that Kurt Russell's character?
Yes.  He's pretty tough.
I liked his beard and sideburns.
Yeah. They would look good on you.
Very funny. Would you watch it again.
No.  once you know the surprise it's boring.
I agree.
We should watch pulp fiction though.
