Do you watch NFL football?
Yes, from time to time I do.
What is your favorite team?
I like the Denver Broncos.
Is Peyton Manning still there?
No, he retired a few years ago.
He won that before he went, though, right?
Yes, he won one after he lost against the Seahawks.
Is he in the Hall of Fame yet?
No, you have to wait a certain amount of time.
Is that so? How long?
I don't know, but at least a few years.
I just heard Cortez Kennedy died, from the Seahawks.
Yes, he was in the Hall of Fame.
He was a defensive end, I think. His team was never too to good though.
At least he was in the Hall of Fame.
Yes, that's good I guess.
He's not alive anymore.
No, he's not.
Great players in the NFL make the Hall of Fame. That's all I have to say.
