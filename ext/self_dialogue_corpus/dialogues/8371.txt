Do you listen to pop music?
Sometimes. I really like Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran, you?
I love Katy Perry. And, that new song, Despacito.
I like it too but is it really pop? It's in Spanish.
It's pretty popular, so I think it's pop. What other pop songs do you likes?
I really like Believer, by Imagine Dragons. What about you?
I think my new favorite pop song is Issues.
Is that by Arianna Grande?
No, it's by Julia Michaels.
Oh, I though it was Arianna Grande.
