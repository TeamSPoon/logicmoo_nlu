Did you like Iron Man 3?
I did, but I didn't.
How is that?
Well, I love the Marvel Movies, but this had some unnecessary stuff in it.
Like what?
I love hot women, I really do.
Trust me, I know.
I hated that when Pepper Pots was being held captive and Iron Man came to her rescue, she was shirtless.
Yeah, that was kind of revolting.
It was for eye candy for sure, but that means they actually took her shirt off when they tied her up. And that's entertainment?
