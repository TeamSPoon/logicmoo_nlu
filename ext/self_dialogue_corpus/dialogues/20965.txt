What was the best movie you've ever seen in theaters?
That's an odd question, I'm not sure.
Well. me and my husband were talking about it, so I figured you'd be a good person to ask.
Oh haha, yeah I do love movies.
Me too, so what was your favorite?
I'd have to say Titanic, everything about it was amazing.
Really? Why?
The emotions of Jack and Rose, seeing the ship sink on the huge screen, the sound in the theater, everything.
I never thought about it that, I guess it was really good.
Yeah, I don't think I've ever been so invested in a film.
I just told my husband about it, and he said that's the only movie he ever cried in.
Haha, really?
Yeah, he said he went with his mom and when Jack died he started to tear up.
That's so funny.  I can see why he would though, the setting and scene made me tear up too.
He said it didn't help that the music was epic around that time too.
True.  I think my heart will go on fit better with that movie than any song ever has.
Agreed. So we have 2 votes for titanic and 1 vote for wonder woman.
Who voted for wonder woman?
I did haha. We just saw it and it was so good.
Not better than Titanic though.
