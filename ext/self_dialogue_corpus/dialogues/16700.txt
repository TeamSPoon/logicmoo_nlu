What piece of music always gives you chills down your back?
Hmm, Passacaglia on B-A-C-H by Ron Nelson.
Oooh, good band piece. Have you ever played Resonances I by him?
No, what makes it special?
Well all brass starts off-stage and makes its way on-stage. They play small boxes of music that overlap.
Minimalist?
Yeah, tied with post-modernism.
What about you?
I really like Shostakovich's eleventh symphony.
I know a few of them, what is so great about it?
This was after the government started censoring his music.
And? Any messages in it?
Well, he signed it with his initials, D-S-C-H.
What's that?
In musical notes, D-Eb-C-B.
Ooh, that. Like B-A-C-H.
Yup, same concept.
Well you know that's not the first time he's used it, right?
Really?
Yeah, I know it plays a big part of Symphony no. 5.
