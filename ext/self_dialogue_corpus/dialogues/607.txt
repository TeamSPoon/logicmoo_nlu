Which team do you think will have a breakout season this year?
If I had to make a pick, I would say the Los Angeles Rams.
Interesting, why?
I'm very excited for their new coaches, whether it be Sean McVay or Wade Phillips.
I think that Wade Phillips is great and what he did with Denver's defense in the 2015 season was amazing. I'm less sure about Sean McVay.
Is it because he's still very young?
That's part of it. Also, I don't think what he did with the Washington Redskins was that impressive when you consider the talented players he had and the fact that Jay Gruden is the head coach.
While you are right about Gruden and the talent present in Washington last season, he helped turn Cousins from a mediocre backup to a Pro Bowl caliber quarterback. That's worth something.
Do you think he'll be able to repeat that success with Jared Goff?
I think that he has as a decent chance to do so. If he can make Goff just average, the Rams will be a huge threat given their talent.
Aside from Robert Quinn, what amazing players do they have?
Todd Gurley had a great rookie season and is bound for a bounce back season.
Even if Gurley were to have a great season, which is not guaranteed, the Rams lack a solid wide receiver.
What about Tavon Austin?
He has speed, but he's not great.
All he has to do is be decent and the Rams can copy the Seattle model of just relying on defense and a running game.
You act as if that's easy. Seattle had a proven running back in Marshawn Lynch and the best defensive secondary in the NFL.
I'm not saying that it's easy, but Robert Quinn, Aaron Donald, and Alec Ogletree areas tough as they come.
I guess that they could become more dominant under the direction of Wade Phillips. I just don't see a strong defensive secondary yet.
I'm not overly concerned about that. Wade Phillips does a great job of getting the most out of his defensive secondaries.
