I remember going to see Love Story when it came out in 1970.
Oh my god, what a tear jerker.
It really was.
Yes it starred Ali McGraw.
She was really pretty.
I wonder what ever happened to her, you never hear about her anymore.
Maybe retired?
That is true, you don't.
Her co star was Ryan O'Neil.
She was a singing instructor and met Ryan ONeils character who was a lawyer.
Yea and then they fell in love and moved in together.
And then she got an incurable disease.
What was it?
I do not really remember but it was very sad.
What was that famous line from that movie?
Oh "Love Means Never Having to say your'e sorry"
That's right.
Well I don't know about that...
It was a good movie but too sad.
It was a blockbuster at the time.
