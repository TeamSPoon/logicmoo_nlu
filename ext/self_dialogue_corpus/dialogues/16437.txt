I will check out that album.
Yes, please do, it is very nice.
I am not really into that type of music.
I know, but just try listening to their new album.
Do you have the album?
I plan to purchase it soon.
That's great!  If you don't mind, I will listen to it after you purchase it.
I would like that.
I am going to purchase it this evening.
I will stop by your home tomorrow to hear it.
What time do you plan to stop by?
Is five or six in the evening a good time?
Can you stop by a little later - like seven or so?
That will work out for me.  I will see you tomorrow, a little after seven.
It will be good to see you again.
It has been a while and I look forward to hearing the album.
I am sure you will enjoy it.
I really like this music - thanks for letting me know about this album.
I am so happy you are enjoying the album.
I plan to start listening to more of their music..
