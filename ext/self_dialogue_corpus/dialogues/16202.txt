Lately I've been really into post-rock.
Post-rock? What's that?
It's usually really quiet, lyricless music. But with rock instruments.
I could get into that.
I've always had trouble listening to music with lyrics when I'm working. It's distracting.
I can relate to that. So you think this would be good work music.
Definitely.
What bands should I try?
I've been really into this Japanese group, Toe.
What's good about them?
It feels like the rhythms they use are really unusual.
Wouldn't that also be distracting?
You'd think so. But it's actually weirdly soothing.
Huh. I wonder if they do that on purpose.
If I were them, I would if I could.
I wonder how much of that a musician can control?
I guess that applies to composers, too.
Writing music must be so difficult.
I bet it can be rewarding, though.
It must be.
