Have you ever seen Back to the beach?
I don't think so. Is it new?
No, it's from the 80's.
Oh, I don't remember ever hearing about it.
It stares Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. And Becky from Full House.
Is it any good?
Yes! It's one of my favorite 80's movies. I just found it online and was so happy.
What's it like?
It's typical 80's with beach music and corny outlines, but totally worth it.
Is it a musical?
No, it's not, but there are some songs and singing in it.
I may have to watch it.
It's so good. Peewee Herman has a small cameo in it.
Oh no way! That's funny.
He sings The Bird to a group of beach party goers.
That sounds hilarious.
Of you can get past the cheesy factor, I think you'd like it.
I love those movies from back then, so I'm sure I will like it.
I've seen it so much I can recite the entire movie.
Then I definitely have to see it.
