What do you think makes a good rap song?
That's a complex question.
Do you think it's the flow or the beat?
I think they are both important.
Do you think the flow is more important?
I think it is important to the song, yes.
You think it's more important than the beat?
Maybe, you can have a good flow without a beat.
I would say the flow is more important than the beat.
I would agree with that.
