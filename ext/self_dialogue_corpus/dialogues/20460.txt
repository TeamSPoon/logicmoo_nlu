Have you seen the movie Jonah Hex?
No, who is in it?
Well, Josh Brolin plays Hex, Megan Fox is the love interest, and John Malkovich plays the villian.
Okay, sound interesting, what's the plot.
Jonah Hex is a difigured former Confederate soldier turned boutny hunter. He gets shangied into working with the US government.
WHat do they need him to do?
To hunt down his former commanding officer, General Quentin Turnbull(John Malkovich).
Okay, but why do they want Jonah Hex to do this?
Because he's one of the best bouty hunters and has personal score to settle with Turnbull.
What's the history between Hex and Turnbull.
Turnbull starting attacking non military target(hospitals, churches, etc) and when Hex refused an direct order, he ended up shooting his best friend, Turnbull's son Jeb.
But I take it that wasn't the end of the story.
No, after the war, Turnbull hunted Jonah down, burned his family alive, and branded his intials into Jonah's face , and left him for dead.
Ouch!, and so Jonah wants reveneg for his family and his face?
No, Jonah wants revenge for his family, he disfigured his onw face to get rid of Turnbull's brand.
Double ouch, so what does Jonah Hex bring to the table?
Well, he's an excellent shot, has a number of specializied weapons, and the ability to talk with the dead.
Talk to dead people, how'd that come about.
After Turnbull left him, the Crow Indians found Hex, more dead than alive, and brought him back. But, they couldn't bring him all the way back to the land of the living.
So, bascially, Jonah can talk to dead people because he literally has one foot in the grave, so to speak?
