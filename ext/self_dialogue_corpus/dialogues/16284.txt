Have you ever heard of the Carpenters?
Yes, I really like their song, "Top of the World".
It was actually a cover of a Lynn Anderson song.
Did it ever become a number one song?
Yes, it was a Billboard number one song in 1973.
I like it because it is such an upbeat song while most of their songs are so melancholy.
My favorite is "Close to You".
Did you know that "Close to You" became their first number one hit?
Yes, that was in 1970.
"Rainy Days and Mondays" was another good song by the Carpenters.
It was written by Paul Williams.
Did you know that Karen really loved Christmas music?
No, I didn't know that.
They even released a Christmas album called "Christmas Collection" and another one called "Christmas Portrait".
Did the albums have any traditional Christmas Carols on them?
Yes, there were lots of traditional Christmas Carols including my favorite, "Carol of the Bells".
Did they have any original Christmas songs?
Yes, "Merry Christmas, Darling" was one of them and Richard wrote the music for it.
Did Richard write a lot of music?
Yes, he did.
