Are you a fan of Lil Wayne?
Yeah! I've been listening to him since Tha Carter.
What's your favorite record?
I'd have to say Tha Carter III.
I think that record definitely broke him into mainstream, but my favorite is Tha Carter II when he was still a little unknown.
You don't like anything from Tha Carter III?
I didn't say that, I just prefer Tha Carter II.
What's your favorite song from that record?
Best Rapper Alive, hands down was is my favorite.
That's a great song! I also like Fireman even though it's relatively mainstream.
