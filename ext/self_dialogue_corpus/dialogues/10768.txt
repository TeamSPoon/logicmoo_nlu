Have you seen the second Fast and the Furious movie?
Which one is that?
It was called 2Fast2Furious.
Is that the drifting one?
No, that was Tokyo Drift, the third in the series.
I am not sure if I have seen the second one, what happens?
It is where the FBI hires Brian to help take down a drug lord.
That does not sound too familiar
It was not the best one, quite forgettable.
Good thing I did not watch it.
