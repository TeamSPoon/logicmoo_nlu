How much should I expect to pay for a music theory tutor?
It depends. What year are you?
I'm a senior in high school preparing for college.
So you're looking for a way to study theory before undergrad?
Ideally I'd like to place out of a few courses to make my degree shorter. I've heard people take five years in this program and we can't afford that.
Who you study music with and where will determine the pay.
Are there any professors at my school who will work with me?
Sadly, no. They're not like instrument professors and don't have the time or availability to teach private lessons.
So who should I go see?
I'd recommend emailing a music theory professor at your school and asking for recommendations.
What do you think will happen?
You'll get a junior or senior to teach you, probably one who struggled with music theory.
I want someone who would get an A to teach me!
No, you don't.
Why not?
The people who struggled and got a B+ or A- are far better than those who got an A+ with no effort.
Really? Why?
Because they have no idea what it's like to struggle and not understand. They don't know how to relate to the students as much.
Ahh, that makes sense. How much?
A music theory tutor in undergrad can probably do it for $10-15 per hour. If you want a grad student, expect $20 or $30, depending on experience. You'll pay more but be better prepared.
