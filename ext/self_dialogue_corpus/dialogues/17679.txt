What kind of music have you been into lately?
I've been listening to a lot of 80's music.
Like what?
I've been rediscovering Judas Priest for a while, some of the earlier stuff.
What do they sound like?
Have you ever heard of Iron Maiden?
Yes, but I'm not very familiar with them.
Oh, well they are both classic metal bands from the 80's.
Ok, so Judas Priest is really heavy sounding?
Actually a lot of earlier stuff isn't really heavy.
What makes it metal then?
The vocals I would say, and the distorted guitars.
What do the vocals in classic metal sound like?
Hmm, most classic metal bands have singers that don't do a lot of noise making or screaming, but more operatic type stuff.
That's interesting, I guess I'll have to give them a listen.
Yeah, you should. I'd definitely give the Defenders of the Faith album a listen.
Are they talking about actual faith?
More like faith in heavy metal music.
I guess that goes along with their priest title.
You're right, I never thought of that.
