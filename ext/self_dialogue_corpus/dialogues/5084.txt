Did you see what the Phillies did yesterday?
What was it?
They extended their manager.
Oh wow thats a surprise.
Who does it on May 11th?
I guess a team who is struggling with their identity.
Yeah I presume he wants to show that the manager will be here for awhile.
Or wants to show stability in the franchise for upcoming free agents.
No one cares about that anymore.
It is all about the money but some guys want to win.
I dont think Philly is luring those free agents for awhile yet.
True, they look like they will be contenders soon.
I dont think so, but back to the extension.
You cant fire a guy who has been given nothing
I agree but they could have waited a few months.
No I think they want to establish trust.
Could be but this guy looks over his head.
He has been given no talent
Thats not true, they have Herrera.
I dont know about that he looks terrible.
