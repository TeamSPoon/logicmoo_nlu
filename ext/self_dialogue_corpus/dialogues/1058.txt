What is your favorite NFL team?
I am from Minnesota so it has to be the Vikings.
Yuck.
Why do you say yuck?
Because I am from Wisconsin.
Oh, so you are a cheese head?
That is right.  Packer fan through and through.
I guess that makes us rivals.
It sure does.
Who do you think will win this year?
I think the Packers will win both regular season games against the Vikings.
I doubt that.
They have done pretty well the past few years.
True, but I think this year will be different.
There is one thing I have liked about the Vikings in the past few years.
What is that?
I thought Adrian Pederson was a very good running back.
Yes he was.
That is all the compliments you will get from me.
I figured that.
