what do you think of damn by kendrick
its a amazing record
one of the best of 2017 so far
2017 has been good for music
yeah. it has kendrick, paramore, joey badass
joeys new album was so politically charged
joey has bars too!
he can really rap
paramore and halsey were great too.
oh yeah and a new logic album
logic has been doing his thing
his new album is so melodic
the insturments are so rich and beautiful
the production is the best its ever been for him
i still like under pressure the best
same. i didnt like bobby tarantino or incredible story
incredible story sounded like one long song
yeah, it got too boring
his next album will be his last
that sucks
