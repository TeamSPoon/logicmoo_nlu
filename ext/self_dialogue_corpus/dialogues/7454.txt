What's your favorite Disney movie?
Oh, that's a hard one. There's just so many classics!
It doesn't have to be just classics either, it can be some of the new ones they put out.
I think for me, it would have to be Inside Out for the new ones, and Mulan for the classics.
Interesting! I'd have to agree with you on that.
I think Mulan was just so different from the other princesses and Inside Out is a movie everyone can relate to.
I loved the animation from Inside Out, it was very pleasant to watch. Even my kids loved it.
I feel like it would definitely call out to children!
I like that Disney is sending positive messages to little children and making movies they can relate to.
Not only that, but adults can enjoy them too! That's when you know it's good.
