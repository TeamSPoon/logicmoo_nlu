Did you see they released the 2017 NFL Schedule?
I did! Looks like there will be some good games!
I know, it seems like the Draft just happened but Training Camp opens in 3 weeks.
Training Camp is such a tease, I think they need to shorten the pre-season to 2 games.
So do I, 4 games is unnecssary, especially when you have to pay the same price for tickets as you do in the regular season.
Those games should be comped, there is more entertainment at the high school level!
The third game isn't bad, at least you get to see the stars a bit longer.
Speaking of stars, why do you think Colin Kaepernick still isn't signed?
Hard to tell - he has such a unique skill set, I think the controversy is kind of drummed up to pass the time.
I tend to agree, I wasn't a big fan of his play dating back to his time at Nevada.
It would be interesting to see him get a shot with a team that is just a QB away.
Perhaps - maybe a team like the Texans could pick him up.
That's not a bad idea, it seems like any one they could sign would be better than they have.
Well they did take a QB high in the draft.
True - what was his name?
I don't remember, maybe that speaks to why they should look into signing someone else!
What do you think of the Raiders chances with Carr back?
They have as good of a chance as anyone, especially with Lynch in the fold.
It will be interesting to see, the AFC West is kind of a mixed bag with Denver, San Diego and KC.
I think KC will be the team to beat in that Division, but I've always pulled for Rivers in San Diego.
