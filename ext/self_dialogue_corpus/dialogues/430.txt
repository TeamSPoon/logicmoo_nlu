Did you hear Tom Brady has written a book?
No, is it about football and the NFL, or about his personal life?
It's about training to be an athlete more than about the games or teams.
He must know something about training since he's such a great player.
The book title is about sustaining peak performance. I imagine he does have to really work hard to stay in shape since he's had such a long career.
That was something last winter when New England won the Super Bowl.
I know, it was New England's fifth time winning the Super Bowl.
I would have thought he would have written a book about the games he's played.
He said the book shows how he's been able to succeed as an athlete because of the way he trains.
So it's not just a lot of practice that makes him good?
No, he has an unusual way of training he said.
I'm sure that will be useful to new athletes who are trying to make it onto the big teams.
He also said he has an unusual approach and method of exercise.
I would think exercise is super important for being able to keep up your strength during the game.
Yeah, everyone could use exercise to keep up their energy at whatever they do.
I'm curious how much time someone like Brady exercises to stay in shape.
The book comes out in September.
I think it would be interesting reading.
He should go on a book tour and sign copies, and they would sell out everywhere he went.
Wow, wouldn't that be something to be able to get Tom Brady's autograph?
