Mr church? N. haven't seen it
Yes. Mr Church. Eddie Murphy is a cook/care taker.
That's not exactly a role for Eddie Murphy
Not his usual role, but it's a really good one
What's it about and how is it related to Lolita?
It's like the upside down mirror image of what Lolita portrays.
Pray tell.
See, in Lolita, the man moves into the house because he's attracted to the girl. right?
Yes. And in Mr Church, he's not attracted to the girl?
No. he's attracted to the mother, not in the way we would think. In the most innocent loving way. And in Lolita, intimacy including sex causes the divide between the two right? And the she ends up getting pregnant etc
Well, at least the way Lolita leaves is somewhat due to the fact that she was having an affair with what's-his-name.
yes, but in Mr Church, it's the absence of intimacy that causes the girl to leave. and then gets into an accident, which ends up
So, both girls get pregnant, but neither by the main male character
yes
And in both the main characters drift apart due to intimacy issues. In Lolita, the man is jealous of the girl's intimacy with other men, and in Mr Church the girl is angry at the lack of intimacy between them
Well, in Mr Church, the intimacy as in emotinal closeness. nothing sexual at all.
Huh. ok. then both girls are knocked up. Then what?
yes, but in Lolita girl is knocked up only after things have settled and all the anger and hatred has whittle away. In Mr Church. the fact that the girl is pregnant is the reason why two get close.
So it's a story of a recompense or a sort. Mr Church is getting what he deserves for taking care of the girl and the mother. Humbert in Lolita gets what he deserves for taking advantage of the girl and the mother.
You got it. It's the upside down mirror image.
