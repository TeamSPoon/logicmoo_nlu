I wonder if they're going to make any other Taken movies.
You mean the one with Liam Neeson?
Yeah, you know the one he goes crazy on the bad guys.
I saw it. Great movie, don't mess with him.
If it was my daughter, I'd go nuts too on them.
Well, think you'd need some training first.
Okay , okay. You know what I mean.
Yes, he sure does make them guys pay.
I wouldn't mind having him as my dad.
Me either.
