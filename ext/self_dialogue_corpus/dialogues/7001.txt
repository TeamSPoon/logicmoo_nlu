Did you watch the movie Beauty and the Beast when you were a kid?
Yes!  I went to the theater to see it.
So did I!  My mom saved up and was able to take me and my sister.
I went with my brother and he hated it.
Oh?  I can't believe someone hated Beauty and the Beast.
Granted, he was on the verge of being a teenager.  He didn't have time for a love story, I guess.
Oh, that's really funny!
The best part is now he's an adult and has to watch it with his kids.
Does he still hate it?
No, he told me the first time he watched it with his son, he cried.
