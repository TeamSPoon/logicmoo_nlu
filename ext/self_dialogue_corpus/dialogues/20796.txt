Hey, ever watched the moive Shoot'em Up.
No, I saw some of the promos, but I never saw the fillm. What's it about?
Clive Owen plays Mr. Smith, a very skilled gunfighter who witnessed a pregant women being chased by a obivous killer.
So, I take he intervenes?
Yeah, he even delievers her baby in the midst of a shoot out, but she takes a round to the head and dies.
So, he's left with the baby?
Yeap, and the assassin's want the bady dead.
Why, it's a baby
The reaason is the baby's father and why he had the kid in the first place.
Ok, so why'd he have a kid?
He's a strongly anti-gun US Senator loking to become President and he has leukemia. The baby can serve as a bone marrow donor to save his life.
And I take the assassin's work for someone who wants him out of the way.
Yes, they work for a big time gun manufacturer who stands to lose everything if the Senator becomes President.
So, SMith is in a bit of a pickle, I take it.
Yes, he has to keep the baby and himself alive, while learning who and why of the situation.
Okay, besides Clive Owen, who else is in this picture.
Well, Monice Bellucci plays a prostitiute friend of SMith's and is the love interest of the film.
Any other big name actors in this film?
Yes, Paul Giamatti plays a fromer FBI porfiler turned hitman who doggs SMith from the beginning to the end of the film.
Alright, I might give this film a look.
