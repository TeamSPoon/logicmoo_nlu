Have you ever seen Ferris Beullers Day Off?
Yes that movie is an awesome 80s classic.
I love those high school 80s movies John Hughes makes some great films.
Yeah I know. I think my favorite one he did was Sixteen Candles.
Oh my god yes!! I love Molly Wringwald shes an awesome actress.
Have you every seen her movie Pretty In Pink?
Yea that one was really intense. I felt bad for her being poor and not having her mother around.
Yeah and how her boyfriend was embarrassed of her.
Well he he was at first but by the end he became a better person.
I agree I think it was just his friends making him act that way.
I loved the dress she created in that movie it was so 80s.
Yeah I know what you mean the dress was really nice.
Another 80s film I like is that Stand By Me movie. Did you ever get to see that one?
Yeah that one was really touching. It makes me think of my childhood friends.
I really enjoy Stephen king movies also.
Yeah he makes some odd movies. I was actually surprised when I saw the movie and it was just about some kids. Nothing supernatural in it.
I honestly think that is my favorite movie.
I don't think its mine but I really enjoyed it.
Yeah whats your favorite movie?
Mine is Artificial Intelligence buy Stephen Spielberg.
