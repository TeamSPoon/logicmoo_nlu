Did you ever go to Vacation Bible School as a kid?
No I don't think I did. What is that?
It's kind of like a camp but only for a couple hours a day for about a week.
Is it in a church?
Yes it's in a church. They have a lot of music and doing hand motions/dancing to the songs.
That sounds like fun!
It was! It was always the highlight of every summer as a child.
My family didn't really go to church growing up so I didn't participate in that.
Oh okay, I understand.
I may send my kids one day though. Have your kids gone?
Oh yes! Even brought home a CD we had to listen to.
What kind of songs were on it?
It was a Galactic Starveyor's theme and one of the songs was "Sin Messed Everything Up."
Sounds kind of cool actually!
It's good music to play in the car, I don't have to worry about bad lyrics.
Good point. Some music is awful these days.
It really is!
I'm very careful what I allow my kids to listen to.
That's good. What kind of music do they like?
Some country, some pop. Basically whatever I play.
