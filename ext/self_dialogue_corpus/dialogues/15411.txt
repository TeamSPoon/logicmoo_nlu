Do you ever listen to trap music?
Yeah, sometimes. I have some on my playlist.
I've been getting into it a lot more lately.
That's cool. I think it's really fun to see live.
I haven't seen it live, but I could see that. It would be fun to dance to.
Do you have any artists you would recommend in the genre?
I'm really into Josh Pan right now.
I don't think I've heard of him before.
He has a song called "Opus" that's amazing.
Is he a producer or a rapper?
He just makes the beats but some songs feature rappers.
That's really cool. I'll have to check it out.
Ekali is really good, too. Have you heard of him?
I have, actually. He did that Gallant remix.
Are you talking about "Weight in Gold"?
Yes, that song is beautiful.
I agree. A lot of his songs are similar to that.
I would love to see that song played live. Songs are always better live.
That would be awesome.
I would sing along to every word.
