How many Super bowls did the Steelers win?
That would be six.
Wow, that's a lot.
Yes, that's my team.
I know. I remember the parties.
Black and yellow, one of my favorite songs.
Don't forget the Terrible Towel.
I have a bunch from going to the games.
Who is your favorite player?
I'd have to say now Antonio Brown.
Yeah, he's pretty good.
Terry Bradshaw was a great quarterback for them.
He was, what year was he still playing?
Not sure when he started. His last was 1983 though.
Is he in the Hall of Fame?
Yes.
They have a few Hall of Famers don't they?
Yes, and don't forget Mean Joe Greene.
I did forget about him.
I know my steelers. They're going to win this year.
