Do you like anime music?
I love anime music. I've always been a fan of jpop and kpop.
What are your favorite anime songs?
Well, almost every song from the openings in Naruto are my favorite.
Yea I like Naruto songs a lot too. Daily life was great.
Daily life was great, but Closer was amazing. I still listen to that song.
Yea, it's too bad cartoons in American don't take music as seriously as in Japan.
I know, it's a shame, because music can make all the difference.
So true, look at fairy tail, the music in fairy tail has become iconic.
Yea, I doubt that anime would even be popular without that music.
So, true. Have you heard Tank! from cowbow bebop?
Yea, that's another classic. What about Battlecry from Samurai Champloo?
I can't believe I almost forgot about Samurai Champloo. Yea Battlcry is one of my favorite songs.
I love inner universe from ghost in the shell.
Oh yea, that song gets me so pumped.
Unravel by Tokyo Ghoul is incredible also.
I'm not a big fan of Tokyo Ghoul, but I do love the opening song to Attack on Titan.
Yea that song is pretty epic.
Anime music really is amazing.
It's one of the main reasons I watch anime at all.
