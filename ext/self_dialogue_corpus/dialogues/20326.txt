Have you gotten to see Despicable Me 3 yet?
I haven't, is it any good?
I haven't either.  But I want to as soon as possible!
Who is the director?
Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda are the directors for this animated movie.
What is the story line?
The mischievous Minions hope that Gru will return to a life of crime after the new boss of the Anti-Villain League fires him.
Does he actually do it? Instead, Gru decides to remain retired and travel to Freedonia to meet his long-lost twin brother.
That sounds fun.  How much has the box office made yet?
It just opened, but it has made $10 million so far.
June 30th is when it is supposed to release all around the country.
Yes, it had some pre-release dates I am sure.
I have enjoyed the Despicable Me stories,  I will see this one as well.
The second one was my favorite one.
Yes it was great, the minions were the best in that movie.
Whenever the minions try to fix anything, they usually end up destroying things!
They are so cute, I even have a bracelet with them on it!
Where did you get that?
My boss had one given to her, and the whole team got bracelets.
Evidently, you are her minions!
