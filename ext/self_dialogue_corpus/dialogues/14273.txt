Don't you think the Men's NCAA tournament is to short?
March madness baby! Yeah, I think more teams should be added.
I agree, I know there is more than sixty teams to start. The NCAA should double the amount of teams that are allowed to enter.
This would prolong the tournament a little but I am confident the tournament could still be finished in March.
Yeah, currently only a few games left to play on the weekend towards the end of the tournament.
I know, I get bummed out when it is over.
Did you hear that Indiana University finally fired there head coach?
Yeah, I think he was there for about 6 or 7 seasons.
I love Indiana basket ball and Indiana University has not been the same since Miles Brand fired Coach Bobby Knight.
That is a fact. Bobby Knight might very well be the greatest coach to ever coach college basketball.
I agree. Do you remember when his temper got the best of him and he threw the chair across the basketball court?
How could I forget that? He got thrown out of the game for that antic.
He received a large fine. I can't remember the details but I think he was also suspended for a game or two?
I believe so. I can't remember either.
This new coach is suppose to be promising.
Yeah, I heard he is one the rare coaches to win five hundred games before he reached age fifty.
That is definitely a milestone.
The new coach could be on course to break some of the college coaching records.
Yes, I have heard only good things about the new coach. What was the new coaches name?
Shoot! I can't remember his name either. It is on the tip of my tongue.
