What your thoughts on the eagles this year?
They can be in the mix.
Good move getting legarrette blount.
He'll definitely help.
You would think so.
He's good around the goal line.
Didn't he score eighteen touchdowns last year?
I believe so,yes.
They added Alshon Jeffery too.
A good wide receiver.
I'm not so sure about Carson wentz yet.
He's young but he had some good moments.
We'll see how he does this year.
They added a couple of defensive ends too.
Who did they get?
Chris long and Derek Barnett.
They will definitely help the defense.
I think so too.
They added defensive tackle Tim Jernigan too.
Oh wow,I didn't know that either.
