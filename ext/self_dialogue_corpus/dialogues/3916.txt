Have you seen any good thiller movies lately?
I just watched the Accountant.
Who is in that?
Ben Afflac. He is really good in it. Abused by his dad but trained to be an assassin.
Sounds interesting. I like him, he's a good actor.
He also has autism and does math like the Rainman.
Smart and a bad ass. I have to wait for it to be on HBO again.
What's up with him and Jen Gardner?
I don't know but I heard he was doing the nanny.
Go figure! He should just be single and not make anymore kids.
