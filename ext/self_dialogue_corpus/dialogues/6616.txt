I just saw the new Beauty and the Beast movie and it was amazing!
I have been wanting to see that!
I suggest you go! I went with my cousins and am so glad I saw it!
Was it like the original?
Very similar, but different in some ways.
Like what? Would a fan of the original still like it?
I think so! There was more character development for Belle, and her father.
That's interesting!
Yeah! Belle was the inventor in this one, but it was a good addition to the plot!
I'll definitely go see it!
