Hey, how ya doing?
Great I just saw the new Wonder Woman movie last week.
Oh how was it?
It was great. I liked the story line, it was definitely not as cheesy as the one I saw back in the 80s!
Bet Gal Gadot was pretty easy on the eyes too!
Yep, but she is actually a pretty tough woman in real life. She used to train with the Israely military.
Oh wow! That's crazy.
I like the whole plot too, from the island she was being brought up, how she met the guy, and how she became The Wonder Woman.
Any cool fight scenes?
Definitely! When she was fighting the soldiers and when she was fighting the villain. It's pretty cool.
