Who is more evil? Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?
Ooh, good question. There's so many places this can go.
I think Darth Vader.
Why is that?
He was a fully-trained Jedi, and CHOSE to do what he did. For decades.
Kylo Ren helped destroy an entire star system.
Yes, but he's young. He still has time to be redeemed sooner rather than later.
Kylo is more powerful for sure, though.
Why do you say that?
Darth couldn't sense his own daughter in the same room as him. That's kind of sad.
