I had a romantic date with Mike on Saturday.
Really? Did you go out somewhere nice?
Actually, no, we stayed home at his place.
Did you make dinner?
No, he ordered in. We had a ton of Chinese food, and he bought two bouquets of flowers for the living room, and we watched a movie on dvd.
What movie did you watch?
"Titanic". He said I'm his Rose, and he's my Jack, only he would never let go of me.
Oh my, that does sound romantic. That movie was so sad at the end when Rose had to let go of Jack's dead hand and watch him slip into the water so she could blow the whistle for help.
I know, I couldn't believe he had "Titanic" on dvd. He said he's always loved boats, and wanted to know if I would like to go on a cruise with him someday.
What did you say?
I said yes, but we would wear our life jackets the whole time!
Oh how funny. I don't know if I would want to go on a crusie after watching "Titanic."
Well, Rose did survive. Kate Winslet was so captivating in that role as Rose.
Leonardo DiCaprio was so cute as Jack that lots of fans fell in love with him.
The movie really stirred a lot of emotion in me when the life boats wouldn't turn back to help others because they didn't want to become too overloaded.
I know, I felt like that one woman who was arguing with them and was so upset.
That movie really made people feel and picture what it must have been like for al those poor people.
You like to think it couldn't happen now, because boats are safer. But there have been some terrible ferries sinking, and there was that one big cruise ship that wrecked.
I know, so "Titanic" is just as relevant today about what could happen and what it's like.
Maybe you should suggest to Mike instead of a cruise, you just take a beach holiday and watch the boats out on the water!
