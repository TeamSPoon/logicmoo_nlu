I really liked Twenty One Pilots music do you know who they are?
I think I do can you tell me one of their songs?
One of my favorites is "Heathens".
Oh yea I know that song! Wasn't it on the movie Suicide Squad?
Yes it was! I think it was great.
They also sang another great song I love called "Ride."
Yes I know that one! I listened to it over and over as I would drive to school.
Their music is always the best. Not one bad song.
I completely agree.
I need to buy more of their music.
