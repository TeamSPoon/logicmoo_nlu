Did you ever see Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
Oh my goodness of course!  I absolutely love that movie.
Yeah it's one of my favorites too.  It was on television the other day.
I haven't seen it in awhile.  Remind me who is in it?
Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are some of the main characters.  It came out back in 1988.
Wow, I can't believe it's been almost thirty years.
Yeah, hard to believe.  I thought it was great the way they mixed cartoons and real people.
Yeah, that was so original and unique.  I've never seen that done before.
Nope!  I don't think it's been done since.
I haven't seen anything like it.  It had a great story line too.
I know, it was hilarious.  The rabbit was so funny.
Yeah, and Jessica Rabbit was great.
Yeah, they were all memorable.  It was neat that it had Looney Tunes in it, too.
Yeah, I know.  I can still remember watching it in the theatre.
Me too!  It's crazy it was so long ago.
It seems like they should've had a sequel to that one.
Yeah it was definitely popular, I'm kinda surprised they didn't.
Me too.  Who directed it?
I believe it was Robert Zemeckis.
Oh, I didn't know that.
