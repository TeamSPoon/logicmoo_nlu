Hi there.
Hey.
What's going on?
Not much you?
Same.
What kind of music do you like?
I like a lot of pop and rock.  I like some country.
Really country music?
Yeah sure why not?
It all just sounds so terrible.
Oh c'mon it's not that bad.
Oh but it is.
Agree to disagree.
Okay.
What about you?
I like a lot of EDM, techno, drum and bass, that kind of thing.
Oh interesting.
You don't like that kind of stuff?
No not really.
Oh okay.
