There's a Beatle's Tribute band that's celebrating their tenth anniversay.
Wow, they must be really good to last that long.
They all have regular jobs, but they play 90 shows every year.
Where are they from?
Detroit. They have a website with their upcoming dates.
I wonder if it's all really old people at their shows.
I think it said they actually get a lot of young people at their shows.
They probably have heard their parents and other people talk about the Beatles, and want to get to see what the music was like.
The band is really professional. They studied the songs, and use Beatle's costumes and instruments.
They must be pretty good to still be playing ten years later.
