Was just listening to one of my favorite Rock bands.
Who's that?
KISS. Got to love them.
They are really good.
They've been around forever. Even our kids like them.
Really? They don't like pop music?
They like all kinds. They went to a KISS concert a few years ago with us.
That's neat that the whole family enjoys somehthing.
My favorite song is Crazy Night.
That is a good one. I agree.
