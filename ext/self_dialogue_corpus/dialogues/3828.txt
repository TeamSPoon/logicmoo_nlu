What's a good thriller from the past 10 years?
I really liked Shutter Island, from 2010
Is that with leonardo Dicaprio or no?
Yeah he's the main detective, trying to find an escaped mental patient
So is the prison on an island? LIke Alcatraz?
Yeah just like Alcatraz, but a lot bigger
Is the movie scary? I might watch it with my wife
It's not that scary, just very tense and suspenseful
And how good is the ending?
It's super great, there's a big plot twist!
