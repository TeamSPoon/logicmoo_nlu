Will XMen ever stop making films?
They keep rebuffing the cast, so probably not.
Cant you see them branching into the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
No I think a different studio owns the rights.
OH ok that makes sense but I Would love to see Deadpool fight with Spiderman
Yeah that would be the ultimate.
Almost have like a DC/Marvel movie as well.
That would never happen because of money.
I think it would be off the wall.
It would make more money than any other movie ever!
