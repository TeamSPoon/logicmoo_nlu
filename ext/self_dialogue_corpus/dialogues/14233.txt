And what about Lady Gaga? You like her?
Oh yeah. Love her. Such an amazing singer, to start with.
Oh yeah. And an amazing performer as well. She looks like the real thing you know. Real intense.
She does. It's funny how someone who is all about costumes and disguises can feel so authentic at the same time.
It is, really. But I feel like a lot of her songs are clearly about her, and the way she lives her life.
Yes. With all the confusion, hubris and craziness it involves.
Really. And she does make it real - the power trips, the crazy partying and the loneliness, and the weird way to interact with people that it all generates.
She's good at craziness. Really good at showing it too. Her videos are something else.
They're so incredible! I love the video for Applause. It's mesmerizing.
I know! It's insane and it's fascinating - and beautiful!
