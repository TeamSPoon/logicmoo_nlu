So, how do you think the Panthers will do this year?
Gosh, I don't know.  When is their first game?
They play the 49ers on September 10th.
Oh wow, that seems late.
Yeah, the season starts September 7th I think.
Is it a home game?
Yes for the 49ers.
Well how do you think they'll do?
I don't know.  I hope they have a better season
Did they draft some good players?
Well, I don't know.  I know they got McCaffrey and Samuel.
Are they supposed to be good?
I guess we'll find out!
Well the 49ers haven't done too well.
Yeah it should be a close game.
Hopefully both teams will have a better season this year.
I hope so for their sake!
Maybe their new players can help turn things around.
Yeah.  I still like watching the Panthers play.
That's probably just because we're from North Carolina.
