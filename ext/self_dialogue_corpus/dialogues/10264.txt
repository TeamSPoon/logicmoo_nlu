I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?
Has to be "Crank" hands down
No way "John Wick"  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in "Crank"  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.
Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene
