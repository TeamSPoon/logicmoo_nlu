Have you seen the movie The Great Wall?
No, is it for tourists?
No, it is a story about 1000 years ago, on why the Great Wall was built.
Oh, why was it built?
The story has two guys from Europe that reaches the wall after just surviving an attack by wild animals.
Was it brutal?
Very, they also described an ancient dragon that has been showing up every once in a while and kills many people.
A flying Dragon?
No, because the wall would be useless. These dragons would climb the walls and attack the defenders and then the cities around them.
What does the European guys have to do with it?
At first the Europeans were made prisoners, but were able to save some guards and get freedom.
Did they kill the dragons?
Some were killed but the Europeans had skills and the Chinese were able to use their skill and finally win.
What kind of skills?
One of them (Matt Damon) was very good with bow and arrows. The other was good with a sword.
How did they kill the dragons?
You should see the movie because it has grace, art and poise when fighting the dragons.
It sounds good.
Has a little love story in it too.
I gotta see that.
