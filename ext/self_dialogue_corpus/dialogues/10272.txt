The Raid: Redemption is one of the best action movies ever.
I saw it, it felt like the movie barely slowed down.
The first half is so depressing, with all the heroes run through a meat grinder.
And then when it did slow down after that, with the guy hiding in the wall and the machete cutting him, the tension was so unbelievably high.
Oh god and then after that it just keeps on being this relentless martial arts movie.
It just didn't stop.
That last fight with Mad Dog was wild.
I know; I felt like the actors were just as exhausted as the characters.
I can't believe the skill and stamina they had. That was a nonstop movie.
I wish more action movies were like that!
