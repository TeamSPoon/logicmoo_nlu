My favorite superhero in the Avengers movie is the Hulk.
Oh me too! I love what's his face . . .
Ruffalo, Mark Ruffalo
Yes! Ruffalo! He's so much better than Edward Norton was, in The Incredible Hulk.
Although, Norton wasn't too horrible.
No, he wasn't. But Ruffalo brings more deep feeling to the part.
And - this is probably silly - but he looks more likely to turn into the Hulk.
Not as slim as Norton?
Exactly. In some ways, he's more like Eric Bana in Hulk.
When was that made? 2003?
