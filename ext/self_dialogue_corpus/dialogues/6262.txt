Do you consider Pixar movies the same as Disney movies?
I do now, but for a while I viewed them as separate things.
I wonder how interconnected the two studios are at this point?
I figure they're pretty well-connected. I think John Lasseter runs both of them.
I wish John Lasseter ran the entire company.
I agree with that. He seems like a very creative and intelligent guy.
What's your favorite Pixar film?
I love Ratatouille. That's definitely my favorite.
Yeah, that's a great one.
I've probbably seen it about 5 times.
