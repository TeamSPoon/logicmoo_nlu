Did you see any of the star wars movies?
Yes I saw the sixth one.
That is it? That is strange.
Yeah but I liked it a lot though.
What was your favorite part.
I loved when darth vader had the mask taken off.
Oh that part was awesome.
It was sad though.
You should see the other ones!
I will make a point to!
