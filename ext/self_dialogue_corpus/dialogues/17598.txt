Man Faith Evans and El DeBarge just blew my mind.
Why you say that?
I just heard that song Lay With You.
Oh that's my jam. You just now hearing it?
Yeah.
That thing at least five maybe six or seven years old.
I don't where I was when they made this but the video is hot.
I know. Those two look good together.
You know El DeBarge been that dude ever since he married Janet Jackson.
I know right. THOSE two should have made a song together.
I don't think they could have made anything like this one though.
I know. I want to hear some Mariah Carey.
Which one?
I like My All. I think I might go put that on the stereo.
What do you have, Pandora?
No. I got all my music on download. I have over two thousand songs.
That's all?
That's all? Do you know how long it took me to add two thousand songs to my library?
You lame. I got over ten thousand in mine.
I guess so when you be downloaded seven-hundred-song-playlists at a time.
