How do you like Houston this year?
I'm mixed on them.  Some pros and cons.
Give me some pros first.
Okay.  Well, you get JJ Watt back.
Huge plus in my opinion.  Best defensive player in the NFL.
When healthy, sure, but he's been really banged up as of late.
I also think they'll be better at QB.
Really?  I think that was a con.
Getting rid of Osweiler is always a plus.
It was crazy how they traded him to the Browns.
They signed him to a ridiculous contract.
And he was awful!  Horrible move.
But he's not on their books anymore so it doesn't matter.
But QB is a con for me because of what they have.
Tom Savage is the starter.
Yeah, and he's just a guy.  They're waiting on the future.
You mean how they drafted Watson?
Right.  I like Watson, think he can be a good pro, but it's going to take time.
He probably starts maybe a year or so away.
They need to get some better weapons for the QB regardless of who starts.
