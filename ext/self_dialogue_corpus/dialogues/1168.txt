So where did that guy play in college?
That guy... Yes because we all know who that guy is.
You know the one who scored highest on the Woderlic or whatever
Oh, Harvard. McInally was a punter and wider receiver for the Bengals.
What was his major?
I don't know. But he did graduate with a cum laude
Wow, that's a big deal. He really is a smart guy.
Smarts are needed in sports. A lot of the plays are very tricky and need smarts to execute them well. That's why NFL cares.
it makes you wonder how Claiborne can function at the level though
Maybe he just didn't care for the test much.
oh,. so like, he just didn't care and didn't even try hard?
Yeah, who knows.
I think I did hear that he said something like oh I blew that test off or something
Oh yeah. he said, "Nothing on that test came with football"
Hahaha. That's funny.
Well, he's an average player.
So maybe Wonderlic does predict performance.
Well, Frank Gore has the second lowest score at 6. he was a leading rusher for the 49ers for years.
Huh, he had 9 seasons with 1000 yards rushing.
That's whole lotta running with da ball.
