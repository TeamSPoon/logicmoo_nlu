Man the end of Empire is pretty intense
How so?
Well there's the scene where they start torturing Han Solo
Oh yeah, he starts screaming off camera
Right, and then they freeze him in the carbon freezing
Yeah, that was pretty emotional
Yeah, Leia finally shows his love for him.
And then Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father
Yes, he wasn't happy about that
No, especially after he cut off his hand.
