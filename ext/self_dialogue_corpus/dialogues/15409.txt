What is your favorite album?
I would say graceland by paul simon, if I had to choose.
That was a great song, not sure what else is on the album. Can you list some?
sure, I know what I know, Diamonds on the soles of her shoes,you can call me al... those are my other top faves
I also like all those songs, he is such a great musician.
His lyrics are so meaningful and deep. I feel so much when he sings.
Ya a good song or musician can do that for sure. I also really like his early work with garfunkle.
Yes they had some good hits too. Sound of silence especially stands out.
That and parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme for me were favorites.
Also a good one. You know he was married to carrie fischer? seems surreal to me now for some reason.
I did know. Maybe because she died.
Or more just the amount of talent in that one marriage kind of astounds me,
Do you know if any of his songs are about carrie?
I believe hearts and bones for sure.
That is interesting makes sense. I wonder who diamonds on the soles of her shoes was about.
I don't know but I bet she's a rich girl and she don't try to hide it... hahahaha.
Funny, modern day paris hilton.
Oh please don't ever lump her in a conversation with the great paul simon.
I heard he used to like to party quite a bit, out in the clubs in LA back in the day quite often.
Probably very true. what famous person wasn't?
