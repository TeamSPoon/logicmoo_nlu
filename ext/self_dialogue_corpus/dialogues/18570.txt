Have you heard Beth Dittos fake sugar?
Yes I think it's some of the best music of the year.
What band did she used to be in?
I think it was Le Tigre?
No. It was called Gossip.
I you're right. I haven't listened to Indie Rock music in ages.
What are you listening to these days?
Mostly real sad folk music
Anything good I might like?
Lord Huron has a song called she built a fire.
I'll listen to it. What else?
Father John Misty's new album is perfect
I've heard that. I like it.
Hurray for the Riff Raff also has a good new album.
It's more rock than folk lately
True. I liked their song June Bug Waltz
That one is my favorite.
I miss the fiddles in their sound
Me too.
But I guess artists have to evolve.
