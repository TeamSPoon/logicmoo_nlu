How was the 76'ers last game?
It was great!
Did you see that last minute shot at the buzzer?
Yeah, that was awesome!
I can't believe they got that last shot in.
I couldn't believe it either.
That was outstanding.
What did you think about all times the 76'ers were fouled?
Yes, the other team was so rough.
I like a lot of action.
Yes, but sometimes they go too far.
Did you see how tall those players were?
Yes, some are over 7 feet tall.
I wouldn't be able to see past them.
That sure helps with the shots.
Yes, it helps with slam dunks.
I wish I could slam dunk.
Yes, the closest I come to a slam dunk is a dunk in a wastebasket.
When do the 76'ers play next?
They are playing next Tuesday at home.  I can't wait to watch them again.
