Have you ever watched Aladdin?
That movie was great, a classic rags to riches story.
Aladdin did get pretty lucky.
I know if he didn't find the genie I wonder what would have happened.
These movies also has a sense of magic so it's tough to say.
Disney really makes it seem like everything is possible.
The Genie was a funny character.
I enjoyed the Genie a lot. He was a magical character.
Do you think the romanticism was too cliche?
It could be seen that way but I still liked the movie.
