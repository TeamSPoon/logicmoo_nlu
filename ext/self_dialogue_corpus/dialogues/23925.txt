Wha upcoming movies are you exited to see?
I want to watch the new Thor Raganarok movie.
I want to watch it too, I thought the trailer was pretty good and fun.
Yeah it was, I like the part were Thor fights with the Hulk.
I know, that looks like an epic fight I wonder who will win.
I think that The Hulk will definetely win.
Well I desagree I think Thor is stronger and more in control.
Could be, its a though choice but well see soon enough.
Yeah hopefully we will.
What about you what movies are you exited to see?
I want to watch Annabelle 2 The Creation.
Uh! that movie looks way to scary for me.
Yes I think its going to be pretty scary.
I watched the first one and couldnt sleep for a week.
Really! that long!
Yeah, it had a high impact on me.
I can see why you donÂ´t want to watch the second part.
Probably best if I dont although who knows I might end up not sleeping for a week again.
Did you watch the movie alone last time?
Acutally I watched it with a couple of friends.
