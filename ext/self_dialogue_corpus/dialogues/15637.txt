What do you think of Coldplay?
I haven't heard that name in a long time. I don't like his music.
I don't really know anyone that does anymore.
I feel like it doesn't appeal to the younger crowds at all.
In my opinion, his type of music has evolved beyond his abilities.
Yeah, still you have to give credit for the success he's had.
That's true. At the time I don't think there was anything like it.
Any time people push musical boundaries is respectable, for sure.
I wonder if he still makes new music.
I'm not sure. I haven't heard of anything.
The closest I get to that type of music is deadmau5.
That's another person who really was unique when he came out.
Yeah, I think the mouse mask is what pushed him to the next level.
Totally. That's some genius branding.
It's unmistakable. I guess it doesn't hurt that his music is really beautiful, too.
Did you ever listen to "Faxing Berlin" by him?
Yes, I remember the first time I heard that song. I had never heard anything like it.
It's too bad so many people have stolen his sound.
I agree. It's a bit watered down now.
Definitely, but I still enjoy it when I'm just trying to relax.
