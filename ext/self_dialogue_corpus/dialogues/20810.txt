Have you seen the trailer for the new movie "Beauty and the Beast"?
Yes, it looks like it is going to be pretty good.
Did you see the first one Disney made in 1991?
Yes, my daughter loved Belle.
It was a really cute movie and it has a good life lesson in it.
I know you really should not judge someone by the way they look.
In the trailer the beast sort of has an attractive appeal. He does not seem so frightening.
Emma Watson sure has turned into a beautiful young lady.
She sure has but she was just the cutest little girl. I could tell she would be pretty when she got older.
Do you know who the actor is that is playing the beast?
I think it is Dan Stevens.
What other movies has he been in?
He was in The Guest and Downton Abbey, he is a pretty good-looking man.
Oh, I never saw those movies, have you?
No, but I do want to see Beauty and the Beast.
Have they release it yet for the theaters?
Yes, it was released back in March.
Oh, well then it will be on DVDs really soon now. You might as well wait and watch it at home.
But the movie theater seems to make a movie come to life.
That's true and when you go to the theater you always remember who you was with.
