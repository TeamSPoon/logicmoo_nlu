Do you like Kenny Chesney?
I love Kenny.  I've seen him in concert many times.
Nice, how was it?
He was awesome.  The first time I saw him was still today the best concert I ever saw.
When was that?
Back in something like 2005 at Gillette Stadium.  Keith Urban and Pat Green were there too.
Sounds like it must have been awesome.
So favorite Kenny song?
It would have to be when the Sun Goes Down.
Yeah, that whole album was awesome.
It sure was.  I used to listen to it over and over.
Yeah so many good songs.  Keg in the closet.
How about some people change.
Or anything but mine.
That was one of the best.  His songs are so relaxing.
Oh, a lot of people don't realize that was when old blue chair came out.
Yeah, I knew that.  Because he released it again.
And then it got super popular.
I know, especially when Cruzin Rum sponsored him.
Yeah, and then he changed Malibu to Cruzin.  I remember that.
