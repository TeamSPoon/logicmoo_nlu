What kind of music have you been listening to these days?
Mostly pop. I'm totally obsessed with pop music.
Who are some of your favorite artists? I love that new Bruno Mars song "That's What I Like."
ME TOO! I love that song. No matter what I'm doing it always makes me want to dance. Besides Bruno I like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, Halsey, etc. I could go on forever.
Do you like Katy Perry's new song Swish Swish? I just saw her perform that on Saturday Night Live.
Yes! I saw that! I've read some bad reviews of her new album Witness, but so far I like every song I hear from it.
I like Ed Sheeran's newest album, especially "Shape of You." Did you see him on Carpool Karaoke a few weeks ago?
Yes, he was totally adorable. I watched it twice.
You need to help me discover some new pop music. Who's someone new I can listen to?
Well, if you haven't listened to the Chainsmokers, Paramore, or Sia, I'd definitely recommend them. Those are three more of my favorites.
