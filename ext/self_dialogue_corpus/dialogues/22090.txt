Do you remember that old Super Mario Bros movie?
The one from 1993? Yeah, I watched that as a kid.
So did I!
What brought this up?
Oh, I just saw it advertised the other day on a commercial.
Thinking of watching it again?
Yeah, probably. It has John Leguizamo, who I really like.
Yeah, he's been in some cool stuff since then. And the movie wasn't that bad.
Yeah, I know it doesn't have the greatest rating online, but I thought it was pretty good.
I really liked the part with the mushrooms and how Luigi was sure they were telling them something.
Yeah, me too!
And how angry Mario was. It was certainly something I wasn't expecting.
Who would have thought the red man was so grumpy all the time?
Well, he is a plumber who's now randomly forced to fight dinosaurs.
Hey now, fighting dinosaurs would be awesome!
And deadly.
Yeah, but before you died, you'd get to fight a dinosaur! And at least attempt to save a princess.
I was kind of sad that Princess Toadstool wasn't in it, but Daisy was cool.
Yeah, Toadstool would have been more classic.
Yeah, more classic. But Daisy was part dinosaur, so that's cool.
