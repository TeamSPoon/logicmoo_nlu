I finally got around to seeing Catwoman the other day.
What did you think of it?
Halle Berry was good,but the plot wasn't as good as I'd hoped.
I felt the same way. It was a pretty big let down.
I wonder if they'll remake it?
Well, it seems like woman super hero are making a comeback, so maybe.
I feel like Halle Berry was a lot better as Storm, she was more in control.
Maybe they can make a stand alone movie about Storm.
I'd pay to see that. I think Halle Berry could pull it off.
Oh for sure! That would be awesome.
