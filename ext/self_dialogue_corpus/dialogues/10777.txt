Did you see Furious 7?
Is that the one where Paul Walker died during filming?
Yes, and they used his real life brothers Cody and Caleb as stand-ins to finish the movie for him.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, that way they could finish the movie.
So is O'Connor killed off as a character then?
No they played it as he retired.
He was so important to the franchise as he is in all the movies
Well he wasn't in Tokyo Drift or Los Bandoleros
Wow you know a lot about  Fast and Furious
