Do you remember the Miley Cyrus movie?
Which one?
The Last Song. Have you seen it?
Yes! I loved that movie, what did you think?
It was a great movie and a great book. Did you know that's where she met her fiance Liam Hemsworth?
No, I didn't know that. What a great meet cute. Who else was in that movie?
I believe it also starred Kelly Preston, Greg Kinnear, Miley Cyrus obviously, Liam Hemsworth and Bobby Coleman amongst some other people.
Do you remember what year it came out, by chance?
I think it was around 2010, however but don't quote me on that.
Sure! What other movies did Miley star in?
My recollection is High School Musical 2, the two Hannah Montana movies and The Last Song. Do you know of any?
Absolutely, my hands down favorite Miley movie is LOL also starring Demi Moore.
Yes, that was so good! Have you ever seen Bolt?  It's an animated movie, she has a voice part in that movie.
Does she have a lead?
Definitely, she was one of the leads in the movie. As was John Travolta, he is a pretty great actor also.
I like his stuff too, my favorites being Face/Off with Nic Cage and the Look Who's Talking movies.
I liked him in Pulp Fiction too.
Oh yeah! I forgot about Pulp Fiction, that was like a cult classic of the 90's.
Speaking of cult classics, have you ever watched Gremlins?
Ha! Gremlins! Wow, what a movie that was. I had a stuffed animal Gremlin when I was younger.
