I feel like watching the old Disney movie Mulan again.
You mean the 1998 or 2004 film?
I mean the first Mulan movie released in 1998. After my recent trip back from China, I started to feel nostalgic.
I see, I used to like the songs in the Mulan movie.
My favourite song is "I'll make a man out of you"
Oh I like that one too.
Yes, it is an oldie but a goodie.
Wow, now I really feel like watching the film again soon.
Why don't you drop by my house later, I'll dig out my dvd.
Sure, see you later.
