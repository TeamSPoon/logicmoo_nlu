Did you see Star Wars Episode One, the Phantom Menace?
Yes, unfortunately. I thought it was terrible.
I actually kind of liked it, what did you think was so bad?
The acting was terrible, especially Liam Neeson. He's usually a great actor.
Do you have a favorite Liam Neeson movie?
It would be hard to narrow it down, but I think Taken is my favorite.
Taken was great, do you have a favorite part?
I like the part where Liam Neeson tells his daughter's kidnappers about his "particular set of skills."
That was a great scene, I would've been scared if I was the person on the other end of the phone call.
What did you think of Liam Neeson's role in Batman Begins?
I thought his character was pretty good, didn't much like the rest of the movie though.
What didn't you like about Batman Begins?
Christian Bale's voice, I can't stand to listen to it.
What about the second one, The Dark Knight?
It was great, because of Heath Ledger as the Joker.
Did you see the third one, The Dark Knight Rises?
I saw it, it wasn't nearly as good as The Dark Knight.
What didn't you like about The Dark Night Rises?
The villain, Bane wasn't a character I was interested in.
I agree, Bane was kind of a boring character, nothing like the Joker.
