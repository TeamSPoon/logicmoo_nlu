What did you think of the new Alien movie?
I enjoyed it but I thought it would be longer! It seemed very short.
I get what you're saying, I feel it wasn't well explained. What was your favorite part?
I enjoyed the setting. And yours?
Me too! I loved how the set looked and how the CGI looked very real
Yes it was awesome I just wish the actual alien had a bigger role, don't you think?
I agree, the alien was on screen like 5 minutes! Which other movie have you watched lately?
i watched Baywatch.
The zac efron one? was it good?
It was horrible! Worst movie I've seen.
Really? I heard it was entertaining
It wasn't! It was dull and boring, do you like those kind of movies?
I mean I could enjoy it if I was really bored!
Yes, I guess. But anyways it was horrible. Which other horrible movies have you watched?
Oh man a lot, I usually pick the worst movies.
Really? such as?
Well the last horrible movie I watched was a cure for Wellness
Oh no! seriously? It looked promising
Yeah haha it was very long and boring, nice characters and settings though.
I think I'll give it a try to see it by myself.
