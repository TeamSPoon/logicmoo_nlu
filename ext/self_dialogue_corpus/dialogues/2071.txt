Who are we going to see in the Super Bowl this year?
Patriots of course!
I don't know there are a lot of teams that loaded up in the off season.
Brady and Belichick are a winning formula.
Brady isn't a spring Chicken, getting closer to 40 every year.
So is every other quarter back in the league. Belichick has a plan. He's the greatest coach in the history of the sport.
You mean his plan to cheat?
All the teams cheat. It's part of a winning strategy.
They may all cheat but New England is the only one that's been caught multiple times.
When you win everyone wants to find something wrong with you.
So you think they are going 16 and 0 I assume?
I don't know about a sweep but 14 or 15.
Who do you think is going to give them trouble this year aside from Atlanta?
Maybe the Steelers, Kansas City?
Pittsburgh's defense is the real deal, and I think Brady is going to have a tough time with them.
I'd be surprised if we win that game, but Im not really to worried about anyone else.
So maybe 13 and 0 because you're not winning against Atlanta, and if you're worried about the Cheifs you've got to factor in that possibility.
I won't lie Atlanta is a better team, but they don't have Brady and Belichick leading the charge.
You realize they're just people, not magic in any way.
You're wrong.
