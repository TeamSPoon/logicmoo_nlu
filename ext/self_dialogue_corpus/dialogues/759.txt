Hey, do you want to watch Sunday Night football next week?
At your house?
Yes, we can order some pizza.
That sounds good. I will bring some others snacks. Who else is coming?
Just the guys and their wives and girlfriends.
Oh, ok. I will bring my wife too.
Great. My girl will be happy to have the company.
Doesn't she watch the game?
No, she could not care less about the NFL.
Oh, my wife is a huge fan. She knows the game like any man.
That's cool.
Yeah, she loves her Falcons.
Oh, that cool. Too bad they suck.
Don't say that to her.
This is going to be fun. I love messing with you falcons fans.
Yeah, it will be fun. She can dish it too.
Awesome, I can't wait.
Me either.
Text me later and we can work out any details.
Sounds good.
