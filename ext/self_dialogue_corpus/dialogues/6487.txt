Which Disney princess would you want to be friends with.
Jasmine, for sure.
Why?
Isn't it obvious? She owns a tiger.
Ok, that's a good point. But Ariel is a mermaid.
Yeah, but I don't want to have to hang out underwater.
Good point.
Plus Jasmine has a palace.
So does Rapunzel from Tangled!
Yeah, but Jasmine has a palace AND a tiger.
