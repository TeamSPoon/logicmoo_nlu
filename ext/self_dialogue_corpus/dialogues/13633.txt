Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Which one do you mean, The Force Awakens or Rogue One?
The Force awakens. I really liked it.
I thought the storyline was too similar to the original.
Really? Why do you say that?
It started with searching for a Droid on a desert planet, just like A New Hope.
Yes, but that's really the only similarity.
They also destroy a planet like they do in the first movie.
Well, there were some big differences. I thought it was cool that they showed you more about storm troopers.
I have a hard time believing that someone who worked for Sanitation would also be sent into battle as a storm trooper though.
