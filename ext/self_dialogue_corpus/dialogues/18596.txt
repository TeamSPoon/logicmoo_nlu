Do you listen to Twenty One Pilots?
No, who are they?
They are a newish band that my kids got into.
What type of music are they?
They do a mix of rock, pop, hip hop, all genres really.
Cool, do they have an album out?
They have 4 albums out already.
Which one is the best that I should download?
Blurryface is the most popular album.
Is that the one with Stressed Out on it?
Yeah! That's it!
I love that song!
They are a great band, I really enjoy them.
I probably will too, we have similar tastes.
They write all of their own songs and all of their own music.
So they are real musicians, awesome.
I also suggest you listen to their last album, it's nothing like Blurryface.
I'm listening now, already loving it.
Let me know what your favorite songs are.
Will do, this is great, thanks for introducing me to these albums.
