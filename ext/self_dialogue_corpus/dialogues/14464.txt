Will Chris Paul stay in LA?
I dont think so.
They have to break up that team.
Theyve comitted money to other guys though
Yeah but Griffin and Paul cannot coexist.
You think they conflict?
I think they are secondary players that need to remain in the background.
So will they trade them?
They are both free agents.
Thats interesting
Yeah so they are gonna end up losing both for no compensation
So this team reverts back to the early 90s style?
I dont think it will ever be that bad.
Do you have faith in their front office?
No but Doc Rivers is smart.
He had success when he had mega teams.
Right but he did flourish in Orlando.
But couldnt do much until he got the big three.
Listen hes a good coach and wont let the team sink
You dont know that for a fact!
