I really liked the movie Moana.
Oh, I saw it last week and didn't think it was anything special.
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen! What didn't you like about it?
I'm not sure, it just didn't hold my interest.
I loved it because it taught me about a different culture and just felt different from most other movies.
How was it different from other movies?
It didn't have a love story, which was kind of refreshing.
Maybe that's the reason it didn't hold my interest.
I guess you could be right. I loved it though!
I won't be seeing it again anytime soon.
