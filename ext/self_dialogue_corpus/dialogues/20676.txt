Do you like the Rocky Movies?
I like them all!
Have you seen Creed?
No, not yet.
You really should.
I feel like it's a different story.
It isn't.  They tie it together beautifully.
Does it have the same actors?
Well, most of them are dead in the story.  Of course Sylvester Stallone is in it.
Don't you think they've made too many of those movies?
No.  I thought it might be cheesy, but they take it in a different direction.
Does Rocky fight in it.
No, he helps train Apollo Creed's son.
He had a son?
I think he had multiple kids, but in the movie he is the illegitimate son Apollo Creed.
Interesting.
It really is.  It's a good story about someone with a complicated past.
Rocky or Creed?
Both.  I think that's the beauty.
I'll have to check it out.
