So, Ice Cube, or Ice Tea?
To drink?
No, the rappers, who is better?
I do not like either.
Well, what rapper do you like?
Dr. Dre is the all time best, I think.
Maybe a good one of the still living rappers.
Well, I guess Notorious BIG would be the best of all time.
No, I would go for Tupac myself.
I think their issues with one another made them even better at rapping.
