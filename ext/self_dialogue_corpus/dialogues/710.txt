Are you excited for football this year?
I'm always excited for football.
I hope Matt Ryan comes back and wins it this year.
That would be cool to see. It's very possible too.
He's so good with making completions.
Yeah, his pass accuracy is crazy.
I have never seen anything like it.
I hope the Giants do better this year, too.
Yeah, I don't see that happening.
I really don't either. Their draft strategy was inconsistent to say the least.
I can't believe they went for the first round pick tight end.
Yeah, how much could that possibly contribute?
I agree. Evan Engram is good but he's just a tight end.
Although, I feel like teams can't always make the huge, game-changing draft picks.
True. Not everyone is a quarterback.
Still, I think it was a weak pick. There have to be better options.
I would say they definitely fell a couple ranks due to their drafting process.
I still hope they do well, though. I love the Giants.
Don't feel bad. I'm truly a Jets fan.
Yikes. Yeah, they're not looking too strong.
