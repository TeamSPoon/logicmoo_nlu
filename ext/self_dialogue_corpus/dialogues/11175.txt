Did you see Kelly Rowland at the Gala last night?
I did! Wasn't her gold, body fitting dress beautiful?
It was, but what who made it for her again?
I believe it was a Givenchy piece.
That's right. Givenchy was also worn by Adele as well!
Her gown was a mettalic hunter green, with beautiful beading and gemstones cascading down it.
Her and her companion that night, Lady Gaga, took the cake.
I was suprised Lady Gaga was wearing something so formal!
I know! Her slinky, silver sequin piece matched her glamourous silver makeup and Louboutins.
Of course, Beyonce showed up and took everyone's breath away.
You said it. She always wears gold, and it looks so beautiful on her...
Her ombre look was definitlely one of the most unique that night.
Lets not forget Nicki Minaj, though. She came with a simple, form fitting gown in royal blue by Alexander McQueen.
I noticed! Her shoes were beautiful, but it looked like she could hardly stand in them!
I believe they were Gucci.
They looked like it. The large rhinestones were the flash of luxury she needed to finish off her simple but stunning look.
Who was wearing the mermaid gown with gold foil embroidery again?
It was one of the Kardashians! She had on a Valentino dress with Jimmy Choo heels.
Her jewelry was beautiful as well, but it looked so expensive!
I believe those were Biorgioni pieces. She didn't buy it however, she just wore it and gave it back.
