Did you ever get into Disco music?
Are you joking? Saturday Night Fever is one of my all time favorite albums.
So you like Bee Gees music?
I love their music. You Should Be Dancing is one of my all time favorite songs.
That album did produce a lot of hits.
I remember learning the line dance for Night Fever.
That was so long ago.
I know. Stop making me feel so old!
You're not old. You just know your music.
In that case, I really liked a lot of the music by KC and the Sunshine Band.
Get Down Tonight is a great song by them.
So is Boogie Shoes.
I hnk Donna Summer released some great songs in that genre.
Like Bad Girls?
Yes and Hot Stuff.
I love both of those songs.
I like how disco music made you get up and want to dance.
Especially with a partner.
The current songs of today don't make you feel that way.
I think some of the EDM songs do.
