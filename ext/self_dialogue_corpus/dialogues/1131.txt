Who do you think will win the most games next season?
It could be several different teams.
Who do you think has the best chance?
I would have to say the Chiefs.
Is Alex Smith a reliable Quarterback?
He has something to prove this season.
Why do you say that?
He threw five fewer touchdowns in the 2016 season compared to 2015.
Nice observation he will want to get better.
He is a few years younger then Brady but has never won a superbowl.
Wow I wonder if he can do it next season.
I am hoping he can.
How are his other stats?
One thing I think he should work on is interceptions.
Yeah a high number of interceptions can make it tougher to win games.
Especially if one team is turning it over the whole game.
I am sure he will want to keep his interception number low.
Definitely he will want too.
I am excited to watch the Chiefs next season.
They have a great fanbase.
