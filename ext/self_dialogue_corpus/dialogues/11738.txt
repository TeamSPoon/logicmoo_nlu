Hi, there. Are you a Beatles fan?
Not really, although I do like some of their songs.
Which songs do you like?
I like the earlier songs, like I Want to Hold Your Hand and She Loves You.
I like all of their different phases. Have you listened to the Sgt. Pepper album?
I know a couple songs from it, like Help From My Friends, but I like Joe Cocker's version better.
No offense, but I think he ruined it. I don't like Beatles covers. Why mess with perfection?
Wow, you must be a die-hard Beatles fan.
Yes, I am. I've loved them since February, 1964 when I saw them on Ed Sullivan.
That's cool. They were a really big deal for your generation.
