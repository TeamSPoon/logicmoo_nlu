What's the deal with all the desert planet scenes in Star Wars?
What do you mean?
It seems like most of the movies had at least one desert scene
Well, not all of them, but yes there seemed to be a lot.
Luke Skywalker lived in Tatooine and they go back to rescue Han from Jabba
Maybe they like the remoteness of the desert planet
I guess. Maybe they like the way the light is filmed for production purposes
I think it helps show how remote Luke's background is
Yeah, that's a good point. Lonely life in the desert.
Yes, but helps provide perspective.
