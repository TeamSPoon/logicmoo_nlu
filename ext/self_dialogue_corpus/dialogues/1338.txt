Do you think that hockey is the most brutal sport around?
No, I would have to say that would be football far and way.
I would tend to agree with you about that.
Even the biggest hockey fan would have to admit that I would Imagine.
You would think so! The NFL may be the hardest hitting league in the world.
I would agree with you there, that may be why everyone loves the NFL like they do!
Even though it is highly entertaining, do you think it is safe?
I feel like the NFL has gone out of their way to ensure player safety.
They have even changed a lot of the rules for safety purposes, correct?
Yes they have changed the game quite a bit over the years due to safety concerns.
What if a player directly hits another player in the head while leading with the crown of his helmet?
That would be called targeting, and the player would then be automatically ejected.
Wow, that has to be difficult for referees to call in the heat of the moment.
The good thing about it is, those type of plays are review-able.
Do you personally like the rule changes that the NFL has instituted?
I like that they are making the game safer for the athletes, but there are some negative aspects of the rule changes as well.
What kind of negative aspects?
Well, I understand players not being able to lead with their helmets. However, often times players are punished for hits that are not dangerous at all.
It seems they are making the game much harder on defensive players.
Exactly! Many players in the NFL even complain about not knowing how to tackle anymore.
