Did you watch Set It Off last night?
You know I did. That's one of my favorite flicks.
I like it but I never liked that raggedy detective.
Which one?
The one that thought Vivica Fox had something to do with the first robbery that Darnell and them did.
I know right. He was just all out of pocket thinking it was an inside job.
Man you know you right. It was messed up how the cops killed Jada's brother.
He was wrong place wrong time. Little clown should have never gotten that haircut.
He didn't want to go to college. He was scared to tell his sister that he didn't get in.
I know but remember how Jada went and slept with the old dude for them ten stacks?
Dude was crazy. I ain't paying ten stacks to sleep with nobody.
Then you had Queen Latifah acting out all like a lesbian and stuff.
I think she was a lesbian in real life.
Man, that don't matter. Remember slimey Luther when he stole their money?
They was dumb enough to stash the money at they job.
I know that's right. That money would have been stashed right at the crib.
If he wouldn't have robbed them they wouldn't have hit another bank.
Yeah, I know. I'm glad that at least somebody made away with some cash at the end.
Oh, you talking about Jada on the bus?
Yeah. The detective saw her at the end but let her go because he felt sorry for her brother getting killed.
