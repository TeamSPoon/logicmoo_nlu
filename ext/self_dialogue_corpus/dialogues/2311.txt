Hey how do you think the Bengals will do this season?
I think they will have a bounce back year
Why do you think that?
They have a much easier schedule than last year
They also had a good draft
Yeah I am excited to see what Ross and Mixon can do.
They also have some picks from last year that are healthy
Yeah Billings is a big guy that can eat up space
I am still not sure if Marvin Lewis can get the job done
We really need to win a playoff game
Dalton has played bad in the playoffs too.
Yeah he locks in on AJ Green too much
Are you going to any games this year?
I would like to go to the home opener to start the season
Who do you think will have a big year for fantasy football
I really like Leveon Bell and Brandin Cooks
Tom Brady is going to hit Cooks early and often
The Patriots have a lot of weapons. They will be tough to stop
I also like AJ Green as the #1 receiver. He keeps getting better and better
If he is the #1 receiver than the Bengals will have a great year
