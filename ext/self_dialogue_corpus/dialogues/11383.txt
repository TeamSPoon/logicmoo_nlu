What was the last beatles song?
I believe it was Now And Then (also known as "I Don't Want To Lose You" or "Miss You")
I think the piano on that track is so haunting.
Yes, it has a very sad quality. You really feel the melancholy.
It is a very bitter sweet song, fits the them.
Yes, I felt the vocals were slightly weak.
I do see what you mean but feel they fit so well with the vibe of the song.
I suppose it does add to the theme and melancholy sound.
Exactly you can really hear and feel the pain and longing in the vocal performance.
True, It makes me feel sad whenever I do hear it.
