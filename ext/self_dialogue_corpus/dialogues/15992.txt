Have you heard Eminem's older stuff?
Which song are you referring to?
The one called Infinite.
No I have never heard of it.
Isn't that funny, you've heard a lot of his music right?
Yes I have.
But you have never heard this one particular song.
Yes that is odd.
Why do you think that is?
I have no idea.
It is because it is not radio friendly.
What do you mean?
There is no hook, it doesnt sound the best.
Oh then why is it good?
It shows his lyrical skills.
Ok he is a great lyricist.
Yes and this song may be his best at showing his skills.
Wow I will have to check it out.
Yes you will enjoy it, listen to his wordplay.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
