Did you see the Tarzan Disney Movie?
Yes, I watched it with my daughter last night.
That was good wasn't it?
It sure was.
I love the part where he's sliding on the trees to the Phil Collins song.
Yeah that was the best part.  I like when he saved Jane from the monkeys.
Yeah, great movie.  Or how about when he defeats Clayton?
That was good.  Guess we know who the real animal is.
I know right?
Over looked part.  When he let out the Tarzan call after killing the leopard.
