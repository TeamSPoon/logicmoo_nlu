Do you remember how we were first introduced to WestSide Story?
Oh yes, you mean during music class in eight grade?
Mr. Folyer played the soundtrack .
Yeah and we would imagine ourselves being the Jets and the Sharks.
We were on the side of the Jets listening to the music.
But we instantly tuned to Sharps once we saw how fine Bernardo was in the movie.
He was struting around in those tight pants.
Made my heart go pitter patter.
Haha ha that was the first time I fell in love.
Me too
My favorite part was when the Sharks were dancing at the party at the gym.
Yeah and when they left there, they danced on the rooftop.
After that the Jets and the Sharks had a rumble under the highway.
The saddest part of the movie when Bernardo and Riff got killed.
I remember you yelling out NO NO when they got killed.
I know I couldn't bare to see that part.
And when Tony got killed......
I cried like a baby
I have it on dvd let's go watch it.
Ok I could use a good cry
