Elvis Presley sure was amazing!
He sure was!!!
He had so many number one hits.
I know! Hounddog, Jailhouse Rock, Blue Suede Shoes were all hits.
I liked some of the later songs too like Suspicious Minds.
It was a shame he died so young.
He would have had so many more songs to sing if he had lived.
That is true.
I went to Graceland once, did you ever go?
No but I would love too.
