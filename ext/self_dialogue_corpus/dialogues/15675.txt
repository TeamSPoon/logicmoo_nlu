You know what I bought from the bargain bin at the music store today?
Please, don't keep me in suspense.
Jethro Tull.  A two pack!
I had totally forgotten about them.
Me too, I have been playing them non stop. Reminds me of our youth!!
We saw them in concert, didn't we?  In high school, I think.
Yeah.  In Hershey.
I love Ian Anderson.  He is amazing.
He is an awesome song writer.
I remember playing 'Aqualung' over and over and over, in my bedroom!
Me too!  And 'Thick as a Brick'!
I appreciate his music so much more, now that I am older.
You mean old.
Very funny.
He was a great performer too.  I just remember him jumping aroun in his tights, playing the flute!
Yeah.  There are a few songs that I wasn't familiar with that I love.
Like what?
One calle 'Up the Pool' I think.  It's about going to the seaside for vacation, to Blackpool.
I remember that one.
It makes me want to go to the beach so badly. Sea weed and sand castles...icy waves....!
