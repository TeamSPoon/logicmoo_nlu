Have you ever seen The Grey.
Yea, the one with Liam Neeson right?
Yea, when he gets hunted by those wolves.
That movie was so good.
Yea but it was really scary.
Definitely. That would suck if that happened to you.
Yea, but I guess it's not as bad if you've got the skills like Liam Neeson had.
Well, it's still pretty bad, he died at the end.
You don't know that for sure.
It's implied though.
