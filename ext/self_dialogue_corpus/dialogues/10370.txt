Hello. What's up?
Hey. Nothing much. Have you seen any good movies lately.
No, not really. I just saw "Life" and I thought it was pretty bad.
I don't know that movie. What is it about?
It's about some astronauts who intercept a capsule that has some alien.
It's a scifi movie.
Yes. I usually like this type movie, but this one not so much.
Really? Why not?
It was just such a bad series of events and unrealistic things I couldn't overlook.
Like what?
Well, the expert on alien life was playing with the alien like a pet for one thing.
That's funny.
At one point the alien seems to be in stasis or hibernating and the idiot electro shocks it.
Wow. That's funny.
Yes, the alien get's angry and attacks the guy.
I don't blame it.
This is the first movie ever where I actually wanted everyone to die.
That's funny.
They were really so incompetent and so many stupid things.
I think I'll pass on this one.
