Every single time I see a deer, I think of Bambi.
Oh I know what you mean!
Disney movies like Bambi probably inspired much of my love for the outdoors.
I know. It's so easy to get attached to the characters.
And there's usually a good lesson for kids in the movies as well.
Yeah, Bambi makes it out in the world even without its mom.
It is really sad when the mother deer dies.
Death is just part of life, I guess.
That's a good point. Kind of heavy for kids though.
But it's a cute movie all the same.
