I saw The Alphabet Killer last night.
Never heard of it.
It's an indie movie.
What's it about?
A woman cop goes after a serial killer who picks out girls with the same two first letters to their names.
Sounds quirky.
It was based on a true story.
Wo stars in it?
Eliza Dushku, Cary Elwes, and Timothy Hutton.
Any good?
Not too bad.  Eliza Dushku is the cop.
She's pretty.
Yes, there's even a nude scene.
Neat.  Who doe Timothy Hutton play?
He turns out to be the murderer.
Wow, he used to play nice guy roles.
I liked him in Beautiful Girls.
Does she get him?
No, he runs away, she goes into a mental ward, and the crimes are unsolved.
Bummer.
