I went to the mall last night and saw that forever 21 started to sell men's cloths.
Really? What are they selling?
I just saw men's watches.
Really,I wonder why?
I heard they want to see if men would shop their. I may consider it.
What wetter you ding in there already?
I was with my girlfriend, what do you think?
Sorry man, just playing with you.
Thanks, but the watches they had looked really nice and not that expensive.
What was the price range?
I saw some $25 to $60
Not bad.
I know, but how long will they last?
No kidding.
They had a few with leather bands and metal bands.
Did the leather lot real?
It did.
What color? Brown and black
Want to check them out later?
Sure
