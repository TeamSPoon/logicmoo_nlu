Have you ever seen the movie Magnolia?
Yes, but it was years ago
It was my favorite Tom Cruise performance
yes, before he got weird and full of himself
That's what ironic, the character in Magnolia was a jerk
Oh yeah, wasn't he a motivational speaker in the movie?
Yes, and he reunited with his father
Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the nurse in the movie right?
Yes and he was fantastic
I remember him being very sweet and funny
Yes, his role in magnolia was his best performace
Julianne Moore was in magnolia too right?
Yes! and a bunch of other great actors
I loved the sound track
I don't remember the soundtrack to Magnolia
There was a bunch of great songs that fit the movie so well
I remember the part where it rained frogs
Oh yeah! That was a weird scene
Isn't the director the same one who did Boogie Nights?
I think it is
