So, is there any argument over who the best rapper of all time is?
Not for me, it is Tupac hands down.
I agree, what do you think his best song was?
For me it would be Dear Mama.
I love that song, he really admired his mother.
What would be your favirote?
I feel like Hail Mary has the best beat of all time.
Yea that one was a great track. Have you ever heard California Love?
Yea, that may have been his most popular song.
Ghetto gospel is another great song of his.
