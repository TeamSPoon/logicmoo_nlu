Did you know Disney makes a lot more than just cartoons?
Really? You mean since they bought Lucas Films and Marvel?
Before then. They made some classic live action films.
Huh, never heard of any.
You might have, like Mary Poppins.
I love that movie! That is Disney?
Yes,  the same animators for the old cartoon did the animated parts in that movie.
Are there any other I may know?
Tons, like the Shaggy Dog.
That is a Disney movie?
