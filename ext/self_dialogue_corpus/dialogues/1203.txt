I can't believe the Patriots are still winning after all these years.
Yeah, it's embarrassing that they just won't get bad.
Well, cheating will do that for you.
Oh, we're way past the cheating scandals.
But it's funny that they keep finding out new ways they game the system.
They might take advantage of certain things, but that didn't make them win the SB.
That was an epic comeback no doubt.
Probably the greatest comeback in NFL history I think.
I won't argue that.  World's biggest stage, down 25 points...
Even late in the third quarter, you kind of thought they might have a shot.
It helps that you have Tom Brady.
Greatest QB ever.
I didn't think so at one time, but I'm not sure I can argue otherwise.
Guy's ancient, like 40 years old, but he's still in his prime.
He's just a great player.
No, greatest.  He may not have the records, but he's got the rings.
It's always funny how they have scrubs for WR's.
Right, but they somehow still come up time after time.
I guess that's the aura of the coaching staff for you.
Yep, best in the league in my opinion.
