What was that movie that came out a few years ago with zombies?
There's been tons of those.  I need a bit more help.
Okay.  It had the teenagers in it and the zombie did the narrative.
Hmmmmm.  I think you're talking about Warm Bodies.
Yeah, that's what it was called.  That was a pleasant surprise..
I didn't expect much from it, but I would agree.
It was a good humorous take on the genre.  Good performances from the leads.
It had a quirky sense of humor to it.  The airport scenes were crafted well.
There were some things I didn't like though.
What in particular are you thinking of?
I thought it was kind of silly that the really dead zombies, the Bonies, were so fearsome.
That was a bit odd.
I don't see how skeletons can run or do anything when bones themselves aren't connected.
Do you mean how we have to have ligaments, muscles, etc?
Exactly.  I know it's a zombie movie, but makes no sense.
So are you saying it would have been more effective to have them more zombie-like?
Exactly.
I can respect that.  Even though it's a zombie movie, there should still be some rules physically.
Maybe they should consult me on some of these movies.
I don't know any producers, so you're on your own.
