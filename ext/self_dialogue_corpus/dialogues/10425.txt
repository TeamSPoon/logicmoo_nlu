How are you doing today?
I am great thank you.
It has been nasty weather we have been having.
Yes it has not been very pretty.
Do you know if it is supposed to rain later.
I hear that there was rain expected this afternoon.
Do you know around what time?
I heard about six pm.
I was supposed to go play pickup up basketball later.
What is the court outside?
Yeah, so if it rains we will not be able to play.
That is a real bummer.
Yeah I will have to find something else to do to exercise.
There is a swimming pool in the local gym.
That would be great, I have not swam in a while.
Yeah it is pretty cheap, only 5 dollars per session.
Well that is actually a decent price.
It is a fun pool, I have been there several times.
Okay Ill try it out.
Sounds like a good plan to me.
