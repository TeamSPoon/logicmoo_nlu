What's the deal with the Frozen movie stuff?
What do you mean?
My two little girls are going crazy for everything Frozen.
That's pretty normal, what's the problem?
I've never seen the movie. I don't understand why they have to have everything Frozen.
You should really see the movie. It's great.
Why?
It's hard to explain. They just did everything right, and the movie became extremely popular. I mean, it's popular for a reason.
Maybe, I will. Then I'll understand why my girls need their entire room to have Elsa and Anna everywhere.
That's funny. Good luck with all of that.
