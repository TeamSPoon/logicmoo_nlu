Dude, have you heard the new Arcade Fire song?
Yeah, I saw that on Spotify. It's called Creature Comfort, right?
Yep, I've been waiting for a new release since Reflektor.
Yeah, can you believe that was 2015?
I know. And this is only a single. We still have to wait for the full album.
Is Reflektor your favorite album of theirs?
Nope. I absolutely adore The Suburbs.
I know. I mean, there's a reason it won best album of the year.
Reflektor is a great album too, though. It took me a while to get into it though.
Really, why is that?
I don't know, it didn't grip me at first. I heard the song Here Comes the Night Time on SNL and I thought it was OK, but it didn't wow me. Now I just love the whole thing.
Well, I sure like it. I just wish they would give Regine Chassange more vocals.
Oh yeah, I love the sound of her voice, especially on the song Joan of Arc.
Hey, I just realized. Joan of Arc. Arcade Fire.
Ha, nice! Bur her French singing on Joan of Arc is great.
Totally. I do like Win Butler too. He's a great lead vocalist. The combination of the two is perfect.
DId you know they were married?
Really? Wow. That makes a lot of sense.
Yeah, they're from Montreal.
Huh. I always thought they were British or something.
