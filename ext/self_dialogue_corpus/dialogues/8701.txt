Do you listen to Nickelback?
I liked This is How you Remind me.
I think the track was a rock anthem
They still play it at sporting events.
People say how bad that band is.
Yeah but people were buying their records.
Do they still make music?
I think they just tour in Canada alot.
Thats interesting because they were on top of the rock world.
Yeah but people ripped them in the States for some reason
