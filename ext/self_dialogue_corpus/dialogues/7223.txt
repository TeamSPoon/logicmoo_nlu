Did you ever watch Aladdin when you were a little kid?
Yes, all the time! It was my favorite.
I loved the music in it so much.
"One Jump Ahead" is my favorite, especially when that one lady sings "still I think he's rather tasty" in a weird voice.
My favorite is "Prince Ali," I love the scene during that song, there's so much going on!
Aladdin and Jasmine both had such cute pets, too.
I would definitely be happy to have Abu or Rajah as a pet. They were both very loyal.
Though Abu was a little mischievous!
I was surprised he listened to Aladdin and gave those kids his bread!
He was so cute and pouty because he didn't want to, though. The kids were very happy with him!
