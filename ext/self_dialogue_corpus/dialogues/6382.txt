Do you prefer animated Disney movies or live action ones.
Either one but I like the older ones in both categories.
So do I. The classics are great.
I don't like all this computer animated stuf.
A few of the movies using that are OK but I agree for the most part.
They lack the magic and innocence of the older movies. They're too glitzy and flashy.
Yes, I definitely see that.
I used to watch Disney movies and the Disney channel all the time but now I never do.
It's all teen comedy now.
It's not funny eiter. The teens mostly have attitude problems.
