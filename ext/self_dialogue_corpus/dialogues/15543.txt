What kind of music station do you put on Pandora?
I usually go for Simon and Garfunkel.  How about you?
I'm more of a James Taylor fan.
I love his laid back style.  Do you listen to John Denver.
Yes, I like the lyr.ics to his songs.  Love to have it on when we travel in the mountains.
Yes, I've been know to belt out "Rocky Mountain High" in the car.
My favorite is "The Boy from the Country."
Is that the same as "Thank God I'm a Country Boy?"
No.  It's about talking to nature and people thinking you are weird because you do.
I don't think Im familiar with that song.
I listen to Simon and Garfunkel too.  I especially like ""Bride over Troubled Water"
Yes and the "Sound of Silience" I also like.
Turn up your player at the end of "Bridge Over Troubled Water" and just listen to the instruments.  Glorious
I'll have to try that.
Do you ever listen to Jim Croce?
Yes, I like "Bad Bad Leroy Brown."
I guess my favorite of his would be "Time in a Bottle"
That is a good one.  "Lover's Cross" also comes to mind
I have the Eagles playing right now.
Looks like we are both into the oldies
