Hi there.
Hello.
What kind of music are you interested in?
Recently?
Yeah sure.
Hmmm.
You still there?
Yeah just thinking.
Oh okay.
I've been listening to a lot of Beyonce and John Legend lately.
Oh okay sure.
Yeah I love it.
Do you like a lot of pop like that?
Well, I would call it more R and B really.
Yeah, but it's also pop isn't it?
I don't know.
I think it is.
Okay.
It's popular music right?
I guess.
