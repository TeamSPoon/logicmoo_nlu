What is the scariest thing you have ever seen in a Disney movie?
Well, you know about my phobia for Chernabog from "Fantasia."
That I do, other than him, who or what gives you the creeps?
I think it would have to be "Ursula" from "The Little Mermaid."
Really, what about her?
She turned people into little sea slugs!
Creepy little sea slugs!
Exactly and she stole voices and-AND she tried to steal Eric from Ariel.
True, she was a real witch.
A real "sea witch." Sorry, couldn't help it.
