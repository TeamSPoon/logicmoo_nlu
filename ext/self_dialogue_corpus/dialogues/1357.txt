It's hard to believe football season is coming up again
It really is!
Are you playing in a fantasy football league this year?
I hope so; it's usually fun.
I haven't decided to play or not yet.
I think it makes the NFL season more fun.
Me too. I like to feel invested in the games.
Do you think the broncos will be any good this year?
It hasn't been as much fun since manning retired.
I know, it was really fun to watch at home him play
I'm also rooting for the patriots this year.
I think they win too much as it is.
It's hard to deny that they are a good team.
Right but Brady doesn't seem as likable since deflate gate.
In a way, it doesn't matter. He's good at football.
I get it. I don't disagree.
I am curious about the browns this year.
I always wonder when they will be better.
I feel bad for them sometimes.
Maybe this will be their year.
