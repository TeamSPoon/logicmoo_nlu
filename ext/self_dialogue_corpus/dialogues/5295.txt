Hi Ho Hi Ho , Its Off To Work We Go!!
Another Monday. No little birds chirping around my head this morning.
Cranky dwarf in da' house!
Ugh. I'm not cranky, but Sleepy and me are tight.
That poor woman having to deal with seven men.
I know right. It would not be very "Maleficent"
See your singing a song to a better day already.
Digging in a mine would be better then at this desk.
Seesh. I'll make sure not to eat any apples you throw my way today.
Magic clock on my desk. Make my day go fast, that would be the best.
