who is the best lyrical rapper?
i think j.cole is the best
no way its kendrick lamar and jay-z
jay z doesnt really make music anymore
jay z is the greatest of all time
who's more lyrical him or nas
nas is lyrical but jay z is more of a spitter
j.cole is better than them both
i think j.cole is good but not the best
all his albums are platinum
