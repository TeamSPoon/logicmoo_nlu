Do you watch the NFL?
Of course I do.
What's your favorite team?
The colts, I miss Peyton.
Peyton Manning?
Yeah, he built that team I came to love.
Doesn't he still play?
I think so, for the broncos.
Still love the team.
Whose your quarterback now?
Andrew Luck.
He's good, right?
Yes, but he's no Manning.
Maybe one day he will be.
I doubt it Manning was in a league above the rest.
Him and Brady were the best.
I can't agree more.
Why did he leave.
The Colts let him go because he's old and had a neck injury.
That's unfortunate.
