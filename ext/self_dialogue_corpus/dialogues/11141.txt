Hi there
Hey
Do you think want to talk about fashion?
Sure I love fashion, what's your favorite thing to wear?
I love holy jeans and tank tops
Skinny or flare
Skinny, I like to wear boots in the winter and sandals in the summertime
That's cute. I like to wear dresses in the summer
I'm not a dress person.
I love dresses, I like they are cute, and cool in the summer too
I wear jeans all year round, I can't get enough of them. I have so many pairs.
I only have a few.
What do you wear when it's cold
I like leggings and oversized sweaters, and boots. It's so comfy
That sounds cute, I wear leggings sometimes.
I have them in almost every color, I have the thermal ones toi
I've never worn the thermal leggings, I've been wanting to try them
They are so warm, warmer then jeans.
Wow, I need to get some then
You really do. There amazing.
