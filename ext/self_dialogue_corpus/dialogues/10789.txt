I didn't really care for the fast and the furious franchise.
Really?  Why?
Well, it's a bunch of racers.  How entertaining can that really be?
Don't you watch the Indy 500?
No way!! It's all just rednecks and left hand turns.
But it can be exciting, especially when there is a wreck
Yes but why would you want to watch a car accident?
Well, there is definitely more to fast and furious than left hand turns and car accidents.
I suppose, but I still don't like the idea of a racing movie.
To each their own i guess.
