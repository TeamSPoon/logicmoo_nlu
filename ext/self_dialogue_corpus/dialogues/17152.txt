What do you think of Rihanna?
I like her but she's not a favorite or anything.
What's your favorite song of hers?
That would be diamonds.
Why that one?
It speaks so well to the person that we're all special and need to shine in our own ways.
How do you get that from the song.
One line, Shine bright like a diamond.
She's talking about diamonds.
No, we the people are the diamonds.
I get it now, that's clever and now it makes more sense.
What's your favorite?
Has to be Work.
Why that one?
Well it emphasizes the need to work and the hustle of wanting more success at work.
I feel like the song is motivating.
I used to listen to it when I was at work and had a stack of paper to do, kept me pushing at a good pace.
I might try that some time, any other songs?
Stay is another good one.
I like that one too for the lyrics.
