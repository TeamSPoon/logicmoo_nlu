you know the part in mulan when they find out she's a girl?
yeah, i do!
that's a really deep part. they literally throw her in the snow!
and she's injured, yeah. that is pretty terrible
they only did it because she was a woman. when she was a man, a wounded war vet they were taking care of her
people don't care about women
they don't. they really don't
she's the best fighter in the team, too
i guess it's fine. by the end of the movie they realize
and then she kicks butt, yeah!
