Did you see Beauty and the Beast
Yes I did. What did you think of Emma Watson as Belle
I like her, thought she did a great job
I can't picture her as Belle.
Yeah I do think of Harry Potter when I see her
Cinderella was better as it wasn't a well known actress
Yes I could really imagine her as Cinderella
Although Angelina Jolie rocked as Maleficent
She sure did, I think that's my favorite Disney movie.
Not me, my favorite is Cinderella.
