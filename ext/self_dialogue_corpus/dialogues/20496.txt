What kinds of movies have you seen lately?
I saw a really good scary movie not too long ago.
Which one was that?
I saw The Babadook.
That's a funny name. What's it about?
It's a monster movie about a story book character that comes to life.
Oh, okay. That's creepy.
It's pretty creepy, but the whole movie is very artistically done.
How is that?
There are scenes where the mom is dreaming and she floats down into her bed to make you feel like you're dreaming with her.
That's pretty cool. What else is interesting?
The choice of colors and camera angles are all interesting too.
Care to explain some more?
Yeah, they chose a bunch of dull and drab colors to make the movie feel depressing.
Huh, that's interesting. Not a lot of movies do that.
Yeah this movie did a lot of things differently.
What else did it do? Did it end well?
The ending was really cool, basically they decided to live with the monster and keep him in the basement.
Oh, wow! That's awesome!
Yeah it was a cool thing to do, there's a lot of metaphorical stuff going on with that you should look into.
