Did you like any one hit wonder Rock bands?
Yes, I like a few.
Which ones?
I'm thinking of bands like Ratt, Quiet Riot, and Twisted Sister
They had a few good songs.
I don't know if they are one hit but they had only one or a few hits.
Yes, I remember Bang your Head by Quiet Riot was big then they had no other hits.
Twisted Sister had two or three from the same album.
We're Not Going to Take It was the biggest one
They had I Wanna Rock as well.
Was that a re-make?
I'm not sure I don't think so.
Ratt had Round and Round.
I liked that song but there wasn't much else good.
Yes, I only remember one album.
Some of the other songs were okay but nothing catchy.
I agree.  What about the make up these bands wore back then?
It is kind of ridiculous to look at the videos now.
Yes with the big hair and make up.
I laugh if I see it now.
