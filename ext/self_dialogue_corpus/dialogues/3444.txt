Do you feel the sixth sense is a horror movie?
Wow thats a great question.
I mean it has all the elements.
Right but it was more of a psychological thriller.
I would say it was a horror movie.
Because of the way you learn about Bruce Willis' character?
Yeah thats the worst kind of horror.
Knowing what you dont?
Yeah thinking youre alive the entire time.
I hope no one is listening! You just spoiled it!
