Are you a Packers fan
Not really,  I am more of a Panthers fan.  They are my home team
They had a grate team two years ago.
I know,. we should have won the Super Bowl.
I think your quarterback Cam Newton is a heck of a player.
He really is a good player.  He can be a little bit of a primadona though.
Are there other teams you like.
Well, my wife is from Indianapolis, so I pull for the Colts as well.
Have you ever been to a game live.
I have been to a few Panthers games, but no Colts games.
How was the Stadium.
The Panthers Stadium is really nice.  I have seen the Colts stadium and it is amazing.
Do you watch a lot of games each week.
Not really, I just watch the Panthers games each week.  I don't really watch other games.
I hope the Falcons have a horrible season.  I can't stand them.
I know what you mean.  The Atlanta Falcons suck.
I hope to be able to see a Green Bay Packers game this year.
That would be a lot of fun.
The NFL puts on a great show at every game.
They really do.  The football, food, and atmosphere make it a great time.
