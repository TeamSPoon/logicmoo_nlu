Rihanna is a very talented singer.
I agree. She releases very impressive music.
Do you know where she is from?
No! I always wondered that though.
She is from Barbados.
That makes so much sense. I always thought she had an interesting accent.
You can't hear her accent when she sings usually though.
I agree. That is especially true in powerful songs like "Stay"
She had quite an impressive repertoire. I am amazed at how many songs she has released.
It's true. She has won a lot of awards for songs as well.
