Do you like Star Wars?
It's a good story.
What do you like about it?
I like the space battles and the struggle against an evil empire.
It's sad that the Empire was so crazy.
They were evil.
It's not unlike some of the leaders in the world today.
It's wasn't a democracy, but they seemed to be doing well financially
I would have fought against them
They would have to go
