Are you a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival?
Yeah, I love them!
It's so easy to put on one of their albums and lose track of time.
Exactly. They make a good soundtrack for just about anything.
I love all kinds of loud southern rock bands.
Me too. Do you like Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Of course I do!
Everyone loves Freebird.
It's a great song.
Definitely. It's a classic.
