What is your favorite comedy movie?
I love Anchor Man
me too! the cast was amazing. I like Will Farrel
I do! But I thought Paul Rudd was hilarious.
Did you see him in the 40 Year Old Virgin? SO funny!
Yes that movie was great and so funny
I wish they had done a sequel
Yes, but what would they do for the story?
You're right maybe they have a baby?
Nah that wouldn't be funny
