What is the best scene in The Godfather?
I like the scene where Al Pacino kills the cop played by Sterling Hayden
That was very violent
That whole movie was violent
Did you like part 2?
Yes
Did you think it was better than the first one?
No
I agree. I think it is overrated.
It is a great film though. But, part 1 is better
John Cazale is great in both
He plays Fredo so good
I know.
It's sad when he gets killed in part 2
Yeah, that's a hard part to watch when he is talking about the fish
He is not in part 1 a lot
James Caan is in that one more.
I liked his performance
Did you like his more than Al Pacino's?
No
