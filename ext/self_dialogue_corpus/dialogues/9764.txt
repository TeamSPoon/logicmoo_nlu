what genre in music do you think is most popular among young adults?
oh, it's no doubt gonna be hip hop, I heard them quite often in college
what characteristics hip hop music often consist of?
well, usually there are multiple or just one cool black dude, singining in punch line about some sensitive stuff in societies
wouldn't that be too sensitive then?
no, they actually made it sound very fun and chill, and I think it helps relax atmosphere in a social environment quite a bit
that sounds very psychologically satisfiying
it's indeed, but be warmed they are usually explicit
Oh, I'll make sure I won't play it when my parents are here
wise choice
