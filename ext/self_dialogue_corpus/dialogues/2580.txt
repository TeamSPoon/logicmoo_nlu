Have you looked at any of the NFL schedulet yet?
No I have not. Any good matchups?
I saw the Cowboys and Raiders play one week.  Don't you like the Cowboys?
Wow, what a good matchup base on last year.
I agree, they are two up and coming teams.
Dallas lost a lot on defense, but their offense is good.
Do you think that the Raiders will move to Las Vegas?
I think there are some road blocks with the owners on the move.
Like what issues?
I think a lot has to do with the TV market in the bay area.  It's a lot larger than Las Vegas.
Well the NFL does make tons of money from ads.
They do and all of the owners know it.
That is probably why they let the Rams and Chargers move to Los Angeles.
Without a doubt.  St. Louis was a small market for an NFL team.
I really liked the Rams when Kurt Warner was there.
The greatest show on turf!
They had a nice little run with him.
Yes they did.  Won two Super Bowls I think.
Now they have an empty stadium in St. Louis.
Hopefully they can use it for college or high school events.
