I just discovered a new band that doesn't use any guitar, but they still rock! They're called Royal Blood.
Oh yeah! They're just a bass player and a drummer right?
Yeah, but they still know how to rock. The bassist put a guitar pickup in his bass to flesh the sound out a bit more. I just saw them at a big festival.
Oh that sounds cool! Who else did you see?
I feel lucky, because Soundgarden played, and it was one of Chris Cornell's last performances before his passing.
I'm still really upset about that. I can't believe that happened! Did he sound good when you saw them?
He sounded amazing. Very energetic, and he talked to the crowd a lot. I was just so stunned by this.
Me too. I saw them many years ago, and they put on a killer show. Definitely one of the best grunge bands.
I agree. I love Soundgarden and Pearl Jam the most, so of course I absolutely adore Temple of the Dog.
Oh yeah! I heard they reunited last year and went on tour! I bet that was something else.
