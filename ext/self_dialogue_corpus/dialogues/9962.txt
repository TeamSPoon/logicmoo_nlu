Did you ever see Gone In 60 Seconds?
No, who played in that?
It was a Nicholas Cage film.
He has really gone downhill as an actor.
Yes, but this was one of his earlier works.
Was this a reboot?
Yes, the original film came out back in the 70's.
Sometimes those turn out good and sometimes not.
Well this one is worth a watch.
I'll have to check it out.
