What kind of music do you like?
Lately I've only been listening to the music my boyfriend makes.
What kind of music is that?
Acoustic guitar.
Oh cool. I didn't know your boyfriend was a musician.
Yes, he is. He makes acoustic covers of existing music and performs them on the Promenade in Santa Monica.
What's the Promenade?
It's a street with mainly pedestrians and stores everywhere.
Does your boyfriend make a living off of playing a guitar on the street?
No, but he gets most of his spending money through his performances.
That's very interesting. It's good that you are able to enjoy his music.
Well, that's the thing. I'm not so sure I'm a fan.
I'm sure he'd understand if you told him.
Maybe, but he is very passionate about his music.
What kind of music do you like?
I like hip hop the most, but my boyfriend doesn't like when I play it in the house.
Your boyfriend doesn't like hip hop?
No, he only likes acoustic music. That's the reason I've changed my listening habits as well.
That doesn't sound good at all.
That's what I get for getting a boyfriend with bad taste, I suppose.
