Hi.
Hi.
Are you a big fan of music?
Yeah love music.
Who is your favorite band of all time?
Hmm that's a tough one.
Take your time.
I would say U2
Oh okay.  I'm not really familiar with them.
They are a huge band you don't know them?
Well what are some of their songs.
Where the streets have no name, with or without you, sunday bloody sunday.
Okay that sounds sort of familiar.
I hope so.
Have you seen them play?
Like live?
Yeah.
No I haven't, but I hear they put on a good show.
You should go see them sometime then.
Tickets are always crazy expensive.
