Dude, football is almost back!
I know man!  Are you playing fantasy this year?
Of course.  No way I'm drafting Russell Wilson, ever again!
Yeah he was horrible last season.  My Seahawks were so injury prone.
Yeah, they need Beast Mode back.
Didn't he sign with the Raiders this year?
Yeah, dude.  I'm not sure how that's going to go to be honest, but I hope they beat the Patriots.
Seriously, somebody needs to.  Tom Terrific can't last much longer.
I don't know man.  He says he's playing until age 45.
That would be insane!  I wouldn't mind having him in fantasy next season, to be honest.
Yeah, but I want my boy Aaron Rodgers again.  Dude is insanely talented.
Yeah, but he plays in the cold like six times a year.  That can hurt fantasy stats.
Very true, and it's toward the end of the season too, when you need the most out of him.
Hey, your Browns had a pretty solid off-season!  Do you think they will win more than one this year?
I don't want to get too hopeful, but yeah I think that's a safe bet.
Who's going to be their quarterback?
I think Kizer will win it.  He's the most physically gifted.  Hopefully Hue can get his head on right.
Yeah, he had a pretty horrible last season in college.
Either way, we have Myles Garrett now, so hopefully the defense improves.
I don't see why it can't.
