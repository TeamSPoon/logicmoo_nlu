Do you listen to Kpop?
Sometimes, I learned about them through anime.
Yea, they use a lot of Kpop songs for anime.
Yea, Joe Inoue had a song in Naruto.
Yea and Boa had a song in Fairy Tail.
What other Kpop songs do you listen to?
I'm a big fan of Nano.
I've never heard of them, should I try them out?
Yea you should. Listen to Hysteria and see what you think.
Oh wait, I've heard Hysteria. That's the same group that made No Pain, No Gain right?
Yea! That's Nano.
Oh ok, yea they are really good.
Mflow is also really good, they have a great song with Boa called The Love Bug.
Yea, I've heard that one, Mflow does a lot of collaborations.
Yea, have you ever heard Bump of Chicken?
I think so, they sing that song called Sailing Day right?
Yea that's one of them.
Man, Kpop groups have strange names.
Yea, no kidding. Right now I'm into a group called The Oral Cigarettes.
Now, that is really weird.
