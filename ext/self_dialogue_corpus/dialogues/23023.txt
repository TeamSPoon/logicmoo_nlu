Do you like Jake Gyllenhaal?
Yes, he's a good actor, and he seems like a nice guy.
I saw a trailer for his new movie coming out this fall called "Stronger."
What's the movie about?
It's the story of one of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing who lost his legs.
I bet Jake will be good at portraying the character. He's really sensitive looking.
He apparently has become really good friends with the guy he's portraying.
I'm sure learning the guy's story was very touching,
The guy said Jake bought him a present for a housewarming gift.
That's nice! What did he buy him?
He bought him a toilet. Jake said his friend had one, and it was the best toilet he saw. The guy said it's "the best toilet in the world."
Wow. That's funny. But you know, it sounds like it must have been something he really needed for his new home, so it's a really thoughtful gift.
They did an interview with a reporter on the set where they were filming, and the news article said you could tell they had become good friends.
It's nice to hear something good happening for someone like that who suffered from such a tragedy.
I know, he probably earned some extra money he could use for sharing his story with them for the movie, and he gets to tell friends he has a famous friend.
Whenever people come over his house and ask to use the bathroom, he can tell them this is the toilet my friend Jake Gyllenhaal bought me!
I hope the movie does well at the box office, so this guy feels like people care about his story.
Oh, I know, it would be sad if it didn't do well.
I'm going to make sure I go see it at the theatre, and post about it on my Facebook and Twitter.
That's a good idea, letting people know if they go see the film, they can send an indirect message of support by seeing it.
