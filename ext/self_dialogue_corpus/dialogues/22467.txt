Did you like Napoleon Dynamite?
Yes I thought it was hilarious.
I did too. A lot of people don't like it.
Well I didn't like it the first time. It grew on me.
I think that's what happened with me too. I thought it was stupid at first.
His dry humor just makes me laugh so much.
I know and all the subtle jokes like with Rex Kwon Do.
Haha! He's one of my favorite characters.
I quote him all the time. Break the wrist, walk away.
Oh my gosh, that's so funny. I always say his line about a roundhouse kick to the face.
That's one of the best scenes in the film.
I agree. I really like all of it.
It's hard for me to get people to watch with me. They don't laugh much.
How can they not laugh?
I don't know. I still find it funny all these years later.
My aunt loves when Kip asks if Napoleon can pull him into town.
And he takes him on his bike while he rides behind on roller blades!
Haha yes! I send her that clip from time to time.
That's funny. I think I'm going to watch it tonight.
I might join you.
