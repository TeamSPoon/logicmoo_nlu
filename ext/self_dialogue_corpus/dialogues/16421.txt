Do you like U2?
I do.  They are one of my favorite bands!
Do you remember all that hassle when Apple gave away their album for free?
I do remember!  I couldn't see what all of the fuss was about.
Me either!  If you don't want the free album, delete it!
Exactly!  I had some friends who did just that.
I really liked the album.  Of course, they are one of my favorite bands.
I think the only album I didn't like recently was Zoo Station.
No, it wasn't my favorite.  Not that there was anything wrong with it.
No, it's just that I have others I like better.
Me too!  Which one is your favorite again?
I thin it is the Joshua Tree.
I LOVE that one.  I listened to it over and over when I first got it.
I know!  It was one of the first albums I bought on CD.
Now you just download it on to your itunes when you get a new album!
It is so cool to be able to do that.
When is their next album coming out?
No idea.  Last I heard was 2016, but haven't heard anything since!
Hopefully it will make it this year at least!
I hope so. I think it is supposed to be called songs of experience.
