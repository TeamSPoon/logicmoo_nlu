Do you remember the first time you heard the beatles?
Yes, on the radio in 1964.
Me, too. I heard "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
That was a good one, but I like "She Loves Me" better.
The music from their movie "Hard Day's Night" was pretty good, too.
I thought it was a step backwards--or at least it was not innovative.
Surely not as much as the 'Sgt. Pepper's' album.
I still listen to that album at least once a month.
I think the "White Album" was the strangest album they made.
Yeah, "No. 9" was beyond belief.....
