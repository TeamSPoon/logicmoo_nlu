Did you see Lady Gaga on the VMA's in 2009?
Yes! Where she did Paparazzi?
Yes! It was amazing. What did you think about the end?
Where she started bleeding? That was incredible.
I know. You could hear the audience gasp audibly when that happened.
What other songs do you like?
I really like Perfect Illusion. You?
I like Joanne. Have you heard all of her new album?
I just bought it.
It's really different from her other stuff. I like it.
