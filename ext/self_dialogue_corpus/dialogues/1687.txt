So how do you think your Raiders are going to do this upcoming season?
I think they should be able to make the playoffs again
Me too, assuming everyone stays healthy
Yeah, I hope Marshawn will still live up to the Beast Mode name
He should as he's representing his home town now
That's true!
But we'll see if he still has it from the first few games
As long as the O-Line holds up, it should be good
Carr signed a massive contract extension, do you think it was worth it?
I do, he's still young and is still constantly improving
I think he's a very smart QB and has the potential to be great
They have a great wide receivver corp too
They did pick up Cordarrelle Patterson, I think that's a great addition
Yup, Carr should pick up right where he left off before his injury last year
So what's your record prediciton for them this season?
I think they'll go 11-5
I'm guessing around there too
The Chiefs will probably battle with them for the division lead
Good prediciton, I gotta go. I'll catch you later!
Ok, see you!
