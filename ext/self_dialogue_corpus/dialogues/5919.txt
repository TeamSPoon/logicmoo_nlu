Have you seen Finding Dory?
Yes, we went opening weekend, it was SO cute!
What did you think of the storyline?
I loved it. Dory is every parent's worst nightmare.
She is. She is so cute and means no harm.
Some of the coping skills her parents use are amazing.
I would never have thought of creating a song about the undertow.
Me neither. I like the shell path they created, so she would find her way home.
She loves shells.
I loved how they stayed right there, instead of giving up hope.
