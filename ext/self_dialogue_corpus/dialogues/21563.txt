Why do you think they make movies?
Hmm that is a hard one.
Why do you think that?
Because I think movies are a plot to inform the public of things the government thinks would cause a panic .
What so you mean?
Do you remember when we had movie after movie about an asteroid or meteor hitting the earth.
You mean like the movie Asteroids?
Yes and Armageddon, Meteors, and Judgment Day.
Yeah I remember all of those.
Well they were great movies but in all of them the earth survived right?
Right.
A few years after Armageddon came out the government announced that there was an Asteroid headed for the earth but it would be a near miss.
And you think that was on purpose?
Sure since it had already been placed in the public's mind that we would survive.
That is a bit of a conspiracy theorist idea isn't it?
Maybe but then it was drug movies and we had a huge influx of drug including the upsurge of Meth. Now Marijuana is becoming legal.
Very true but...
Then there was Zombie movies, and the incidents with bath salts. Now there are Alien movies where Aliens are champions of the earth and we get along with them.
So you think they will mention we have been working with good aliens?
Who knows but can you really say we haven't?
