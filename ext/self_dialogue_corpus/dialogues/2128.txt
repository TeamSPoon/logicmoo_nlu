I've had something in my mind regarding the future of the NFL
What is it?
After guys like Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Big Ben retire who do you think will be the top guys at the position?
it's hard to say. Mostly because I don't think Brady is ever going to retire. Second, I don't know the future of the upcoming quarterbacks for the draft.
True. Hard to judge the future of the position when there will be 20 or 30 new quarterbacks drafted by the time they are all gone.
To answer your question. I think it might be someone like Dak or Russell Wilson.
What about Carr?
Oh yeah definitely Carr. I think I might have to edit my answer. I forgot about him.
Do you think Cousins could ever hit that tier?
I'm really not sure. His Win/Loss record against good teams isn't that impressive.
The 'Skins don't seem to be too faithful in him. They keep dangling him on one year deals.
I suppose with good reason. He still needs to play better in big games.
What about Newton? You don't think he can take over the league?
He could, but I find his style of play to be too physical to maintain.
I find he is kind of like a worse version of Big Ben. Cam's more athletic, but his accuracy and decision making is a lot worse.
Yeah definitely. Even with a poor offensive line Big Ben still plays amazingly.
I think Cam may make a few more Pro-Bowls, but outside of that I don't think he will dominate.
His career hasn't been as good as people say it has.
It is crazy to think we are in the brink of a generation change at the quarterback position.
I always fear we will hit a wall where there's no legitimately great ones in the league, but looks like we have plenty of candidates for the future.
