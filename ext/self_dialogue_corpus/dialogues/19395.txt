Hey, you ever hear of Rag Time?
You mean Rag Doll by Aerosmith?
No, "Rag ... Time"
Oh! Like Janis Joplin..
Well, Scott Joplin, but yeah-
Sure, "The Entertainer"-
Yep, what do you think? These are the roots of modern music.
I don't know. I only remember it from "The Sting" movie
You gotta realize what a step this was for music and for jazz.
How do you mean?
Well, Joplin kinda went crazy he started jumping all over the place.
How so?
His hands, he.. chased octaves using cords he-
I got it. I think I know.
One hand would be jumping between 2 or 3 octaves while the other was doing the same.
Yeah, I guess it's pretty wild for the time.
Never been done before, you ain't kiddin'
So why bring this up?
I don't know, it's just one of those things.
Yeah, forgotten..
