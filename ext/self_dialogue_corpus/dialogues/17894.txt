Have you ever listened to religious themed music?
You mean, like at church?
It could be during a religious ceremony, but there is religious music sung outside of worship services.
I used to sing in a church choir when I was a boy, but haven't listened to too much religious music recently.
I was curious because I think it's interesting how religion and music pair together.
How do you think they pair together?
Well, music is very much something that can stir the emotions. And the concept of religious faith is one that touches on emotion as well.
I can sort of see where you're coming from.
It's like, feeling the bliss of connecting with a higher power, and the feeling of listening to an achingly beautiful song.
So you're saying that music can enhance that feeling?
Or even create it in the first place, sure.
Hmm, interesting.
Have you ever heard the song 'Amazing Grace'?
Of course, that's a classic song.
It's a beautiful song, and also one that has religious concepts within it.
Definitely.
I think that good religious music is like good music of any kind, in a sense.
What do you mean?
If it's really good, it transports you into an emotional or mental state that is elevated.
Yes, I suppose it does.
