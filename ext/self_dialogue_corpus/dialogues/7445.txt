How did you like The Incredibles?
I didn't like it that much when I first saw it, but it's really grown on me over time.
I felt the same, actually. It didn't seem like something I would enjoy at first.
Edna Mode was the character that got me interested in it, though.
She was so funny! Especially when it came to her opinion on capes!
I hope she is in the sequel.
I would love to see more of her, too. I haven't heard much about the sequel, have you?
No, I just know they announced they will have one.
I hope it is even better than the original movie. Maybe with some more humor.
I would like to see more scenes like when all of the family fights the villain together in the end of the first one!
