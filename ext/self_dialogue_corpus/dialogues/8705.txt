What do you think of The Killers' new stuff?
You mean their new single The Man?
Yeah precisely that one.
It's a bit different, more of a disco vibe than a synth rock vibe but I dig it.
I like it too, I was expecting a backlash against it but it's been pretty positive.
Yeah the YouTube comments are generally pretty positive.
Now that could just be because after five years we finally got a new Killers song.
Could be, but nothing stops YouTube commenters from being terrible if that's what they want to do.
Very true, I'm glad to see the reception the song is getting.
Same, I can't wait for the full album in September.
