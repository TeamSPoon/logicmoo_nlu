Do you like Brian in the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes I love him.
Do you think he's that awesome in real life?
I hope so, he's so dreamy.
Do you have a crush on him?
Obviously I do.
What do you like about him as an actor?
Well first off he's all business but at the same time he's not. He will do what it takes to get the job done but for the right reasons.
That's a good reason.
Plus he's just awesome.
