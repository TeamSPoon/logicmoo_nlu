So who is your favorite Harry Potter movie character? Besides Snape.
Besides Snape, I would have to say Luna Lovegood.
She's a trip, but I think my favorite by far is McGonagall.
Oh yeah. Maggie Smith killed that role.
Of all of the older British actresses that I know, she fits the part the best.
As if you know more than her and Judy Dench.
Anyhow. I loved the scene during the Battle of Hogwarts when she brought the statues to live.
"I've always wanted to use that spell." She looked SO happy when she said that.
It's another reason that that character was such a boss witch.
Ha. I see what you did there. Yes, I would have loved to have her as a teacher, or a grandmother, or just a neighbor.
