If you could go to any pop concert, who would it be?
Well I would have to go with Bruno Mars.
He is so good. Have you heard his new song "What I Like"?
I have. I love it!
It is right up there with "Just the Way You Are" in my book.
I would say that my all time favorite song of his is "Grenade".
That is a good one. He has a way with love songs.
He does, but he also sings some non-love songs.
Name one.
That is easy, Uptown Funk.
