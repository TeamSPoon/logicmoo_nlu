Have you noticed that Smash Mouth is getting popular again?
Yes, and I don't know why.
Its because of a meme.
Which meme are you talking about?
Something to do with their All Star song. But its everywhere.
Yes, I see people quoting that song all the time. I like it, though.
It definitely brings back memories.
Its a great song and is nostalgic.
Do they still make music?
I have no idea.
Besides All Star, I cant even think of another one of their songs.
There are 2 other really popular ones.
And they are?
Walking on the sun and I'm a believer.
Oh! I completely forgot about I'm a believer.
Thats another really nostalgic one.
It had to have been in some movies.
I'm not sure.
Well, All star definitely was.
Yes, Shrek.
