We watched The Trasnporter one and two this weekend.
The Transporter. Is that Science Fiction?
No,  great action movies with Jason Statham.
Is he a bad guy again?
Well no and yes.
What's that mean?
He is hired to get people somewhere and only goes after people who try to attack.
Guess that's why it's called Transporter.
You got it. Lots of classic Statham action.
I should watch both in one night. Maybe this weekend.
