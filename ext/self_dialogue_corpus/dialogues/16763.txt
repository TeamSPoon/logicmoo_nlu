All the songs go really well together, and the music sounds amazing.

That's a hard choice! I would have to say The Real Thing.
Why? What makes it your favorite?
It gets me pumped up, the beat is just so good.
Do you think it's a good song to exercise to?
Oh, yes! I think a lot of their songs would be.
Except the slow ones, right?
Yes! Though I guess you could cool down to those.
