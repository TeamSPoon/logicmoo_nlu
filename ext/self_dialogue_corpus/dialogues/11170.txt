Did you see Jennifer Lopez's dress at the Met Gala?
Yes, I thought it looked familiar.
Yes, it looked like something she had worn to the Oscars I thought.
It was fabulous though.
Yes, I really like that aquamarine color on her.
Yes, me too.
That color is flattering to a lot of different skin types.
Yes, unless you are super pale!
Yes, I agree.
I could not wear that color.
Yes, I think fair skin looks best in bolder colors.
Yes, otherwise we tend to look washed out.
Her boyfriend was wearing a really nice suit with a tie that matched her dress.
I noticed that, very sharp.
Diana Ross had on a really beautiful Oscar de la Renta gown too.
I did not see that. What did it look like.
It was super poofy and full of volume.
Sounds like Diana Ross.
Yes, it was dramatic and beautiful.
Just like her!
