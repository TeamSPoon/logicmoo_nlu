Well, I let my kids watch all of the Harry Potter movies finally.
Really? What did they think of them?
They were hooked from the first scene of Sorcerer's Stone.
That is not suprising. They are fantastic films.
I agree, I think that they're favorite one was Goblet of Fire.
They have good taste, that is also my favorite.
My daughter just about fell in love with Ron Weasley.
Really? Why him?
I am not sure. I think she just liked that he is kind of a goof ball.
That he is.
