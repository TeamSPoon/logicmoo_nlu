Have you seen the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I tried to go but it was already gone by the time I went to our local theater.
I heard it had awful ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yeah, well you can't trust their opinions. Sometimes the reviewers dislike the ones I like the best.
True, plus I always want to see Johnny Depp!
Yes, me too! I heard that he appeared in person at the Pirates' ride at Disneyworld, pretending to be a character statue of Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I saw a video of that, and he began to move as a boat of people moved by.He was promoting this latest movie I think.
Wow, how did the people act when the character figure moved, andthey realized that it was the real Captain Sparrow?
They were excited! They whipped out their videos and cameras!
Well I would have loved to see that! I hope to see the movie soon.
