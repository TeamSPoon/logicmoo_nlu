Will the Yankees ever be good again
I think very shortly
How good will they be?
They have one of the best farm systems in baseball
Do you think theyll ever go back to the old way of doing things?
Like signing overpriced free agents?
Yeah that way
No, I think baseball has changed
In what respect
Most teams hoard their talent
So you wont see them sign those guys
Those kind of guys arent hitting the market anymore
But what about a team that has a surplus at a position
You do have those but that will be in trades
Will their farm system ever run out?
Sure theyll trade those guys away
Interesting. I cant see them standing pat
Either can I, but theyll use it as a farm system
I bet Steinbrenner is rolling in his grave
Oh you know he is
