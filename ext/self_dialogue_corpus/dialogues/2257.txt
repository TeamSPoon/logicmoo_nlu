Hello!
Hello!
I didn’t see you I the field. Where had you been?
I was watching the game from the right side. I hope you enjoy it.
Oh, yes I did. It was a keenly contested game. There was excitement all through. Wasn’t it?
Yes, you’re right. Until the game was over it was difficult to forecast which team would win.
Yes, I too thought the game would end in a draw.
On the whole it was a clean game. There was no foul charge on either side.
What are you doing after the game?
I am going to a buddy's house to celebrate the win.
Is your buddy a Seahawk's fan?
Yeah, he will like anyone whose a Seahawk Fan.
Great, I actually got a Lynch Jersey I can wear to over there.
Ah ha that's a good one.
You excited about the next game?
Yeah, but I won't be able to make it to the next game.
Why not?
I have something for work and my boss isn't a Seahawks fan.
That's too bad, we'll have fun at your buddy's.
Sounds good.
