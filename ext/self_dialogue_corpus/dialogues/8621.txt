Bon Scott or Brian Johnson, who's your guy?
Has to be Brian Johnson. His voice is the best.
Yeah, but my favorite AC/DC song is It's a Long Way to the Top so I'm going with Bon Scott.
What happened to that guy anyway?
He vomited while sleeping and choked to death.
Dude, that is tragic.
I know, it's an absolute shame how many Rock artists have died from drinking and drug related deaths.
Brian Johnson was obviously the band's saving grace.
How did Angus Young come up with that little hop he does on stage?
Beats me, but he's been performing like that for 40 plus years now. It's awesome.
