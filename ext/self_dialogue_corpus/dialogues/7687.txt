What do you think the best Dumpledore moments were throughout the series?
I liked when he made that escape during Order of the Phoenix.
That was pretty awesome.  How about his grand mater plan in Snape's Memory?
Yeah, like when he had Snape begging for mercy?
Don't forget when he fought off all those creatures in the cave with Harry.
For sure, and when he died.  That made me feel so bad for him.
Until later you find out he was already going to die and he master minded it.
That was amazing.  Dumpledore is always ten steps ahead.
He also seemed to hold his own against Voldemort in the Ministry dual.
Yes, clearly he's the man.  But he couldn't get past those horcuxes.
