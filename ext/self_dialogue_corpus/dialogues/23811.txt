Have you heard of this movie called “Kimi no Na wa,” also called “Your Name”?
You mean that one animation movie?
Yeah, that’s the one!
Is it from Japan?
Yeah, it’s a Japanese anime movie that had some theater releases in the U.S.
I saw the trailer for it.
What did you think of it?
The animation is amazing!
It is, isn’t it!?
The colors were so beautiful!
I especially like the aurora in the sky.
Yeah, it looks like real life.
Are you going to watch it?
I don’t know. Do you know what the plot is?
Yeah, there is a boy and a girl that live in different areas of Japan. They switch bodies.
Whoa, that sounds cool!
It is! They get to live each other’s lives.
So it’s a romance movie?
It is, but it also has some mystery in it. It’s a very beautiful movie, plot and animation wise.
I think I’m going to watch it because I want to see more of that animation.
