Yo
Yo wanna get a movie
Nah i am bored of movies
Why
I dont know i feel burnt out
but movies are always chill
I feel like i have seen everything their is in movies thoguh
How though
Well it all feels so rote now
Nah their is still plenty left
But how can you be sure
i am sure because i am sure
But what if their is nothing new its all repeats
some repeats are bound to happen
But what if it is all that
Nah their is plenty of original movies
Where
You gotta look into lower budget stuff
But is that any good
Most are
