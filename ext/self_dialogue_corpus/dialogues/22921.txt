Are there any classic horror films that you really like?
I love the original Frankenstein.
The one with Boris Karloff?
That's the one.
I liked him in The Mummy.
He was in a lot of those classic  horror films.
What do you think of Dracula?
I think it was pretty good for its time.
Bela Lugosi was such a good actor.
Did you ever see The Wolfman?
I never really had an interest in any kind of Wolfman movies.
How about Phantom of the Opera?
That has such a good story line. Did you see the remake that came out in 2004?
Several times. I love the music in it.
You know a movie that was really corny to me?
What's that?
The Thing.
Oh that had too much screaming for me.
Those old movies are fun to watch from time to time.
Especially on a cold, rainy night.
