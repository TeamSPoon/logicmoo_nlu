What's your favorite Disney movie?
Old time Disney - it would be Sleeping Beauty. That was a groundbreaker in animation back in its day.
What about a contemporary favorite?
It would have to be Aladdin. That film just had everything perfect.
Kind of bittersweet now, since Robin Williams has passed.
I'm grateful for films like Aladdin that captured Robin when he was at his peak, doing what he did better than anyone else in the world.
He certainly made the Genie a unique and memorable character.
He was so topical with his improv riffs that you need to look some of his references up to understand them! But that makes Aladdin a kind of time capsule as well as a great movie.
It was fun to find out that Robin could sing, too. I guess he could do anything.
He will live forever, thanks to Aladdin and all of his other wonderful work on film and TV. I'm glad for that.
