DId you watch the movie "Unbreakable"?
Yes, that is the one with Bruce Willis as the Security Guard.
Yes, he did a good job. I was expecting something like he usually does, but this one had a slow pace.
I really did not expect him to turn into a super hero, it really picked up on all the action and suspense, great ending
Did you catch the twist at the ending?
Kinda, can you fill me in a bit?
Well starts out Bruce is a security guard with one kid, and he and his wife are having issues. He is on a train going to NYC, for an interview.
That is when the train wrecks and he is the only one, left alive.
Yes, and the reason he was left alive was that he had the powers of a superhero, but he had no idea.
Then he runs into the man that has the broken bone disease. Who in turns in the end orchestrated the entire thing. Bruce was the good guy and the other guy was MR. Glass.
