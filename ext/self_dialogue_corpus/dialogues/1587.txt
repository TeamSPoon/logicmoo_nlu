What teams do you think are going to the NFL playoffs this season?
In the AFC, at least three of last year's playoff teams are - New England, Pittsburgh and Oakland.
Yeah, can't argue with that. But who else?
In the AFC South, I an't see Houston repeating as division champions.
Me neither, that was a fluke last season. The Colts should be better this year, at least a little. That's enough to take a weak division.
Yeah. I am not sure about Kansas City in the AFC West.
I don't think they get back. Alex Smith is unspectacular, and I can't see that defense being as good this season.
The AFC North teams should be better. I could see Baltimore and Cincinnati getting the Wild Card spots.
Could be, but the AFC East won't get any Wild Cards. Miami got lucky last season.
They did. So did Detroit in the NFC North.
That they did. I doubt they get back into the playoffs.
Me too.But Green Bay should win that division again.
Agreed. Chicago is a disaster and Minnesota will be worse without Adrian Peterson.
The NFC East could get three playoff spots.
Yeah, it could. Dallas should win the divison again, and the Giants are good enough to return to the playoffs.
Yep. And Washington should be improved enough to contend for the Wild Card.
If they don't get it, I think Tampa Bay could - assuming they don't beat out the Falcons for the NFC South title.
Yeah, Jameis Winston look like he will be great, and soon.
The NFC West is Seattle's to lose.
Yep, and I can't see any Wild Card teams from that division.
