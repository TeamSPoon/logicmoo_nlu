Did you see Kong: Skull Island?
It was a good movie
What was your favorite part
I liked all of the parts where they were hiding form the lizards
The lizards were really scary
Do you remember the part where they showed the barricade with wooden spikes
Yeah, the spikes were covered in blood
It was sad that the people worshiped the monkey
Yeah it was big, but they were smarter that it
They made those beautiful works of art inside
What did you think about the pilot
He was different from the tribe people
It's cool when they tie in a real world event with a movie
He blended in pretty well with the modern day people
He certainly knew more about his airplane
Do you think you could start and engine like that after so many years?
Not if it was out in the open, getting rusty
I felt more sympathetic to the military people this time. They just wanted to explore
I didn't feel the same connection between Kong and the woman he saved in this one
They wanted to deal with other ideas
