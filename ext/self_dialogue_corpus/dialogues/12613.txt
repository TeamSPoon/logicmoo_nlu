So there is a debate over the relationship between Wookies and Ewoks.
Yes, some say they ae related like distant cousins.
That's what i originally thought. But then i came up with a different theory.
What was that?
Well, like on Earth there are Humans and Apes, i was thinking that Wookies and Ewoks were similar.
So Wookies would be the advanced of the two.
Yes, and the Ewoks were the lesser of the two species.
Interesting. They do look similar except for the height issue.
And they are a jungle species. However we've only seen Chewbacca, no other wookies.
That is true too.
