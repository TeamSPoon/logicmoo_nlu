Do you like Radiohead?
Yeah, but I havent listened to their new stuff for a while.
Oh really? Did you hear anything from a Moon Shaped Pool?
I watched one of the videos, it seemed pretty cool and similar to their earlier stuff.
Really, I thought it was a little different. There earlier stuff is more rock/pop.
Oh yeah I agree. I guess I meant like the albums from 10 years ago, like In Rainbows.
Oh yeah, I love that album. What's your favorite album?
Ok Computer.
Cool, did you hear about the OKNOTOK anniversary edition that just came out?
Yeah, I read about it. I haven't checked it out yet.
I haven't either. I still have the original CD from the 90s.
Me too. Are they touring?
I think so! Have you seen them live?
Yes, at the Shoreline. They were amazing.
Cool! I'd love to see one of their shows. I usually just watch their live stuff on youtube.
Oh yeah I also like watching those videos -- they are really good live.
Do you follow any of their solo work?
I have Thom Yorke's first album which was ok.
Oh, The Eraser? Yeah that was just ok.
Not nearly as good as Radiohead.
