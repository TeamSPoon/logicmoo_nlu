Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson?
I haven't, but I liked the animated version.
The animated version was pretty good, the real to life one is better though.
What other Disney movies do you like?
101 Dalmations is my favorite. I'm an animal lover.
That's a great movie. I love Pongo and Perdita.
The puppies are so cute. Especially Roly, the chubby one.
I liked the twilight bark, when the dogs came together to save the puppies.
Cruella Deville is a nasty villain.
The movie kept you on the edge of your seat. For being animated, it was really good.
