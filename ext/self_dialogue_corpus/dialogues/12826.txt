Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens last weekend with my boyfriend.
What did you think of it?
I enjoyed it a lot, but I was a little confused about how it really connected with the other movies.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I liked Rey a lot though.
Oh, I loved Rey! I'm excited to see where her story goes. And Finn too, I really liked him.
I really enjoyed that they kept Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It made it more real.
Are you going to see the next one when it comes out?
Yeah, I thought I probably would, we should go together!
It's a date!
