did you see pokemon 2
the one with lugia?
yeah, that movie was good
not as good as the first one though
ill have to agree with you on that
lugia was really cool though
lugias song was nice too
i learned it on the piano
i learned it on my guitar
it was such a nice little tune
it was.

moltres is just a fire duck

i liked zaptos
zaptos is all spikey, which is kinda cool
