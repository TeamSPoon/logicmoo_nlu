So I finally saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two!
Finally! I mean, really, it was about time.
It was so great. It really brought the books to life for me.
I think it is interesting how the movies started so light and blissful and got so dark before culminating in Deathly Hallows.
I know, it is like the movie content matured with the age of the actors.
Well, did you like the older or newer movies?
That is a tough question.
How so?
I liked them all, but for different reasons.
I guess I cannot really pick a favorite either.
