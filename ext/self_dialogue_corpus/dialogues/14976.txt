Are you a big fan of comedy films?
Sometimes. It depends on what I'm in the mood for.
I heard you. I can only watch them on occasion.
Who is your favorite comedy actor?
Mine is probably Will Ferrell. You?
Kevin Hart for me.
I really like Kevin Hart but he is in too many films.
I know. He really sold out.
I can't blame him. He had a great reputation and received big offers.
I wish he stuck to his roots, though.
