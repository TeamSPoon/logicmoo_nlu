Have you seen the last superbowl?
Of course I did, I bet 20$ on the game
Who did you bet on?
The patriots
Then you must've been very nervous
Without a doubt, I was a wreck
It looked like they were certainly going to lose the game
Yeah especially at half time
Where did you watch the game
At a superbowl party
Were your friends teasing you about your bet?
You bet it, it was quite annoying
But it sounds like you got the last laugh in the end
I laughed so hard when Brady started the comeback
I bet you were yelling and screaming at the TV
I was extremely loud and I was very annoying
What did you do with your prize money?
I just bought some beer for the party
Well that makes you a good winner!
Yes, I didn't want to make anyone mad by winning, so I contributed to the people
