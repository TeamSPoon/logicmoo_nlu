Hi! Did you hear Britney Spears new song?
No, What has she co e out with ?
She is a great singer and she sings make me.
What is it about ?
I think it's about taking things to the next level in love.
She has a guy rap in the middle of it.  His name is G easy.
Oh I heard of him he is pretty good.
She also has this other song called slumber party.
I think this one is more fun.
I will have to see both of them to compare.
Yeah she just released her ninth album.
Oh my god I didn't realize she had that many albums.
Yes, they are just two of the songs.  A lot of the other ones are about relationships and love too.
Which one do you lie
