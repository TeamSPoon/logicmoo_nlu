Lets talk about movies
Sounds great to be
I love all kinds
Me too
I just watched nights in rondanthe
That was such a sweet movie
I cried so bad
Me too
Richard gere is still hot
Totally
Would it kill nicolas sparks to have a happy ending
I know
Richard gere should have come back
And they would have lived happily ever after
Exactly
I loved a walk to remember too
That was also sad
I know
But it was good
Yes it was
