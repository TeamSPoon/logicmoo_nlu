You know,life with no music would be pretty bland.
I definitely agree with that.
I mean,I'm always playing music.
Exactly,in the car or at home.
It's so relaxing and takes your mind off things.
It's like being in another world at times.
I know what you mean.
I always wanted to play an instrument.
I can play some things on a keyboard.
Really? Like what?
I can play the beginning part of let it be.
That's a great opening piano part.
I taught myself.
That's real cool.
I think so.
Was it hard?
Not like you would think. Basic c cords.
Wow,I'm impressed.
It's just a lot of practice.
Practice makes perfect
