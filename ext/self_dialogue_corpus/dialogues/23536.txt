I just saw my first James Dean movie.
How did you like it?
It was not what I thought. A lot of drama for the most part.
What one was it?
It was called, Giant.
With Elizabeth Taylor?
The dark headed woman, yes.
That is one of his more dramatic pieces, focuses more on adult and not teen stuff.
I thought he made more films.
Nope, not really less than ten is all.
I liked the one with the jacket. A Rebel Without a Cause.
That is his more classic one. The whole angst thing.
He reminded me a bit of Heath Ledger in Ten things I hate about you.
Another Teenage angst film.
I like the way movies portray teens like that.
You would like American Gaffiti then.
What is that?
It is a coming of age film, Harrison Ford and a few pretty much lesser known actors at the time.
Is it a fun film?
Fun, drama, teen issues, a lot going on . Worth a watch.
