What did you think of Brave?
I loved the story.
Yeah, the characters were very memorable too.
Yeah, I really liked the witch.
It was too bad she was only in it for a bit.
I don't mind though. I like characters that pop in only for a scene.
I thought it was really cool how she just disappeared and her house was empty.
That scene was very cool.
Did you like the ending?
Yes, I am glad her mom turned back into a human.
