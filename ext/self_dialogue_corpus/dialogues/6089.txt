What is your favorite Disney movie?
I don't really have a favorite, but I pretty much like anything that Pixar has made.
I heard Cars 3 was very good.
It was definitely the best in the series.
I really liked the Toy Story movies.
That is probably my favorite animated series of movies of all time.
It's amazing that the sequels are just as good as the original.
The characters in the movies are some of the most memorable of any movie.
Buzz Lightyear and Woody's interactions are funny for both kids and adults.
The fact that they throw in some adult humor here and there is what makes those movies so entertaining.
