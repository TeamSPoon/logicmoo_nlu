Who is your favorite disney character?
It's got to be Goofy!
Woah, me too! I loved A Goofy Movie!
No kidding, that's my favorite disney movie of all time!
Me too! Whats your favorite scene?
Obviously the powerline concert at the end of the film!
Mine is when Goofy and Max are travelling along the river in their broken down car
And when Goofy nearly died at the waterfall, I almost lost it!
Me too, its quite a tear jerker
Best movie of 1996 by far
