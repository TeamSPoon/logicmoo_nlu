Did you hear Iggy Azalea's new song SWITCH?
I did.  I also saw the leaked video.
Well, what did you think?  I loved both of them.
Both video and song reminded me of Nicki Minaj's work.  I like Nicki better.
You think she's copying Nicki?
Absolutely!  The costumes look like she robbed Nicki's closet!
Maybe, but the music was very different.
She used Nicki's "mirror, mirror on the wall" line.
Everyone's using that line these days!
Iggy's voice didn't even sound like Iggy.
What's wrong with experimenting with different sounds?  She's trying something new.
New to her, but not new to mainstream pop or rap.
Fine.  What do you think of the song without comparing her to Nicki?
It's okay.  I would dance to it, but I'm not in love with it.
What about Anitta?  That was the first time I've heard of her.
She's a Brazilian pop star, but I don't know much about her.
I thought she was good on SWITCH.
I agree.  I might look her up on youtube.
It looks like Iggy is creating a new image of herself.
I'll watch the video again, but my initial impression was that she's stealing an image.
