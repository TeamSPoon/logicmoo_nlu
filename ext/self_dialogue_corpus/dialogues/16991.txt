Hey.
Hi.
What kind of music do you like?
I'm not a huge music listener, but I do like some things.
Like what?
Like genres?
Yeah sure.
I like Classical and Opera.
Oh that is different.
Well I do listen to a lot of talk radio and podcasts.  Those are more my thing.
Oh I see what you mean.
What about you?
Music wise I like Rock, Pop, and EDM.
EDM?
electronic dance music.
What is that?
It's like pop music with a beat.
Oh I see.
Sometimes it is played on the radio.
I think I might have heard it a few times.
