Did you watch the game between the Braves and Marlins last night?
I meant to but forgot to turn it on. Did I miss anything?
Just one of the best pitched games I have ever seen!
Really.. what happened?
The Braves started Julio Teheran as starting pitcher.
He has had some rough games lately. Only pitched 3 innings last week .
Not last night.. it was a stellar performance. They played him 7 straight innings before letting him rest his arm!
Did he walk anyone?
Not only did he not walk anyone, he had a no hitter!
Are you serious? I haven't seen the Braves do that in ages!
Yeah. Teheran had an awesome night. They even clocked his fast ball at over 90 mph. And not only was he fast.. he was accurate!
I am pretty impressed. He really isn't one of my favorite Braves pitchers, but it sounds like he had an awesome night.
Yeah. a few batters got a piece of the ball, but they were fouls.
Who did they bring in for the 8th?
Jim Johnson. Poor guy had been warming up all night waiting for his chance to pitch.
How did he do?
They let him finish the game. He was pretty good, but not as good as Teheran. Johnson gave up two hits in the bottom of the ninth
Did anyone score on him?
No, he left both batters stuck on base.
Well, remind me to watch next time Teheran pitches.
