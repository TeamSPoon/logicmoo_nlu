So what time are me going to the movies?
Let's go around 8 or 9. Hey what do you think about the dinner and a movie combo?
Sounds like a wonderful treat!
I want to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2!
The first one was so hilarious. Love me some Groot!
The sound track was perfect for that movie.
I can't wait to see baby Groot! i hope it is as good as the first one.
Who knows sometimes they can hit a home run twice with a sequel.
What other sequels did you like?
Beverly Hills Cop for sure. Eddy Murphy's character is so perfectly annoying.
Also what are the cop movies with Danny Glover and Mel Gibson?
Lethal Weapon! Very dramatic but with just the right amount of humor tossed in to make it interesting.
I liked them okay I suppose. But if I had to go for a cop sequel it would have to be with Bruce Willis.
Ahh Yes Die Hard. Good one.
Die Hard movies are so over the top in intensity.
You are quite right about that.
I like the Christmas one the best.
Oh speaking of sequels and Christmas how about National Lampoon sequels.
Randy Quaid is SOOOOOO annoying in these movies. he drives me crazy to watch him.
Yeah he is a goofy dude and plays the part too well!
