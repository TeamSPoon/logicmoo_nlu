We've been having these weekly movie discussion lunches for many years.
Well, technically we talk about other things--sports, family.
Yeah, yeah, but mainly movies and anyway, we've gone from mainly seeing movies in the theater to seeing them at home.
That's true, but I still enjoy the in-theater experience.
Yes, and it's getting nicer all the time.  Have you been in a theater with the new seating?
I have--just like the recliner at home.
And they haven't raised the prices yet where I've gone.
I think they'll have to eventually, especially since it's cut down on the number of seats.
And what about the reserved seat situation.
That is weird to me--it's kind of intimidating trying to pick out your seats while the cashier is impatiently trying to move the line along.
Yes, but it does work out nicely when you can order online.
I haven't gotten in to doing that, although my son does when we go to the movies with him on a visit.
It's pretty efficient.
Yeah, and a little odd when he gives the ticket taker his phone to scan.
What I can't stand is the snack prices.  Do you sneak stuff in?
No, but I don't always buy anything, and I used to really enjoy food at the movies.
It's the chain theaters that gauge you; some of the independent theaters aren't so bad.
I know--there are nice independent theaters that we go to when visiting Santa Cruz and Eugene that are reasonable.
You've said that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is your favorite movie--let's talk about Redford next time.
O.K, I know how you love hearing me talk about old movies, but then Redford is still going.  We can talk about his new movie.
