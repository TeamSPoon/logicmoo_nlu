What do you find appealing about rap?
Oh, several things. It makes me think more than other music, for instance.
About what?
Life in general, but more important it's the way it makes me think.
How do you mean?
Well the genre has a way or presenting things in a way you might not have thought about them before, and encouraging critical thinking and discernment and questioning everything.
Such as?
Oh, news media, the reasons behind a lot of actions by organizations.
I like rap that's about positive things, and not "crazy wild rap".
That's valid. To each their own.
