Who is the best defensive lineman in the NFL?
Playing or past?
Either.
In the past I really liked watching Warren Sapp.  I don't know that he was the best though.
Okay.  So who do you think is current best?
I think Khalil Mack plays well.
Mack is a great player.
I think he really raises the quality of his team.
Who does he play for again.
The Oakland Raiders.
That is right.
Speaking of the Raiders what do you think of Carr?
The quarterback?
Yes.
I don't know much about him.
I didn't watch him close last year but it seemed like he had a lot of highlights.
I guess he did since I know the name.
I will have to pay more attention to him this year.
I think he must be fun to watch.
I sure hope so.
