Have you seen Beauty and the Beast starring Emma Watson yet?
I haven't yet but I am planning to see it this weekend. Have you?
Yes, I did saw it actually last weekend.
How was it?
You know, I went into movie skeptical but in the end I have to say I did like it.
Why did you thought you wouldn't like it?
Well, I thought it would be cheesy like almost all romantic movies are but it wasn't.
How's the acting like?
Emma Watson nailed her character as Belle and so does Dan Stevens as Beast.
Sounds great, I guess I should book tickets now and make sure to see this weekend.
