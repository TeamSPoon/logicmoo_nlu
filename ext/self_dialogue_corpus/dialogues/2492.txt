What do you think of the Monday night football schedule for this year?
I haven't really checked it out yet.
Well week one is the saints at Minnesota.
Nothing big there.
The second game is the chargers at Denver.
That's not really a great game either.
I have to agree with you.
It gets better the following week.
Don't the Giants play?
Yes at home against the lions.
The following week the Cowboys go to Arizona.
Do you think the Cowboys will win the NFC east again?
I don't think so,no.
I think the Giants will be even better.
The Giants defense is going to be dominating.
It could be.
That's the only time the Giants will be on Monday night.
Only one time?
Yes,only one time for the Cowboys too.
That's very unusual.
