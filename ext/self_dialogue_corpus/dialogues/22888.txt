What did you think about 'Spider-Man 3.'
I think it was the worst 'Spider-Man' movie ever made.
I really disliked it too.
What was the biggest sing the movie made you think?
I think it's the fact that they tried to shoehorn too much into one movie.
My thoughts exactly.
I mean why have three excellent Spider-Man villains in one movie?
There wasn't enough focus on any of the villains to develop them fully.
I think even having two of them would not have been as bad.
Topher Grace's Venom just wasn't menacing.
Venom in that movie was also so one-dimensional.
You're right.  That scene where he's praying at the church for god to kill Peter Parker was absurd.
Speaking of absurd, the dance scene.
Yes, that was insane.  It happened right after they showed us "Emo-Peter Parker."
I don't think Tobey Maguire will ever live that scene down.
That movie almost ruined the franchise.
I guess that explains why it was rebooted twice since then.
I have high hopes for the new one.
You mean 'Spider-Man: Homecoming?'  Me too.
Yea.  I think Tom Holland will be awesome as Spidey.
