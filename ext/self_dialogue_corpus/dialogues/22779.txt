did you see the series of unfortunate events?
the movie or the tv show?
either or
i watched the movie.
people apparently love the tv show. the movie was bad
yeah and i usually like jim careys films
it wasn't his fault though.
he was fine as a actor.
they just executed the movie poorly
maybe it was the director or the dialogue
i wonder how it would have been if tim burton did it
it probably would have been better than that brad guy
is that the name of the director.
yes, it just wasnt very cinematic
yeah, it was a bit of a snore
i watched it in theaters too
you spent all that money to see it?
yeah, i loved the books so much
and now you can watch the tv show on netflix
i may consider it
