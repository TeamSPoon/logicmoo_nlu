do you like saosin
i like the old saosin
with anthony greene?
yeah, he was a more versatile singer
his vocals were so strong
he could do so much with his voice.
7 years was intense
the new singer had some good songs too
alone was my favorite
i liked so simple
that song showed how good the vocalist really is
he still isnt as good as anthony though
thats true. anthony has circa survive though
its not as good as old saosin
that is debatable
you really think so?
circa is more complex and intelligent
lyrically it is
but its more progressive too
thats true
