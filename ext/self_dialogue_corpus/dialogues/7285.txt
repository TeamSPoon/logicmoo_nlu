Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Not yet, is it any good?
It's amazing! I really enjoyed watching it in theaters, so I bought it when it came out!
Awesome! I may have to see about renting it.
You really should. I think you will like it.
Does it go along the same storyline as the original? Are the songs the same?
For the most part they stuck to the storyline, they added a little, but it helps the story along. And I was surprised at how well Emma Watson sings!
Nice! I have been a little apprehensive because I loved the original so much.
I totally understand. I was worried I might not like it as much, but I wasn't disappointed at all.
Alright, you've sold me, I'll be renting it this weekend!
