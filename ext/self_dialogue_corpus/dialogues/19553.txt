You know who Pink Floyd is right?
Of course. Well, I mean I've heard of them.
Do you know any of their music?
I've heard the song about time, I liked that one.
That's a good one, but they've got tons of other good stuff too.
Don't they have some really psychedelic stuff?
Some songs are like that, but most of it is like light rock.
What's one of the better albums.
Man, I might as well just list my top three.
Sure, go ahead.
Animals is really good, that one has a lot of popular songs.
Is it about animals?
Not really, it's more about people. The Wall is another really popular album.
I haven't heard of that one.
No most people only hear or see Dark Side of the Moon.
That one I've definitely heard of.
That's the one you see T-shirts of everywhere.
With the pyramid and the light?
That one, that's the album that Time is off of and it's their most famous.
I want to look into The Wall and Animals, I think I'll like stuff on those.
