Have you ever seen Ice Age?
I don't think so -- what is it about?
It's an animated film that came out in the early 2000s.
I don't usually like cartoons.
This one is great!  Ray Romano does one of the voices.
I did like him in the Everyone Loves Raymond TV show
Th character he does the voice for acts just like him in that TV show.
Maybe I would like this cartoon.
I wouldn't call it a cartoon.
But isn't it animated?
Yes -- and it got an Oscar nomination for best feature-length animated movie.
So it is a cartoon.
But when you say "cartoon" like that, it sounds like you're comparing it to the stuff you see on Saturday mornings.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
It's much better in quality than the cartoons on TV.
What would you call it, then?
It's a feature-length computer animated movie.
I guess that sounds better.
Let's watch it over at my place tonight.
OK!
