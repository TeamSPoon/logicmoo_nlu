Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
Han Solo is my favorite.
I agree, I really have a crush on him.
His relationship with Chewbaca is so entertaining.
I like the scenes where he is flying the Mileneum Falcon
So do I.
I was so sad when he died in The Force Awakens.
I couldn't beleve his own son killed him.
I wasn't expecting that either.
I know, I really thought he would be able to save Kylo Ren from the Dark Side.
