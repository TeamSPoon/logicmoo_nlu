What do you think about the Chargers and Raiders both moving to new cities?
I feel sorry for the fans. The Raider fans have been through it before but the Charger fans must be crushed.
Yeah, I hope they have lousy seasons. That's just wrong.
I agree. And since I'm a Denver Bronco fan, I really hope they're lousy!
Did you see the Chargers' new logo?
Yes, I did. What a slam to San Diego. All the years they were there, they never added SD to the logo.
I wonder what the Raiders are going to do?
I haven't heard but I'll let you know if I see something. What do you think about John Lynch going to San Francisco?
I think it's great! I always liked John Lynch.
Me, too! I'm going to be rooting for them to do well. He's good friends with John Elway and he's been giving him tips
I'm just glad they got rid of Kaepernick.
Yes, I didn't care for him.
What do you think about Denver signing Jamaal Charles?
Oh, I thought it was fantastic. I like him and he's been a big Bronco fan his whole life.
You're kidding, really?
Yes, I even saw a picture of him as a teen wearing a John Elway jersey. It was funny.
Ha ha, I can just see the KC fans when they saw that.
Some of them were really mad. They had no idea.
Maybe he'll do good there.
I hope so. We need a good running back.
