I think Episode six is the best Star Wars.
Really? I think Episode five is the best.
I just really like that final meeting between Luke and Vader.
Yeah that is good, but I think the famous reveal in Episode five is better.
Oh thats definitely a great scene, hard to choose between the two honestly.
Yeah but its a lot easier to compare the new trilogy don't you think?
Oh for sure, obviously Episode Three is the best of the prequels.
Yeah agree with that, best lightsaber battles of all the Star Wars movies probably.
No question, the end fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin is classic.
Yeah That might be my overall favorite Star Wars fight.
