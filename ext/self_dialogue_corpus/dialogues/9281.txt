I remember thinking Chingy was really cute when I was a teenager.
I'm not sure if I know who he is.
He was pretty popular, do you remember the song "Right Thurr"?
Yes that was on the radio a lot!
"I like the way you do that right thurr...."
I loved that! My sister played it all the time.
He wasn't what I would call a classic but pretty good.
I agree. He was fairly talented.
I liked him. I can't remember a lot of his other music.
I know he collaborated with a few artists.
