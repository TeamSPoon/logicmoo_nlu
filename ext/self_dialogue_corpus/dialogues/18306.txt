Did you go to that iron Maiden concert?
Yes
How was it?
They were spot on
Did you hear them okay?
My ears are still ringing
I love loud music
I need to bring earplugs next time
Did you understand the lyrics?
I did not hear anything he said
They should lower the volume
I doubt that would go over well with the fans
But, you had a good time?
Of course. I've never been to a concert before
Was the singer good?
He was perfect
I didn't think he would be good
Why?
Because he is old
He's old but he still sings brilliantly.
