What's the most emotional NFL moment you witnessed?
By the far the Saints return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
I've heard about the game but I just moved to New Orleans and it seems like everybody talks it.
Yeah it was a Monday night game in the Superdome.
Who did the Saints play?
Only our biggest rival, the dirty birds.
The Atalanta Falcons?
Yes haha. We call them the dirty birds.
Gotcha, so was that Monday night game the game when that dude blocked the punt?
Sure was and the dude is named Steve Gleason, bascially considered a hero in New Orleans.
Yeah I see people all the time wearing Gleason shirts.
Steve was diagnosed with ALS a few seasons after his historic punt block and all the shirts you see are for his charity called "No White Flags"
Oh wow, that's heartbreaking.
It's very sad but Steve's a class act, he still supports the Saints and is always on the field at any Saints home game.
I'll for sure look for him next time you take me to Saints game.
Who says I'm going to take you to any games this season?
I hope you're joking rite now.
I am I am, don't worry you can actually come to the Monday night game with me this season.
Great! Who are the Saints playing?
Vikings in the Superdome!
