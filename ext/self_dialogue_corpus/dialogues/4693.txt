How about them Cubs beating the Reds?
That was crazy! I did not see that coming.
Me either, what was the score again?
It was five to nine. I was really happy about it.
They did well, they had a good last few games.
They have, only three loses.
And  four wins! How do you think their season will go?
I think it will be great I mean they had a good margin in wins too, by points.
Most the games by two points. But they had some bad loses.
They did have a zero to five lose at the Cardinals.
The Card just really beat them bad. It was awful.They scored no innings, they were off their game .
Everyone has bad days, they only lost by three to the Brewers.
And two to the Cardinals in the second game.
The Cardinals are having a good season, so it is not like they got skunked by a bad team.
They Cardinals are doing great. I really see them in the finals.
I think they have a chance to make it to the last bout.
They may even win if they keep it up.
But, I am still hoping the Cubs pull back and take it all home.
Who do you think beside them might make it?
It is hard to say, the Cub, Cards, maybe the Yankees if they get lucky.
