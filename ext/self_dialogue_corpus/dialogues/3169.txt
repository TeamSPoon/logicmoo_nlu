What kind of year are the Colts going to have, you think?
Not sure. I don't keep up much with AFC.
They've got Andrew Luck.
Isn't he the highest paid player, or was?
I think so maybe.
You know, I used to think he was really slow but it turns out he's pretty fast.
I thought the same thing. I thought he was a real plodder.
Get a good pass rush on him and he was toast.
But I think I heard he runs like a 4.4 forty.
That's pretty good. Faster than a lot of QBs.
Faster than Tom Brady.
Yeah, old man Brady. I got to say the guy is good even if I don't like him much.
I guess it's human nature to root for the underdog and Brady's no underdog.
What do you think of Belichick as a coach?
I kind of feel about him the same way I feel about Brady.
I know what you mean.
I admire him and I think he's a great coach but I can't cheer for his team.
It's like they don't need cheering for.
Yeah, like a machine, a winning machine. Hard to cheer for a machine.
I heard that. I'm with you, man.
