What is your favorite Disney character?
There are many good ones. My favorite would have to be Mushu, Mulan's sidekick.
I don't remember Mulan having a sidekick.
Mushu was the red dragon.
I remember now. He was funny.
Not only did he provide comedic relief, but he was there for Mulan when she needed him.
Why is he your favorite character?
Mushu makes me laugh. He also reminds us that no matter your position in life, you can be there for others.
For a small dragon, he played a large role.
I think his heart was bigger than he was.
