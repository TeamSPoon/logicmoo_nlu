I love to watch old school Star wars movies how about you?
Yes! The new ones are just not as good.
I did like the newest one because it had princess Leia and Han solo but it was missing Luke skywalker.
I agree and I just don't see Leia and Han's son turning evil.
I agree and  I like how it gave way to more sequels but then again 7 was enough.
8 if you count Rogue one.
Yes I haven't seen that one yet because it goes completely away from the main characters of Leia,Han,and Skywalker and their families.
Yes but I hear it is really good, better than Revenge of the Sith.
Yea I didn't care for the actor playing Anakin/ Darth Vader in that one.
Yes and I like that they explained Darth Vader's back story in those Pre-quels but it  wasn't a nearly as good as the original star wars trilogy.
