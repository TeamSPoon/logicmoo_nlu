Have you ever watched the Scott Pilgrim movie?
I haven't. Did you like it?
I thought it was great.
Doesn't it have that actor in it?
Do you mean Michael Cera?
Yes! The guy from SuperBad.
Yup he plays Scott Pilgrim.
Does he play an awkward teenager?
Of course! Well he's 23 in the movie so not really a teenager.
Very true. I love him though.
I think you'd like this one a lot.
Is it about Superheros?
Kind of. It's based on a comic book series.
Isn't he in love with someone?
Yeah and he has to defeat her exes to win her love.
Huh that's a new concept.
It sounds corny but the movie has great visuals.
That sounds kinda cool.
Yeah I'll have to have you watch it sometime.
Yeah I think I'd like it.
