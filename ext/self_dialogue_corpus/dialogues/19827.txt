Have you heard Alt-J's latest new album?
You mean Relaxer?
Yeah, that one.
Not yet but I have a few songs on the radio.
What do you think?
I feel like each song on this album that I have heard is trying something different.
Me too. I feel like some are taking bigger risks than others.
So far my  favorite tracks are In Cold Blood, Deadcrush and Adeline.
Those are the only ones you have heard, right?
Yep.
I hate to say it, but I only like the three singles, too.
The rest isn't very good?
No. Not in my opinion.
Well, that is kind of disappointing  after loving An Awesome Wave and This Is All Yours so much.
Tell me about it. I was really excited for this album after hearing the singles.
But once you bought the album?
But then......first minute is a recorder intro.  And the rest wasn't great either.
I had high hopes for this album.
So disappointed. Maybe it'll take a few listens to grow on me but my initial opinion was that it didn't fit in at all.
Guess I won't be buying the album.
