I wonder what's so dfferent about the European culture that led to all these things.
I've heard one theorist saying the Christianity and its inherent nature for the believers ruminate and think deeply on things.
That's  kinda interesting.
Indeed. Our religion forces us to ruminate on everything ioncluding science, knowledge, art and music.
And when we think deeply about anything, it tends to develop fruther.
it indeed does and music is no different, and the musical theories are present in virtually no other cultures. At least not the the extent found in Western art music.
That sounds racist, almost.
It's a fact. A fact is not racist.
Anyway, so medieval Europe is where it all began eh?
In my opinion, yes.
I formed that opinion based on my studies.
You're a mathmatician.
What does that got to do with anything? I also studied music.
and music and math has a lot in common.
They're both rule based and very logical.
Logical until you get to atonal music.
Well, we can't win 'em all.
Who's the most famous atonal music composer, I wonder?
There are quite a few. Schonberg comes to mind immediately. 5 little piano pieces
That's a beautiful piece of music. How do people write something like that out of a key? It's amazing to me
