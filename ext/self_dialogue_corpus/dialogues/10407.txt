Hey what are you doing Thursday after class?
Probably studying, why?
There's a free movie playing!
Really!?
Yeah! A movie in the park.
Sounds great. Wha't playing?
Sing.
Never heard of it.
It's airly new... and a kid's movie.
Oh, really? Wouldn't that be weird for two adults to go to a kid's event?
Well the advertisement doesn't say anything about that!
Ok, then! I do still love kid's movies.
Me too! I still watch the Rudolph classics on TV every Christmas.
Me too! And I always have to watch Home Alone.
Classic. Did you ever watch the sequel?
Yeah, just the first one.
There's more than one?
Yeah, they built on the Home Alone empire! All the other one's are pretty bad though.
I bet.
I don't even think they went to the theaters. Straight for TV movies are always a flop!
