Yo you want to go see that Auburn Baseball game?
Nah not really.
Why not?
I don't like baseball
Dude, you obviously didn't see the last game.
What happened?
Ok so the auburn pitcher, top of the 9th, had 2 outs, 2 strikes and 2 balls right
Right.
And he decided to call a time out.
You can do that in baseball?
Apparently.
Ok continue
So he talked to the coach and decided to do something nuts
What happened?
He swapped with the catcher and he became the catcher.
Ok then what?
The the catcher pitched it, and actually threw a strike and struck the dude out!
No freakin way, how?
The guy took off his mask and it was Tim Hudson!
Bruh. No freakin way! Ok I gotta go see them play now.
