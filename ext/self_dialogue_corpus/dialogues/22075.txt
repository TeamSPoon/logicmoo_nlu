I want to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Me too. I saw the first one and it was hilarious.
I haven't even seen the first one.
You haven't?!
Believe it or not, I haven't!
Well, you should definitely see it before you see the first one.
Ok.
I mean, you don't have to, but, it's super fun and you'll get the characters more and stuff.
That's how it usually is.
Yeah, the dude who plays starlord is hilarious.
Looks like it.
Anyway, so when do you want to go see the second one?
I don't know. You've kind of got me wanting to see the first one first.
Makes sense.
Where should I see the first one?
I don't know online somewhere.
Netflix?
Maybe. It's a big movie. I'm sure it's online somewhere.
Yeah.
Cool, and then after you watch that we'll go watch the second one!
