Did you like Jar Jar Binks?
No, he was annoying.
I agree. I liked 3PO way better.
Did you like the new film?
No, I thought it was very boring.
Yeah, it's kind of like they ripped off the old one and added a bunch of Star Trek ideas into it.
What was your favorite episode?
I liked the original the best.
That was a good one. Most people like Empire the best
That is also a great one.
