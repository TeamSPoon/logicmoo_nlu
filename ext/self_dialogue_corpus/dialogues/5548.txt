What Disney movies do you like?
Monsters, Inc. is my favorite.
That's a great movie! Billy Crystal and John Goodman are phenomenal!
They really are. I couldn't believe Mr. Waternoose turned out to be on Randall's side.
I couldn't believe that either. Good thing he was captured and arrested in the end.
Did you see Monsters University?
I did! I liked Monsters, Inc. a little better, but Monsters University is still really funny.
I love how Sully tries to help Mike in the end with his scaring.
By helping him cheat in the scare games?
Yes. He did it out of love for his friend.
