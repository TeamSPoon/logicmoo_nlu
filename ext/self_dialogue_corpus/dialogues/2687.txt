Hey! I haven't seen you in a while!
Yeah, I moved to New York!
Nice! How do you like the New York Giants?
I've actually been able to see them play a few times.
That's pretty awesome.
I agree.
Where did you see them play?
I watched some home games, so they were at the Metlife Stadium.
Is that in New York?
Actually it is in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Why New Jersey?
They share the stadium with New York Jets, so I guess that must be where they agreed to?
You'd really think their stadium would be in New York, though.
For sure. I was surprised, too.
So how has the team been doing lately?
They're ranked third right now.
Behind who?
The Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears.
Clearly you're more up to date on the team than I am.
Clearly!
