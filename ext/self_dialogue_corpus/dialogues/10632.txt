A lot of people tend to like the Fast & Furious series for the overall story.
Right. Are you getting to something.
I was going to ask you if you like any of the subplots of the movies.
Well, now that you mention it.
Well, go on.
I was kind of into the whole thing with Letty being brainwashed.
That was in number 6, right.
That's right. I liked the process of her going from being brainwashed to being back with her team.
I imagine that would be satisfying to watch.
Wait, so you haven't seen it?
