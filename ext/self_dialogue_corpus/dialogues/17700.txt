What's your favorite band?
The Beatles
Yeah, they're great. What's your favorite song?
So many to choose from. Maybe Strawberry Fields Forever.
That's a good one. I love A Day in the Life.
I don't remember that one.
It's the last song on Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Oh! That's a famous album. But I can't recall that track.
It's one of their most innovative. It builds to a crazy climax with a full orchestra.
Oh wow. I've got to go listen to that one again.
Yeah, it's great. What's your favorite album?
It's got to be The White Album.
Oh yeah? What's your favorite song on that one?
O Bla Di O Bla Dah
Haha, I got to admit, that song gets on my nerves a bit. But it is catchy.
You can't please everyone. Do you like John Lennon's solo music?
Some of it, yeah. Imagine is good.
But not as good as the Beatles, right?
Yeah.
You can't beat the Beatles in their prime.
