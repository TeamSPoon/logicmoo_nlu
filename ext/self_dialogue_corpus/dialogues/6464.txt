Did you know they're making a toy story 4?
I didn't, I loved the first 3.
Me too, the new one comes out in 2019.
It'll definitely be worth the wait for that.
I think so too, I'm going to buy a Woody or Buzz Light Year doll for my cousin's birthday.
I used to have a Woody toy of those as a kid.
Did you like it?
I used to play with it all the time but I kind of wish it had been a Buzz Light Year toy.
I'll end up buying him a Buzz toy instead then.
I'm sure he'll like it as much as I would have.
