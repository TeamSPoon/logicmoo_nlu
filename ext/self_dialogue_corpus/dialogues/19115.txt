Do you like jazz?
I do, although I don't listen as much I used to.
Yeah I know what you mean.  It can be relaxing though.
Have you ever played an instrument?
I used to play trumpet.  What about you?
I played the sax in highschool.
Cool, every play any jazz?
Just some awful improve with my friends.
Yeah, like a terrible b flat blues.
Glad to see we weren't the only ones.
We thought we were jamming pretty hard though.
Who's to say we weren't.  Maybe we could be in a band right now.
I'll get on Facebook and contact everyone.
Yeah, we're getting the band back together.
Maybe we could make this like Blues Brothers.
That was a good movie, with great music.
Yeah it was.  How often do you see music that good in a movie?
No often.  That band was good too.
Don't forget the suits.
Yeah, I like their odd sense of fashion.
