What do you think about Guns N' Roses touring again?
I love it. I'm a huge fan of Axl.
I'm surprised they got back together.
They had so much baggage I'm pretty shocked as well.
Did you see where they were playing their first venue?
Yes. The new arena in Vegas.
I really wish I could have gotten tickets..
Me too. I'd love to hear Paradise City live one more time.
Maybe they're going to schedule more dates.
I hope so. Them and AC/DC are my favorites.
