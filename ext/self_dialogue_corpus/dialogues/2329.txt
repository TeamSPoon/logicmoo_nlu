Do you still like the NFL even with all the concussion issues?
Yes, I love watching football. That hasn't changed for me.
But don't you think it is too dangerous?
I think those are all adult men making a decision to play, and they know the risks.
I have a hard time watching anymore.
I still love the game and I don't think it is different than any other sport, or even extreme sports.
I guess that is true.
They have implemented rules to try to make the game safer, like the helmet-to-helment and targeting rules.
But that doesn't physically stop players from doing it.
No, you are right, but I think there are fewer instances.
Maybe. It is just so intense.
That is what I like about it. I think it is so much more interesting and engaging than other sports.
There is definitely more action than in baseball, I'll agree.
For sure. And I've never been a huge fan of hockey or basketball. I just really love the NFL.
What's your favorite team?
The Patriots, but I genuinely like watching all the games.
So you are as much a fan of the game as you are a team.
Well, I'm definintely a Patriots fan, but I am certainly a fan of the game too.
I just don't understand grown men running into each other over a ball.
Well, it is a bit more complex than that! Maybe you should give it another chance.
