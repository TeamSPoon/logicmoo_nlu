Do you listen to Soundgarden much?
I do! I've mostly only heard Black Hole Sun.
Yeah that's their biggest song.
I do like it a lot though!
Yeah it's a great song.
What is your favorite.
Personally I'll always love Spoonman.
I think I've heard that one before.
Yeah it's great. Very heavy and grunge sounding.
Didn't the lead singer recently pass?
Yeah Chris Cornell. Really sad.
I can't believe that. How tragic.
Yeah I guess he felt he had no way out.
If only he knew how many lives he changed.
He really was an inspiration.
Did he do any other work?
Yeah he was the singer for AudioSlave.
Wow I didn't know that!
Yeah he really was an awesome musician.
Yeah I'm going to miss him.
