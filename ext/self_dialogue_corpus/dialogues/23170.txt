Did you see the movie SIng?
Sure did, I took my grandkids to it.
How did they like it?
They loved it and so did I.
It was really cute.
I loved when Rosita and Gunther did Shake it Off.
I thought that Johnny doing Im still standing by Elton John was really good too.
All the songs were good.
They came out with the soundtrack to that movie as well.
Do you happen to have the dvd?
I do, I bought it for my grandkids.
I would love to borrow it.
That would be fine.
Did you know that Sing was the 7th most profitable movie of 2016?
No I did not know that.
Yes and Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon were the two main characters voices.
Yes they did a great job.
Yea, the storyline was cute and the music was really good.
I love kid movies.
Me too, they even appeal to adult audiences as well.
