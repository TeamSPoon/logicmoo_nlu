Did you watch Rogue one?
Yes i watched Rogue one. the movie was awesome. The whole series seems so much better that they are making filler movies such as rogue one.
Yes i have to agree, now we know the whole story of how the rebels got the coordinates for the death star.
Yeah not bad and Felicty Jones did a great job with her role as Jyn Esro.
I have to disagree i think the best acting in rogue one was by Diego Luna who played the role of Captain Cassian. He was the real rebel he was bad ass in my opinion.
Yeah but i still like Felicity Jones but i know what you mean by when Diego Luna did a good job. Especially when he killed of his own informant to get out of trouble, thats a real rebel move.
Haha I guess, what do you think of the new Star movies movie that is coming out this December.
I am definetly excited but i do not like the name.
Really you dont like the name The Last Jedi?
Yeah i feel like they are changing up the story too much. I also didnt like the fact that they killed off Han Solo in Force Awakens.
