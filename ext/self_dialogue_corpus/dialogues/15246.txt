Hey, did you hear Taylor Swift's music  is back on Spotify?
No, I haven't. When did that happen?
Just in the past week or two I think.
Oh, interesting. What do you think about her track "Blank Space"?
I really like the song, but some people prefer her old music.
I personally agree with you, country music is fine but I prefer her new style. What do you think of Katy Perry?
I'm not a big fan. I prefer bands, such as Cold War Kids.
I've never heard of them, what genre are they?
I would say the are Indie/Alternative.
Similar to The Young Giants?
Yes, I would say so to an to an extent.
When did they last release an album?
Their most recent album was L.A. Divine.
What's your favorite song by them?
I really like Hang Me Up to Dry. I think First is really popular too.
I might've heard First before, actually.
Yeah it was really popular when it came out.
Have you seen them in concert?
Not yet, but I would like to. They opened for Modest Mouse before.
Wow! I love Modest Mouse.
