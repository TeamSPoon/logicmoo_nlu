Have you seen the two new Star Wars movies?
Yes, I saw "The Force Awakens and Rogue One"
What did you think about them?
I thought they were great.  They finally got back to basics.
Yes, they were both better than the 3 prequels
I am excited about Luke Skywalker coming back.
Me to,  I hated we didn't see more of him in the first one.
I know, I am ready to see him kick some ass.
I just think it's weird that he just decided to tell all his friends "good luck" and disappeared.
Hopefully they were do a good job explaining that in the next one.
