What's your favorite movie?
Tough call!
What do you mean?
There's so many options! Throw me a more specific question.
Ok. Let me think of one!
Like if you were to ask me my favorite movie soudntrack, that'd be easier!
Ok then! What's your favorite movie soundtrack.
Definitely Crash.
It's been a while since I've seen that movie. What's the soundtrack like?
It's all this super ethereal instrumental music.
Sounds like sleepy music!
It is!
Why do you like it so much?
I actually like to fall asleep to music, it helps me relax.
Do you ever fall asleep to that soundtrack?
In fact I do! It's on my playlist of sleepytime music.
That's a good idea.
Do you have a hard time falling asleep?
Sometimes yeah.
Sometimes all it takes is a relaxing movie soundtrack!
