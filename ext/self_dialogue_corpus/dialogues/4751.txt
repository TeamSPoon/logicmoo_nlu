What did you think of last night's Yankees Royals game?
I wasn't expecting the Royals pitcher to be so good.
Yeah, it was the pitcher on Wednesday who was supposed to be a problem for the Yankees.
And they really beat up on him.
The baby bombers are becoming the Bronx bashers!
One of those radio guys is calling them the Bash Brothers.
Too bad they couldn't score last night.
After the game Girardi said they were having trouble seeing the ball well. Duh!
Poor Montgomery. I guess it's tough when you're just starting out.
I think he's a decent pitcher. He has some wins, just has to get used to the pressure of the big league.
You know, speaking of pitchers, Sabathia was pretty impressive the other night.
He was awesome!
You never know with him.
Hard to make the transition from high speed thrower to finesse pitching.
I wonder if Petite has been giving him some lessons.
He's dealing with a lot, getting over his alcoholism, learning a different way to pitch. And just getting older.
I guess. Still making the big bucks though.
For sure. This is his last season with the Yankees. Hope he invested his money wisely.
Yeah. Say, who's pitching for the Yankees against Tampa tonight?
I don't know. Tanaka maybe.
