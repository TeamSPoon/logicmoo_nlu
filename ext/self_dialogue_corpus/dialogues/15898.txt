Who do you like that is kind of like Billy Joel?
What do you mean?    Why not just listen to him?
Well, Billy Joel has not released anything new in a number of years.
Wait, isn't he still touring and selling out Madison Square Garden?
Yes, Billy Joel is playing concerts, but has not released anything new in twenty years or more.
That is a long time.     I guess you are asking about piano-based pop?
Yes, that is one direction I would be interested in.
Well, there is always Elton John.
Yes, he is a great piano player, and I know much of his albums through Duets and that Disney soundtrack.
OK.      He has released two or three new discs in the last few years that are pretty good.
Great, I will check them out.      Who else?
Well, there is always Leon Russell, who was kind of a hero to both of them.
I know a little of his work.     He's that old white-haired guy with the long beard?
That is the one.     He was quite popular in the late sixties.
I didn't know that.     Where can I see him.
Well, he played with George Harrison and Bob Dylan in that tribute concert.
Which Tribute?     That was well before Live Aid, right?
Yes, something like 1972.      You cannot miss him.
I will check it out!    Do you remember the name?
I think it was The Concert for Bangladesh.     The picture is of a starving Indian or African kid.     Quite sad.
