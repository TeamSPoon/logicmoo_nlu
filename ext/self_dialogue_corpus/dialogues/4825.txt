Why are aluminum bats allowed in the MLB?
It's just a regulation.
But it's a stupid regulation.
It's a tradition. Besides, wooden bats make so much better sound when it hits the ball. not like aluminum bat which that high pitched metallic sound
So amateurs are allowed to use aluminum?
Yes. Amateurs at collegiate and below can use either wooden or aluminum bats. Except in high school there is one more rule
Like what?
Hollowed out metal alloy bats can return the ball at a higher speed given the same power.
And...?
They have a way to quantify that property of a hollow bat. It's called BBCOR
BB what?
BBCOR. Batted ball coefficient of restitution.
That can't be real
oh, it's real alright. There's even a formula Mathematician came up with in order to characterize the bats.
Well, what the hell is the point of that?
The point is that the wood, when it hit the ball, deforms, absorbign some of its energy, which decreases the speed at which the ball will be returned out
And the BBCOR bats don't?
Not that they don't, but it give them the way to control how fast the ball get returned after it's hit by the bat. hollow bats return the ball faster given the same power
Oh, I see, so it's a safety thing
yes,. By giving kids the aluminum bats, they can swing it, but still protect the pitchers and the infield because the speed at which the ball returns is limited by the bat.
