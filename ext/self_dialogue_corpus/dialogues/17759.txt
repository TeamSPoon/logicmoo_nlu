Do you think kids today like music from the seventies and eighties?
I know my kids do.
Really, that is great.
Well they grew up in the eighties so they listened to a lot of it.
That was when MTV started.
Yea remember that Is it still on?
I am not sure.
I remember them watching Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, The New Kids on the Block
Yea and Aerosmith.
And others too.
Remember the band Hanson with that MmmBop song?
I do, that was a really catchy tune.
It was and they are all grown up now.
I saw that they were going out on tour again this year.
Really?
That was the only hit I remember them having though.
Yea , one hit wonders.
Well I wish them good luck.
They probably have a lot of new songs now.
I hope so.
