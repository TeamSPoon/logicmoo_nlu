Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
You mean Rogue One? Yes, it was awesome.
You liked it? I thought it was confusing.
I loved it. It was probably my favorite in the series.
It was not really part of the series though...
I understand that, but it did explain so much that was left out of the first  "Star Wars".
Like What? Why is it your favorite?
I always felt like the original movie from 1977, started out in the middle of a already playing story. I love how it tells the story of the orign of the death star plans.
I always felt like "Episode One" revealed enough of the story.
It did explain a lot, but I feel like "Rogue One" really went deeper. I felt a real connection with Jyn and Galen Erso.
I did not feel like their story needed to be told.
To each their own opinion, I guess. Which one is your favorite?
My favorite is the "Return of the Jedi".
Why? That one is so old!
It has been my favorite since I saw it in the theater back in 1983. I love the ewoks!
Ewoks are adorable.
Do you think the next one will be good?
Do you mean "The last Jedi"?
Yes. I think the plot sounds very interesting.
I am excited to see if Rey is a Kenobi! We will have to wait until Christmas to find out.
