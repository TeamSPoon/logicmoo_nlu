Have you heard of the musical group, Gojira?
No. What kind of music is it?
They are a relatively new metal band.
What type of metal?
You could say they are somewhat progressive and possibly post-metal. They have a unique sound.
Who are they similar too?
I would say they are somewhat similar to Meshuggah and Mudvayne.
They're like Meshuggah? Are they "djent" sounding?
No I wouldn't put them in that category.
It sounds like they might be good. Why are they called Gojira?
Gojira is the original japanese name for Godzilla. Their music talks about saving the earth and Godzilla (or Gojira) was a force to protect the Earth.
That's kind of cool. Are they a good band?
I think they are one of the best sounding bands, although they don't get to technical with virtuoso riffs and such. The lead singer has a very powerful voice for metal.
Are they an American group or foreign?
They are actually from France. You would never know that just from listening to them, though.
A French metal band? That's interesting.
I think metal has become pretty big in France as of late, although I don't now of any other really good French bands personally.
I don't either. Which album do you think I should listen to?
I would probably start off with "The Way of All Flesh."
That sounds pretty intense. I'll have to check it out.
