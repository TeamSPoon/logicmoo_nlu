Hey have you ever seen any French movies?
No, but I heard my friends mention a good French movie?
Oh really, do you remember what it was called?
Yes, I think they said it was called Amelie.
Oh, that's a great film, I've seen that, you really should watch it!
What's it about?
It's about a French lady living in Paris and she tries to improve peoples lives.
That sounds really cool!
It really is.
Who is the director?
I'm not really sure, but it's shot in a very beautiful way.
So it's an arthouse movie?
I suppose you could say that but it has a sensible plot and stuff.
Oh that's good, I hate movies where it is really difficult to follow what's happening.
Yeah, they are a bit silly. I think Amelie is playing at the cinema this weekend.
Oh right, do you want to go together?
Sounds like a good plan to me, I could watch it again.
Great, I look forward to seeing the movie.
Me too, see you on Saturday.
Yeah, see you then!
