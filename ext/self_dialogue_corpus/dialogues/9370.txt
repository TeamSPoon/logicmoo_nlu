What rap artist have you been listening to lately?
Azealia Banks.
Oh really? I haven't heard much of her music.
It is amazing. It is rap but it has elements of house and garage.
Sounds interesting. What songs should I listen to?
1991, and the big beat.
I will definitely take a listen.
Liquorice is very good too for her song.
She should be on the radio more often.
I agree.
