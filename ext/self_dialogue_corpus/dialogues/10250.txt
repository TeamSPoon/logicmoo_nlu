One of my favorite movies is Snakes on a Plane.
With Samuel Jackson, right?
Yes.
I saw that a while ago.
He just has so many great lines in that.
He does. But he's good in every movie he's in.
Amazing how an entire movie can take place in a plane.
Yeah, and it kept you interested too.
It sure did. So much going on all the time.
That is high on my list too.
