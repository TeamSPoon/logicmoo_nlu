Hey, have you ever seen the movie Susicide Squad?
No, I haven't. Could you fill me in?
Well, Suicide Squad is set in the DC comics universe.
Oh, Batman and SUperman and such?
Yes, but this is after the death of Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Okay, so what's going on?
With SUperman gone, Amanda Waller, a US offical of questionable moral fiber puts forth her Taskforce X program.
What's Taskforce X?
Taskforce X, aka The Suicide Squad, is program to use incarerated supervillians as an expendable superpowered commando team.
Supervillians, how do they hope to keep them under control?
The candiates are implated with a nanoscale explosive device in their necks powerful enough to destroy their heads.
Yikes! and ouch!, who'd they pick for the Squad.
Well, first is Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot, a assassin with superhuman aim and skill with firearms.
Okay, who else is in the squad.
Well, Joker's girlfriend Harley Quinn is one, as well as Waylon Jones, aka Killer Croc.
Killer Croc, isn't that the guy that is half crocodile and lives in the sewers of Gotham City?
Yes, but Batman drove him out and he was caught by the government.
Okay, anybody else interesting in the group?
Yes, Chato Santana, aka El Diablo, a one-time LA gang member who was pyrokinetic abilites, which means he can generate and control fire.
Okay, this sounds like it might be interesting, I'll watch it and tell you what I think of it.
