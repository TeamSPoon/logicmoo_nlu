I saw a cute article about Kelly Clarkson the other day.
She seems like such a sweetheart.
She was helping other sweetheart,.literally. She helped a fan who wanted to propose to his boyfriend in front of her.
Oh my gosh, how sweet. Did the boyfriend say yes?
Yes, they posted pictures of their riings together on Instagram.
That was really nice of her to help make that special moment so special.
When they mentioned they'd been dating for four years, she said it was about time.
Where was Kelly at that they met her?
It was at her concert at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
I didn't know she was on tour right now.
She's going to be appearing in Chicago at Soldier Field on July first. She's doing another good deed.
What's she doing this time?
She's appearing in concert with Blake Shelton. It's the kick off start of the 2017 Warrior Games for wounded warriors.
Aw, that is really sweet. I love seeing people do things to help support wounded military soldiers. They need all the help they can get.
Kelly said it would be an honor to perform for these heroes and their families at the opening concert ceremony.
It is nice for the soldiers to see famous people pay tribute to them.
Kelly said it was amazing to be able to help shine a light on these heroes, and there should be more moments like this.
There really should be more done for veterans. I'm glad Kelly and Blake are singing for them to help start off the games.
I think Blake and Kelly are both such strong singers, it should be a really inspiring, stirring concert.
Music can be very inspiring, and a concert like this will be very uplifting for everyone.
