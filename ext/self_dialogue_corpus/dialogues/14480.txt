How bad do the Spurs miss Leonard?
Its terrible what he meant to the team.
Cant someone else step up?
You would think so, right?
I thought Pop was a better coach then this.
You couldnt put this on him.
They are getting destroyed by Golden State though
The problem is they are getting no secondary scoring
So the bench is outpacing the Spurs?
Even Warriors best bench players are outperforming much of San Antonio's lineup.
Think they miss Duncan?
No, hes too old anyway
How about Parker
He was a great facilitator but I think his time is up too
Wow could this be the end for the team?
No Pop runs a well oiled machine.
But Golden State could survive without Durant or Green or Curry
I am not sure thats the case
So Curry means that much to a team that already has studs everywhere?
Yeah pretty much thats what I am saying
