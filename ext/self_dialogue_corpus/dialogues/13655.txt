Do you know some of the influences George Lucas had when he wrote and directed Star Wars?
Well, I know that Lucas went to USC film school, right?
Yeah, he was part of that generation of directors who were first and foremost movie fans.
And got exposed to a lot of art cinema, Kurosawa, or example...
And you see that in Darth Vader and Obi-Wan's duel, and R2-D2 and C-3PO wandering around.
Yes, it was in the HIdden Fortress, that Kurosawa film, with the comic duo who wandered on and offscreen a lot.
So, how much influence do you think Flash Gordon had on Star Wars?
Well, if you watch those serials from the 1930s, you can see they pioneered the opening crawl.
And there's that scene of Luke and Leia swinging across that chasm on the Death Star.
Lucas was definitely a guy who loved movies, and you can see that in Star Wars!
