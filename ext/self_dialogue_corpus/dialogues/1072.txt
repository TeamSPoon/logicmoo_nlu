Hi are you a fan of NFL football?
Yes I am!
That is great, what is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Detroit Lions.
That is awesome.  I hear a lot of great things about Matthew Stafford.
Yes he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
What is the most impressive stat of his to you?
He was the fastest player in NFL history to reach 30,000 passing yards.
That is an incredible stat.  Are there any other stats of his that interest you?
Well he is known for his comeback victories.  In fact, he hold the record with 8 comeback wins in one season.
Wow that is very cool.  I love the excitement during comeback wins.
I agree but it is very hard being a fan and witnessing all of these close games.
I would still prefer that over a blowout.  Blowout's are boring.
I would always prefer an exciting game.  That is why I am glad that the NFL is focused more on passing now.
I get that but I also feel that the solid 4 yard runs are a classic part of a good offense.
That is true but it just not as exciting to watch.
I just love watching to NFL in general no matter what style of game it is.
My sunday's are filled with NFL football and good food.
Sounds about like me.  There is just nothing better than Sunday's during the NFL season.
Sunday's during NFL season really are the best.
