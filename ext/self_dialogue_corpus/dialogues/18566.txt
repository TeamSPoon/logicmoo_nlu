Do you like country rock.
Yes,I,called it southern rock.
Really started in the seventies.
Pretty much exploded.
Lynerd skynrd led the way.
Yes,free bird.
What song is it you wanna hear!!
Free bird!!
They rolled out some hits.
That smell,sweet home Alabama.
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Loved all,of,them.
What a shame the plane going down.
Amazing any survived.
Yes it,was.
Billy Powell passed away too.
Yes,almost ten years ago.
Everyone getting older.
Yes they are.
What a great band.
