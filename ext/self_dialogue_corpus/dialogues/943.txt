Will anyone break Peyton Manning's passing record for yardage?
Drew Brees really has a good shot at it.
I think Tom Brady could even do it.
If I had my money on it though it would be Matt Ryan
Why do you think that?
He has alot of weapons at his disposal.
So did the other guys we mentioned.
Yeah but hes young and hes playing in a time when passing is the name of the game.
Brees has literally done nothing but throw the ball in New Orleans.
Yeah and I think he will break it.
So why do you bring up Ryan
I think he will end up with even more yardage
Its interesting but I cant see Ryan throwing for 5000 yards ever.
Me neither, but he never gets hurt and has the weapons around him
I know he had a great year but Shannahan is not his coordinator anymore
Thats true but hes still an elite talent
I think they take a step back though this year
With that defense and receiving corps? No way!
The super bowl hangover is a real curse.
Oh yeah I forgot about that. You are probably on to something
