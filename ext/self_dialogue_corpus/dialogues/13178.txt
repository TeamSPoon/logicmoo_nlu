Let's talk about Star Wars. Some people are really invested in the series of movies.
I've seen a few of them, although the did get kind of boring after a bit. Very white, male fantasy focused.
Yes, giving time to women's voice in the series, might have been a nice change. I hear the newest one has a strong woman character?
Yes, that's been getting a lot of publicity. Although the demographic that fixates on Star Wars, is white, male, for sure, definitely that audience.
So much of media is saturated in with that perspective. It's hard not love some of the characters like Chewbacca, even if it is somewhat flawed.
Yes, although you wonder if it's aesthetic in appeal, more than written content.
Because Chewbacca looks like a big walking teddy bear?
Right. And the voices of R2-D2 and the droids, were very soft and kind of lovable.
Kind of going for the comic angle. Do you think the plot was too simplistic though, all that good and evil simplicity?
Maybe. Like chopping off Luke's hand, could definitely be Freudian. Emasculating, right?
