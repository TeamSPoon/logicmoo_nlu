Big fan of horror movies?
Depends, I really like the 80s slasher flicks
Which ones?
Halloween and Friday the 13th
Oh yeah, Halloween was freaky.
Yeah, still kind of spooky to watch these days
Michael Meyers was creepy
Yes, especially with that mask.
Yes, All white and brown hair. Very scary looking
Yes indeed.
