Do you think a film about Obama will ever be made?
I think eventually but maybe not for our generation.
Outside of his political views I dont think there was anything earth shattering that happened that could be made into a film.
Besides the murder of bin Laden?
That could but I dont think we know enough to actually make that a legit film.
They could dramatize it.
They could but I think people stay away from political films.
It does cause divisiveness
Maybe they turn it into a comedy?
He would never sign off on that.
Maybe if he got a role in it he would do it.
No way, lets just say a film about him is probably on the books but not for a while.
I guess they would just have to make it a biopic.
Yeah probably just go through his life up until he got to the White House.
Who would produce it?
Maybe Stephen Speilberg.
You know they would not let just anyone do it.
No, it would be a huge film.
What actor would play him?
Thats a tough one because he doesnt look like anyone specific.
