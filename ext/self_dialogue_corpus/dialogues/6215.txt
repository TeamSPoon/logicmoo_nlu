Did you find Underdog funny?
The premise of it was great
Having a dog superhero was too funny
Jason Lee played that role
Yeah its hard to imagine
Wasnt Peter Dinklage in that too
Yes there were quite a few actors in it
Patrick Warburton was definitely in it
Yeah the plot was absurd so they loaded up with stars
I think Brad Garrett was the funniest out of all of them
