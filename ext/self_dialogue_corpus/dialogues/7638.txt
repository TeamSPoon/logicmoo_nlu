You know, I don't get the whole Ron and Hermione thing.
You don't like them as a couple?
I just don't think they're compatible.
Why not?
Because Hermione is an incredibly smart, academic type. Learning is her passion.
Yeah, but opposites attract, don't they?
Sometimes that's true, but I just don't see it in this case. Ron really isn't supportive of her interests unless they benefit him in some way.
Okay, I can see that.
I just would've rather seen her end up with someone else, you know? Someone a little more mature.
Now that you mention it, I did like Viktor Krum.
