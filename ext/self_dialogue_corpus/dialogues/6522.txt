What was your favorite song from Frozen?
For me, has to be Let It Go.
I knew you were going to say that.  Everybody says that.
Okay, wiseguy, what about you?
I'm a bit different.  I prefer First Time in Forever.
Nothing wrong with that song.  It was quite lovely.
I actually preferred Kristin Bell's singing over Idina Menzel.
That's some pretty heavy praise.
Just sounds more natural to me.
I disagree, but respect your opinion.
