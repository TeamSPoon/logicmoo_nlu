Do you like action films?
I love them!
What is your favorite?
Well, for new ones, I would say Logan.
The Marvel one?
Yes, it was full of action.
Was it not like any other Marvel film?
No, it was more like a cop show, lots of killing and action, but a hint of mutant.
Was it very gory?
It was rated R for good reason.
