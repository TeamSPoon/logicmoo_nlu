Have you seen that new movie that came out recently in November?
Oh, you mean Moana? Yes, I have, it's so good.
Yes, I agree. I've been singing "You.re Welcome" ever since it came out.
Me too! Dwayne Johnson was so good in that movie.
I know, he's been in a bunch of good disney movies.
Oh really? What has he been in?
Well, he was in the Game Plan with Madison Pettis.
Oh, was that him? I forgot about that movie. It's so good though.
Yes, it's one of my favorites. I really like that he switched to animated movies though.
I agree, he definitely has the voice for it.
