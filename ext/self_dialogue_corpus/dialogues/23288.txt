Do you remember the movie "Beetlejuice"?
Yes!  That was one of my favorites growing up.
It was awesome.  Have you seen it lately?
I watch it every couple of years when I think of it.
I haven't watched it in a while.  I need to find my DVD.
If you can't find it, I'm sure I can find mine somewhere.
What was your favorite part?
Gosh, it was all so good!
I know.  The dinner scene was awesome though, right?
Of course.  Who can hear the Banana Boat song without thinking of that scene?
Exactly!  I liked the miniature town in the attic too.
Yeah, that was cool.  As a kid, I always wanted one of those.
Did the guy's character make that, or was it in the house when they bought it?
I don't remember.  I think it was already there though.
Did you hear they were making a sequel or something?
I've heard that, but I don't know how much of it is true.
I wish they would.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Well, the movie is great.  I wouldn't want a sequel to ruin it.
