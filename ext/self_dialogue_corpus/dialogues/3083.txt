Have you ever wanted to play in the NFL?
No, but some people I know have.
Who?
There was a guy in my high school that did.
Who else?
A teacher at my high school did. Also a guy I work with did.
Are they not in there anymore?
No, they both got injured.
That's too bad.
Yeah, i had a couple friends who wanted to join but weren't good enough.
What happened with them?
They were big guys, but I'm not sure they practiced that much.
It would be an interesting job.
Yeah, it seems like you could get hurt easily.
It's funny how NFL players say that their job is just a game.
It is a cool job but not that important.
Entertainers make a lot of money.
And they can be famous.
it would take a toll on your body.
Yeah, you would have to push your body.
