What do you think of the new Drake album?
I like it a lot, it's on my daily playlist still.
I think I like his mixtapes over actual albums, but I think it was pretty good too.
What's your favorite Drake record?
If You're Reading This It's Too Late.
I remember when that came out, I couldn't stop listening to it.
I like it when he collaborates with other artists on songs, which usually comes on mixtapes.
Yeah, I love when I hear Lil Wayne on a track with Drake.
Or Future!
Agreed, I feel like all the best Drake songs have features on them.
