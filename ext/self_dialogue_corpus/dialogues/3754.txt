Do you remember that movie "The Usual Suspects" from 1995?
Good grief, was it back in 1995? Yeah, that was such a good movie.
The cast on that movie was so good. How many were there?
Five I think. You know Kevin Spacey was such the standout performance. Acting 2 roles.
I know. It was such a twist. I never expected it.
Me either. It was an awesome surprise. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I thought the way the plot unfolded was brilliant. The perspective was creative.
I know. I couldn't get over how good it was. I like movies that are not so obvious and make you think.
Having the start in the police station and the story Verbal Kent telling his story....
Yeah, that was genius. I loved it to the end.
