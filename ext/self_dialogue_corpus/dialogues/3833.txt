What thriller movie stands out the most to you?
Se7en
Oh man, I totally forgot about that one.
Yeah, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman at their peak.
Yeah, that was one freaky movie as well.
Kevin Spacey as the killer was quite the twist at the end as well.
Yeah, he tricked Brad Pitt to committing the final sin.
Wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow his wife?
Yes, and she loses her head in the end
That's kind of a bad pun/joke
