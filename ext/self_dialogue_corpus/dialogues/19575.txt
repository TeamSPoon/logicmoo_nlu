What is that noise?
What noise?
The thing coming out of your speakers?
Oh that? Its just electro swing.
Its incredible! I have never heard anything like it.
Im not surprised. Its pretty new.
That was a pretty hipster thing to say.
I pride myself on my obscure genre knowledge, thank you.
Who even makes this stuff?
Who makes any music these days? Nerds.
People with computers?
Probably.
Where can I hear more of this stuff?
Just google it.
Oh come now, more specific please.
I can't let their secrets out.
Really?
I am very protective.
Wait, did you make this music?
I plead the fifth.
