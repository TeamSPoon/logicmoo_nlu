Did you ever watch the Excorcist movies?
Like the Excorcism of Emily Rose?
No, just The Excorcist.  The original.
No, I actually never watched it.  Was it good?
That was one of the scariest movies I had ever seen.  And I hadn't seen it for the first time until the nineties.
Who was in it again?
It was Linda Blair.
Wait, that's the one with the girl in the bed, right?
Yeah, she's possessed by the demon.
It's a really popular scene.  I've just never seen it.
