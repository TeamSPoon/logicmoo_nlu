So, are you getting excited for the new season?
Well, kinda. I'm not too sure about how the Seahawks are going to do though.
Oh, are the Seahawks your favorite team?
Yeah. I always watched them growing up.
Well, why are you worried about how they're going to do?
Their draft class looks kind of weak, and Russel Wilson isn't getting any younger.
Yeah, he really got banged up last year.
I know. He's the most mobile quarterback in the league so of course they turned him into a pocket passer.
Why did they do that? He was in good shape before he got hurt, wasn't he?
Yeah, he was doing great in the preseason, but for some reason they decided he'd stand behind his awful line and wait to get tackled.
Oh man, don't even bring up the Seattle offensive line. They were just awful.
Well, what do you expect, the lowest paid line in the league, for a good reason.
Well, did they at least draft anybody to shore up the line for next season?
Ethan Pocic is supposed to be a good offensive lineman, but I don't know, I don't watch college ball.
Well, I read an interview where the Seahawks were really eager to get Pocic, maybe he's good.
I sure hope so, otherwise it's going to be sack city again.
It doesn't have to be, if they just let Russel Wilson move with the ball.
Yeah, he's definitely still the most mobile QB in the league, but he's too short to just stand in the pocket.
Well, I hope they do well, I always liked the Seahawks too.
Me too. Maybe we should see if we can get some tickets and see a home game?
