So what do you think of the QB the Bears drafted?
Well, they gave up a lot to trade up to the 2nd draft position to get him.
True. He better be great, or that was a mistake.
A great QB really makes all the difference in your team's chances though.
So true. You've got to roll the dice and hope you get lucky.
Yeah I believe QB is the hardest position to scout. More busts there than any position.
Still, this guy has quite an arm.
He'll need it at Soldier Field in the winter time. The wind there can be awful to throw against.
I heard a lot about his accuracy. I really hope it's true.
No kidding. Cutler had a great arm, but he wasn't accurate, and it killed them.
It killed me watching it!
Yeah, you see short throws from the best QBs  that are in the perfect position leading the receiver go for huge plays all the time.
Most of them are so fast that if you don't make them stop or lunge just to catch it, they can gobble up huge chunks of real estate in a flash.
God, I'd give anything to see that on a regular basis here.
That's the dream!
So we'll see how he turns out. Hope springs eternal!
Yeah, he's got some definite pluses.
But lots of college experience isn't one of them.
Yep, that's the risk. The claim they don't expect him to play much this year as he learns.
That's the plan. But they're just one big hit on the veteran starter Glennon away from having a whole new plan. It's be trial by fire.
