I just saw John Wick Chapter 2
Nice.  How was it?
It was awesome.  Its just a shoot-em-up movie, but its badass.
Cool.  Lots of action then?
Tons.  You've seen the first one, right?
Yea.  That was awesome too.  Keeanu was great.
Yea, its pretty much the same formula, but its works so well.
So lots of guns, shooting, action and fights.
Exactly.  And theres another dog!
Oh cool.  I like that part of the first movie.  It added a little bit of reason behind the movie.
Yep.  Part 2 continues the story.  Its literally right after the ending of the first one.
Sweet.  So its a continuation.  And I saw Laurence Fishburn in the trailer.  Was that a cool on screen moment?
I dont want to ruin it for you, but it was.  A lot of the people in the audience cheered out.
Keanu looks badass in it.  He does these roles so well.
Yea.  He literally does like 99% of all the stunts.
Yea, I saw the YouTube clips of him in the shooting range training and all the other stuff.
He's really an under rated actor.  More so because of the roles that he is sort of limited to, he does it great.
Yea.  I love him in the Matrix and the first John Wick.  His like an undercover action star
And to think, it all started with Bill and Ted.
I LOVE BILL AND TED!
