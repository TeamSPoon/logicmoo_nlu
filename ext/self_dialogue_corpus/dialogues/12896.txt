I think rogue one was sort of cookie cutter
How was it cookie cutter
It kinda felt filler
Filler?
Like it is not important
But in the grand scheme of things it is
But how is that possible
Well they were the whole reason the death star was brought down
I still believe without those events things would have went well
Nah not at all
