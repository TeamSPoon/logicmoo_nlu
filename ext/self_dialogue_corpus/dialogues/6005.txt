Have you or your kids seen the Disney movie Finding Nemo?
Sure we have. Me and the kids watch it all the time.
It's a classic in our house. We love to watch all our favorite characters.
We do, too. Did you know that Ellen Degeneres was the voice of Dory?
Yes, I knew that. She did a great job didn't she. Dory was a great character.
You know who was my favorite character? It was Crush the sea turtle.
I know, right? He had like a cool surfer dude personality. I loved it.
So did I. All the animation in the film was really neat. Especially when they showed the schools of fish.
I think I'm going to buy the kids the sequel, Finding Dory. I'm sure they will love it.
Yeah, I think it will probably do as well as the original Finding Nemo did.
