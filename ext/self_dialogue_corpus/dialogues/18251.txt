What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I'm always concerned when a musician is known as much for their clothes as their music.
Seriously? Did you say the same about Kraftwerk or Daft Punk?
No...but their music at least made you think!
So does Lady Gaga's. I think you're just being a generational snob.
Maybe. She's been compared to Madonna a lot hasn't she?
She has. I think it's got more to do with the constantly changing image than anything else.
See that's exactly my point proved for me!
What do you mean?
She's known for her clothes more than her music.
OK, let's try another. What do you think of Rihanna?
Now you're talking about a proper star.
In what way is she more of a star?
She's just got that X-Factor hasn't she?
You're talking nonsense. Gaga has mystery about her, Rihanna has none.
Maybe, but Rihanna is always herself so after a while the image is secondary, because it never changes, so you stop noticing.
How do you mean?
Gaga disguises herself, dresses up in meat-suits and worse. It was a real surprise to see her face for the first time...she aims to shock and image always comes first, not music.
You can't accept music and image can go hand in hand can you?
I don't think we're ever going to agree!
