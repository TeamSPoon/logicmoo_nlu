You ready for football season?
Hell yeah. Raiders are going to win it all this year!
Why do you think that?
They would have won it all last year if not for Carr's injury.
Still would have been tough to get by the Patriots.
True, but we also upgraded in the off-season, especially at RB.
Yeah, I'm excited to see Beast Mode back in action.
The entire NFL has to worry about the Raiders.
Still, I like the Patriots over them.
We'll see what happens in the playoffs.
The Cowboys will be tough too.
Let's see if Prescott is the real deal.
I think he proved he is last season and so did Elliott.
I'm still not a believer.
I also think Carolina can return to Super Bowl contenders this season.
It all falls on Newton's shoulders.
Yeah, he just didn't have it last year for some reason.
I think he'll bounce back this season.
Any team that you think will be a big surprise?
I think the Titans and Bucs could be playoff teams this season.
