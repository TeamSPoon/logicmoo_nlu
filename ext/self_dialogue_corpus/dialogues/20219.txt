I saw your post that you went to go see It Comes at Night yesterday.
Yes, me and my fiances went to see it.
What did you think?
I really liked it
I've heard really conflicting reviews though.
Well, both my fiance and I had different opinions, even though we like the same kinds of movies.
What did you disagree about?
I liked the tension and suspense, and thought it was well thought out!
What did he think?
He thought it was too much of a slow burn movie, and not enough happened to justify the run time.
I heard it was kind of in the style of The Witch.
I haven't read that, but I guess that would be a good description.
So, what comes at night?
I don't want to spoil it for you.....
No, I feel like I need to know now! It will help me make my decision whether I watch it or not!
Well, since you asked......
Tell me! Please!
Ok, well, nothing comes at night. It's more of a suspenseful drama than a horror movie, I don't know whether "It" was supposed to be allegorial or.....
What do you mean nothing comes at night? How could they do that!
Well, if that's a dealbreaker for you, DEFINITLY don't see it!
