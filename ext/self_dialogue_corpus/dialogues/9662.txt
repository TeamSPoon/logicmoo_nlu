So, what's your favorite rap or hip-hop song right now?
Probably "Congratulations" from Post Malone.
I love Post Malone, too.
He's easily my favorite new artist of the last few years.
Mine too. His voice is so smooth.
His songwriting is incredible, too.
My favorite song by him is "Too Young".
That song is so underrated. Most people would say "White Iverson".
Yeah I've heard "White Iverson" too many times to like it anymore.
I agree. Although it was a strong release for being his first big song.
