Who did you like most in Aladdin?
The genie of course.
I agree with you.
I love that movie. It is so exciting.
Yeah, the carpet, Abu, Jasmine, all are wonderful.
Did you like the story?
Yes, I thought Jafar being obsessed with getting the lamp was a great idea.
Did you think he would try to become a genie?
I had no idea. But, it was a great way to end the movie.
I agree. Aladdin was a great story.
