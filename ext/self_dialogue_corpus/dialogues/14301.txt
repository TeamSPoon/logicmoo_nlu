Did you see the Boston, Cleveland game tonight?
Who've thought Boston had pep left without Thomas?
Yeah, I thought they were done.
Baker came out of nowhere tonight.
They all played well.
They did but Lebron had an off night.
Yeah and the Cavs were still witihin striking distance.
That doesn't bode well for the Celts.
Yea. You think the Warriors are gonna sweep?
I think so, no Kawahi no Spurs.
Yeah, he's a monster.
Took a while to get him going though.
You think Zha Zha did it on purpose?
I dunno, I've played defense like that and never got under anyone.
True, everyone is saying he's a big man but that big man could've taken a step in any direction.
Yeah, that really turned the tide of the whole game and series.
The playoffs have been pretty boing other than that though huh?
Yep, two horse race.
I guess we'll get to probably see Cavs versus Warriors part 3.
Should be pretty darn exciting.
