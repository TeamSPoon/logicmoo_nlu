where do you usually get your music albums? i need  Nelly's new album
the 'LIT"   music shop at 5th avenue,though i'm not certain if Nelly's album is in stock.
oh that's too far,i can't find it in any near by music  shop.
why this sudden urge for the album lol?
i heard one song off the album and i really loved the song,also seen some reviews about the album and its been positive ones.
hmm i see,i haven't heard any recent work from Nelly of late talk less of  an album.
you should listen to "dream" mate, the song is so cool.
coming from you i would have to check it out, i know you have a good ear for music.
the lyrics of the song seems he was relating it to Ashanti.
oh really? i thought they've finally broke up.
yes they have, but you could sense from the song he was referring to her, even the video vixen used looks so much like her.
so was he being insulting?
on the contrary no, its a story of someone who feels regrets for his actions.
hmm well i feel he should rather get that behind him and focus more on putting his career back on track.
come on, nelly is still relevant in the music industry, he's already a brand.
let's face the fact, when last did Nelly drop a hit song that made it to top 10 of the billboard chart?
you can't quantify an artist success  through some billboard ratings.
yes i know but it is an almost perfect reflection of who's hot and not, so if Nelly can't even make top 50 it tells a whole lot about his relevance.
well lets see with "dream" so far reviews are positive and might make top 10 on billboard,cos the song really sound great.
well lets hope so, i am still a fan,he just have to make some good music like he used to before,like the "ride with me" days lol.
