I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Chris Cornell.
I still can't believe it. I grew up with Soundgarden as my favorite band.
Soundgarden was kind of lost during that 90's grunge area. I think they fall right in line with Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chain.
To me, they're even better than Pearl Jam and Nirvana, if I have to be honest with you.
You have to admit it was basically Chris who made that band.
Black Hole Sun is such a deep song.
That's the favorite off the Superunknown album, but I think there's a couple other tracks that were better.
Really? What were your favorite tracks off that album?
I like Black Hole Sun a lot but my favorite was Fell On Black Days. I think I related more to that song.
Oh, I liked Fell On Black Days too.
I actually was a bigger fan of Chris when he formed Audioslave.
Audioslave is a band where, when someone mentions them I know they know their music.
I know right? They had three fantastic albums. The self titled Audioslave album was my favorite of the three.
That was my favorite too. Cochise, Like a Stone, and I Am the Highway are my favorites song by Chris of all time. Right up there with Black Hole Sun.
I Am the Highway always makes me choke up because like Fell On Black Days, I could really relate to it.
Did you know Chris planned a reunion with Audioslave before his unfortunate passing?
I did know that. I was so disappointed and saddened to hear that.
You know though, his music lives on. Did you get his solo album?
I have that album, it's really good too. He opened up for Linkin Park during their Projekt Revolution tour. I caught a show, it was so good.
You are lucky. I never got to see him live! I have to just live his wonderful music through the live concert DVD's.
