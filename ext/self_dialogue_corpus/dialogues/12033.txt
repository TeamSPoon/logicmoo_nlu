What is better an X-Wing, Y-Wing or the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars movies?
How could you even ask this? Of course it's the Millennium Falcon.
Sorry, I was just curious. I also like the Millennium falcon.
It's okay! Yes, the Millennium Falcon is basically the main ship of the movies.
I'm surprised how big it is from the outside since they only really showed two areas.
Yeah I think the rest of ship is only for cargo stuff.
I wish we could of seen the rest of the ship.
That would of been awesome!
I hope there are more closeups of the cockpit in the future.
Yeah a view from the back would be good!
