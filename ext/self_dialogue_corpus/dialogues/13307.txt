I think A New Hope might not be quite as good as Empire, but it's top three and definite more important.
Agreed all the way.  Star Wars changed the way we see movies forever.
A New Hope also had the second best story line, maybe Rougue One could give it a run for it's money.  But it's a long shot.
Yes, Especially when you look to old copies when Han shot first.
Totally important.  It changes the character a little.   Now he has a little more goodness he didn't have and his turn around isn't has exciting.
Han has always been one of my favorites.
Him and Chewy, the ultimate bromance.  I love those guys.
I know, I was sad when he died.  But when I heard Chewy cry it almost made me cry.  They've been together so long.
I wonder what will happen to Chewy now?  He's one of those long time characters that just means so much.
I'm looking forward to seeing how they met in the Han Solo movie.
