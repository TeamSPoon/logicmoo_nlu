I just rewatched all the old Star Wars movies this weekend.
It's been a while since I've seen those, what'd you think.
It's funny how obvious the new digital effects are.
You mean having a random Bantha in full digital randomly roaming outside the cantina on Tattooine wasn't normally there?
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  Some of it was pretty cool though.
Like what?
The part with Han talking to Jaba before he take Luke and Obi Wan away from Tattooine.
Yea that part was really cool, but remember, Han shot first.
Yea, I hate that they changed the confrontation scene in the Cantina.   I hate that Lucas changed it to make it a self-defense thing.
Yea, Han was supposed to be a marauder type.  Making him not shoot first was a bad idea.
