Hey, did you ever listen to Vanilla Ice?
Oh my gosh, yes!  Of course.
He was one of my favorite rappers when I was a kid.  I actually read his autobiography.
That's funny.  His name was Robby Van Winkle, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was his real name.  He was from Texas and Florida.
So his first album To the Extreme came out in 1989, right?  Isn't that the one with Ice Ice Baby?
That would be the one!  It's hard to believe it was so long ago.
Yes, true.  Believe it or not, Ice Ice Baby was the first hip hop single to reach the top of the Billboard hits.
Whoah, are you serious? That is hard to believe!
Yeah.  He actually released an album in 2011.
Oh he's still around?  What was the album?
It's called WTF - Wisdom, Tenacity, and Focus.
I never even heard of that.
Yeah, he signed with Psychopathic Records.  He's apparently still around.
He actually did a reality show on DIY network, I remember hearing.
Yeah, it's called the Vanilla Ice Project.  He was also on Dancing with the Stars.
That's crazy.  Well his latest endeavor is working with Insane Clown Posse.
That's just hard to imagine.  They sound so different than he did in his early work.
Yeah, he's definitely changed a lot since Ice Ice Baby.
Yeah, totally different style now I'd say.
