I liked Fast Five, but miss the focus on street racing.
Me too, but I can forgive it for that film, it was so good and funny even.
I think it was the one in the series that made the most money.
I think you are right.
I wonder if you asked the actors if it would be their favorite.
I think Vin Diesel has stated that it is, but I'm not sure, I'd have to look it up.
What an insanely fun set of movies to work on, I bet it would be a hard choice for any of the actors to pick a favorite.
I think it would be more fun to be a stunt driver on those films!
True, I wonder if any of the stunt drivers have been hurt.
I bet insurance would take good care of them if they were.
