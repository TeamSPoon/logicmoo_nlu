Who is your favorite female singer?
I think that would be Amy Lee. You heard of her, right?
Yes of course. The lead singer of Evanescence.
I absolutely adore her voice. It's so beautiful and haunting.
I haven't heard anything about her in a while though. Did she take a break from making music?
She did have a break, as she became a mother and had to focus on that for a bit. But she's actually just released a new song recently.
What's the song called?
It's called Love Exists. It's a bit different than her other material, but still very beautiful.
I'll have to search for it and give it a listen.
It's actually an English cover of Francesca Michielin's song called "L'amore esiste".
Who is Francesca Michielin?
She's an Italian singer-songwriter. She won the fifth series of the Italian talent show X Factor.
Interesting. Amy Lee usually writes her own songs.
That's true, but she heard the song while working on a project in Italy and loved it.
Yeah sounds like the song was quite special if she wanted to make it her own.
Evanescence is actually working on a new album as well.
Sounds great. When is it expected to be released?
This fall. It's called Synthesis and it will feature some of the new tracks combined with some of the older ones.
Ah, so basically a synergy of the present and the past.
Yeah, that's basically the idea behind it. Should be interesting to hear it once it's released.
