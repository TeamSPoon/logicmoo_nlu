How do you think the Panthers will do this year?
It's harder to tell after a losing season than a winning season.
What do you mean?
They have never had back-to-back winning seasons, so it's safe to assume they will have a losing season after a winning season.
What about after a losing season?
More times than not, it's a losing season, but they they have had winning seasons after a losing season.
What was their problem last year?
It seemed like 99% of the time, a defender was in Cam Newton's face before he got to the end of his drop back.
Do you think they did enough to fix the offensive line?
Probably not.  It also didn't help that the receivers dropped passes all the time.
What do you think of Christian McCaffrey?
Hopefully he pans out they way everyone expects him too, but I feel he is being over-hyped.
Has Netwon started throwing since his surgery?
Yeah.  I hate how the media made a big deal about when he got his surgery.
I know what you mean.  Andrew Luck got surgery and still isn't thowing, but the media doesn't seem to care.
I'm not sure, but the Panthers may be the only team in NFL history to never have back-to-back winning seasons, but make the playoffs for three straight years.
Really?
A few years ago they went 12-4 and made the playoffs. The year after that they made the playoffs with a losing record because the NFC South was so bad.
I remember that.
The year after that, they went 15-1 and made the Super Bowl.
