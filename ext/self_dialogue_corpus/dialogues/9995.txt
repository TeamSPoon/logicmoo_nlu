Have you ever seen The Departed?
I don't think so, who is in it?
Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jack Nicholson.
No, I don't think so.  Is it any good?
It's a great action movie.  If you like those types of movies, definitely check it out.
What's it about?
Well, I don't want to spoil the plot but it's a complicated story of two men undercover, one in the police and the other in the mob.
Oh, sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's a complicated story but it does it just right and keeps you very entertained.  I highly recommend it.
I'll check it out, thanks!
