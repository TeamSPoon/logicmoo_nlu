I'm listening to my favorite song right now.
Oh really, What is it?
No Rain by Blind Melon.
Oh I have never heard of them.
Its a grunge rock bank from the 90's
I like grunge rock like Nirvana.
Yes they are similar. Just more clear vocals.
I should check it out! I need some 90's tunes on my playlist.
I'll let you borrow my CD.
CD I dont even have a CD player. Ill get it off yout playlist.
Yeah you should check out all my music. I've really been into ALT-J and Neutral Milk Hotel lately.
Oh really what songs should i look up?
Look up breeze blocks and oh comely.
What kind of music is it?
ALT-J is super intense! I like them while working out or when i need to be in my own world.
Whats Neutral Milk Hotel about?
The album airplane under the sea tells a story. Its more calm music.
Any other suggestions to download? I'm looking for some calm music.
Look up Bon Iver. So relaxing and his voice will put you in a trance. My favorite is Flume!
Thanks for all the Suggestions! I feel like you gave me a lot of good artist with different feels to them!
