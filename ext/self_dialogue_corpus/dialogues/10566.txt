Hi
Hey, what's going on man?
Not much. I was thinking of watching a movie tonight.
Oh, which one?
No Country for Old Men
Oh, I saw that one a few years back
What did you think?
I liked it, but some people that were watching it with me didn't like it
Why not?
They didn't like the ending and some of the abruptness of it
Have you read the book as well?
Yeah, it's very true to the book
Okay, I read the book to and I was curious what the movie adaptation is like
Yeah, it's really good. Cohen brothers production
Oh yeah, I like their work.
Yeah and Javier Bardem is really good in it as Antoine Chugar
Oh yeah, the big bad assassin dude, right?
That's him.
Okay let's watch it later tonight
Sounds good. later.
