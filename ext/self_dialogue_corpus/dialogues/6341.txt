I think Alice in Wonderland is probably my favourite Disney movie.
Why do you like Alice in Wonderland best?
Well, I really enjoy all of the Disney movies, but the thing I like most about them is the music, and the songs in Alice in Wonderland are really beautiful.
I think I know what you mean, they are quite simple songs, but they are very pretty.
What is your favourite song from the movie?
I think I like the song, "All In The Golden Afternoon" best of all.
I like that song best as well. I love how Alice is so tiny, and the flowers singing are giant.
I would love to be like Alice, and shrink to a tiny size, and wander among the beautiful flowers.
In the movie, after the flowers have sung their song, Alice meets the caterpillar.
The caterpillar is very cute, I like his little shoes.
