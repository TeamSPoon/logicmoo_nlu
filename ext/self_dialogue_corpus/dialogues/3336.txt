Hey dude you watch any good horror movies lately?
Yeah, I actually did, I watched a Get Out.
How was it?  I heard it was directed by a Jordan Peele.  Isn't he a mostly comedy actor and writer.  It seems a little odd he would direct a horror movie.
Yes, I thought the same thing but the movie was very well made and it works.
How so?  What makes it great.  From the trailers it looked like a very serious horror film.
The movie is more of a horror-comedy satire that deals with people's fears about race in a very smart and funny way. It's very well directed and the plot really takes you on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.
Wow that sounds interesting. I'm definitely going to check it out.
Yeah you should.  It has great performances from the pretty much everyone in the cast.
Was there anyone in the movie you liked best?
Definitely Chris' best friend Rod, he really steals the show with his comedic performance but also the great choices he makes in the movie.
