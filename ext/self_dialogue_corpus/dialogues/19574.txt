What are some good, upbeat songs?  You know, stuff that'll put you in a godo mood?
Well, let's see.. got several of those.  I think "Send Me On My Way" by Rusted Root is a decent example.
Not sure I've heard that one.
It's from the first Ice Age film, got this whole "sixties" vibe to it.  It's pretty nice though.
Alright, let me give you one of mine... "This Is How We Roll" by Florida Georgia Line.
Ahhh interesting choice.
Yeah, I know, there's some people who don't like because they say it's not "real" country, but I don't really judge songs by that.  I just think it's a lot of fun to listen to.
Yeah, that it is.  Okay, let give you another of mine.. Walk the Moon, "Shut Up and Dance"
Oh, that's is an awesome song!
I agree.  It almost always puts me in a good mood.
Although I imagine it might not if you were someone who didn't have anybody to dance with.
Well, then you just do what Elvis did.
What do you mean?
"If you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair."
Where's that from?
Jailhouse Rock.
Ahhhh... forgot about that line.
Oh, man, I am so ashamed of you right now.
I know, I know...
You're a disgrace to your family!  Haha!
