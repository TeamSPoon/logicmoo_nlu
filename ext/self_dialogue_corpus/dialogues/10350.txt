I thought it was a really great movie as well. I love the mixture of both action and humor.

I really love the main character star-lord. The character is so funny and I enjoy watching the actor play him.
Who is the actor that plays star-lord? I remember him on the movie Passengers but can't recall his name.
The actor who plays star-lord is Chris Pratt ofcourse. I hope they come out with a third Guardians of the Galaxy soon.
I hope they do as well. Next week I am going to see the new Wonder Woman movie. Would you like to go with me?
Yes I would love to see the new Wonder Woman movie with you. I love that actress Gal Gadot.
