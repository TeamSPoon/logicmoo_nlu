What do you think about the Cowboys this year?
I think Dak Prescott is under pressure for an encore.
Oh ya he definitely will.
Prescott won't be catching anyone by surprise this season.
He's going to be in charge for the first time.
And taking on much more responsibilites.
I hope he can make it through without any problems.
His teammates are urging him to be a more vocal leader.
Ya they need him to show them he want this.
They have a much harder schedule this year too.
Much better defenses he will be facing.
He won't have much room for error.
I hope he doesn't fall into the sophomore slump.
Ya that's taken out many a good quarterback.
Have you been to the new stadium yet?
Oh man that place is huge.
I haven't been able to make it out yet.
I haven't been for a football game but I went down to check it out.
I think I'm going to try and get tickets for a game this year.
Me too we should go together.
