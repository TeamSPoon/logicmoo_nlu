So are you looking forward to the new Wonder Woman movie?
I'm not really a DC fan, but after seeing the trailer I was kinda intrigued!
I know, right? It looks like it might actually be good!
Which is impressive, considering how bad Batman vs. Superman was.
I didn't think Batman v. Superman was that bad, some of the character moments were nice.
Yeah, but the problem is that word "moments." A movie should have more than a few of those.
I guess you're right. Still, I have high hopes for Wonder Woman.
I never thought I'd say that about a Wonder Woman movie, but I agree.
She certainly hasn't had much luck in film in the past.
Yeah, it won't take much for this to be the best Wonder Woman movie.
I like the humor I've seen in the trailers.
I actually laughed out loud at a couple parts, so hopefully they've gotten away from that dark and gritty feel they thought Superman had to have.
Yeah, trying to make Superman dark was just completely the wrong call.
After The Dark Knight's success, they kinda thought everything had to go that route.
Which is totally not true, let super heroes have their own personalities!
Exactly. It doesn't help either, I think, that Zach Snyder's direction is so... bleh.
What do you mean?
He's great at creating a moment, like you said, but he tries to make every shot too serious and important sometimes.
He does use slo mo a lot, I guess.
Exactly, especially in his battle scenes. Hopefully Wonder Woman won't have that as much.
