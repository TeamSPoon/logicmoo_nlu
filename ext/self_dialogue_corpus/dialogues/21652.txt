Who are some of your favorite directors?
Tarantino, for sure, Kubrick, David Fincher, Coen Brothers, Cameron Crowe.
Do you like David Lynch?
I really like Mulholland Drive, but generally, his stuff is too out there for me.  I don't need everything spelled out, but some of it is nonsense.
Yeah, Eraserhead is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, except for a bunch of others.
Haha, it's a little better than Tokyo Psycho, which I think only us two have ever heard of.  And now that I think about it, no it isn't.
I know you're a big Stallone fan-- what do you think of him as a director?
I like him-- he directed Rocky 2 through 4, and Rocky Balboa, and I really liked all those movies.
Did you know he directed the little-know sequel to Saturday Night Fever called Staying Alive?
Uh, yeah.  Look who you're talking to.  Did you know for a time, John Travolta was being considered to be Rambo's sidekick?
That would've been a much different movie.
Let me as you-- what are some of the worst movies by great directors?
Ooh, good question.  One that immediately springs to mind is Lolita, by Stanley Kubrick.
Because of the timeframe and the content, his hands were really tied.
Yeah, and it's not terrible, just kind of boring.
Any others come to mind?
I've never seen the movie, but I heard Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate was really terrible.
Haha, that movie bombed so hard that it led to studio executives taking greater control over movie productions.
And, caused United Artist to go bankrupt.
Yeah, I guess it was a pretty terrible movie.
