Have you heard Creed's last album?
I haven't. Is it any good?
It's not too bad, to be honest.
Does it sound like their old stuff at all?
It actually does. With a few differences here and there.
What are the differences?
It's a tad more pop-ish.
Eh, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
It's kind of like anything else on the radio these days.
That's true. Which I don't really like.
I saw the band last weekend and they still sounded great.
Did they sing all of their hits?
And then some.
I wish I would've went now!
You should've, man. Great concert.
I'll have to go when they come back.
They'll be back eventually. They tend to come back pretty often.
Yeah and I keep missing them haha.
I'l let you know when they come then.
Now that sounds like a plan!
