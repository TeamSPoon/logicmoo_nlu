I wish they made superhero movies based on the obscure versions
Huh i do not get you
Well their are different versions of heros
Like?
Like spiderman noir or something
I never heard of that what is it
It is spiderman but set in the 30s or so
That would be an interesting super hero film
It would be pretty awesome
Well they might do one some day you never know
