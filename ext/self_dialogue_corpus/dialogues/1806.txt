Are you ready to watch the Dolphins lose again this year.
Hey, my Dolphins are still the only team to go undefeated for an entire season and win the Super Bowl.
That was way back in 1972, they haven't even been to the Super Bowl since 1985.
They lost it in 1985 and also in 1983, but at least they made it.
I guess they were a good team back then, but they have been struggling ever since.
Dan Marino was a great quarterback, but he never got them to the Super Bowl.
I think the real reason they were undefeated back in '72 was because of Shula.
Yes, Don Shula may have been the greatest coach ever.
I think Bob Griese was the quarterback the year they were undefeated.
He was, but he broke his ankle in week 5 an was out for most of the season after that.
I didn't know that, who replaced him?
It was Earl Morrall that helped them to remain undefeated for the season.
Well hopefully Miami will one day be as great a team as they were back then.
I hope they will within the next few years.
It must be hard watching them struggle to even make the playoffs every year.
They have to get good enough to beat the Patriots, or they will never make it to a Super Bowl.
The Patriots are a hard team to beat.
I will still be rooting for the Dolphins every year, even if they can't seem to make it to the final game.
I understand team loyalty, I wish the best for you.
This is going to be the year that Miami finally makes it to the Super Bowl again, and wins it.
