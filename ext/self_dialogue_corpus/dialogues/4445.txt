What's your favorite old thriller, a classic.
Wait Until Dark, with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin.
Why do you like it so much?
First of all, Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses, and secondly it's a fantastic movie.
What's it about?
It's about a blind woman who lives in an apartment and drug smugglers are looking for a heroin filled doll and think she has it.
Oh, wow! That's different!
I guess you could say that, but it's the acting and the suspense that make it so good.
I'm going to have to look for that one, it sounds like something I'd like to watch.
You won't be sorry if you do!
