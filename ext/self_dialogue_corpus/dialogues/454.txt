Do you think it's actually awkward for Raiders fans to support the team, knowing that they're leaving town in a few years?
Yeah, I definitely do. They're going to Vegas, right?
Yeah. It must be odd wearing team apparel that you know will be outdated in a few years.
That's why fans shoudn't buy anything they can't afford to burn.
That's pretty funny. I do think it would be cool to see a team in Vegas though.
Yeah, I love that city. But I never thought it would have a team.
I think that the city has a good chance of really making good money off of the team considering how many people go through that city.
But don't you think that would be a problem, considering the city might not have enough home town fans?
No, I think that's what makes having a football team there marketable. It'll be an international favorite.
I could see that happening.
Yeah, especially since football is becoming more famous overseas. Tourists from other countries might become fans of the team.
That would be pretty cool to see the NFL have more international exposure.
It would probably mean more games overseas like they do now.
That's actually something I don't like. I hate watching games that are played in London for example.
They aren't too bad. Plus it'd be cool to see more international athletes take up football.
I just want to make sure that the games aren't affected because the players are jet lagged by the trip.
Well, at least the NFL makes sure the schedule accomodates those types of games.
I wonder if the NFL would think about bringing a team to Canada first.
I think I heard rumors that there might be for the future, but I'm not too sure.
It definitely would be a cool thing to see more expansion teams.
