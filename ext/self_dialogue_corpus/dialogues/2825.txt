The GREEN BAY PACKERS won the first Super Bowl.
That was in 1967.
It was in LA.
They played the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS.
35-10 was the final score.
Green Bay won the Super Bowl the next year also.
NEW YORK JETS won their first one in 1969.
DALLAS COWBOYS won their first one in 1972.
MIAMI DOLPHINS won 2 in a row.
Then PITTSBURG STEELERS won 2 in a row.
Then they won 2 in a row again a few years later.
Buffalo Bills  appeared in the Super Bowl 4 years in a row.
DALLAS COWBOYS almost won 4 in a row.
The city the SUPER BOWL is chosen to be played in is decided years in advance.
I think it takes a while to plan it.
Pittsburg Steelers have won the most SUPER BOWLS.
DALLAS COWBOYS have 5 wins.
Two other teams have won 5 also.
Miami had 3 consecutive appearances.
Denver Broncos have lost 5 SUPER BOWLS.
