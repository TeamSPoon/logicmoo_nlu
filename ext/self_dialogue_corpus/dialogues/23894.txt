What's your favorite movie?
Hmmm, I'm not sure. I guess V for Vendetta.
I don't think I've seen that one. What's it about?
It's set in a really dark nazi-ish future where Britain is ruled by a totalitarian government.
That actually sounds pretty interesting, is it about the resistance movement?
Kind of, it's about a "terrorist"/superhero guy who gets the people to stand up to the government and a girl he rescues.
I think i will download it. Who's in it?
Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman play the main characters. It was directed by The Wachowskis.
The Wachowskis... Why do I recognize that name.
Seriously? Have you seen the Matrix movies?
Of course I have.
They directed those.
Oh, that's it. They did speed racer too!
Yep, and Jupiter ascending. I loved that movie too.
Me too, Mila Kunis was amazing in that.
So was Channing Tatum.
Yes he was! Actually we should totally  have a movie marathon.
I'm down.
Cool, want to come over on Saturday?
Sounds great, I'll bring Jupiter Ascending and V for Vendetta.
