So what kind of music do you like?
Well I like all sorts, except for country music.
Oh okay, me too.
I feel like I know a lot about current music but not a lot about classics.
Like Rolling Stones, or Led Zeppelin?
Yeah, I mean I know who they are, just not really familiar with their music.
Oh okay, well would you like me to list off a few more?
Yeah for sure!
Well, what's a current band you like and we can think of older bands that sound like that.
Well I like a lot of indie rock music.
I think indie takes a lot of inspiration from classic rock and roll.
Okay, like who for example?
Like, LCD Soundsystem sounds a lot like 80's music.
Really? Like who?
The Talking Heads, Echo and the Bunneymen, and The Cure.
What would you classify them as?
Well the Talking heads is more experimental.
What's a song I've heard from them maybe?
Psycho Killer.
Oh yeah, I have heard that one.
