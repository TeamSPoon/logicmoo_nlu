Have you ever seen Prisoners before?
Not sure, what is it about?
Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) faces a parent's worst nightmare when his 6-year-old daughter, Anna, and her friend go missing.
Isn't Jake Gyllenhaal in that one too?
Yes, it came out about 2013 I think.
I never got to see that one in the theater before.
Yes, it is a heart-wrenching one.
I hope it turns out good.  Don't tell me, I want to see it!
Ok I won't tell you!
Thanks!  I will rent it.
