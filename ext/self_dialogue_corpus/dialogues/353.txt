Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
No, but I hear Gal Gadot's performance is excellent.
So is Patty Jenkins' directing of the movie.
I can understand why it is a popular feminist superhero movie.
People have been waiting for the Wonder Woman movie since her cameo in Batman v. Superman
I was actually disappointed with Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice
Why? Did you not like Ben Affleck as Batman?
No, his performance did not complement Henry Cavill's Superman very well.
My main issue with Batman v Superman was the casting of Lex Luthor.
Also true.  I could not take Jesse Eisenberg seriously as a criminal mastermind like Lex Luthor.
