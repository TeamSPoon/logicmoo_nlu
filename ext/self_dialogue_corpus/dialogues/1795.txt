How are your Bengals looking this season, man?
Oh, I think they could win it all!
Marvin Lewis better hurry up and produce some results, I know that much.
Yeah. I think it's time to move on after this season.
What sucks is that they almost ALWAYS make it to the playoffs.
Yeah. I love Dalton. I think he's underrated.
Me too, actually. Him and Stafford.
Oh, definitely. Stafford has a cannon on him.
How do you think the Lions will do this year?
I think they're in the same boat as the Bengals, as far as head coaches go. They need to start producing results.
Definitely. They need some good receivers too.
With no Megatron, it's like... what's the point?
Yeah. And the Bengals need someone to supplement Green.
I know, right!? We need someone who can be in the slot and create mismatches.
Like a Christian McCaffrey, right?
Exactly. Or like a Dion Lewis.
Bengals defense should still be decent, if not better, though.
No doubt. As long as we have a monster like Burfict, we should be decent at a minimum.
I agree. Well, I'll see you once the season starts.
Me too. I'm excited for some football!
