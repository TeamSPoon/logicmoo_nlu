Let's get dark about music.
Bring it.
Let's assume you are on your deathbed in a hospice and you can choose your playlist.
Okay.
What do you want to listen to as you die?
Oooh, good one. That's a heck of an ice-breaker.
Yeah, I always ask this on blind dates.
I'm having the time of my life. Let me think about it - what about yours?
I want something super slow and gorgeous.
"Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten?"
That's a great choice, but no. I think the Jurassic Park theme.
I thought you said slow and gorgeous. That's loud and brassy.
Have you heard it slowed by 1000%? It's about an hour long.
No, what's it like?
Slow and gorgeous, as I said. You can't really hear where they are in it, but you know what's happening at the same time.
Interesting.
Yours?
The Oceanic six theme from Lost. It's unbeliveably gorgeous.
I haven't seen that so I don't know it.
It's got constant counterpoint. I warm up and go limp when I hear it. I think it'd be nice.
