What's your favorite rock band from the 80's?
I'd have to say Van Halen.
Oh I love them and also Duran Duran.
Yeah they really defined the 80s. My kids love 80's rock music as well as 90s.
Do they know about the Cranberries?
Zombie is their favorite song. They love the chorus, just like everyone else.
That's great that you've introduced them to the classics.
Thanks, I feel like that's essential. Today's music is awful.
I totally agree with that. Were you into any of the hair bands?
That's the one genre of rock I purposely skipped without regret.
