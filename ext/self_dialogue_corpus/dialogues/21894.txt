Are you into animated movies at all?
Yes, I love them.
Mind if I recommend one to you?
Sure, go ahead.
Well have you heard of A Bugs Life?
Nope, Is it worth watching?
Yeah, I really enjoy watching it.
What is it about?
It is about a group of ants that work hard to try and get food.
Interesting, sounds like a good kids movie.
Yeah it is, the ants have to also provide food for grasshoppers which bully them around.
Haha, so there is a bit of a twist on the movie.
Yep, but the ants eventually end up fighting back.
That sounds really fun to watch.
What is your favorite animated movie?
Probably Ice Age.
Haha, I love that movie.
I do too, its always a great one to watch with the kids.
I agree, I especially like the little squirrel always trying to get a nut.
Haha, that is so funny.
