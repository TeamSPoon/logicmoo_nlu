Are you a fan of music?
Of course! Who isn't?
I fugured! If you could see any musician live, who would you chose?
OOh, tough one. Dead or alive?
I guess either.
Not to pick the most obvious answer, but probably the Beatles.
Good choice, To see John Lennon live would be something else.
Tell me about it, what a talented songwriter. You?
I hadn't actualy made up my mind before I asked you!
That's funny. What artist would you chose?
Not to be a copycat, but probabky the Beatles as well.
Good choice!
I would live to see a lot of artists from the 60s and 70s though, it's tough to pick just one.
Agreed- America's best era of music.
Have you seen anyone from that era perform?
I saw Cat Stevens once, well, Yusuf Islam I guess.
That must have been awesome.
It was. What about you? Do you have a favorite classic rock musician you've seen live?
I did see Rod Stewart once.
That must have been cool!
