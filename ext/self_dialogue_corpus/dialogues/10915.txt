Did you see the first Fast and Furious short film?
What do you mean by short film?
There were two short films released outside of the movies.
I do not believe I have seen either, when did they come out?
One in 2003 one in 2009.
No I have not seen either.
The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious was the first.
That is a long name, at least I know what it is about.
Yea it pretty much bridges the first and second films.
I had no idea it even existed.
