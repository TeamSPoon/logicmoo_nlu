Don't know about you, but I'm a huge fan of the Batman movies.
Which ones? Nolan or Burton?
Definitely the Nolan ones. They're just so good.
Have you ever seen the Burton ones.
I saw the first two. I really enjoyed Michael Keaton's Batman and Jack Nicholson's Joker.
I feel like Nicholson's Joker is highly underrated.
I can see why. For the first proper big-screen appearance for the character, it was pretty awesome.
Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman were also both pretty good.
I actually really enjoyed DeVito's Penguin. I'm disappointed that the Penguin character wasn't in the Nolan movies.
It would've been interesting to see, that's for sure.
So I take it you've seen all of the older ones?
Yes, I have.
In that case, how do you feel about Batman & Robin?
Oh. I would've liked to keep that one tucked away. That one wasn't very good.
So I've heard
I mean, at least Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was fun.
Ice puns for days!
Yeah. Also, I feel like they did a good job making Bane look as accurate to the comics as possible.
Honestly, after the Dark Knight Rises, I can't see Bane in any other look other than Tom Hardy's.
His Bane did look pretty cool.
