No, pulp fiction was the best one ever
I do enjoy the movie
Why do you like Pulp Fiction ?
It is great and the story line was so interesting
Did you like stright outta compton ?
Yes that was on the top of my all time list
Do you know that the Tupac movie is coming out soon ?
Yes and I have been waiting 20 years to see it.
Do you think the movie will be good ?
It has to be it took 20 years to make it
Do you think the Tupac movie soundtrack would be nice
Now thats a hard question to answer
Why is it so hard ?
It likw Tupac has been dead for 20 years. He cant make his own soundtrack
ok, but it could be a collection of all of his songs just for the movie
That would not be a movie soundtrack that is a greatest hit
what is your fav movie of all time
I would say john waters female trouble
How about john waters polester ?
Also a great movie
