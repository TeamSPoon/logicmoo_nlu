If I hear one more person say the Beatles are overrated, I'm gonna lose it.
The Beatles are overrated.
I hate you.
Seriously though, no. People who say that miss the whole point.
Right. One time I heard this kid say "blah blah blah they're overrated".
Go on...
So I asked him. I went up to him and said, "hey, why do you think that exactly?"
Did he have any half way decent reason?
Nope. He goes, "their music was so simple. Psh. I could do that!"
Was it really? Then why aren't you a famous musician right now?
Exactly. It's that same way as any other kind of artist- when someone is so insanely talented, they make it look easy. That doesn't mean that it is actually easy.
Did he have a comeback to that?
Nope. He just said "whatever, man."
Wow.
Yeah. He probably loves Justin Beiber.
Don't hate on the Beibs, man.
C'mon now.
No. Don't you dare say bad things about my Justin. Justin Beiber is the next Kurt Cobain, he said it himself!
I hate you.
The Beatles are overrated.
