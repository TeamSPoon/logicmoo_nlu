Did you see the Jungle Book?
Yes, it was interesting
That's my favorite Disney movie
It's good that the wild animals treated him so well
It is pretty amazing they liked him at all
The snake is the same as the one from Robin Hood
I wonder how it got to Nottingham
I liked the Bear Nececcities
It's catchy
Living in a jungle would actually be terrible
