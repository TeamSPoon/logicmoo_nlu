How do you feel about bench warnings?
I think it keeps baseball grounded.
But there are unwritten rules.
I understand those but some of them are antiquated.
If someone bunted to break up a no hitter you wouldnt have a problem?
No because the name of the game is to get on base.
Thats a progressive thought
I think you do what you need to in order to get on base.
What about throwing at a guy?
Bench warning should only be given if the ball goes near the head.
So if they throw at the ribs you are OK with that?
Yes its baseball thats how you keep players in line
It seems barbaric to me.
Other sports are way worse.
I just dont like the ejections automatically
Coaches should control themselves.
I think they do a good job of that.
Well not when their bench gets warned.
Thats true.
They have to keep the focus of the team on their minds.
