Who do you think Rey's father is?
Definitely Palpatine.
Why is that?
Her fighting style, her aggressiveness, her Britishness.
I have a better theory.
You're demented, so this should be good.
She's Luke and Leia's daughter.
Wait...WHAT???
Well, they could have had sex during episodes IV-V, before Leia got with Han. Gotta do something for those long hyperspace flights. They didn't know yet either. Explains why she was dropped off: shamed the Jedi and the Senator.
You're a horrible person. But that's good.
