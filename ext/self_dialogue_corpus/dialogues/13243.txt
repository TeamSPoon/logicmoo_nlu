Do you like Rey from the Force Awakens?
Yeah she reminds me a lot of Luke.
Really, that's interesting.
Yeah just her attitude to the whole thing.
I guess you're right, they do kind of have the same attitude so far.
Yep, I wonder if Rey will be like him in the end?
You mean turn to an evil person?
Yeah the darkside.
I doubt it, she's too sweet and innocent.
That's true but you never know.
