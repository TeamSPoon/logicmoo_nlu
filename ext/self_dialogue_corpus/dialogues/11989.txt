I like The Emperor Strikes Back.
Oh, that's a classic!
I like all the classics, but that's my favorite one.
Do you like any of the modern ones?
I like Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, despite what the reviewers said.
I like that movie too! It's very campy.
Campiness in Star Wars movies is underrated.

I would say, Luke Skywalker.
