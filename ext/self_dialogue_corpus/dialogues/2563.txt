I was reading an article the other day about NFL cheerleaders.
Anything interesting?
Yes. I couldn't believe what they make in a season!
I have no clue. A lot?
No far from it. The elite cheerleaders make 3000-3500 dollar in wages.
That is preposterous!
The less seasoned girls make 1500-2000 dollars a season.
That has to be less than minimum  wage.
Yeah  a cheerleader from the Oakland Raiders sued the franchise for paying them $5.00 hr which is less than minimum wage.
Did they win?
Yes it was 1.25 million dollar settlement.
Hey I found a fun fact. The first ever cheerleader squad was of Baltimore Colts which was established in 1954.
I had no idea it was that long ago.
Did you know that there are some famous people who used to be professional cheerleaders in their younger days?
Will I be surprised ? I know that some are professional people in their respective kinds of jobs.
Two well know actresses Teri Hatcher and Megan Fox were professional cheerleaders.
Do you know what teams they cheered for?
No I have no idea about Megan Fox but Teri Hatcher cheered for  San Francisco 49ers
What about the ones now who are people with regular jobs.
One I know is a Doctor and one is a chemical engineer.
