Did you buy Beauty and the Beast yet?
Not yet.  I'm trying to not let my daughter know it came out yet.
Why's that?
I would rather wait for the Blu-Ray to get a bit cheaper.
How much is it at Target?
$25 I think.  Seems expensive.
If you want, you can borrow my copy.
It's okay, I'm sure we'll get around to it.
Alright.  Besides, you know she's going to watch it about a billion times once you get it.
No joke, don't remind me!
