Do you like One Direction?
I love One Direction.
Do you like One Direction more or less than Nsync?
Wow, you're gonna make me choose!
Life is about hard decisions my friend!
Okay, so I like both equally and let me break it down.
Okay, go.
Nsync changed the music scene.
So did One Direction.
Yes, both of the members are cute.
And both are broken up now.
Boybands never last....but both of them had catchy music.
Your favorite songs from them?
One Direction.....hmm...I liked their last album, Four, as a whole.
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. I liked Stockholm Syndrome.
Me too, I also liked Drag Me Down.
Well what Nsync songs do you like?
Oh, Girlfriend and Bye Bye Bye easily.
Yeah, those are catchy songs.
They get stuck in your head.
