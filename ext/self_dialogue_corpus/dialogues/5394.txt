I think my favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Hmm, mine is probably Frozen.
Oh man, everyone loved that movie!
Yeah, the songs really get stuck in your head.
My daughter couldn't stop singing "The cold never bothered me anyway!"
Ha ha! I couldn't stop singing it either. It drove my husband crazy!
Hercules had some great music too! Remember when Megera sang, "I won't say I'm in love!"?
Oh right! The muses were great in that film! I loved that they were all shapes and sizes.
Me too! I swear, that song was my theme song. I never thought I'd get married!
And look at you now! A Disney-esque princess... turned Queen. Congratulations!
