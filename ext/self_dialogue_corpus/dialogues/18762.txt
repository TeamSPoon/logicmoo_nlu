Who is your favorite band of the 90's?
Don't laugh, but I loved the backstreet boys.
I'm pretty sure everyone listened to them even if they wont admit it.
They were everywhere.
I want it that way was my jam.
Don't ever say my jam again. But I loved that song, too.
I have vivid memories of the music video that was shot in like black and blue and white playing on Disney Channel
You mean Shape of my heart?
Yes! Did you like that song.
Yeah, I loved it.
You remember having to hide from the other guys that we didn't listen to boy bands?
In high school, yeah, but in elementary literally everyone did on their cd players.
I wonder how they're doing now.
I know they still tour and whatnot, which is weird.
How is it weird?
Well, they're old now. I wonder if they get the same fans in the audience, or teen girls again
I doubt teen girls go.
You never know
Its probably girls who grew up listening to them.
Thats probably the majority of the fans, yeah
