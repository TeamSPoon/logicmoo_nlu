Alright, so what do you think of Alestorm?
Eh... I don't know, what about it?
I mean do you like them or...?
What even is it?
It's pirate metal, fam.
Ah... Oh! Like Keelhauled and all that?
That IS Alestorm, yeah.
It's alright, I mean I love the pirate theme in the videos.
But what about the music!
Oh... Look, I'm not going to lie, I dunno.
What do you mean by that?
Just... It's kind of been done before. Like the whole Johnny Depp, Pirates thing.
Okay look, it's nothing like that. We're not talking... like sea shanties or anything.
We're not?
PIRATE METAL man, I feel like you aren't listening. Like rock and roll?
Why didn't you just say so...
I DID! Well? Do you like it or not?
Eh... it's aiight, Drinks was better though.
That was also Alestorm!
OH... well, I like it fam, good stuff.
