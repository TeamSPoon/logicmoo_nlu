I'm really into 90's music right now. Have you ever heard of Pearl Jam?
Yes, I was in high school in the 90's so I listened to Pearl Jam a lot.
Wow, I didn't think they were that popular.
They were, in the 90's. I listened to a lot of grunge music.
What's grunge music. I said Pearl Jam.
Pearl Jam is grunge. It was a big style in 90's music.
Oh, yeah. I think I read something about that on Tumblr.
Ok, let me help you out. You like Pearl Jam?
Yeah, I've been listening to them non-stop lately.
Then write down these band names too. Nirvana, Soul Asylum, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains.
Oh I've heard of Nirvana! I haven't listened to them though.
You should, especially their MTV Unplugged.
Ok. MTV is ok, but my mom won't let me watch because she hates that show Teen Mom.
Don't worry. MTV used to be a lot different, this was a music show.
Ok cool. I'll have to make Spotify playlist later with all these bands.
You should! I think you'll really like them, also try Stone Temple Pilots and Sonic Youth.
I love this, my parents don't listen to any cool music.
You might be surprised, but that shoould get you set up for awhile.
I don't know I listen to a lot of music, I'll go through this pretty quick.
Then let me tell you about Riot Grrrl.
