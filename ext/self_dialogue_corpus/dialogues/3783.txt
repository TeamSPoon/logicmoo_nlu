What is your favorite thriller movie?
John Wick
I love that movie!
Have you seen the sequal?
No, but I heard that it is awesome!
Yea me too!  Have you seen the video about John Wick with a nerf gun?
No, what's that about?
It bascially is a guy looking like John Wick that takes out a ton of kids at a Nerf war.  It's rather violent looking and overkill vs kids.
Sounds funny!
Oh it is!  google it!
