So guess what they came out with a new Transformers
What are you serious didn't make enough of them
I know right I'm over there like Michael Bay you made enough Transformer movies already
This is like the 4th or 5th one I'm not even sure
So did you watch it yet
No not yet haven't got the time but I probably check it out
Yeah the last one is called the last night the mean it seemed like they just threw it together
That's what happens when you make five and six movies sequels there's nothing to talk about
But hey least the special effects look good that's mainly lot of people watch them to Transformers
Yeah most people watch them science fiction movies just for the special effects
Did you see all the other Transformers before this
I don't know I think I seen at least one or two of them
Who's your favorite character in the Transformers I mean Transformer
You know the Transformer Bumblebee what is he the Dodge Charger right
Is that a charger is at a challenger but yeah I know who bumblebee is
Well my favorite is Optimus Prime
Of course you going to pick Optimus Prime you always liked the biggest and strongest
No I like him because he connect all together with the other Transformers
Do you like one big super Transformer
Do you think Transformers are real
