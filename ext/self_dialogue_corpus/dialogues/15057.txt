Spaceballs was a good movie, wasn't it?
One of the better comedies to come out in the 80's in my opinion.
I don't think Rich Moranis did much after that.
Well, he did do the Honey I Shrunk the Kids movies.
Yeah, but not as good as Spaceballs.
Well sure, but just answering your question.
I really liked the reference at the end to Planet of the Apes.
You mean with them mistaking it for the Statue of Liberty.
Yep.
I agree, that was comedic gold.
