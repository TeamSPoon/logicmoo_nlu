Can you think of any Pop Artists who have crossed over to Rnb?
Old School Pop or New School Pop?
It doesn't matter, I just want to see if you are on your Ps and Qs on Pop music.
Bette Milder would be an old school crossover.
I thought you would say Michael McDonald because of his Motown Hits album.
Justin Beiber have made some head way in Rnb.
Didn't he win Best Rnb artist recently?
I think you are thinking of Justin Timberlake.
If we go way way back Old School Dusty Springfield would be considered a crossover Rnb artist.
Wow! You went way back to the 60s on that one. High Five!
