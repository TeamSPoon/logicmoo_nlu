Did you watch the Braves game last night?  It went extra innings.
Yeah, I held out until the 11th inning and then had to go to bed.
Do you think the Royal have a strong bullpen this year?
I don't know.  It seems like they traded a lot of pitchers at the end of last season.
What do you think of that call on 2nd in the 9th inning?
He looked safe to me.  They challenged it and lost.
Can you believe that hothead Ryan charged to mound after getting hit by the ball?
Yeah, they need to send that clown back to the minors.
I bought tickets to the Cubs game.  I'm bringing my son and his ball glove.
Ya, never know.  Plenty of foul balls to be had.
Did you see the Indians and Padres game.  It was a high scorer.
Yeah, it looked more like a football score.
What did you think of the homeplate umpire in the Yankees game last night?
I think he's the best money can buy.  He didn't make a good call all night.
Are you going to watch the Red Socks vs. Yankees game this weekend?
Wouldn't think of missing it.  I never miss that matchup.
Did you watch the end of the Royals double-header?
Yeah, the GM got doused with a cooler of Gatorade.
Did you hear they traded Rodriguez for Chavez?
Yeah, we got the bad end of that deal.  Millions down the drain.
