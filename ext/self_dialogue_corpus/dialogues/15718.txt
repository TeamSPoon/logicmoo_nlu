Have you ever heard of Cody Jinks?
Yes I have. He is from Texas and used to front The Cody Jinks Band.
He is a solo artist now.
I didn't know that. I used to see him play in Houston all of the time.
He is being hailed as an innovator of a new breed of country music. A mix of the old and the new.
Yes. He certainly has that throwback sound.
His song, I'm Not The Devil, is really good.
Nice. That was a song that he played with The Cody Jinks Band.
It is tearing up the country charts now.
Awesome! That was one of my favorite songs of his and his group.
He just has that true and tried and raw sound that I love.
Yeah. He is certainly a throwback to the old outlaw and Texas singers for sure.
He reminds me a lot of Waylon and Willie.
Yes. He certainly has the sound that was very similar to theirs.
I hope that he becomes a household name.
Cody Jinks is certainly a big name in the music industry down here in Texas.
He just has the potential to go very far in today's music business.
Yes he does. He is certainly one of a kind.
I get the feel that he could turn out like Zac Brown, Jamey Johnson, and Sturgill Simpson.
Cody Jinks certainly can carry on the legacy that those artist do.
