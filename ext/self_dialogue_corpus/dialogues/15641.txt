Will you help me pick out music for my wedding?
Sure! Have you picked a song for your first dance yet?
No, I haven't, there are so many good choices.
May I suggest I Need You by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill?
That is a great suggestion. I love Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.
I do too. Did you know that Tim and Faith have been married for 20 years?
I bet thats why their love songs are so meaningful.
They are another great duet in Country Music.
I agree. There are so many good duets in country.
Who is your favorite country artist?
I have many, but at the very top I would say Garth Brooks.
Yes he is good. I love his song Sail My Vessel.
Yes, and Standing Outside The Fire is another good one. Who is your favorite Country Artist?
Martina McBride is one of my favorites.
Yes, I like her music too.
You could use her song In My Daughters Eyes for the mother daughter dance.
Great idea. That is such a heartfelt song.
I agree it has a lot of meaning behind it.
Thank you for the suggestions.
Your welcome.
