I'm really glad they held off on superhero movies until now.
What do you mean?
Could you imagine how awful the special effects would've looked back in the 80s?  As much as I love Superman from the 70s, but it looks cheesy in parts.
I think it's really ahead of it's time.  I think it looks better than the cgi in the first X-Men.
Yeah, when Wolverine swing around on Lady Liberty's crown, he looks like he came straight from an Xbox.
Hugh Jackman was an excellent Wolverine.
I know!  Who do you think they'll get to replace him?
I don't know.  I'm sure whoever it is will be a disappointment.
I wonder when they'll make another X-Men movie?
I think it's Deadpool next-- you know that'll be hilarious.
