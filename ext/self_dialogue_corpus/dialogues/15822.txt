Do you think Nickelback deserves all the hate they get?
No, I actually love them.
Would you say that in public?
Sure, I think the hate is more of a meme now anyway.
I think they are generic, but the hate is pretty excessive.
I don't see how they sound generic at all, to be honest.
Which songs do you like from them?
Too many to name. My favorites are Photograph, Far away, never gonna be alone.
Photograph has a great music video.
Even if you don't like Nickelback, that song will make you feel kind of sad.
Yeah, it makes you feel super nostalgic and regretful.
Yeah, every time I listen to it I think about things I wish I had done when I was young.
Rockstar is a song that I think many would like.
Its a good song. Like I said, I can't think of why they are so hated.
Me neither. People just say they hate them for laughs, I guess.
I'm sure there are a ton who do hate them, but I doubt its as bad as it seems.
I'm gonna listen to them today to try and figure it out more closely.
Go ahead, you'll end up getting addicted to them.
Which album should I start with?
All the right reasons
