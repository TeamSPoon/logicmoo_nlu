I feel so bad for Seahawk fans, man.
Why's that?
Because of Marshawn Lynch.
Yeah I know, it really sucks he retired.
No, he's going to the raiders.
What? Since when?
Since last week. Are you living under a rock?
I guess so, I've just been so busy.
Well, I just feel bad for the fans. I'm glad I'm not a Seahawks fan.
You shouldn't feel bad for them, you should feel bad for me.
What? why?
Because now I have to be a Raiders fan.
You're such a band-wagoner.
You're just a hater.
I thought you were a Patriots fan?
I am.
But now you're a Raiders fan?
Yes sir.
How does that even work?
I have enough love for all the teams.
