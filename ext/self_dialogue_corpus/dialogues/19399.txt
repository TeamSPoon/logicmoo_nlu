Do you have a background in music?
What do you mean?
I mean, have you ever gotten musical training by a professional?
Well, I've played piano for 8 years when I was a kid. But I'm no good now.
Oh cool. I played piano too.
Nice.
When you took piano lessons, did you also have to learn piano theory?
Yeah. I was tested on it every year. California has a kind of yearly testing thing where you advance levels.
Yeah I'm familiar. Certificate of merit right?
Oh cool you did that too? What did you think of it.
It was kind of a chore. The stakes seemed high but the reward wasn't really there.
I feel like it was more a "for yourself" kind of thing.
Well actually, aside from just getting to certain levels. Certificate of merit will recommend you for piano competitions and recitals.
Oh, I wouldn't know I sucked haha.
Yeah not to brag or anything, but I was invited to a lot of the end of the year ceremonies.
Wow, nice. Were you ever contacted by a professional.
No I wasn't that good! But I got a couple of trophies.
That's cool. I guess it is kind of an engine for future professional piano players
I guess you're right. I was never meant for it though!
Me neither, clearly.
