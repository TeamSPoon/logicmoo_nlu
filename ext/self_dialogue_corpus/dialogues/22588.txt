Did you ever watch the Saw movies?
I've seen the first 3. Have there been more than that?
There have been close to 7 to date.
I really should get caught up. My favourite is still the first one though.
It was so good! I mean, in a morbid way.
I can't stand the character of Jigsaw. They give me the creeps.
Why do you think they chose that aesthetic for Jigsaw?
I've wondered about that. I wonder if Jigsaw is male or female, I don't remember if it was disclosed or not.
We should really see the rest of the movies together.
And have a marathon!
Yes, we should go through them in chronological order.
That will be enough gore to last me a few months.
There are some interesting fan theories I've seen online about the Saw movies.
Well that piques my curiosity. I'm more interested in the fan art I've seen.
There's a lot of inspiration considering how many movies are available.
Oh, it looks like the newest movie, Jigsaw is coming out later this year.
Want to see it in the theatre?
Definitely. Let's get caught up in time, shall we?
Sounds good. I'll bring the movie snacks.
Nothing like watching someone cut their foot off in a dingy room to kickstart your appetite.
