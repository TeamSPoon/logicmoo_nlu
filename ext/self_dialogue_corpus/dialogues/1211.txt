What do you think about the Detroit Lions next season?
I watched them a bit, but think they have a lot of issues.
Really?    What is the biggest problem you see?
Well, the rushing game was terrible last year.
True, but Theo Reddick seems to be healthy this season.
Yes, but both he and Ameer Abdullah need to be healthy.
What about the quarterback?
Matthew Stafford is good, but he does too much.
How can a good quarterback do too much?
A good offense should be balanced, and nearly 600 passes is just too much.
Isn't that a factor of the offensive line?
True, and unless Rick Wagner has a great season, that too is questionable.
Fine.      What about the kicking game then?
Well, it starts with Matt Prater.
That's what I'm talking about!
He is definitely a great kicker, although not necessarily the best in the league.
What about the punting?
I like Sam Martin.
Didn't he even get some team records last year.
Yes, he did a tremendous job in the first game in the Colts.
