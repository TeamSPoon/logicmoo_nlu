Hey man, when does the NFL season start?
I think preseason starts in mid-September.
Awesome, I can't wait.  Who's playing first?
I think the Chiefs and the Patriots are the first game in preseason.
That'll be an easy win for the patriots.
You think so? I think the chiefs are looking pretty good this year.
I don't think so, who do they have that's any good?
Are you kidding me?  They've got Travis Kelce and Kniles Davis.
Yeah, but a team isn't going to succeed with a good Tight End and a decent running back.
They've got more than that man, I'm not a chiefs fan, but I'm not going to deny talent.
Who else do they have?
Spencer Ware is going to break out and Nick Foles gets better every year.
Nick foles is garbage.
No he's not, he's much better now than when he was on the Eagles.
I'll give you that. But doesn't make them good.
I think Andy Reid will do some good things this year.
Super Bowl good?
No, not at all haha.
Alright, so at least we can agree on that.
Yeah, alright man, have a good one.
