Did you see "Cars 3"?
I did not, but I see that ticket sales are doing very well.
I remember being very young when the first "Cars" came out.
We both were. I am not sure i can stomach any more of the "Lightning McQueen" character.
Now, I can definitely get excited about the new "Pirates of the Caribbean" Disney movie.
I saw it. It was good if you are loyal to the franchise.
Did all the main characters return to film this one?
Many did and there are a few plot twists.
I want to see the new "Star Wars" movie that will be coming out.
Me too. "Rogue One" was surprisingly good and it helped to put pieces from the old franchise together.
