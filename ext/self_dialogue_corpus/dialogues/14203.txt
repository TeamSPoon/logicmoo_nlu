Do you like listening to Lady Gaga?
Yes.  I think she is so talented.  I would love to see her in concert.
I couldn't believe how well she did at the Superbowl halftime show.  That was super entertaining.
I didn't realize those were all drones that were flying through the air at the beginning of it.
I'm guessing she had something to do with the planning of that whole performance.
Probably.  She's so original.  Can you imagine wearing a meat dress.
I think that's kind of disgusting, but leave it to her.
I have to say that I like to try and sing along with her when I hear her song "Poker Face".
I imagine you look pretty weird driving in a car singing that.
Oh, I only do it when there is nobody around.  Otherwise I would probably look like I'm having a seizure or something.
