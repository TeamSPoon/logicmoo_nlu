I love the Beatles, how about you? They are one of my favorite bands.
Mine as well, what are some of your favorite songs? I always liked the early songs, Love Me Do, I wanna Hold you hand and the  others that made the first become popular.
I really love the album Sargent Pepper, now that has some great songs like Lucy in the Sky.
Yes that is a great record! No one can beat their songs. Who was your favorite beatle?
John Lennon. Now he was a great composer. Just think of all the songs he would have written if he was not killed. Such a horrible tragedy.
I agree, Paul McCartney also came out with a lot of good songs.
I love Hey Jude, Get Back, Yellow Submarine, Norwegian Wood, and a lot more.
Those are some of my favorite as well as a lot of George Harrison songs.
They were all talented, you cannot find a band that rivals them. They were real trendsetters.
You are right. No one today can hold a candle to them.
