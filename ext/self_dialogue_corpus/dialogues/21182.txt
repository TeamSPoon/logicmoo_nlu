Hey, aren't you a fan of the Star Wars movies?
I like the older ones.  Some of the newer ones are good and some are not.
Have you seen all of them?
Absolutely.  I like to see them as soon as I can after they come out.
Do you like to watch them on TV later?
I don't like to have them interrupted by commercials.  It sort of breaks up the story.
I agree with you.  I get really involved, then have to see something about cereal or fast food.  Yuck!
Yeah, especially when they are doing the trash scene in episode 4.  Who wants to see food?
EEEWWW!  There are lots of places where food isn't a good idea.
Yup, but I get thirsty when they spend a lot of time in the desert.  Episode 1. 2,4, and 7
Me, too.  I bet they sell lots of soft drinks during those movies.
Uh huh!  Did you get cold during the scenes in the blizzard in episode 5?
Not really.  I saw that one in the summer.  It was kind of nice to feel a little cool.
I get a little dizzy when they fly.  Anney really got me in episode one with the pod races.
It was fun, but I got some motion sickness, too.
Did you think you needed a translator in many of the films?
Sometimes.  But I kind of got used to it after a while.
I liked the Ewoks.
My favorite was Yoda.
Do or do not.  There is no try.
