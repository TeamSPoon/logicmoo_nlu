Who do you think is the best female rapper of all time?
I really like Missy Elliot.  She was really incredible to listen to.
What about Nicki Minaj?
She's talented, but I don't think she's as good as Missy by far.
Does Missy Elliot still make music?
I think she released a new album within the last year.
Oh, I hadn't realized that.
Yeah, I guess she's not as popular as she used to be.
She really was on fire back in the day.
Oh, yeah, she was.
