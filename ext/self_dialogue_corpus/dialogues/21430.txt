I went to go see the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 movie last week, it was so good.
Oh yeah I want to see that one!
I love Chris Pratt, he was really good in it.
He's one of my favorite actors, he looks so good in this one.
I think the CGI was definitely better in the second one too.
The CGI in those movies is great, especially with all the new characters.
Yeah, they did a good job on Rocket and Groot's CGI too.
The baby Groot looks so cute!
He was so cute in the movie, he was my favorite new character.
I saw the trailers and I definitely want to see it just for the cute baby Groot.
There was a lot of interesting new characters and species.
Oh yeah, like who?
Starlord's dad was in it and he plays a crazy new character who can create planets.
That's crazy! Sounds interesting though.
Yeah, I won't spoil too much but there's a good twist to it.
I love movies that keep you in suspense like that.
The music was also great too, they have lots of retro songs.
Oh yeah, like in the first one.
Yep, it has a lot of the good things about the first one and expands on the history of the characters.
I'll have to go see it!
