what's your favorite rapper of all time?
oh boy, that's a hard question
come on, you gotta choose
well, if I have to choose, it's gonna be Drake then
good choice, I like him too, he got style
for sure, especially Hotline Bling, right?
haha, right. But what other music you listen from him?
umm, he's a really productive singer, in a blink of an eye, there are just 2 more albums coming out from him, I listen to all of them
I like Views, the album was great
so as the cover
