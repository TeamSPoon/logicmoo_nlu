Did you think Emma Watson was a good choice to play Belle?
For sure. She was even born in France!
Wait, she was?
Yeah, she just moved to England when she was young.
Wow. Wait, why does it matter that she's French?
Because Belle is French!
Wait, really?
Yeah. Belle means "beautiful" in French.
Wow, I had no idea. Thanks.
You're welcome.
