Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast Movie?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
It was fantastic! I expected it to be worse than the original, but I was surprised.
Why did you expect that?
Remakes are usually pretty bad in my opinion, but not this one.
So what did you like the most about it?
The Beast had the most beautiful singing voice! There isn't a song for The Beast in the original.
Seriously? I didn't know that!
Yeah, it's such a shame. The song added so much.
I bet. I will definitely have to go see the movie soon since you got me so interested in it!
