Only sixty three days.
Sixty three days? Sixty three days till what?
Sixty three days until football season!
Seriously, I mean don't you follow baseball?
I cannot wait. The Steelers are going to bring home the Championship this year for sure.
You think so huh? Aren't you forgetting something?
What do you mean?
I mean are you forgetting that New England is also going to be playing this year.
Yeah, that is an issue, but I think this is the year that we win.
How do you beat Tom Brady?
It is all about the defense's ability to get to him. He can be shaken and beaten. If you can get to him a couple of times he tends to lose his temper and then you can beat him.
Who is going to do that?
Well, Cam Heyward was injured last year and he will be back. Bud Dupree was also hurt for a while and he should be back.
You think those two guys are enough?
They will definitely help but the secondary is also going to have a lot more experience working as a team.
How does an experienced secondary help you get to Tom Brady?
If they have got their men covered then Brady can't release the ball and our front four has more time to apply the rush.
I see, so it is all about teamwork.
That's right, unless of course you are the New England Patriots.  Then it is all about Brady.
You got that right.
