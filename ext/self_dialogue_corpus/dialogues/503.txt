So, what do you think about the Dolphins quarterbacks this season?
Well, obviously you need to start with Ryan Tannehill.
He had that knee injury late last year, and I heard there were questions about his recovery during the off-season.
At this point it doesn't look like that will be an issue.  He will wear a brace, but he has looked good in camps so far.
Yeas, but those are just camps.
That is true, we won't know for sure until games start and he needs to put stress on the knee or he takes a hit.
What about his progress as a quaterback?
This is his second season under Adam Gase, and it looks like he has really started to improve.
We have heard that before with him.
I know, but his progress does seem pretty genuine.  He looks like the leader this team needs.
What about his problems with accuracy on the deep ball.
If you look at his numbers from last year, you will see that stat is actually misrepresented.  When his line gave him time, he was one of the better deep passers in the league.
What about his troubles on third down and in the red zone?
More experience for the team in the offense should help, as should the addition of Julius Thomas.
How about the backup quarterbacks.
Matt Moore is back as the primary backup, and he is one of the best in the league.
So, no worries there.  What about the future?
They have a couple young players in Brandon Doughty and David Fales.
Neither of them is replacing Matt Moore.
True, they are both projects.  Their job right now is to learn and see how they develop.
