With the new Beauty and the Beast movie out, did you happen to re-watch the original Disney animated version again?
Yes, I did. I had too. I wanted to compare the two movies.
Me too. I loved the Disney animated movie better.
So did I. I think Belle was my favorite character out of them all.
Oh, really? I always liked Chip and Mrs. Potts the best.
Did you like Gaston's character?
Well, not really. I think he was kind of a boring character.
At the end, Gaston was the one who died right?
Yeah, he fell off the wall of the castle when he tried to kill the beast.
Oh, yeah. I forgot what had happened in his final scene.
