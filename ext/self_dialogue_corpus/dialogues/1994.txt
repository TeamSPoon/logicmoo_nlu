What do you think about the rookies in the NFL last year?
I think that they didn't perform very well
I agree, off the top of my head I can only remember Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot
Yeah, I really don't remember anyone else
Did Carson Wentz start playing last year?
Actually I think you are right
Yeah he did alright with the Eagles
It's surprising too because he came from a small university
Yeah I guess there's talent everywhere you look if you look hard enough
I bet a team wishes they get good rookies for the new year
Yeah it's really important to have refreshing talent on your team
They can go very far with good rookies
They can also bargain their rookies with other veteren players.
Rookies often don't last too long in the year though
I think your right, a startling number of them are injured and out of the league early
Yeah but the minimum salary I believe is around 400k/year
That is still a lot of money but the best players get paid so much more
But they probably should
But the disparity is so large, it should be a little closer together
That may happen in the nearby future
