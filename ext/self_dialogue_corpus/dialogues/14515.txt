Is Porzingis long for New  York?
I mean he should be.
I cant believe theres talk of trading him
The franchise in disarray
I am shocked that Phil Jackson doesnt have a better hold on it.
He is a better coach than personnel guy.
I think thats evident.
I do not know what they are going to do.
Will they be competitive soon
Not when stuff like this happens.
I mean Kristaps fell to them and they are bungling that.
I think the Anthony situation did alot of damage.
To the coach or who?
To the organization as a whole
Guys dont want to be in that dysfunction.
Nope and we can see it playing out right now.
Yeah I think that its the end of the line for them.
They need to bring in a big named coach
And trade Melo?
Yeah he has to be the first move
