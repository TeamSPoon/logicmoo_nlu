Do you ever find yourself wearing the same thing celebrities wear?
I don't really have the money to keep up with their lifestyles
I'm not looking at the lifestyles and talking specifically about what they wear
I gotcha yeah I try to wear what they have but I don't think that they are trendsetters
Wow that's crazy I think they know what they're doing
What do you think is the best magazine for fashion
I would probably say Vogue
I would probably say Vogue
I'm not a big fan of that publication to be honest with you
I'm not a big fan of that publication to be honest with you
They do post a lot of different styles which I like to get inspiration from
What would you rather wear clothes the celebrity endorsers or nothing at all
To be honest with you I choose my own fashion I don't need a celebrity tell me what to wear
Ouch it seems like you're throwing shade
No I'm not doing that I'm just saying I think each individual has their own likes and dislikes
But you do need some sort of direction to head in
Not necessarily you can go online and get a lot of ideas for a wardrobe
What sites do you use for that
I think Pinterest does a good job
Yeah I'm not a fan of that at all
