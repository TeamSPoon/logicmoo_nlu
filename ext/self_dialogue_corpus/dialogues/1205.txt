So do you think Tom Brady is gonna be able to win another Super Bowl?
Nah, I don't think so.
Really? He still looks pretty good and healthy.
I just think that he gets carried by his team too much and never really plays a great Super Bowl where he dominates.
Yeah, I guess I can see that. But if you think about it, it really is all about being part of a great system.
I agree. I think Tom Brady is getting to that point though where the system can't help him anymore.
You do have to admit though, he still played great last year.
Yeah, but a year is a long time for a professional football player. For all we know his body can break down soon.
Maybe, but then again, if you think about it, he didn't even have Gronk in the Super Bowl and they still won.
I think the Super Bowl win was more of a matter of the Falcons making stupid decisions.
Yeah, it is odd that the Patriots won their last two Super Bowls off of stupid choices by the other teams.
Do you think he should still continue playing?
Yeah, I think he's still their best choice at quarter back.
I actually think the back up Jimmy is a better choice.
Yeah, I think he's pretty good, too.
I actually think they should start him soon and cut Brady because Jimmy is about to become a free agent.
I don't think that would happen. New England fans would riot.
Yeah, but when Jimmy gets signed by another team and does better than Brady, they're going to wish they had kept him.
Yeah, that would be funny.
I definitely would love to have Jimmy as the quarterback on my team.
