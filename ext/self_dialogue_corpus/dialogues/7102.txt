How do you feel about them making another Toy Story sequel?
I'm not too fond of it, I thought they had a great ending with the third film.
I agree, honestly I didn't think there needed to be a Toy Story 2 or 3 either.
I mean, however you look at it they're fun sequels to a children movie, but agreed.
But what I'm also saying is, I didn't think they needed to exist and both sequels were great films.
That's very true, it's hard to distrust Disney and Pixar at this point.
Definitely, they can really do no wrong in my opinion.
Indeed, even their lesser films are successful and worth the watch.
Indeed, similar to Finding Dory.
Hmmm, see I can't agree I actually hated Finding Dory.
