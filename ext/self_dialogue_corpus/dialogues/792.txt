Who do you have for MVP this year?
I got Matt Ryan repeating again, I think the Falcons are going to have another great season.
I can see that, it is hard to win back to back though.
Who do you have for MVP?
I think Drew Brees is going to win it.
Really, why do you think he's winning it?
I think Saints are going to surprise everyone and win over 11 games and make the playoffs, and Brees will put up 5000 yards again.
I can definitely see the the 5000 yards happening, but the Saints winning that many games, I don't know.
I just have a feeling, either way it could be Brady and Rodgers too.
Yes they will always be up there, especially Aaron, the Packers are going to be very good this season.
I think so too, they are my Superbowl favorites.
Can't believe that Rodgers only has one ring, he's been the the best player for the last five years at least.
I have to agree, put him on the Patriots and they win every year.
Yeah, anybody with top 10 talent can succeed in that system.
True, I wonder if Jimmy Garoppolo is even that good, or if it was the system.
Won't know until he gets a chance to shine, we'll see.
You think anyone is about to have a comeback season?
Cam Newton, he might get the Panthers back this year.
He might, but I think he just had that one Superbowl season, I think the new young Quarter Backs are about to take over.
Yes, I am so excited about that, hopefully this will be a competitive season.
