Did you know that they are making "It" the 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King into a movie?
I thought they already made that one. I remember watching it on TV.
They did make a "made for TV" mini series about the novel back in 1990, but they are redoing it for the big screen.
I liked the mini series in the beginning, but it just got stupid towards the end.
I agree. I can't wait to see this remake.
Hopefully, it will be better then the last. The novel scared me to death when I read it in High School.
You should watch the trailer for it. It looks so scary.
Is pennywise the clown in the trailer?
Yes, Pennywise is in the trailer. He looks very scary.
I thought the Pennywise from the first one was scary.
I think it will be broken down into 2 movies.
It would have to. There is so much information in the book.
I was very exited to find out that Stephen King really liked the new movie plot.
Was he involved in the process of making it?
I am pretty sure he was. I read a quote on Facebook that said he was immensely pleased with the film.
I had nightmares for weeks after reading the novel.
It was pretty scary. Get ready to have more nightmares!
Do you know the release date?
I have heard that "It" opens in theaters Sept. 8, 2017.
I figured it would be on Halloween. I can't wait to see it!
