Did you know that it has been ten years since the last Harry Potter book was released?
Has it been that long already? Wow!
Yes, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in 2007.
I can't believe it has been so long.
I remember that on the day it was released, I went to the book store dressed as Professor Dumbledore.
I never dressed up for the book releases, but I did dress as Harry Potter for Halloween when I was a kid.
People always dressed up for the book releases. My mom dressed as Professor Mcgonogal once.
My mom never read any of the Harry Potter books.
My mom was a bigger Harry Potter fan than I was!
Wow, you're so lucky.
