Can you believ it is almost time for the next season of NFL football?
Are you kidding?  It seems like forever since last season ended!
No, it seems like just yesterday that I saw the Patriots win another title...
That must be it!
What?
I just realized why it seems like so long since I enjoyed a game of football!
What do you mean?
I hate the Patriots!
So.
Don't you get it? I hate the Patriots!
I still don't understand.
You see, I hate the Patriots so much that my mind have blocked out all memories of last year's playoffs.
You mean you don't remember the Superbowl?
Not last year's Superbowl.  I remember the Broncos's victory the year before...
That means...
That's right...selective amnesia!
Incredible!
The pain of seeing the Patriots win another Superbowl was so traumatic that my brain has erased all memory of it from my conscious mind.
So, to you, it seems like two years since you saw a Superbowl!
Yeah, I don't remember a thing!  If only it worked the same way with ex-wives!
