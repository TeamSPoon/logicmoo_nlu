Have you heard Adam Lambert's music at all?
yes, I enjoyed him since American Idol days.
I think his big hit was what do you want from me.
I do think that opened him up to a wider audience than just idol fans.
Did you know that was actually a Pink song.
I guess she had a version.But it didn't make the cut on her record.
She does do a version of it on a later album. But I am glad Adam got it.
I think that song helped his career tremendously.
Ya he should definitely thank pink.
He should do more than just thanks her, send her a fruit basket, lol.
You know it would be neat if they did a duet version.
That would be cool.
I wonder if one exists and we just don't know of it.
It is possible. I love pink.
She is great. I like how tough she is.
I guess she was a highschool dropout.
Pretty nuts. I think that is great but so many dropouts are in such bad places in life.
Ya sad to think so many failed artists out there or just people in strife in general.
Now I feel sad.
Don't think" Pink", put on her album or adam's and dance your heart out.
