The first Die Hard movie was awesome to watch on Netflix.
Man, I can't believe that came out 30 years ago or whatever.
It still hold up relatively well.
It's got a good premise: trapped in a building surrounded by terrorists.
But they should know you never mess with John McClane.
He pretty much took them out one by one.
The best was the ending scene where Hans fell off the building.
Yeah, one of the best villain deaths ever.
Kind of a shame the rest of the movies weren't up to par.
But at least this one was tight.
