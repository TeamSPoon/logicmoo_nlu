Do you like boy bands?
Not at all.
Why not? They have catchy tunes.
There is no talent there.
Can you do what they do?
If someone paid for me to do it I would.
I guess you have no talent.
I'm into rap.
Now they have no talent.
That is very true, but the have good beats.
Imagine if there was a boy group that raped.
That would be comedy.
I wonder if it would sale.
Who knows. You should try to get people together.
I haven't put a band together since new kids.
That was you?
I told you, but you never believed me.
I still don't.
Look me up.
I will, new kids were good.
