so are you thinking of going to the dance?
yes, but it is really hard choosing what to wear
well, what about the dresses in your closet?
they are fine, but since it is latin dance, I kind of want something sexy to match the theme
Maybe something flashy too?
yes, something that is sexy, move well with the movement of the dance, so showcase the steps and the beats better
So are you thinking of going dress shopping?
yes
how about we go together this weekend?
ok
I want to get something news for the dance too since you mention it
any preference?
yes, something tight and flashy, so it looks good when I spin in salsa
I love salsa
and probably some high heels too
I think so
so which of the latin dance do you like so far?
I like salsa and tango
I hope they have lots of salsa song this dance
me too
