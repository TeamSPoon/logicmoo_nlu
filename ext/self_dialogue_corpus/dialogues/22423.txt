I seen the best movie of the year!!!!!
Oh really! What?????
Beauty and the Beast!!!!! IT WAS SO AMAZING!
AWE, Cute! I loved the first one, the original one.
Me too but i can honestly say this one was equally if not better!
Oh why so?
The creativity of how they turned all the characters in candle stick, piano etc was done beautifully!
I LOVED the Candle Stick and Mrs. Pots & her son Chip!
I know me too! I seriously want to see it again already, it was that good!
I really like Emma Watson! She seems like the perfect Belle!
She really was! She brought Belle to live and it gave me more understanding for her falling in love.
That was the hard part for me to really believe in the original.
This new one explains and gives Belle and the Beast more of a connection and you can feel the love develop.
Oh cool!
It also explains how the story really began and I had never been really clear on that part.
I heard it has new songs too?
Yes, the new songs were fantastic and so well written and the singing was perfect!
I'm excited to see it now! It has gotten great reviews!
I totally recommend it and already want to see it again and take my hubby!
That sounds like the perfect date night for me and mine too!
