Did you hear about the latest movie news lately?
I did! I heard about Brad Pitt's new movie with Tommy Lee Jones!
Oh really? That sounds like it'll be good! Do you know the title?
It's called 'Ad Astra' and it's supposed to be a space packed adventure.
Wow, I think that'll actually be a hit!
I know, I love sci-fi movies.  They're the best.
Yea! By the way, are you a Star Wars fan?
I haven't seen all of them, but I have seen Rogue One and it rocked!
Me too. I heard that they're going to pay a tribute to Carrie Fisher for the episode 9.
I think I saw that in the news. I think that's pretty neat.
Yea, she is a legend and I'm glad the director will honor her.
Right, Colin Trevorrow is really admirable for doing that.
I'm really excited about Jurassic World 2!
Yea! That sequel sounds like it'll be better than the first.
Chris Pratt is such a great actor and he really plays that role perfectly.
He does, he's incredibly talented.
I read somewhere that they spotted an Easter egg at the Fallen Kingdom set.
Wow, I wonder if it's connected to the movie whatsoever.
Yea, it seems like it could be.  It's supposed to be from Steven Spielberg's film.
I'm gonna bet my money it is!
