I watched Saw with my brother last night.  I haven't seen it in forever.
I haven't seen that in years either.
Did you like it?
I think I did.  I don't think I'd want to watch it now though.
It's pretty gory.
Yeah, there are movies that are worse.  This one was about as bad as I could handle.
Did you like the sequels?
I didn't see all of them.
I have them in case you'd want to borrow them.
I probably will pass on that.
