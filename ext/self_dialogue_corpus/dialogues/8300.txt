Have you heard Britney Spears is ending her tour in Las Vegas?
Yes! I was so upset I wanted to go. Does she sing her latest album?
It's a mix up of her older hits such as Baby one more time to her newest hits.
Sounds like so much fun! Her music is so great. My favorite song is Circus!
Great song! She is a great dancer and I hear she puts on quite a performance.
Nice to hear she turned her life around after her meltdown!
It really is.. she is back and doing better than ever.
I'm hoping I can make it out to Las Vegas to see her.
Me too! She is one of the greatest pop stars out there.
Yes, the princess of pop with over 9 great albums.
