What do you think is a great horror film?
Leprechaun is great.
I agree. Have you seen Wishmaster?
Of course. It is amazing.
I like old horror movies like Hellraiser and An American Werewolf in London.
Those are great films.
I even like the old, old ones like The Wolf Man from 1941 and Dracula wkith Bela Lugosi.
Have you seen any new horror movies?
Yeah, I don't like them as much.
Me neither. I think they are boring. I prefer the classics.
