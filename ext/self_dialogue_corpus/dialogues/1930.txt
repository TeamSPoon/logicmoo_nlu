Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?
You know, I used to sometimes, but mostly for the commercials and halftime show.
So you're not a huge fan.
But this year, I watched it for the game with a friend who is really into football.
What did you think of the game this year?
I mean, it was amazing right? Did you watch it?
I started to, but as the Patriots came back during crazy play after crazy play, I had to turn it off.
Ah, so you were a Falcons fan.
I've been a Falcon's fan all my life, yeah.
So you must've wanted to shoot yourself in the face during the second half of that NFL game.
You could say that. It was a disaster.
They say that Tom Brady has a reverse curse on him, and he'll keep winning until the apocalypse.
Right now I just want a lowly team like the Cleveland Browns to come in and beat them next season.
That would be an amazing game to watch.
The Patriots would finally pay for all the good karma they've been getting.
You don't think the Falcons made a lot of mistakes that Super Bowl? I think they deserved to lose.
My Falcons never deserve to lose. Matt Ryan is a god and deserves the best.
Do you have a little Matt Ryan action figure somewhere in your house that you kiss before you go to bed every night.
How did you know?
Because I have a Tom Brady one.
