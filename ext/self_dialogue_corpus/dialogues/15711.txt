Whats the worst song you've ever heard in your life?
Easy! Friday by Rebecca Black.
No that's too easy pick another one thats not from an amatuer.
Ha, ok. I'd say "Wobble Wobble" by 504 boyz.
I can't say I'm familar with the group or the song.
You should consider that a blessing to be honest.
On a scale of one to ten how bad would you rate the song.
Ten being the worst?
Yeah.
I'd give it a 10 hands down. The song was just terrible all around.
So it had no redeeming qualities?
Absolutely none to speak of. It was one of those mindless songs.
Mindless?
Yeah, you know how a song will come out and nothing about the lyrics or song has any kind of substance?
What you mean like no story or message?
Yeah exactly like that, but add on the fact the melody is bad too.
That does sound bad but to get the full effect I'll have to give it a listen.
I honestly think you can skip the full effect. It's gotta be one of the worst songs ever made.
I still think I'll give it a listen. It's just not the same until  I hear it.
Hey it's your ears.
