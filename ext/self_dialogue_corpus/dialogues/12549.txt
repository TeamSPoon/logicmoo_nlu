Do you remember in Empire when the Millennium Falcon was flying through the asteroids field?
Yeah, that was pretty intense. The odds were not good.
Well according to C-3PO
Yeah, but Han never cares about the odds
And remember they flew into that hole
Well it turned out to be a massive worm hole
Yeah, the "walls were collapsing"
But they turned out to be the jaws of some massive space creature.
And then the Empire was using those bomber TIEs to try and weed them out.
Oh yeah, those were pretty cool. Vader really wanted that ship.
