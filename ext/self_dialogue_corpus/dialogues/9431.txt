Did you ever listen to any Lil Wayne music?
I listened to some of his music.
Me too. Which song did you like the best?
I really enjoyed his song "How to Love".
I remember that one. Such a great song.
One of my ultimate faves was "Go DJ".
Yes that was a great one too. I really loved the beat of that song.
I completely agree. One of a kind for sure.
Yes it was!
"Mrs. Officer" was pretty great too.
