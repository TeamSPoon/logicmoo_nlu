I'm listening to Justin Timberlake!
He is a great artist.
I like his song Sexy Back.
That's his best one!
I also like his old stuff when he was with Backstreet Boys!
Yeah but I like him better now.
Have you seen his music video for Cry Me A River?
Yeah! He had a Britney lookalike!
That song was totally about her.
The video was too. I love that song.
