I wish Nirvana was still around.
Ya me too, but how could it go on with Kurt?
Well i meant that he was still around too.
Oh ya totally, i mean it wouldn't be nirvana without him.
you know a lot of people just didn't get him.
what do you mean, like his lyrics.
ya people would put a lot of thought into the lyrics, but he himself said sometime they were just nonsensical.
no way, his lyrics had a lot of meaning, i dont think thats true. just because we didn't understand them. i think to him they meant something really deep.
I'm just telling you what i read he said.
kurt was the voice of my generation. he spoke about the anguish we all feel at some time.
ya who am i fooling, he sounded like that to me too.
he was a popular kid who moved and then became one of the unpopular kids at his new school.
that must have been rough for him.
i read somewhere that he hated the rich kids that could afford the front row tickets while poorer kids were way in the back.
oh ya i think i read that too. he said that the kids up front were the kind of kids that picked on him.
he was a very deep person
he really was, there was nothing shallow about that guy.
courtney love, i blame her. i think she ruined him.
she certainly took over his life it seems.
i wish he'd never met that crazy chick.
