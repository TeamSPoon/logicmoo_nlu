Have you ever heard of the band Wishbone Ash?
I think I have.
They were a seventies band.
Yes I remember them now.
I don't remember many of their songs but I remember one called Blowing Free.
I remember that one too!!
I heard it on the radio the other day.
I have not heard that one in years
They were a pretty good band.
Yea they were.
