Have you seen Wall-E?
You mean that CGI movie Disney did with the blocky looking robot who loves old musicals?
Yes, that's the movie! Have you seen it?
No, I haven't.
But if you haven't seen it, how do you know so much about it?
I watched a few trailers for the movie. It looks interesting, especially that other robot -- the rounded white one that floats around.
Oh, you must be talking about EVE. Yes, she's amazing as well!
So, you obviously liked it a lot, I'm assuming.
Yes. You would never guess that robots could be so expressive and emotionally endearing as characters.
Well, I definitely need to go see it now.
