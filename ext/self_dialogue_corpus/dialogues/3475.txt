Are you into horror movies?
I always liked the Amittyville movies.
Oh, that stuff was creepy.
Do you know that it was based on a true story?
Based is a tricky word though.  I mean, how much really happened.
I guess.  It still was scary though.
Oh, I'm not debating that.
It was really scary for its time.
What do you think about the remake?
It wasn't as bad as I was dreading.
