Did you see Mulan?
Yeah
It was cute, and a great theme
I can't believe they wouldn't let the woman fight
It was funny when she was taking a bath ad she had to not let them see she was a woman
It would be hard to conceal that
There are some jobs they don't let women do in the army
I wouldn't think people would fight unless they had to
They might want to stop an enemy
Either way, it was well written
