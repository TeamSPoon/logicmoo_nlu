Did you see Cars 3 yet?
No I haven't. I really wanted to though.
It is actually really great. It helps wrap everything up.
That sounds like it would be great. What is it about?
It is about Mc Queen and how he is becoming an old racer.
Oh that is kind of different. Does he win?
You will have to watch the movie to find out!
Oh ok. Thanks for not ruining the movie for me.
No problem. I had somebody do that to me with the movie, Logan.
Yeah I heard that people were going around spoiling that movie for everyone.
I know. I tried to see it is as fast as I could, but it still was spoiled before I had seen it.
That happened to me with The Sixth Sense.
Oh wow! What happened?
As I was walking in to the theater, somebody said the ending to one of their friends.
Oh that is the absolute worst. Did you say anything to him?
You better believe it! I told him that was incredily rude!
Good! Some people need to be told that some times!
It ruined the movie for me, but in the end the movie was ok at best.
I agree. The twist was really the only good part about it.
I think so too. It wasn't as good as everyone thought it was.
