Do you play any instruments?
Yes. I play the violin.
That's cool. I play the piano.
I started playing the violin at age seven. What age did you start playing the piano at?
I started at the beginning of high school so probably like fourteen or fifteen.
What's your favorite song to play?
"William Tell Overture" by Rossini.
I love that song!! It's so happy-sounding.
What's your favorite song to play on the piano?
"River Flows in You." It's quite difficult, I've been trying to learn it for quite some time.
What is so challenging about that piece?
It involves a lot of quick fingering and involves a wide range of notes.
Oh those songs are the hardest to learn but they're so fun to play once you master them.
I have to agree! There's nothing better than nailing a really hard piece of music.
Have you performed in any concerts?
Only a couple at my local church.
That's neat. I've never played during mass before.
Have you ever performed anywhere?
I've performed at a couple of weddings but not ones in churches.
That's cool. I bet you made a lot of money.
