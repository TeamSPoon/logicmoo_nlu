When does the new season start?
In early September.
What is your favorite team?
I don't really have a favorite team.  What about you?
The Steelers.
Do you think they will be good this year.
I do, the roster looks good again, so I'm hopeful.
That's cool.  I'm excited to see how some of the rookies play this year.
Yeah, normally rookies don't have a huge impact.  But last year Dallas had 2 rookies that had huge seasons.
You mean Elliot and Sheppard?
Yes.  I don't remember two rookies on a team having a bigger impact.
I don't either.
Do you watch much of preseason?
I usually don't.
Yeah, I only watch some of the Hall of fame game most years.
I've seen that before.  I do watch a lot of highlights on ESPN during that time.
I do that too, or read on Apple news.
That's a good idea, I could add a lot of sports to that app.
Do you go to games in person often?  I don't, but I'm not close to one.
I've been before, but I don't go often.
