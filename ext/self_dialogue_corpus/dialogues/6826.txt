I really enjoyed the original avengers movie.
Having all of my favorite superheros in one movie was epic.
I still need to see the sequel.
Me too, its on my movie list.
I think iron man is my favorite.
I really like Captain America more.
The action is so well done.
Yes, and the actors really make the story believable.
The story writing and how they all found each other in the 1st film was well done.
I'm not sure if I could ever be an Avenger.
