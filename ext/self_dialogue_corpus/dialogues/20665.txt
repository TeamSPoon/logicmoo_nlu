What type of movie do you like most.
I like those filled with twists and turns.
Have you seen any of the Hitchcock movies?
Yes, I know I saw the Birds.
What did you think of that movie.
I felt it had it's moments of suspense.
Did you think the female star was going to get hit by a gull while crossing over the water.
Not at first but, after realizing the title of the movie, it did not surprise me.
Did you see the movie the Martian?
Yes I did. I liked it and was anxious to see if he got back home.
Have you seen anything recently that you enjoyed?
Yes, I really enjoyed Hidden Figures.
I did n't see that what is it about.
It is a story of the United States early space program and three ladies that were heavly involved.
Who was the male star?
Kevin Costner and he did an excellent job.
I think I heard the ladies were black and we initially discriminated against.
Yes, and the main lady character was the one responsible for figuring out the exact recovery angle that was need to bring the astronauts home safely.
Sounds like the three of them were pretty special.
They were and our space program may never have been success without the black female math wis.
