I can't wait for the start of the season!
Tell me about it, it feels so long since I've watched football.
Who are you rooting for?
I like the Baltimore Ravens
That's cool do you think they'll win it all this year?
I hope so, but I'm not sure.
What gives you doubts?
We seem to be in the rebuilding process and I'm not sure we're ready to take the prize, but I'm hopeful.
I am personally looking for the Eagles to do good things this year.
What makes you think that'll happen?
It looks like they finally got Wentz some receivers he can utilize.
I think it's going to take longer for them to gel.
I hope not. Wentz certainly has the talent.
I agree, but it's only his second year in the league.
I know, but there have been junior players that have lead teams to greatness in no time.
You're right, I'm just not certain they can make it happen.
Why do you say that?
It takes more than a QB and receivers to make things happen.
I agree our defensive and offensive lines could use some work.
I agree, but I hope your Eagles do well. I'd like to see my Ravens play them in the Super Bowl.
