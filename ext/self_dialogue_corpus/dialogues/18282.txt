Music has come a long way in the last 20 years.
Why do you say that?
It seems like there are so many different genres now.
I see what you mean.
Yeah like wasn't it just rock and country until a few years ago?
Well I think when disco came on the scene it spurred a movement.
Yeah that when punk, metal, and all those started popping up.
Now there are more genres and a wider variety to choose from.
Sometimes it's hard to know what to choose.
I tend to go for the trendy artists like Katy Perry and Lady GaGa
Not me.  I like the under rated artists.
Like who?
Well I love Lana Delrey, and you don't really hear alot from her.
Florence and the Machine are great too, and you don't hear much from them either.
It seems like the artists they play on the radio are the same ones over and over.
Yes it does. Unless you are listening to alternative.
I am a subscriber to sirius xm and the channels i listen to have a tendency to play the same artists all the time.
Yes i had it but got rid of it for that very reason.
Can't justify paying that kind of money for just a few songs.
That's true.  Cheaper to pay 10 for google play and make your own lists.
