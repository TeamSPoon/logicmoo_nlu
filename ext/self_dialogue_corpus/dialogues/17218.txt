I feel like writing a letter to Metallica.
Um, why would you do that?
Their music is really starting to bug me.
How so?
Well the thing is I actually think they're really good but I don't like any of their songs.
That's a little confusing. Why's that?
The vocals are excellent, and so is the band but the way they write songs is seriously annoying.
Ok, what's annoying about it?
They have really cool songs like Nothing Else Matters which is classic and haunting and awesome, but then they write things with three tempo changes which are a year long!
Well now you're exaggerating a bit.
Ok they're 9 minutes long but that's long enough to be two songs, and since they're changing between two tempos they basically are writing two songs!
And you have a problem with that?
Just write two songs, separate songs, that I can listen to one at a time without it taking so long!
I can see you're pretty worked up about this.
It just really bugs me when a good band gets all artsy and ruins the enjoyment of listening to their music.
But they're writing it. I'm sure they're writing it the way they want it to be.
Maybe but it's long and gets boring and then I turn it off.
Right, but they're being artistic which as artists is kind of what they're supposed to do isn't it?
I guess. I just don't like their art maybe.
There are plenty of other good metal bands out there.
