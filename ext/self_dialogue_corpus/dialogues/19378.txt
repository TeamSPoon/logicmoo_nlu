Music these days is not what it used to be.
I agree! Most of what i hear on the radio is rap and hip-hop.
Drake, Wiz , Lil' Wayne, Rick Ross, Future seem to dominate the airwaves.
I have to admit that I like alot of hip-hop. Alot of the music is pretty good and has a catchy beat!
Music???? All the rap artists do these days is take old songs from the 70's and 80's, add a heavier bass line, and profane lyrics.
C'mon.....really? You gotta give the rappers some type of credit.
Credit for what??? Most of these rappers have no creativity musically. How hard is it to take someone else's music and add your own lyrics.
If it was that simple, everyone would be rappers making millions of dollars.
Who are some of your favorite rappers?
I like Drake, Lil' Wayne, Rick Ross, Jay Z, and a bunch of other rappers.
OK. Let's take Drake for instance. If you by one of his CD's, look at the linear notes and read the fine print for each of his songs.
O.K.???? What will I find?
You will find that for alot of his songs, Drake has used samples from old songs in his music.
I never really paid attention to that. Sometimes I do recognize music that a rapper may use in their song.
Earth Wind and Fire, and the Isley Brothers are two of the most sampled groups when it comes to hip-hop music.
That's interestering! I just thought that alot of the rappers created the music and wrote the lyrics.
Don't get me wrong, even though I'm not a rap fan, I don't totally dislike all rap music. I'm just an old school guy who remembers when musical artists created the music and wrote the lyrics.
I can see how alot of people may dislike rap, because of the appearance that rappers are "borrowing" other artists music and making tons of money.
How would you feel if I took something you created, changed somthing small about the creation, then passed it off as my own work?
I would be upset........VERY UPSET.
