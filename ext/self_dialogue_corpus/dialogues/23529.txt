Does Kevin Hart do to many films?
I think he keeps making the same kind of film.
Hes even been in a bunch of animated flicks to.
Yeah hes over exerting himself.
Comedians have short shelf lives in Hollywood
So I guess hes thinking get in it while you can.
Yeah try to make as many films as possible and see what spurns sequels.
Nothing that he has done so far is sequel worthy in my opinion.
I dont know if thats true.
Maybe the Secret Life of Pets.
I dont like cartoons but that was a good movie.
I think it was well written.
Its tough to do want to keep doing those films.
Not true look at Despicable Me.
Yeah they do turn into franchises sometimes.
As long as you get good actors into them you should be good.
Boss Baby was terrible though.
I dont know how much a leading man Alec Baldwin is.
He certainly has pigeon holed himself into comedy
Yes that developed the last 10 years.
