I like the Green Bay Packers
Why do you like that team
My husband likes that team and I follow the team with him
Have you ever been to a game
We have been to Lambeau Field 2 times
That sounds like a lot of fun but cold
The first game was freezing but we were prepared. We wore feet warmers and heavy gear
Good thinking. I would love to go to a game
It is well worth the time and expense. It is a great experience
I think I will look into it
Its always good to go with a group of friends
I have a group of friends that like the same team so that should be no problem
I would recommend paying extra for parking near the field
Thanks for telling me that. I would never have thought of that
You might have to get a hotel room about a half hour  away. Appleton is a good place.
wow that is good advice
You should also give yourself time to visit all the fun things in the area
Sounds like an extra day or 2 would be worth it
I hope you have a great time
Thanks I will tell you all about it
