Did you know Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the Beatles?
I thought it was Let it Be
Let it Be came out last but was recorded before Abbey Road
Wow you learn somethign everyday
So with that what song did you like the most
I thought Come Together was awesome
Yeah it was great but mine is Here Comes the Sun
I believe George wrote that right
Yeah it was one of the few he did pen himself.
Thats crazy the songs he did write were all great.
