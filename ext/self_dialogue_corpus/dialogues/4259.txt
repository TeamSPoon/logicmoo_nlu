Do you prefer older or newer thriller films?
I love the older ones.
Oh yeah, what's your favorite.
Psycho of course. It's a classic.
I totally get that; it's so well done.
Yeah, and who doesn't like Hitchcock films?
Exactly. Did you ever notice that there is no music at the beginning of Psycho's shower scene?
No, you're kidding!
I'm not! It's totally quiet and then once the killing starts, the music starts.
Oh wow, now I have to rewatch the film so I can catch that.
