I want to see someone make a movie that continues the lord of the rings lore
How so?
Like you know include the other stuff
Like what
Like the silmarillion and stuff
That would be hard
But if you got the right director
True that makes sense
Who do you think could pull it off
Michael bay
You are joking right
Maybe
I would hope so
I am pulling your leg
You had me for a minute their
I could not imagine him doing it
It would be horrible
No more than that
Atrocious?
Oh most certainly
