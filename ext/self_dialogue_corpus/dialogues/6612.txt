I just watched Moana for the first time. Have you seen it?
No, I missed it in the movies and haven't seen it on Netflix yet.
You're missing out! You should totally watch it.
That's what I've heard.  What did you love about it?
It was so cute and funny!  My favorite song was "You're welcome"?
I've heard that song, I didn't realize it was from Moana!
Yeah!  It really has some great songs in it!
Excellent!  Did it have a good side-kick?
Yes!  Hey-Hey the chicken!  I don't want to give it all away, so you should see it!
Ok, I will!
