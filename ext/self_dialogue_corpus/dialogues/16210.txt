Are you excited to see Tristan und Isolde next week?
We're really going to that?
Yeah, you said you love opera.
No, I didn't. I hate opera.
Why would you say that?
I was either being ironic or trying to impress a girl who likes it.
Oh...I thought this was a date for us.
Sorry.
Why don't you like opera?
It's not that I don't like opera, it's that Tristan und Isolde drives me crazy.
Why?
Well, this is in Wagner's particular style of endless melody.
Why is that bad? It's creative!
Nothing repeats, ever. If you try to hum a tune when you get out, you'll only remember the last thing you heard.
But, doesn't it prove he's a great artist?
Yes. But the style is a mental and emotional drain.
I wonder how the performers memorize it.
I have no idea! I've always wondered how they can rehearse it.
Well, I'll keep a positive outlook.
Good luck! Sorry about the date.
