Do you like indie rock?
Yeah, it's such a broad category though. What do you like?
Bad Books, Young the Giant, that kind of stuff.
Oh I love Bad Books! Have you heard Manchester Orchestra?
No I haven't, I know it's the same guy, though.
It's great. Do you like fun.?
Yes, I really liked their first band The Format though.
I haven't heard of them. What would you recommend?
They only had a few albums, so I'd recommend all of them. Quite similar to fun. but more indie.
I'll check them out - I love Nate Ruess' vocals.
