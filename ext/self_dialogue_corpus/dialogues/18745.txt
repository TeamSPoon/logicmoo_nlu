Do you listen to foreign music?
No, not so much.
Why not?
I can not understand foreign languages as I do not speak foreign languages.
What about artists that collaborate with spanish singers?
I must say I do like the instrumental in spanish songs.
Have you heard the song that Justin Beiber did that is spanish?
Yes, Despecito right?
Yes, that song.
I do like that, although I do not understand what they are saying.
Same here, but like you, I like the instrumental part of it.
The guitar playing in spanish songs is so beautiful.
I love the way the guitar is played also.
What about you, do you listen to foreign music?
I have been known to listen to some, because I like the way it sounds.
Have you tried to learn what they songs mean that you like?
No, I have not gone that far to learn the words.
It would be hard to try and sing along with in a foreign language.
It does not stop me though, you should really listen to some.
I think I may, I might like some songs!
