My favorite STAR WARS character is Luke Skywalker.
I think he was in the first 3 movies and maybe more.
He was kind of like a farm boy.
Yes. Like someone from a small town.
He wanted to get away from where he was living.
Yes. But they needed him at home.
His land speeder was cool.
It was like a hot rod.
It went quick.
I wonder how fast it went.
