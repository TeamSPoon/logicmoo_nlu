Hey are you going to watch much football this upcoming NFL season?
Yes, my favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys
Yeah, they are a great team with good young talent
Yeah, Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott are definite offensive stars
I think the Cowboys have a good shot of winning the NFC East and making a Superbowl
Yeah, the NFC East is weak outside of the Cowboys
Who do you think will win the AFC this season?
I expect the New England Patriots will win it again this year
Yeah, they are definite contenders but Tom Brady is getting older
Brady may be getting older but the team around him is still elite
You are right, Rob Gronkowski will be back and hopefully remain healthy for a whole season
With Gronkowski being healthy, I cannot see the Patriot's offense being stopped
You are right, teams would have to put the majority of the focus on him which would open up other receivers
Yeah, the best chance defenses would have would be to rush Brady so that he does not have much time to throw at all
A good pass rushing defense that could challenge is the Houston Texans
Yeah, JJ Watt gets a lot of sacks and tipped passes
Hopefully JJ Watt recovers from last year's injury and is back to his elite form
Even if he isn't, the Texans also have Jadeveon Clowney who can also get sacks
Yeah, I remember when Jedeveon Clowney was picked number one overall
He is a definite game changer and defensive force
