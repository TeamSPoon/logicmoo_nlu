I just watched Mulan for the first time since I was a kid.
Mulan is one of the best Disney movies of all time.
Yes! I'll make a man out of you is THE best song out of any Disney movie.
I agree. It gets me pumped up every time I listen to it.
I just checked and it has like 80 million views on Youtube.
Mushu was hilarious in that movie.
He definitely added some humor to it.
Did you hear that they're making a live action?
I did, but I didn't hear too many details.
Yeah, they only recently announced it.
Do you think it'll be good.
I don't know. Not sure how I feel about a live action remake of a classic Disney animation.
Yeah, I'm not sure either.
I just looked it up. They're not planning on having any songs...
What? You can't have a Mulan movie without the songs.
Yeah, there seems to be a ton of backlash from fans.
All Disney movies have songs! Especially Mulan.
They better change that or I bet it'll flop at the box office.
I definitely won't see it if thats the case.
Same here.
