Are you ready for some football?
Heck yes! NFL Season is less than 2 months away.
I know I finally get my Sunday's and Monday Nights back.
Word! I feel like season has been over forever.
It really does, NBA, NHL, MLB season have been boring. Need some NFL
Amen brother, plus a little Fantasy Football.
Just hearing those words gets me excited.
I know I won my league last year, but the Falcons for me came up short.
That was a heart breaking law in the Super Bowl.
Yep, team played not to lose, rather than go for the win.
Do you think Atlanta will have another magical season?
As long as Matty Ice, and Julio are healthy we should be fine.
They both should be fine this. That offense is amazing. Just need the defense to step up.
Yep, hopefully they learn from their mistakes.
Well my philosphy has always been, anybody but the Cowboys.
Not a fan either, as I can't stand Jerry Jones.
I have just never been a fan of them because of the self proclaimed "America's" team.
I hear ya there, as the Steelers are more American then them.
Exactly, as they have the lunch pale type attitude/blue collar America represents.
Regardless, lets go Falcons!! Super Bowl or bust!
