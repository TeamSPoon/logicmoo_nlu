What is your favorite movie them of all time?
Oh that is difficult. I cannot think of one that I prefer the most.
Well if push came to shove I would say the theme from Gone With the Wind.
Oh yes, I can see that. It is classic and definitely catchy.
Yes, it has spanned almost a century time.
Almost. Not quite there yet though.
Ok so can you think of one.
Probably Star Wars.
Oh sure. Absolutely agree on that. The trumpets!
Yes, that music is so distinct and you can feel it in your soul.
And you thought you didn't have a favorite movie tune.
I guess I did. I really love the Star Wars theme.
Who wrote it? I can't remember.
John Williams. He wrote many movie themes.
That's right. Talented man.
Sure from the main theme to Darth Vadar's music he captured all the emotions of the film.
The music for Darth Vadar always scared me a little bit.
Yes that music is a bit foreboding.
You know something bad is going to happen when it starts up.
Yes, you are right. It depicts his personality perfectly.
