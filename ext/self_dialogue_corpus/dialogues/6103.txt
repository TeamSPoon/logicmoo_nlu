Which muses in Hercules was your favorite?
I am not sure wh the Muses were.
There were five, Calliopy, Clio, Thalia, Terpsichore and Melpomene. They were the muses of poetry, history, comedy, dance and tragedy.
I liked the shorter, fluffier one. She was spicy in personality.
That was Thalia, the muse of history.
Yes, that is the one. She was a mischievous one.
I think I liked Terpsichore the best. She taught Hercules to dance.
I bet that was a tough job!
Imagine if he stepped on your toes.
He would break them.
