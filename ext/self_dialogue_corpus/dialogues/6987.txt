Who is your favorite actor in Toy Story?
I liked Tim Allen a lot.
Really? You didn't like Tom Hanks?
I liked him too. But, Tim Allen was my favorite.
He did have a good voice.
Don Rickles was great as Mr. Potato Head.
It's too bad he will not be in part 4.
Yeah, but part 1 will always be the best and he is in that.
There are some really great voice actors in those films.
Yes, it is a great talent to be able to voice a character.
