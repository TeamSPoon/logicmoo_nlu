You listen to any good music lately?
Yeah, I go through phases where I listen to a bunch of one kind of music all the time for a couple months or so.
So what is it now?
Mainly Haggard.
Never heard of them.
Oh, well do you like neo-medeival music?
I... don't really know what that is.
Oh. It's like medeival music redone in a fresh way.
Well I probably would like it.
Haggard is my favourite in the genre.
We should listen to them together!
Definitely. If you like metal, or if you like classical music, or both, you'd probably find at least some of their stuff enjoyable.
Do they have any particular song that's really good?
To me personally, maybe Per Aspera Ad Astra.
Sounds olde.
It really is a modern sound though.
I'll take your word for it.
It's striking how something can sound both so old and new at the same time.
Well that is rather intriguing.
I'll write down the name for you so you remember to listen to it.
