Did you see the match between the Blues and the Preds?
Yeah.
I was so bummed
Me too.
I thought we had a chance to come back.
I did too, but the Predators just wanted it so badly.
Yeah, but coming back from a 3-1 to make it 3-2.
Yeah I hear you.
Pietrangelo just looked off in my opinion
I agree.
I wouldn't be surprised if he has an injury or something that he was playing throug.
And Tarasenko is kind of spotty as well.
It was frustrating, but I was really hoping to pull it off
I would have loved to see the bLues win the Stanley cup
I think it's funny that everyone talks about how disappointed they are
Yeah, considering the blues have made it to the playoffs the past few years.
Exactly.  I would like to see the blues win as well, but I just love that they come to the playoffs so often.
Maybe next year is the year.
Who knows.  IT was a great season regardless.
I agree.
