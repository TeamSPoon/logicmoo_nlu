What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
Definitely the Empire Strikes Back.
Oh, why's that?
I loved the twists and turns. My favorite scene was when Han saw Vader and was about to shoot.
That's definitely a great moment. My favorite would have to be the original Star Wars though.
It's a classic; you can't go wrong.
The storyline is so well done. Plus, I loved "Ben" Kenobi. He's my favorite.
Ah, if I had to pick I would go for the Han/Chewbacca duo.
They have an amazing rapport, that's for sure. Poor Chewie, he never got his medal.
We can only hope someone gave it to him later!
