Did you ever see the movie BFG? It's a Disney movie.
Yes! Oh my gosh, I absolutely loved it!
Really? I haven't had the chance to see it yet. What did you enjoy about it?
I loved how BFG, which stands for Big Friendly Giant, by the way, would sneak through town without being seen by anyone.
What's so great about that? I don't understand.
Well he was huge, for starters. Taller than most buildings.
How did he avoid being seen then? I'm trying to picture it.
He would kind of morph into some of the things he would be standing by or be near. A lamp post, for example.
Oh how cool! Now I'm curious to see it.
You really should! It was a really fun movie and it had a great storyline.
