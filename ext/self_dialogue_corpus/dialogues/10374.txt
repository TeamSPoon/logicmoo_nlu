How's your day going?
Not too bad. Just grabbing a bite before I have to go back.
Work huh?
Yup.
Sorry to hear it!
Me too!
Did you see that movie on TNT last night.
No. What was on?
V for Vendetta.
That was a pretty wierd flick.
I liked it.
Who was in it?
I don't know most of them, but Hugo Weaving.
Who's that?
The bad guy from the Matrix.
Oh, yeah! He's pretty good.
"Mr. Anderson..."
Ha!
You should give the movie another shot.
I think I will!
