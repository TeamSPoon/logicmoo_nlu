Have you seen the preview for the new It.
I have. Uber creepy.
I think they top ol Tim Curry.
Yeah, but the first one wasn't all that scary.
True. I actually watched that on Holloween in a cemetary!
How'd you pull that off?
My cousin was renting a place that happened to be smack dab in a cemetary.
Crazy! Did you get scared?
No. That's my point. The new one looks way freakier.
I'll have to agree with you there.
