Did you see the live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?
Oh yes, it was horrid.
The Disney version has always been a childhood favorite of mine, but they totally butchered the new version.
I had always imagined a real-life version of Belle would be someone with sweet, gentle features. I don't know, Emma Watson's pretty, but she's not what I had in mind.
Agreed, plus her acting just made me cringe.
Nothing beats the Disney version.
What did you think of the cinematography?
Some of the casting members might have been poor choice, but the scenery was absolutely stunning.
Yeah, the director did a nice job there. It reminded me of the French version of the movie.
If I were to compare the two, I'd go with the French version.
