Do you remember the scene in Lilo and Stitch, where Lilo made a sour jar?
The one where she stuffed all three of her friends in the pickle jar?
That's the one. Did you notice the title on the book beside her?
I think it was Voodoo for Beginners.
What's hilarious is that her friends all have these nice little dolls, and hers is a Voodoo Doll!
I liked it when she said "My friends need to be punished", and in the jar they went.
Lilo and Nonnie are all sorts of messed up, yet they have such a typical sister bond.
I really like how that one was done.
Me too. It shows that not all kids have a perfect childhood.
Also shows the coping skills they can acquire. I think this is the only Disney movie that shows how the parents die.
