Every time I hear "You'll be In My Heart" I throw up a little.
That's gross. Why?
Not literally, silly.
Yes, I know, you're Mr. Metaphor. So why does it bother you?
It won the Oscar for best original song.
So? That means it's good!
But, it wasn't deserved. It's boring and generic beyond belief.
I can believe it.
Of course you would.
So, who should have won?
"Blame Canada" by Matt and Trey from South park.
Really?
Yeah, they were nominated and it's far more original.
But it's such a short song.
Short and sweet.
Why do you like it so much? I know you love South Park but there's gotta be more.
It's just super well-done. I bet they loved it and didn't want to look bad by giving a song with curse words an award
Plus they probably find it immature.
It's just...Phil Collins and his music are so boring.
I can see that, but it's still nice to listen to, and the song works in the context.
