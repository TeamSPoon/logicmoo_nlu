What is your favorite Hitchcock movie?
The Birds
I love that one
Me too. Did you know there was no music in it?
I had no idea
It was so scary. I had no idea why the birds did that.
I like how they left it a mystery.
Hitchcock does that in all of his films.
What is your favorite part of The Birds?
I like every scene equally. They are all great.
