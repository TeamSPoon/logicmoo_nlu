Hey man, are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Of course! I can't wait!
What's your favorite team?
I'm a Saints fan, how about you?
Uh oh! I'm a Falcons fan, haha. Sorry about the beatdown we put on you guys last year.
Ha! Good one! We'll se if that happens again now that we have Adrian Peterson.
Yeah, AP is pretty good. At least he used to be before that ACL injury.
I thought he recovered quite well from that injury, actually.
Well, in any case, I wish him the best for you guys next year.
Thanks man! Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure, what's up buddy.
How in the world did your Falcons blow a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl?
We don't like to talk about that anymore haha.
I can see why. I guess Tom Brady and the Patriots were just too great.
They really were! The Patriots have been so good for so long, we knew it would be hard keeping them down.
That's for sure. I really enjoyed that Super Bowl though, both teams played well.
True. I was really enjoying the game right until the 4th quarter.
Hahaha, maybe you'll get them next year.
Yeah hopefully, as long as we have NFL MVP Matt Ryan on our team, you can't count us out!
Yeah, but you're going to have to beat my Saints first!
