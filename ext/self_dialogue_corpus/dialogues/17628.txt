When someone approaches you with their mixed tape how do you feel?
You mean their amatuer music?
Yeah.
I haven't had it happen to me in years but when it did happen to me I felt pretty bad for them.
How come? DId you turn them down or tell them something mean?
No not at all.
Then why did you feel bad for them?
Well Ifelt guilty because I had zero interest in their music or listening to it.
That's not really something to feel bad about in my opinion.
Well I look at it this way. I put myself in the other person's shoes and I'd hate to be ignored without being given a chance.
Yeah I guess you can empathize with them but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to get rejected.
What makes you say that?
Well they aren't really advertising to specific people. They are just asking people at random to listen to their stuff.
Yeah so what?
They could be asking someone who has zero interest in their music taste. So they have no choice but to be rejected.
Yeah I understand you now. That actaully makes me feel better about turning that down.
I mean we turn down professional musicians too if you think about it.
We do?
Yeah, I know you don't like Lady Gaga and I've tried getting you to listen to her before and you've turned down her music.
Yeah thats true.
