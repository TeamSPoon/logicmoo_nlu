Have you seen the movie, Babadook?
No, I don't think I've ever heard of it. What is it about?
It's an Australian horror movie. It came out in 2014.
Oh interesting, not too many of those.
It is about a child's imaginary friend that turns into a stalker.
That sounds pretty scary.
It is accompanied with this pop-up book that is super creepy.
Creepy how?
It has images of the Babadook, and ends with the mother killing the dog and the boy.
Yikes, that does sound creepy. How do people even come up with stuff like that?
Apparently the writer heard that her friend's son had a similar story.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Do you mind if I tell you some spoilers?
No, go for it. Honestly I don't plan on seeing it, I don't like horror films.
Well there is the big climax where the babadook keeps getting more and more visceral.
what do you mean by Visceral?
I mean like, he keeps escalating his actions, the mother's fear of the Babadook becomes more and more apparent.
Did the director leave any clues that the mother is losing her mind, or is the Babadook real?
Oh man, the mother keeps flinching and grabbing her jaw like she has a severe tooth ache.
So like she just has an infected tooth and its just rotting her brain?
