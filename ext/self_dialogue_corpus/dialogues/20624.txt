Did you hear they're making another Jurassic Park movie?
No.  Are they really?
Yeah, It's going to be called Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom.
I can't believe they're still making these movies.
I know!  I really liked Jurassic World.
Me too, I think anything with Chris Pratt is great.
I like him too, but I still think the original Jurassic Park is the best.
You always say stuff like that, always nostalgic for old stuff.
Well, it was my favorite movie growing up, what do you want from me?
Jurassic World was way better, and you know that.
It goes Jurassic Park, The lost world, Jurassic World, then Jurassic Park 3.
I disagree.  I think it's Jurassic World, the lost world, Jurassic Park, and then Jurassic Park 3.
Agree to disagree. I'm excited for the new one though, I think it'll be good.
I know nothing about it, but just looked it up, and they already have a 6th movie planned.
Really?  That just got me super excited.
Right?  Regardless of the order we put them in, at least we can agree that we're happy they're still making it.
Yeah, can't argue that.
Did you want to go see the new one together when it comes out?
Sure, when does it come out?
It's scheduled for June 2018, so we'll see.
