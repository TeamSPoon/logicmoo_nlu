How many movies have you seen in theaters in the last year?
Maybe two, three.
That's it?
I don't like movie theaters. Much prefer DVD or streaming.
Why? Movies are so much better on the big screen.
I've got a big screen at home and no crowds.
The crowds are part of the experience. The ooh'ing and the ahh'ing with each twist and turn.
The popcorn-covered floors. The woman with the big hat sitting right in front of me. Her six foot three date, sitting right in front of my wife.
It isn't that bad!
And then there's the tickets. Twelve dollars a pop. And don't even get me started if the movie needs to be seen in 3D or Imax.
Don't tell me you hate Imax.
No, of course not. IMAX is great. I love watching movies in IMAX. I just don't like waiting in line only to pay twenty dollars a piece for a ticket.
But, to be surrounded by the movie.
Is great! But isn't worth twenty dollars.
Geez, isn't there anything you like about movies.
I love movies. My wife and I have a huge collection of movies at home.
But you never go to theaters?
Very rarely. Why bother?
LIke I said, for the experience.
Pay twenty bucks for dirty floors, uncomfortable seats and so some stranger can spoil it for me. No thanks.
