Guess what I saw last night at the theater!
What was it? Did you go see Wonder Woman?
Not just Wonder Woman, but Wonder Woman in IMAX.
Dear mother of god, that's amazing.
Yes, it was two hours of...amazing.
Was the movie good too?
The movie was amazing - it was a really cool origin story.
Oh yeah? Do you think they will make more movies?
Yeah I bet they will, the first movie ends sort of at the end of World War I, so there's plenty of space for Wonder Woman.
This is good news, my friend.
