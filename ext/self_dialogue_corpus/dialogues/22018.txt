I'm really excited for the Death Note movie!
The one that's coming to Netflix, right?
Yeah, that's the one! They haven't shown much but I think it looks great.
Good for you, but I'd be cautious.
What's wrong with being excited?
Look at other anime adaptions. Like Avatar for example was terrible.
That was based on a cartoon actually.
Fine then, take Dragon Ball Evolution. That was awful.
I actually don't think it was that bad. It's better if you view it as a martial arts comedy than an anime film.
But you admit as an adaption it's no good?
Sure, it's not a great adaption, but it did pair up Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum for the first time. The two later went on to work on Shameless together, so I give the film credit for that.
Alright, so the casting director realized they had good chemistry, big deal.
See? If nothing else, there's a good chance the Death Note film cast will have good chemistry.
Good chemistry will mean nothing if the adaption is poor.
I don't know, I actually hope the movie will go in its own unique direction.
Huh? What's the point in that?
Well, the story has been adapted about five or six times already. I think it's time for something new.
Ghost in the Shell tried to do something different, and people hated it.
A lot of people actually liked it. I think just came out at a bad time.
Maybe. I just hope for your sake that the Death Note movie is good.
