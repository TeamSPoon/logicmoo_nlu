Got your fantasy team set up?
Not yet. I will be doing such soon. I am stilled baffled that the season's almost here.
What is the one thing you are most looking to find out this season.
I really want to see what happens with the Seahawks overall.
They have had some serious controversy huh?
Yeah it seems like every season some report about their locker room comes out.
What happened before this recent report again?
They said that Wilson didn't have the support of the locker room.
How could you not support someone like him?
I don't know. The guy plays his heart out despite being like 5'10" max.
He puts it all on the field regardless if he is injured or his line is porous.
I can't agree with that. Now we have reports about Sherman.
Weren't they actually actively trying to trade him?
I think the Seahawks admitted to dangling him.
You don't find a lot of great corners. You can't just give one out or attempt to.
He didn't have as good of a season last year, but the guy can still play at a high level.
Yeah. The team definitely showed that they are completely ripe for the pickings when Earl Thomas is out.
Yeah. Shows that Sherman isn't the best on his team, but he's still great.
They have a tendency to start slow too, so a record below .500 early in could definitely stir some things up.
Yeah I know. It's going to be interesting to observe.
