What happened during the Rams and Patriots game last night?
Oh, the Patriots won the game.
Did you catch the final score?
Yes, the Patriots had 26 points while the Rams only got 10 points.
Well, I'm not too surprised by the score.
Yea, the Rams appeared to be scared during the first half.
Why do you say that?
Because they didn't score any points at all.
Wow, not even a field goal?
Nope, they could barely move the ball down the field.
How many yards did the Rams get from running the football?
A whole 36 yards.
That's sad. Did they do better with receiving?
Somewhat, they had 161 receiving yards.
How many yards did Brady pass for on the Patriots?
Brady had 269 passing yards.
How did the Patriots do in running the football?
They did much better than the Rams with 133 yards.
Oh, I see. Later on, I'll check the highlights on the internet.
Yeah, you can but you didn't miss anything important.
