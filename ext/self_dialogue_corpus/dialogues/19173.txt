I don't get it.
What about?
I was TRYING to find a recording of Carl Orff's "Musika Poetica", and it barely exists.
Where did you hear that music? You said it was in some movie you saw years ago.
I heard it in the movie, "Badlands" with Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen. I think 1973 or so.
Oh, Carl Orff. Wasn't he the composer of "Carmina Burana"?
Yes, performed first in 1937 or so. THAT music you can hear everywhere.
It's that grim chorus you've heard a hundred times in commercials, video games, movies. It's embarrassing.
Amen. But you can't find "Musika Poetica", a really short, famous piece that you'd think would be widely available.
That's that really short, Caribbean-sounding drum and Xylophone thing, like a marching song?
Yes, Carl Orff wrote hundreds of pieces for music students to play.
Like William Gillock did for piano music.
Oh, I'm not familiar with that. I'll have to look that up.
"Carmina Burana" was based on a 13th century poem, I think it was called "O Fortuna".
Well, it's pretty grim sounding to me. And it's EVERYWHERE. I heard a thing about it on NPR radio once.
Oh, yes, right. The rappers Naz and Puff Daddy did versions of it, for gosh sakes.
Heavy metal group Therion did a version of it. There's "Carmina Burana" used in that movie about The Doors.
I remember Ray Manzarek, the keyboardist from The Doors, had an album in 1983, called "Carmina Burana".
It's been used in dozens of commercials, movies, video games, sporting events. It's like Pachelbel's "Canon" in the old days.
Oh, no. Don't remind me of Pachelbel's "Canon"!
