What do you think about the Bills firing Rex Ryan?
I don't think he got a fair shot at the tem.
Well he shouldn't have shot his mouth off on a playoff promise.
Yeah but he only had two seasons.
I agree two seasons is a short time but he has had other problems.
What do you mean?
Well he allowed way too many touchdowns.
His defense was his downfall.
Do you think the Bills will have a better season.
Well I think they might but again, it is a rebuilding process all over again.
How many games do you think they will win?
I say they win the first game and then lose the next two.
But do you think the new coach will allow two consecutive losses?
Well it would be a tough loss but I think they lose the next two by 10.
And the first score.
They will win by only 7.
So one touchdown for the win.
Yes or a field goal.
I think they will win by 21.
They don't have a chance to win the first game by three touchdowns.
