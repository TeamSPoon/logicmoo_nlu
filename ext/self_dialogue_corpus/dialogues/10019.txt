Have you seen any foreign action movies?
I've seen The Raid: Redemption.
Oh, that is a great action movie.
It is the action movie I've always wanted.
Why is that?
I've always wanted an action movie with the most minimal amount of plot in favor of being almost nothing but action sequences.
That makes sense. Usually the plot is nothing special in action movies anyways.
Exactly, and all we want to see are cool action set pieces.
Yeah and that movie has nothing but cool action set pieces.
My personal favorite was the scene where the two brothers are fighting Mad Dog.
