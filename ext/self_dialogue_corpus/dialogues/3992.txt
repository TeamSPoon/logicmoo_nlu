Have you seen American Psycho?
Yea, that's one twisted movie.
No kidding. It makes you feel like anyone could be crazy.
Well, anyone can. Christian Bale was so convincing.
Yea, can't believe that's the same guy that played as batman.
Yea, but he was really good in batman too.
Yea he was, he's such a great actor.
Yea, and he does such weird movies.
Yea, I just hope he doesn't make another American Psycho, that movie scared the crap out of me.
Yea me too, it was hard to trust anybody after that.
