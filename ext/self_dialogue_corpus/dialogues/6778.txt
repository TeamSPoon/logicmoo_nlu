Do you like the cartoon Disney films, or the live action ones?
I like them both. But, the cartoons seem to be the best.
What about the Pixar ones?
I love those too.
If you had to pick, which ones would you go with?
I cannot decide. There are so many underrated live action ones.
Like what?
Fuzzbucket is great.
I've never seen that one.
It's about a boy who has an imaginary friend and then he comes to life!
