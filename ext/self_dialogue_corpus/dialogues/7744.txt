For the longest time, I had an aversion to the Harry Potter movies even though I had not seen one film.
You should watch the series.  They are very well done.
I actually finished up the series last night and I enjoyed it.  All the movies were well done.
Which movie did you like the most?
Probably, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  I enjoyed the series when the characters were younger and more naive about the world.
I am different.  I liked when they were older and the movies were a bit more darker.
Which movie was your favorite?
Probably Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  The dementors were spooky.
The tone of that whole film was very dark to me.  Even the colors used in the film seem to be more muted.
I think there is more at stake in the later films.  That is why I like them.
