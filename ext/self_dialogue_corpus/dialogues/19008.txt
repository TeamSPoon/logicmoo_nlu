Are you still playing the piano?
I just started to study Bill Evans’ jazz style.
I only know about a few jazz musicians. Is he still alive?
No, he died in 1980.
Did he do anything I might have heard?
I’m not sure. You may have noticed one of his songs in the movie “Black Mass” about Whitey Bulger.
The one starring Johnny Depp? Oh, that music sounds like lounge music, the kind of music my parents used to listen to when they were having drinks.
You like some of Miles Davis’ work. Bill Evans worked with Davis.
Miles had so many different styles. When did Evans work with Miles Davis?
Back in 1958 or 1959.
So, it’s probably not Miles’ bebop work. I like bebop.
Well, Bill Evans was more laid back.
How do you go about studying his style?
I'm working on the song, The Two Lonely People" from that movie. I start by practicing the major chords, then I work on the melody.
Did Evans have big bands?
No, he was known for his trios, with a bass and drums.
Do you have any of his stuff I could borrow to give a listen?
I’ll lend you “Sunday at the Village Vanguard.”
Thanks. When can I hear you play?
Give me a while. I'm not very good.
