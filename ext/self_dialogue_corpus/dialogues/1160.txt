Do you think the league has its hand on the domestic violence issue?
Yes I do I think it broke with Ray Rice
Like that was the low point?
I think after that they really buckled down
It still happens though
Yes but not at the rate that it was going at
This is true, what about Hardy?
What about him?
Do you think that really changed the league
I mean he got a year and then came back and was trash
Would he still be good if he was around today?
No I dont think he would be around.
So he was a flash in the pan player?
Yes otherwise we would see success still
Why hasnt anyone signed Rice?
He was a running back so its hard to get jobs even when you dont miss a year
I dont think he was over the hill
He definitely wasnt.  But he plays a tough position
One that is easy to fill as well
He probably learned from his mistakes
