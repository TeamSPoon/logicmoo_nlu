Do you like The Beatles?
Oh, hell yeah!
Dude, me too. They're kind of vintage and cool.
Yeah, they are. What's your favorite song, then?
Octopuses Garden.
Dude, no way. What? That's your favorite song? You have terrible taste.
Alright then, what's your favorite?
Strawberry Fields
A cliche!
I don't care, I love it.
