What are you feeling on lana del rey?
I actually love her. I think she is sexy and cool.
Ya she is pretty sultry and ultra cool. I love her videogames song.
That is a good one along with bluejeans and summertime sadness.
She has such a nice tone and quality to her voice, I wish I could sing like her.
Ya I heard her live and she sounds just as good as on a recording.
Not all singers are capable of live performances that match or even come close.
Agreed. Lady GAGA is someone similar in that she is truly a talent.
She really has the vocal chops. Also so creative. I am always impressed with her.
Me too. though she does have a huge team behind her helping her create a lot of her iconic looks.
Maybe true but she is the only writing most of her songs.
Always more impressive when the singer is also the songwriter.
Does Adele write her own songs?
I would think at least some of them. They seem so personal to her.
I know sia first wrote songs for other artists before making her own album.
I love sia, she is such a talent. And like that she hides her face.
I wonder if it is because her music has a younger sound/appeal. Yet she is pretty old.
I didn't know she was old at all! Maybe that is part of it, smart on her part. Makes me like her even more now.
Well glad I could strengthen your love for Sia, she deserves it!
I am going to go look up her age. Thanks for the information and chat.
