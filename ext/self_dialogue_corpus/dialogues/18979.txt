Do you think listening to music while doing something else makes you more productive?
I must say it helps get tasks done.
This is true, music makes whatever I am doing less boring.
I have to have music on as background noise.
Me too, and I also can't drive without listening to music.
I like to work out listening to music as well, there are some songs that really get my blood pumping.
Do you like listening to harder music when exercising?
Yes, it motivates me more.
I can see how that would work. I like to blast music while doing yardwork.
I can't even shower without listening to music!
Anything in specific you listen to?
Well I do not really listen to the radio, so whatever is playing on my phone usually.
I am the same, radio plays the same songs over and over.
Yes, it gets really old. I have a lot of songs on my phone.
Me too, I never hear the same song in the same day.
I have a wide variety of music as well.
I am glad they made aux cords to listen to music in our vehicles and other stereos.
Yes it makes it so easy. I do not listen to CD's anymore.
Neither do I, although I still have a bunch of CD's from when I was younger.
I bet it will not be long and CD"s will be completely obsolete.
