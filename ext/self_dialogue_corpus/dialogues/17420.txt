Do you like Nirvana's music at all?
Absolutely, they were pretty great back in the day.
It still is great, it really stands the test of time. I'm always in the mood to put on the album Nevermind in my car or anywhere.
Which album of their do you like the best?
I would probably say Insecticide but that doesn't mean that I don't like the others. That one's just my favorite.
I like their last one, In Utero the best I think. Kurt Cobain really matured as a songwriter for that album.
In Utero definitely had the most complex musicianship. It had a much more layered sound to it than their previous stuff.
That was also when they added Pat Smear as a member of the band and second guitarist.
Which song opff of Insecticide to you listen to the most?
It's either the song Dive or Aneurysm. I can't choose so I'll say it's a tie between those two.
My favorite by them is probably the song Lithium.
I don't think Nirvana has any bad songs. Every single thing they released was great.
How long have you been listening to Nirvana?
A long time, over 20 years. I think I appreciate them a lot more now than I did when they were popular.
You didn't like them when they were still around?
I did but at the time they were so popular and overexposed that I got a little tired of seeing them everywhere.
The last album they put out was their MTV Unplugged in New York. What's your opinion on that, do you like it as well as their studio work?
Oh it's perfect. It's sad that was their last released music though so it's a little depressing listening to.
Which song off of MTV Unplugged in New York do you like the most?
Probably it would be All Apologies. I like that album's version better than the version on In Utero.
