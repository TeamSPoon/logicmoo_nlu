So what is the deal with Jacksonville?
What do you mean?
Well, why do they consistantly have bad seasons?
That's a good question.
I mean they have to get good draft picks, why can't they develope them?
Well, sources say Coach Gus Bradley needs to be replaced.
I can believe that.
Also, most of the players ae under 23, hard to develope good players straight out of high school.
HA! That's true.
I also hear Monte Kiffin is comin out of retirement to save the Jags.
Really? he's gotta be on life support.
Probably.
Plus they let a lot of free agents just show up and play.
I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team.
So bad coaching, free agents and when they DO get some good drfts they wind up hurting themselves.
Really?
Yesh, the last passer they acquired got his passing had caught in the garbage disposal!
That's crazy.
Hopefully they will ditch Gus, get some solid players and get out of the 3-13 funk.
Fingers crossed!
