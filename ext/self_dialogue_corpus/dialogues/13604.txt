Hey, so if you had to pick, what do you think is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Wow, that's a tough question! But if I had to pick, it would have to be The Empire Strikes Back.
Oh, good choice! There is so much great stuff in that movie!
I know! Yoda, AT-ATs, Luke and Vader's lightsaber battle...
Oh, for sure. I think my favorite aspect of the movie is the AT-ATs on Hoth. They are just so cool and iconic.
I know exactly what you mean! They really allow the notion of how powerful the Empire real is to hit home.
For sure! And, I mean Yoda too?! He is the best! Maybe one of the best characters in the entire Star Wars Universe!
I couldn't agree more! Frank Oz was just a complete genius!
Oh, totally! You have to wonder if they can ever top Empire!
Well, I'm not sure, but I definitely wouldn't mind them trying!
