Did you listen to Eminem when you were younger.
No I didn't listen to him until my young adult years.
I listened to him a lot growing up.
What was your favorite song as a youngster?
I'm sorry mama.
Why that one?
It hit home with me and was exactly what I was feeling as a child.
Can you ellaborate?
I wanted nothing more than to leave my moms house though at the same time I loved her but I didn't understand her choices as a child.
That makes since.
Do you know he regrets making that song?
Why would he?
He feels like it was a betrayal of sorts towards his mom.
Isn't that how he feels though?
He did but as he matured he realized the reasons and the reality of the situation.
That's a good point.
I believe he made a song apologizing and for her because now they're in a good relationship.
That's so nice of him.
I agree nothing better than a story turned around for the better.
Totally agree.
