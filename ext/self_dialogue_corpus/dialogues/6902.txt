Did you ever see Aladdin?
Yes and I absolutely love that movie.
My kids just say it the other day and have been singing the songs ever since.
I does have a lot of great songs in it.
Jasmine and Aladdin were great in it, but I think the Genie stole the show.
I'd have to agree with you.
Robin Williams did such an awesome job in that part.
I know! I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like he did.
I never saw the sequel, Return of Jafar, but I can't imagine it being that good.
I didn't see it either. I didn't really want to.
