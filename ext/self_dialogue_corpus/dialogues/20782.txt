So, it seems the Transformers movie franchise continues, eh?
Exactly. They've churned out a number of them.
That same actor has been in a couple of the films.
Are you talking about Mark Wahlberg?
That's him. Was there another main actor that did a Transformers movie?
Well, yes. There were three live-action Transformers movies in theatres before Wahlberg.
Oh, wow. I didn't realize there had been that many!
Yep. There has been one every two or three years since 2007.
Who starred in the movies without Mark Wahlberg?
Shia LaBeouf was the main actor for the first three movies.
That rings a bell. Were those movies as good as the more recent ones?
I would say they probably were. They were all Michael Bay films.
Who is Michael Bay?
You don't know who Michael Bay is? He is a widely recognized director that has done Transformers and some other popular movies.
Okay. I've probably seen some of this stuff, then.
Did you ever see Armageddon, Pearl Harbor or The Rock?
I know I saw Armageddon, and I think I saw Pearl Harbor.
Well, those were Michael Bay films.
Okay, I see. Which movie was The Rock?
That was that one about escaping from Alcatraz, with Sean Connery and Nick Cage.
