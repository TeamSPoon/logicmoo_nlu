What are your thoughts on Fiona Apple?
I love her!  I think she's a really talented singer and pianist.
I don't even know if she makes music anymore.
I know, it's really sad when musicians from when you were a teen/twenties stop making music.
It's like "You helped me through life!  Don't stop now!", you know?
Exactly, artists should know that we all need soundtracks to our lives so keep making music!
Fiona's first album was sooo good!
I remember when she came out and everyone thought she was so weird.
Granted, she was a little different.  But she wasn't Bjork weird.
Bjork!  I totally remember her and her swan dress at that awards show.
Sometimes I think artists are just too over the top.  I don't get the message she was trying to send.
I don't either.  It was very strange.
I think she won worst dressed that year.
And rightfully so!  There's Lady Gaga strange and then there's Bjork strange!
Bjork did have some good songs, though.
Yes, you can't go wrong with Army of Me.
Such a good song!
I had forgotten all about it until I saw it in someone's Spotify playlist.
I love rediscovering old songs that way.
Yes, the older playlists from like when we were teens are really great.
