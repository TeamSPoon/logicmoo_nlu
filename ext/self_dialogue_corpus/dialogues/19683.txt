Have you ever heard of the singer Kane Brown?
No, what kind of music does he sing?
He is a new country artist but he adds pop and sometimes rock so the fan base is bigger.
That sounds cool does he have any albums or singles out?
He has a few singles out his cd is self titled, it's called "Kane Brown".  His newest single is "Better Place"
That's awesome, I'll have to check it out.
Oh he's up for new break thru music video of the year with CMT for his video "What Ifs".
The video must have been pretty cool.
They shot the video in California at a resort it was beautiful, it's a romantic song so it was the perfect place for it.
It sounds like you really like him and his music.
Yeah he's awesome, not only is his music great his personality is too!
Really? He's not like most famous people that don't have time for fans?
Nope he has his own social media pages he controls; he even replies back to fan comments.
He sounds like a really down to earth person, does he have a fan club?
He has two the Kane Brown Squad and Kane Krew. Kane Krew is run by him and his family and he's even active in the Squad too.
How can I join them?
It's easy they're both a group on Facebook just search and hit join. Someone will approve it in a day or two sometimes in a few hours.
That's awesome I can't wait to be apart of it all!
I'm sure you'll love his music and you'll meet a lot of cool friends, even his family and band members will talk to you.
Sweet! Thanks for telling me about him.
