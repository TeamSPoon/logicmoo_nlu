Which NFL teams got the best results from this past draft in April 2017?
You really do not know for a number of years how any draft pick or class is going to perform.  Some do well and others due to injuries or performance do not.
Which teams seem to have made some good choices then in terms of positions ?
Each team drafted player which the team believed would fill a necessary gap in offense or defense
Can you give me some examples of how some of the teams did?
Sure, lets take the teams from New York since I am a New Yorker
Ok, how did the Jets do in the draft?
Interesting the Jets have decided to stay with their quarterbacks and not try for any new ones to develop.
Who are the Jets quarterbacks?
Christian Hackenberg is one and  Bryce Petty is another.
Who did they draft first?
They used a number 6 draft and picked up a player named  Jamal Adams
What school did he play for ?
He played for LSU which is Louisiana State
I thought he would be higher in the draft
I am sure that was the consensus.  But he went in the sixth round which was a bargain for the JETS
What position does he play ?
He is a safety
What is a safety?
A saftey is a defensive back that lines up about 10 to 15 yards in front of the line of scrimmage and then waits to see how the play unfolds to follow the ball.
