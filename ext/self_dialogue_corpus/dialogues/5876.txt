I'm fostering another litter of orphaned bottle fed kittens for the cat rescue I volunteer for.
Aw, you are so kind. I know it's got to be a lot of work. But I bet they are super cute.
Oh they're adorable. They are a lot of work. One of the hardest parts is naming them, and thinking up something cute that will attract attention.
So what did you name them?
I like to name them after characters from Disney movies, so hopefully they will attract families with kids who will play with them.
That's a great idea. And it gives you lots of possibilities for names.
Two of them are little grey tigers, a boy and girl, and I named them Kiara and Kovu, from The Lion King 2 Simba's pride.
Those are really unique names, they are sure to get attention!
The other two are grey and white girls, I named them Elsa from Frozen and Ariel from The Little Mermaid.
I'm sure you'll find some little girls who want to adopt kittens with names like those!
