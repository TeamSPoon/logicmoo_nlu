When do you think Snoop Dogg will make another album?
Well, I think I just read that he came out with a new song.
Oh, what's the name of it?
I don't remember, but it's controversial.
When isn't Snoop Dogg controversial?
Yeah, that's true, but this must have been bad enough for the media to pick up on.
What's controversial about it anyway?
I think it has to do about being homophobic or something.
Wow, that's an area that I wouldn't have expected him to touch.
Yeah, but he's getting publicity.
