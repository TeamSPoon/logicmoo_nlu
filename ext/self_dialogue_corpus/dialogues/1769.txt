Hey, the NFL season is coming up.
Yeah. I am aware. I'm really excited. How about you?
Of course. I am going to be rooting for my favorite team!
What is your favorite team by the way?
My favorite team is the Washington Redskins.
Oh ok.
What's the problem?
Well the Redskins haven't made any advancement from the playoffs to the Super Bowl since the late 90s.
I understand that but I always love a great defensive team. What is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
I heard their new stadium is really massive and great for hosting the Super Bowl.
Of course. As long as Tony Romo doesn't get any injuries this year it's all in the bag.
The game isn't won on soley defense. Besides, Romo is getting old don't you think?
This is coming from a Redskins fan? You lost RGIII. Please don't give me a lecture.
Realistically, Romo probably has another season left in him and then he is out.
We will see. How about your draft picks?
What about the draft picks? I'm confident in the choices they made.
I never really am. They just don't listen to the teams and take in consideration for things.
Things such as what?
Salary.
