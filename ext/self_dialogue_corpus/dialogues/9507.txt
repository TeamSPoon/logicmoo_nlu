Is it just me or is it really hard to understand rap lyrics unless you have them written down right in front of you?
Well all these modern artists mumble.
No I mean even classic ones.
I haven't really noticed.
I think it's just there's a lot going on at one time.
Yeah, like for me I mainly listen to Irish artists so there's a whole range of accents there plus they have entirely different slang. Those are the things that get me.
I gotcha. I just feel like I can deal with a lot of clever word play or really fast speed of delivery but it's hard to keep up with both.
That makes sense.
So I usually will read all the lyrics before listening to an album for the first time and then read them again while I'm listening.
I do too except there are some songs I just can't find the lyrics for anywhere. So I end up understanding about one more line each time I listen to a song.
