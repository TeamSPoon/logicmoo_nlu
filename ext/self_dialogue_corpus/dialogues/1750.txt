Do you think Andrew Luck will be ready for pre-season?
I'm not too sure, but I hope so.
Do you think we will make the playoffs this year at least?
If they can protect Andrew I think we will win it all.
I don't know about that, Robert Mathis isn't here anymore.
That's true.
We had a good draft though, and got a lot of good guys.
I just hope it's all a good fit.
Do you think T.Y. will have another amazing year?
I hope his season is as amazing as his backpacks are, haha.
Well, i just hope we win 10 games.
We should win more this year, with our new General Manager.
Yeah, that's very true.
I'm so glad we got to keep Chuck though.
This season is going to feel so weird, with a lot of veterans being gone.
Yeah, especially Patt.
I couldn't believe he retired so suddenly.
I couldn't believe it. I thought he was joking.
And to announce it on Twitter too.
I will really miss him. He was the best punter.
