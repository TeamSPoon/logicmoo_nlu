Have you ever seen The Blair Witch Project?
I did. I saw it when it first came out in theaters actually.
How did you like it? Was it hard to watch?
It really was. I literally couldn't stomach the shaky cam.
That's what made me hate it at first, but I started appreciating it upon subsequent viewing.
That's how it was with me. You see how terrifying it is after watching it a few times.
That's true. That's why I don't go into the woods to this day.
I believe that movie started the whole "found footage" movie fascination.
You're right. That air of mystery and possibility of it being true really draws people.
I didn't know it wasn't real until the characters came out at the MTV movie awards!
