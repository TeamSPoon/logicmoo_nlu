What's your favorite music genre
i love Rap/hip hop
Me too, well I use to
I know, rap music sucks now
Drake is huge now, but I think he is garbage
Me to, he is terrible
I like real rappers like Dre, Wu Tang, Nas, etc
Hell yeah, thats real hip hop.
What about biggy!
Man, ain't no one like biggy.
Jay Z is the man as well
Yeah, he was the shit.
DMX was one of my favorites
Ruff Riders Anthum baby
that was my joint
I remember grinding on girls to that song
Drake, etc cant even compare
Hip Hop is dead
It's a shame what kids think tis good music.
I know, they don't know what good music is.
