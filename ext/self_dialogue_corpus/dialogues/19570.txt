Hey do you listen to Grace Vanderwaal?
No I don't who is she?
She just won Americas Got Talent. She is on 12 years old and she is very talented.
That's amazing does she sing or does she play an instrument too?
She sings, plays the ukulele and best of all she writes all of her own songs.
Seriously?! How have I never heard of her?
Well she just started recording her album and has been traveling making appearances so she hasn't started a real tour yet.
Well what is your favorite song so I can look her up.
I love Gossip Girl, Clay and listen to I Don't Know My Name. That was the song that made her get so far in Americans Got Talent.
Okay I will listen to them.
When you do let me know if you like her because I heard she is going to Las Vegas in a couple months to do a small show.
Oh my goodness okay I will let you know. But I have a feeling that I am going to like her so lets plan a road trip.
Sounds great to me.
Do you know if she is gong t be preforming with anyone else?
Yeah I think that she is going to be playing with a few other contestants who made it to the end of the show.
Oh so it is an Americas Got Talent show?
Yes it is but you never know. Grace already has a big musical following so I hear Ed Sheeran might make an appearance too.
Well now we have to go!! I love Ed Sheeran his voice is amazing.
Well just wait until you hear them both sing together. I am going to buy or tickets now.
Sounds great. This time next month we will be seeing Grace and maybe Ed!
