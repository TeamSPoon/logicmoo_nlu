Would you like to come over and spend the day with me?
Sure that sounds like fun! We could order a pizza or something.
Sounds good to me. Do you have any movies you could bring over?
Yea I have a bunch of movies. What are you in the mood for?
It really don't matter, I just want to watch something that I have not seen before.
I think I could come up with something. Have you ever seen Mean Girls?
I am not sure, who does it have in it?
It stars Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams.
Does it also have Tina Fey in it as well?
It sure does! The cast is one of the strong points of the movie in my opinion.
I do not think that I have ever seen that one come to think of it.
Great, I will bring that one over for us to watch then!
Sounds good to me! Maybe you could bring over one more just in case we want to watch another one.
I recently bought a new movie called A Dog's Purpose.
I have been wanting to watch that one for a long time!
I actually have not watched it yet myself, so we could watch it together.
That would be nice, I love Dennis Quaid movies.
Yea I like him as well, and I like animal movies!
My brother watched it and he said it was a really good movie.
Well, it looks like we have two good movies to watch then!
