I am having such a depressing day!
I am sorry to hear that. I like listening to my favorite music when I am depressed.
That is a good idea actually. Maybe that would help me out.
You should give it a try! What kind of music makes you happy?
Well, I have always been a fan of Kelly Clarkson.
She is very talented! I remember watching her season of American Idol.
Yea me to; I just knew she was going to win.
Her voice really stood out. Which of her songs do you like the most?
I really like a lot of her older music for the most part.
Yea she has some really good songs that she put out years ago.
Breakaway and Because Of You are probably my favorites.
I remember those songs. I have not heard them in forever though.
Me either, I think I may pull out some of my older CD's of her.
Yea, that might be all it takes to turn your day around!
You could be right! Besides, I am pretty sure I have all of her CD's.
Have you ever heard that song Stronger from her?
Yes! That song always lifts my spirits.
Yea it is a very inspirational song actually.
Thank you so much for reminding me of it.
No problem! I hope her songs can really make you feel better!
