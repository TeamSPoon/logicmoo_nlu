I saw the movie Xanadu last night.
Oh that is like a cult classic. I have seen it as well.
What do you think about it?
I love it! I thought Olivia Newton John was great in it.
I thought so too and her singing and dancing was wonderful.
I loved that Gene Kelly played a part in it.
His dancing was impeccable. It was so great that he was in it for sure.
I loved the music in it. I want the soundtrack.
Yes, ELO was great. I am surprised the movie did not do better.
I heard that it was because it was not released in a lot of theaters and the critics didn't like it, but people who saw it did.
Oh, so not enough people could see it so the sales were low.
Yes, that is what I heard.
It was a little cheesy I guess, but it was fun.
I would watch it again just for the music and dancing.
Yes and it was fun to see roller skating.
The relationship between Gene Kelly's character and Sonny was great.
I liked that Sonny treated him with respect.
Yes you don't see that a lot nowadays.
Yes, people show no respect to older people.
Well the movie shows how valuable older people are.
