Have you ever seen The Godfather?
Doesn't that have Marlon Brando in it?
Yes, he makes an impression in it.
Who else is in the cast?
Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are in it, too.
Oh, I like Al Pacino!
Yes, he's pretty great in it.
Yeah, I've always thought he did great work in the films I've seen him in.
Great direction in this one, too.
Who directed it?
Francis Ford Coppola directed it.
Oh, he's one of America's greatest directors.
Yes, and The Godfather is one of those great American classics from the '70s.
I'm going to have to watch it soon.
You'll love the story, and it has a lot of action, too, if you like that.
I do like action in films.
Another great part of the film is all the wonderful period costumes.
I love it when a movie has authentic details like that.
Oh, of course, it really transports one to that time period.
I know what you mean.  The film sounds like it has wonderful production values.
