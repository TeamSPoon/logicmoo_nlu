I never understood why Goblet of Fire was liked so much.
Why didn't you like it?
Just felt that the actual games took way too long.
That was the best part of the movie.
Well, we already knew Harry would win, so why take so long?
Did you not enjoy seeing the dragons?
Yeah, that was cool.
Or the way he handled the water task?
Yeah, that was cool too.
So that settles it.  You should like it because those scenes were cool.
