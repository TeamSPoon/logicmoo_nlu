You've seen The Hunger Games trilogy, right? Do you know that the idea was ripped off from a Japanese movie?
I've seen them, but I didn't know that. Which movie?
Battle Royale.
I've seen that one, and I never made that connection. It seems so obvious now...
Doesn't it? Do you have a preference?
I thought Battle Royale was a lot more entertaining.
Why is that?
The Hunger Games was so Hollywood. Too much lame suspense and baiting with tension.
I agree. In Battle Royale, there was also an overall air of absurdity that indicated some self-awareness in the film, which I liked.
I agree. The Hunger Games was total fantasy, and we are expected to take this ridiculous premise as fact.
Do you remember the teacher in Battle Royale?
He was played by Takeshi Kitano, right?
Yes. How do you know him?
After watching the movie I thought he looked so familiar, so I looked him up. He's the host from Takeshi's Castle!
I was surprised to find out he has a very prolific film career in Japan as an actor and a director.
I had no idea. Based on these two things I have seen him in, I bet he's funny.
He commonly plays in yakuza (Japanese gangster) films.
Do you have any recommendations I should check out?
Sonatine, Outrage, and Brother.
Awesome. I hope they are on Netflix.
