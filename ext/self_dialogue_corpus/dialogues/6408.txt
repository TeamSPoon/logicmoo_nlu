What are your favorite Disney characters?
Any parameters, or can I choose any at all?
Hmmm... How about favorite from the movies in the last 10 years.
Ok, how many can I choose?
Five
That's it?? That's so hard!!
I know, that's what makes it fun!
Ok, so I'll go with... Baymax, Moana, Thor, Captain America and Anna from Frozen
Thor and Captain America are Marvel, not Disney!
Marvel is owned by Disney so they count!!
