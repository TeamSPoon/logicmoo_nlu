What is a band that you can't stand.
Red Hot Chili Peppers.
That's surprising. Most people like them.
For some reason, I find them really annoying.
They are kind of a unique band. Maybe you just don't like their unique style.
They are unique, but in a bad way. I really can't stand their songs either. Californication. Uh, I hate, hate, hate, that song.
Any other songs from them that you loathe?
Otherside. What bands do you hate?
Definitely the Offspring.
Why do you hate the Offspring.
They scream and scream and sound really whiny.
I could see that. I kind of like them, only in the sense that they bring me back to my teenage years.
They do bring me back to those years, but I don't associate them with that the good things that happened during that time in my life.
What song do you hate the most from the Offspring?
Self-esteem, by a mile.
They definitely scream throughout that song. I could see where you would get the whiny sound with them.
Self-esteem was basically all whining and screaming.
I'll make sure to never play any Offspring songs around you.
Please, don't ever.
Maybe, once, if I ever get the urge to drive you up the wall.
