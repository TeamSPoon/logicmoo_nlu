Are you going to see the live action Beauty and the Beast?
I don't know. I love the animated one so much.
I see, you want to keep your memories intact?
Exactly! How perfect is the first scene? Or the one where the Beast really lets his anger go?
What about Gaston's song? So clever!
It's just a perfect film. No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.
I don't think you need to worry--my mom saw the new one and said it's fantastic.
What did she like about it?
She said Emma Thompson is perfect.
Hmmm...maybe I need to make time to see it.
