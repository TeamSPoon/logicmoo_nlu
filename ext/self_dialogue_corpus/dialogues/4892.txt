I went to the game last night.
I was there to.
Did you get the give away?
Yeah
Did you like it?
Not really, why?
Just asking. What a game Kershaw pitched.
I thought one of his best.
I agree.
That guy had one of the best sinkers ever.
Don't forget about his curve.
If you had a chance to hit against him wild you?
Sure.won't you?
No I would be too afraid to get hit by his pitch.
I can't believe he went 8 innings with Pitt let's them get a hit.
A simple bloop single could do it.
I would not be surprised.
Why?
He looked tied.
Wouldn't thou bee after 87 pitched?
