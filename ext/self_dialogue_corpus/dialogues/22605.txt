Do you remember the movie Holes?
I remember the name, but not what it was about.
It's based on the book Holes. It had Shia Labeouf in it.
Oh, the one where the kids had to dig all day?
Yeah, you saw it?
Yeah, for school. Do you like that movie?
Its in my top 10 of all time.
Wow, why?
Everything about it. I love Shia, Zero was cool, and just the whole story is great.
The one thing I remember is the lizard scene.
Yeah, when Zero and Stanley found the treasure and were covered with them.
And the only reason they weren't killed was because of how many onions they hate.
That was a great scene!
Its too bad Shia turned into a bit of a crazy person in real life.
But his movies are still good.
I remember him from Even Stevens the most.
That show was so funny!
He was the funniest character on Disney Channel back then.
I agree.
Here's hoping he does more comedy
