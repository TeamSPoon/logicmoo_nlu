How did you like the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?
I liked it a lot, but I think the plot was so similar to A New Hope that it felt more like an homage than a new movie.
Yeah, I thought that too a little bit, but I liked how they added so much more diversity to the cast.
Yeah, that was great, but I hated seeing all the internet trolls complaining about reverse racism and reverse sexism.
Ugh, for sure. What is it about the internet that seems to bring out the worst in people?
I think the combination of the Star Wars Universe and the internet can be a bad combination sometimes.
How so?
So many people have loved these movies for so long that they have a hard time accepting changes to their favorite childhood impressions about them.
Like the huge controversy over whether Han shot first, right?
Exactly!
