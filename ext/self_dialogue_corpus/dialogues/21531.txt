What was the last movie you watched?
The Prestige was the last movie I saw.
Who is in that movie?
It stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.
What is it about?
It's about two magicians who form a professional rivalry which pushes them both to cross moral lines in order to be the best at their craft.
Oh, sounds interesting. What are the themes?
Some of the themes include obsession, rivalry, deception and grief.
How did you like it?
I thought it was very good, but it will require more viewings.
Why is that?
Well, the film is presented out of order, so it will take more viewings to completely piece together the timeline.
Is it kind of like Memento in that regard?
In a way, which is no coincidence as both movies were directed by Christopher Nolan.
I love his movies. They usually involve a lot of interesting cinematic techniques.
That is true, and The Prestige is no exception.
I may have to watch it. Who else is in it?
It also stars Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson.
I like Michael Caine. His is in a lot of other Nolan movies, correct?
Yes, he is also in the Dark knight trilogy and Interstellar.
