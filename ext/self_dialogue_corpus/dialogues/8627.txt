Do you remember Counting Crows?
Sure.  I liked listening to them when I was in school.
Do you still listen to their music?
Not really.
Why not?
I think I liked their sound more back then.  It's just not fun to listen to anymore.
Didn't the singer used to date one of the girls from Friends?
Yeah, his name was Adam something.  I want to say he dated Courteney Cox, but it might have been Jennifer Anniston.
He was the guy with weird hair.
I don't know if it was weird, but he had dreads.
