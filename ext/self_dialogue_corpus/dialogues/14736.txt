So I watched Haunted Mansion the other day.
Why did you do that?  I heard it was awful.
Sure was.  Just another poor movie choice by Eddie Murphy.
He's been in duds ever since the Beverly Hills Cops movies.
Well, he kind of sold out a bit.  Haunted Mansion was a pure money grab.
Disney was chucking cash at him, so I don't blame him.
I know what you mean.
I refuse to watch Haunted Mansion.  I don't want to waste my time.
You shouldn't.  Save yourself the trouble.
Consider it done.
