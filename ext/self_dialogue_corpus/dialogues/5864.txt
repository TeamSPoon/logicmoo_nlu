I really think the movie Brave was a nice example of courage; how about you?
Eh, I don't think so. The movie was just kind of...boring. I mean, her mom got turned into a bear? Seriously?
Yeah, but Merida was pretty brave, right?
Hmm, I guess so. but her three brothers are kind of just the comic relief.
You're right about that, to be honest.
Although, they were helpful when they provided a distraction.
I really liked her Scottish culture.
Me too, I like foreign culture movies.
Like Aladdin, which takes place in Arabia.
Yeah!
