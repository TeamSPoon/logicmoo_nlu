Were you ever a One Direction fan?
1D?  No, I can't say I ever was.
I wasn't a fan of the band as a group, but their solo careers are way more interesting to me.
That's a great point.  Individually, they put out some great songs.
Any come to mind?
I liked Niall's 'Slow Hands.'
That's a great song.  Very chill.
I listen to it really often.  Do you have any favorites?
I think Zayn's 'Pillowtalk' is so good.
Interesting.  I think Zayn is the best singer, but I like Louis' 'Just Hold On.'
What do you like about it?  Also, I do agree that Zayn is the best vocalist of the crew.
I like that dance and EDM element.
You're right about the electronic element.  It's definitely catchy.
The only songs by One Direction as a whole that was better than the singles, was 'Story of My Life.'
I love the emotion behind the song, the meaning, and also the music video.
Hands down their best work I think.
I did like 'What Makes You Beautiful.'
While I agree it was catchy, I don't think that it was anything special musically.  The lyrics were weak in my opinion.
You're right about the lyrics.  They were rather simple, but that song still reminds me of summer.
That aspect, I can agree with.  I heard it nonstop the summer it came out.
