Honey We Shrunk the Kids is a great film.
Yeah it is. Rick Morranis is hilarious.
I really like the scene when they find that giant Oatmeal Cream Pie.
Haha. That makes me hungry every time I see it.
And do you remember when they have to fight the giant ant?
Yes. That would make me so scared if ants were really that big.
I want to build a device in my back yard like Rick did and search my yard for bugs.
Yeah, only he was searching for his kids!
I hope I wouldn't find any of those in my yard.
I'm sure you don't have to worry about that.
