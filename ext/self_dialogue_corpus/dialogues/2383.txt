NFL football is the best.
I agree. I am ready for the season to start.
Wouldn't it be cool to have a Superbowl ring?
I think I saw one sold on Pawn Stars.
I bet one of those rings costs a fortune. Do you know how many Superbowls there have been?
This next season will make 52.
Who plays in the Superbowl?
The conference champions from the AFC and NFC.
I heard the Steelers have the most Superbowl wins.
They do! They have six but the Patriots have the most Superbowl appearances.
How many do they have?
I think they have nine.
Bill Belichek has created a dynasty.
Do you think Tom Brady will get one more ring?
I think he will get at least one more. He has a lot of life left in him.
He takes really good care of his body.
You have to in such a physically demanding job.
There are a lot of injuries in the NFL.
Those guys get paid a lot of money though.
True. I would play a couple seasons and then retire.
