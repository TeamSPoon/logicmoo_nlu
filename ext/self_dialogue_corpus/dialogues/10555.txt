What is the thing you hate most about movies?
Going to them.
So you dont like the theater experience?
I would rather do it in my home.
I think the ambiance is great.
I just am not into special effects.
Do you watch movies that have them?
Yes and no.
Can you elaborate?
I am not a huge adventure fan
What about comic movies?
They have them but the storyline is more important to me.
Would you consider paying the same price at home?
No because I dont have the requisite screen for the theater.
So would you pay half to watch a new movie at home
Yes that seems fair.
The movies are the best part of seeing a movie.
Just does nothing for me.
How about if it was a musical?
The loudness of the theater is bothersome
