Did you ever see 127 Hours?
Doesn't strike a bell.
It's the one where the guy cuts off his arm because he trapped himself in a canyon.
Oh, I remember now.  That was based off a true story.
It was pretty amazing he somehow lived through that.
Can you imagine what it would be like trying to cut off your own arm?
I couldn't do it.
Most people probably couldn't.  He did it with a little knife.
It's a wonder he didn't die.  You should probably watch it again sometime.
I think I need to.
