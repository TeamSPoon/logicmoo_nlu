You know Weird Al's parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way?
Yeah! I actually like it a lot more than the original, not being a Lady Gaga fan.
Have you given her music a shot?
I haven't really had to. I mean, it's so popular I'm accosted with it when I go out or when I stay in.
When you stay in?
Yeah, like I was watching American Idol with someone and she was one of the people performing in between the contestants.
What did she perform?
Poker Face.
And what did you think of that?
That was enough for me to know I wouldn't really care for her music in general.
