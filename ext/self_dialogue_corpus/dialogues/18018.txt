Hi, what do you think about the Beatles?
They are close to my heart and my favorite band of all time.
Me too. Every song is so good that it is nearly impossible to choose a favorite!
I know what you mean. What are your top two favorites?
I would have to say that one of mne would be Hey Jude.
I love that song. Paul McCartney wrote that song for John Lennon's son.
I did not know that, really?
Yep, He wrote it for Sean Lennon.
Oh, how cool ! Good information and knowledge.
Thanks, I love talking about music history.
Me too, do you have any current favorite songs?
I don't stay current so I would have to say no. What about you?
I am pretty bad about that too. My current would be about twenty years old.
Exactly! For instance?
For example I would would say I love Elvis!
Right on, Love me Tender is an oldie but goodie!
Right, I listen to the fifties station every day while driving.
I love when the song Mr. Postman come on because it reminds of of high school.
I know what you mean. I have a lot of songs that do that for me too.
I will second that sentiment with the song My little Run Run Runaway oldie !
