Do you recall the first song you danced to?
Like slow danced at a dance?
Yes, do you know?
I think it was, all 4 one's, I turn to you.
I remember that song.
Ya first one I actually recall. It was in space jam was really popular at the time.
I love so many songs from space jam.
ya, like what?
Pump up the jam. It is one of the best songs to energize oneself.
It does have a certain energy. really fun song.
Also I believe I can fly.
Was that R. kelly?
Yes it was him.
That was a great song.
Indeed.too bad he became so weird.
Ya no kidding, didn't he pee on an audience or girl?
Something really gross and bizarre.
It is too bad because he really had some great songs.
I loved party jumping.
He had lots of goodies. I feel his career is done. but I think he still tours.
