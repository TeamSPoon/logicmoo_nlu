What's your favorite music genre?
I hate music
You... HATE music...!?
Yea, it's a bunch of noise to me
What do you hate about it?
I don't know.  It just doesn't do much for me
That's too bad.  I love music
Why..?
It goes with my moods
What do you mean by that?
When I'm down I can relate to many of the issues that they talk about
So, sort of like poetry?
Yea, sort of
But what about all the noise?
The dynamics and variation go to accent the lyrics
Hmmm... I'm beginning to follow you
Yea, you should give diferent types a try
I very well may give it another go
I gotta run!
Later!
