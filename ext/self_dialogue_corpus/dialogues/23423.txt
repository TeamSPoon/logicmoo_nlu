Do you like movies?
I love movies, what kinds do you like?
I mainly like comedy, what about you?
Action movies are my favorite.
I love all robin Williams movies.
He was a good actor
He was.  I miss him.
I hate what happened to him, it's so tragic.
It really is, I didn't know he was so depressed
I dont think anyone did
It's still so sad
I know, I wish somebody thought to help him
Same, he was so funny
One of my favorites is flubber
Oh I forgot about that one, that one is great.
And Mrs doubtfire, I just watched that one on TV the other day
That was is so funny, I love his impersonations.
Me too, they are hilarious.
And the one where he is a kids doctor was so good.
He was so talented
