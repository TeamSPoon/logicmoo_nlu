My boyfriend and I just watched the Dallas Buyers' Club the other night. Have you seen it?
No, but I've heard of it. Who is in it again?
Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.
Oh yeah, Didn't McConaughey win an Oscar for it?
He did! Although I liked Leto's performance better.
What's it about?
It's about a Texas man's-man who gets HIV when most of the people getting it were gay.
How did he get it?
He got it through unprotected sex with a woman who did intravenous drugs.
That's so scary!
Yes, and unfortunately he lost many of his friends because they thought he was gay, and they would not accept him anymore.
That's horrible. What did he do?
He finds out about drugs available in other countries and makes them available in Dallas.
Isn't that illegal?
Yes! He gets into trouble with the police and the IRS.
So he just becomes a businessman?
Kind of, but he also befriends a lot of people in the gay community and really helps people out.
Wow, is it based on a real story?
It is! The man was only supposed to live for 30 days but he ended up living for 7 more years.
That's inspiring! I want to see it now.
