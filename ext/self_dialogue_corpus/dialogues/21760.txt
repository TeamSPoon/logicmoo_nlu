Oh my God! You need to see The Revenant!
I did. It is amazing!
I'm still shaking because of the bear scene.
It is a master piece, the way they accomplished that scene.
I was literally sweating while I was watching it.
Yes, it was extremely intense.
And Leonardo DiCaprio killed it again.
I think he is definitely one of the best actor out there right now.
He deserved the Oscar for this performance.
No doubt about that.
And what about Tom Hardy?
My hat's off.
Yes, i finally got to like him in this movie. I mean I hated him in the movie but I loved his acting.
You didn't like him before?
No. He hadn't convinced me in any of his previous performances.
Well, I think this is one of his most serious movies yet.
Exactly, maybe that is why I didn't like hime before.
But the whole movie of The Revenant is like staring at a deeply intense yet amazingly beautiful drawing.
Yes, the photography and the job the director did was outstanding.
Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is one of the best right now.
