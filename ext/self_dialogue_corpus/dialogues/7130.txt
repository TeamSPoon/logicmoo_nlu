The Muppets were so much fun, I liked shaggy dog
I liked Kermit he was so funny
the way he was with Ms Piggy was funny
a pig and a frog is a weird combo
Yes it is I do not know how they came up with that
seriously, who comes up with these ideas
I like how someone made the puppets, a lot of work went into them
that is true, and people were making the voices also
I think the idea of muppets and the things they do is a creative idea
I know, only a creative person could come up with that
