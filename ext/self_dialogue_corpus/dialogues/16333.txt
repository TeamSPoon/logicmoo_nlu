I really like Harmar Superstar's sound.
Yeah, it's really unique.  I've heard he's awesome live, too.
Have you heard "New Song" by Warpaint?
No, aren't they that band from Finland?
The new Gorillaz album is as good as any of their others.  Have you heard it?
Yeah, I really like the song, "Andromeda".
What label is Frank Ocean with?
I think he's with Def Jam.
I have been listening to the last David Bowie album over and over.  I can't believe he's no longer on this earth.
Blackstar is so good.  I especially like, "I Can't Give Everything Away."
What's your favorite song from the La-La Land soundtrack?
City of Stars.
On the song, "City of Stars", is that really Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone singing?
Yes, it's really them.
I've been listening to Ben Harper a lot lately.
Have you heard the album he did with Charlie Musselwhite?
I'm so glad I went to the Cure concert last summer.
I've seen them live, but not since the early 1990's.
The Replacements are my favorite band
I wish Bob Stinson was still around.
