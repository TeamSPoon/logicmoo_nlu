what is a little know fact about a song?
Well did you know golddigger was originally written for a female to sing.
No, I did not. Crazy! Such a male perspective.
Well kanye apparently rewrote parts to make it form a male perspective.
Who was it written for in the first place?
A rapper named shawna.
I have never heard of her.
I only know one song, I think she missed out big time.
Ya, It makes you wonder if she did golddigger would she be a household name?
Perhaps it was a huge song.
I wonder if Jaime fox was always intended to be on it.
I don't know. I kind of doubt it but maybe.
Fox has such an incredible voice.
He does indeed. Such a great actor as well.
Yahe is racking in the money.
From gold digger for sure was a good payday for them.
ya i think it was the most downlaoded song in a week.
But were those paid downloads or just pirated?
I think they were for paid copies.
well either way they made a ton . That shawna girl must be so upset.
