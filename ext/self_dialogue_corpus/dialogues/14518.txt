So, how about this first half?
Boston's doing a much better job tonight.
Yeah, only down by 12 right now.
How about that sweet 3-pointer by Cleveland before?
Yeah, that was nice.
I don't know how many fouls they've called, do you?
At least three I think.
Good, Boston just scored two more.
But Cleveland scored three more.
Ah, nice try, Boston.
Okay, they have possession again.
And they blew it with that air ball.
Brad Stevens does not look happy.
Well, he should be happier than he was last time.  At least the gap is only 13 points this time.
Good, the Celts are standing up for themselves to the ref.
Did he call a foul for backing into the one from the Cavs?
I hope not.  I think it was legit.
Everyone backs into each other at some point.
True, how else do you protect the ball?
Exactly!
