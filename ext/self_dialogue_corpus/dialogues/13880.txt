What is your least favorite Gaga song?
I would go with born this way.
Really? That was such a popular track.
It was well done. But I can't help but think she ripped off Madonna on this track.
I Madonna is one of her bigger influences.
Well to me it sounds to much like a certain Madonna song.
Which one exactly?
Express yourself. It is clear the similarity.
I don't hear it myself. weird.
Not weird , true. Even Madonna felt ripped off by Gaga on this track.
