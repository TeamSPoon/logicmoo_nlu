So Marcie, uh, I was wondering. Would you like to go to the Sharks game with me?
The Sharks? That's ice hockey, isn't it?
Yes it is. It's our own San Jose team.
Um, isn't ice hockey sort of violent?
No, not really. it's an exciting, fast-moving game of skill, actually.
Then why do they tell that joke?
What joke?
I bet you know. I went to a fight, and...
...a game of ice hockey broke out.
You have heard it!
Yeah. My grandfather told me that joke.
Ha-ha. I've never seen a game.
I have really good seats. Right down behind the shield.
The shield. That's reassuring.
You'll like it, I promise. And if you don't we'll leave.
Wow. How can I turn you down?
So you'll come.
Of course I will.
Want me to pick you up?
Nah. I'll meet you at the Arena. I want to locate all the emergency exits.
