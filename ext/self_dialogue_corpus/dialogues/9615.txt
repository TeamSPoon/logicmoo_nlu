I think that Wu-Tang Clan are the best rap group of all time.
I thought that title was reserved for NWA.
It would be if they would have lasted longer.
But they still left a bigger impact than Wu-Tang did.
That's true. But Wu-Tang have been making consistently good music not just as a unit, but as solo members.
NWA's members are still putting out music.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that Wu are better because of their longevity.
I can understand that, but I feel like impact and influence outweigh longevity by a lot.
I can understand that.
Not to say I don't like Wu, though. They're still a great group.
