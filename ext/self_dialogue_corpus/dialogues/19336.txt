Hey have you heard the new Rancid album?
Yes I have!
What do you think of it?
I really like half of it but I don't really like the other half.
Really? I thought it was great the whole way through.
I'm not really sold on some of the songs.
Well what's your favorite song on the album?
I really like I got them blues again. How about you?
It's hard to decide, I really like Ghost of a chance and Telegraph Avenue.
Telegraph Avenue is awesome!
Yeah I love that little riff that Lars plays on his guitar throughout the song.
Yeah that's so catchy. It fits perfect.
Did you see they're going on tour this summer?
I did! With Bouncing Souls and Dropkick Murphys.
It's going to be so awesome! What show are you going to?
I'm actually going to two. The one in Bangor and the one in Boston. I can't wait.
Nice. I'm hitting up the one in San Diego.
Where are they playing in San Diego?
They're playing at PetCo Park.
Oh man that sounds so cool. I wish I could go to that one.
