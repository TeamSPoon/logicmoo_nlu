I'm going to give an unpopular opinion: I loved Spider-Man 3.
You did? Why?
There were a lot of villains and Tobey's character spoke to me.
You were emo, that's right.
What did you think of it?
I only saw two-thirds of it.
Why just that much? Did you walk out.
Yes, but not on my own.
Huh?
The theater's fire alarm went off right before the third act. They gave us free passes but I didn't come back to finish it. I used it on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I think.
