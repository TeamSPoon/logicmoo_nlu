Do you like Beatle's music?
Yes, I do.  My favorite Beatles song is "Hey Jude."
Well, I know an interesting piece of trivia about that song.  Did you know that "Hey Jude" was not the original title?
What?!  What was the title?
Well, Paul McCartney originally wrote it as a tribute to John Lennon's son, Julian.  So he called it "Hey Jules."
Wait a minute--I didn't know John Lennon had a kid back in those days!
Yes, he was married and had a son before the Beatles even became famous.
So why did the song title get changed?
I'm not sure about that, but I remember reading that the lyrics changed before it was recorded and so the title changed.
Okay, now I have to listen to that song again and see if I can pick up on the tribute part.  Thanks for the info!
