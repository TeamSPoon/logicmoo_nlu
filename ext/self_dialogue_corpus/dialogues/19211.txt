Who's your favorite music group?
The Beatles for sure.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
"Mr. Postman" is my favorite.
Why is that?
I really like how it sounds like he is begging on the song,  that and I really like the beat.
I like that song too, but my favorite Beatles song is "Penny Lane"
Oh, okay, that's cool.
Yes, I so wish that they would make a comeback.
Me too, that would be awesome. But they need to find replacements for Harrison and Lennon.
Yeah, that is true, I think that drummer from Nirvana should merge Foo Fighters with a, replinished Beatles.
Yeah, that would be awesome, Dave Grouhl gets lots of influence from the Beatles anyways, might as well!
That would be so sweet. But they have to really like each other to do something like that.
Yeah, that's true. I think they might be friends, but I don't think they like each other enough to do that.
Do you like New Jack Swing music?
I don't know what that is. Can you tell what that is, please?
Well its like rhythm and blues and jazz put together with a disco sound and beat.
Oh yeah, that's good music, I like that. I like Bobby Brown.
What's your favorite Bobby Brown song?
My favorite Bobby Brown song is "On our own"
