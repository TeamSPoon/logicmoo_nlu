What's your favorite classic Disney movie?
I like Sleeping Beauty.
I think my favorite is Peter Pan.
Sleeping Beauty has the really sweet romance between Aurora and Prince Philip.
That's true. Peter Pan doesn't really have a romance.
And I love the fairy godmothers. They're so funny, and they get to save the day!
Peter Pan has a lot of funny parts, too.
And both movies have a lot of good action scenes.
But I have to love the movie that was the origin of Tinkerbell.
Okay, you're right, that does make Peter Pan a classic!
