What did you think of the latest Fast and Furious movie?
I only saw the first movie.  I hated it.
I think that they should have stopped with the third movie.
I think they should have not made the first one. Vin Diesel has no acting talent.
I agree. Vin Diesel has muscles and that's it.
Paul Walker was decent though.
I thought Paul Walker was good as well.
The cars in those movies were not that impressive to me.
I can think of a better way to waste 90 minutes.
Waste is right. Those movies were so boring.
