Have you watched any of those horror movies I lent you yet?
Yes I finally watched The Cabin in the Woods. Even after hearing about the movie that ending was a twist!
I find that to be one of the best horror movies I ever watched. It was not predictable at all.
No, that movie defied all expectation. I really liked the part where they showed the panel of monsters they could choose from.
I know when I saw that panel and heard them taking bets from different teams all over the world I was really confused, but I wanted to know what was going on.
It did a good job explaining how the objects in the basement correlated to the different monsters. Using Dana to explain it while she figures it out herself was a good method.
Yes, they did a good job providing the information we needed to understand without being boring. What did you think when that zombie family came out to attack the kids in the beginning?
That part was kind of predictable as soon as I heard the story they were reading. It just helped set it up to be even better when it went so far out of normal horror movie territory.
I sill do not quite understand how the ritual saves humanity, but I guess this time it didn't.
No, Marty and Dana refuse to finish the ritual so that is the end of the Facility, and I assume the world if their rules are correct.
