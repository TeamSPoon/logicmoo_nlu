Have you seen Moana?
Isn't Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in that?
He sure is. He plays the demigod Maui and is hilarious in it. He even sings!
How's the music in Moana?
The music is great! "How Far I'll Go" was nominated for an Oscar. Moana was also nominated for Best Animated Feature.
Wow! That's impressive.
I think the most impressive thing is how lifelike they were able to make the Polynesian islands look.
Really? The scenery is that good?
It's AMAZING.
I guess I need to check it out!
