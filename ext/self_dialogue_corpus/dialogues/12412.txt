Do you ever watch any movies?
All the time.  I like to watch the Star Wars movies.
I do too! I own them all and watch them all the time.
I do too.  Have you seen the most recent one?
Yes, I saw it in the theater.
I went on opening day when it first came out.
Star wars is more than just movies.  It is fun to collect all the memorabilia too.
I have to agree.  I have shirts, actions figures, and posters too.
We will have to watch one the movies together sometime.
Sounds like a plan.
