I LIKED ELVIS AND ALL OF HIS MUSIC
JAILHOUSE ROCK WAS THE FIRST VIDEO
I ALSO LIKED LITTLE RICHARD
HE WAS THE BEST LOOKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS
MY FRIEND AND I USED TO BLAST "LUCILLE". IT WAS THE BORING NEIGHBOR'S NAME
EVERYTHING WAS SO UPTIGHT IN THE FIFTIES - MUSIC WAS A GREAT ESCAPE
CHUCK BERRY LASTED A LONG TIME
I WOULD LIKE TO GO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON TO SEE HIS RED CONVERTIBLE
HIS SONGS LIKE MAYBELINE WILL LAST A LONG TIME
DON"T FORGET JOHNNY BE GOOD
