Whats your favorite war movie?
It depends, what war?
What do you mean?
Well theres the Vietnam war, World War 2, the Civil war...
I just mean in general, whats your all time favorite?
I would have to say Full Metal Jacket
Why is that?
It really gets in the mind of the soldiers
Yeah thats true
And you can't beat the first half of the movie
I've actually never seen it, whats in the first half.
Well the first half is all of the marines getting their training before they go to vietnam
Wow, so it's like a journey?
yeah, and the sergeant is really tough on them and it's actually kind of funny
Thanks I'll have to check it out
I actually like Saving Private Ryan as well
Thats my favorite!
I take it you are interested in that war in general?
yeah, and I haven't found a World War 2 movie as good as that one
Thats true, the story and acting is really touching
