Do you think that Boogie Cousins and Anthony Davis can co-exist?
Yeah I think they can. I think their games compliment each other
I agree with you on that one.
Cousins can play with his back to the basket a little better and Davis can do a little bit of everything.
Plus Cousins is not a bad 3 point shooter either
Yeah the guys is a phenomenal offensive player, he just has to keep his head on straight.
I think Davis is a good player for him because Davis is calm and can talk him off of the ledge
They just need some other pieces around these guys.
I like that they have Jrue Holiday, but they need some outside shooting.
Yeah if they can get some three point shooters they can open up the lanes more
For sure. This could be a dangerous team going forward
Yeah either that or this blows up in their face
I think these guys will play even better together next year
They are going to be an unstoppable force
I would love to see them make the playoffs next year
Yeah that has got to be their goal, but it's not going to be easy
It's all about their role players. They need a good core
Yeah they do. It can definitely work the fans may need to show some patience
Yeah I think the fans down their are pretty excited.
Yeah the Pelicans are definitely a team to watch out for.
