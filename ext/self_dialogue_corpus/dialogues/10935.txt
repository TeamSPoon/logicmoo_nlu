Have you ever played Ice Hockey before?
No, I have not.
Really? Why not?
I actually don't know how to ice skate.
Wow, that's pretty crazy. I learned how to ice skate when I was 8.
Seems scary, I wouldn't want to try.
It's not that bad! You just need to get the hang of it. You want to go sometime?
Sure. Don't laugh if I fall!
Haha. Sure. Once you learn to ice skate, you can learn how to play hockey. It's a lot of fun
I don't think I'll ever coordinated on ice enough to play hockey.
It's not that bad! Once you get used to skating, hitting the puck is so much fun!
Yeah I suppose so. I'd like to hit a puck.
Right?! And once we start hitting the puck, we can fight each other just like on TV.
Haha! Fights are the best part of hockey!
I'd win the fight on ice everytime.
Of course you would. I don't know even know how to skate.
Yet.
Sure.
So. Ice rink this saturday?
Let's do it.
