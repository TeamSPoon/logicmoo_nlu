So I watched Split the other day.
Oh yeah? How did you like it?
I liked it. It had it's moments.
Like what?
Well, it was really long.
Have you never watched an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
I have! I just didn't think this movie needed to be that long.
Okay. Well what about the actual movie?
I liked how he used the idea of Dissociative Identity Disorder for the villain.
I agree. It was a bold move and it turned out really well.
Yeah, not cheesy at all.
Plus it brings light to the actual disorder.
You're right. Maybe they shouldn't have made him so evil then.
Well when you put it like that.
I'm teasing. Anyways, the girl was interesting though.
She was. But it was a little bit triggering don't you think?
Yeah. I know some people would get easily offended by it.
Well it happens to a lot of people in that way.
So this movie was basically showing the evils of society?
A little bit.
