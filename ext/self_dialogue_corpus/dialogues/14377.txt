Did you see the game  between the Cavs and Celtics.
Yeah, it was a blowout.
The Cavs were winning by 41 points at halftime.
I didn't even watch the second half.
Lebron was doing pretty much anything he wanted.
Isaiah Thomas was having a terrible game. Did you see he is going to muss the rest oif the playoffs?
Yeah, now the Celtics have even less of a chance than they did before.
I think the Cavs are favored by about 15 points in game 4.
I think they should be favored by way more than that.
Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving have been playing extremely well too.
I'm guessing we can get ready for a Golden State versus Cleveland finals again.
I would say there is no doubt about that.
Draymond Green is probably my least favorite player in the history of the NBA.
Everybody thinks Golden State is going to win it, but I'm not so sure.
Cleveland obviously has a very good team, and they did win the championship last year.
I think Golden State might be a little too overconfident. Kyrie had his way with Curry last year.
Klay Thompson couldn't guard him either.
Cleveland does have a better bench this year too.
Well here's hoping Cleveland repeats again.
People would then have to admit that Lebron just might be the best NBA player of all time.
