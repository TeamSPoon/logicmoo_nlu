What did you think of 47 Meters Down?
I thought it was really good.
So did I. Its definitely a change from what Mandy Moore usually does.
I think movies that are set in the ocean are almost guaranteed to creepy without much effort.
Why's that?
A lot of people are afraid of deep, open, water. You almost immediately start thinking about what could be below you.
That's true. I remember after I saw Jaws, every time I went into the ocean I was expecting to be eaten!
That's what directors and writers are counting on, that most people already have that fear.
Can you imagine being stuck in a cage under water? It would be horrifying.
I doubt I'd even get in the cage in the first place, no thank you.
What about the other movie with people stranded?
You mean Open Water?
Yes, that's the one. I'm not sure which is worse being in a cage or having no protection.
As much as I hate cages, I have to think you'd be safer there.
True, but you're all the way on the bottom, no one can see you to rescue you.
Yeah, at least if you're floating, you have a chance of someone seeing out.
I really expected those guys to take off after the girls got stuck in the cage.
I totally did too!  They just met those girls, no reason to hang around.
Wow, remind me never to go shark watching with you!
Oh I wouldn't leave you....probably.
