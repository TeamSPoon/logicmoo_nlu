What Stephen King adaptation is your favorite horror movie?
The Green Mile.
Try again, I don't consider that horror, even if it's the genre.
Umm, you go.
I really liked The Mist.
What's that about?
A fog covers a town and huge inter-dimensional spiders invade.
WOAH, nice for arachnaphobists.
The best part is the ending: they kill themselves to not be killed by the spiders but the fog is so thick that they can't see the military help that arrives 30 seconds later.
Dang, that's intense! But thanks for ruining it.
