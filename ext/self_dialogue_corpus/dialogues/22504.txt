My son wants to watch "an old adventure movie.' Got any ideas?
Haha old like something from our childhood?
Yes, I think that's what he means.
How about Stand By Me?
Oh that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of that.
Has he seen it before?
No, he's only 7 so he's mostly just seen animated stuff and super hero movies.
Oh, 7 may be too young then.
You think? I was pretty young when I saw that.
Maybe it won't appeal to him as much with such a serious tone.
Yeah you're right. Anything else come to mind?
How about The Goonies?
Great suggestion! I can't believe I never showed him that.
There's a lot of adventure in that one.
Yeah and he loves anything having to do with pirates.
He will love it for sure then.
I haven't seen it in so long. Is there a lot of bad language or any nudity in it?
No nudoty, but a couple swear words if I remember correctly.
Ok, nothing he hasn't heard before I'm sure.
Not with the internet and kids these days. Enjoy Goonies with your son!
