Are you a fan of Train?
Yes. I am.
Have you ever seen them live?
Yes and it was royally disappointing. They weren't very good at all.
That's surprising. They don't seem super auto-tuned.
I'm not sure if they actually are. They just don't sound very good live.
That's a really shame. I was going to go buy tickets to their concert.
Well, don't go because of my opinion. Maybe you won't feel the same way I do.
Maybe I will go, then. "Drops of Jupiter" is my all time favorite song.
Mine too!
Did they play it at the concert?
I don't think so, sadly.
Then maybe I actually won't go. That's kind of the reason I was going to go, as crazy as that sounds.
There are much better bands you can go see live than Train!
Who would you recommend?
The Killers. They're fantastic live.
Ooh, maybe I'll look into getting tickets to their concert then.
You should! They play a really great show. Everyone's on their feet the entire time.
Really? That's the type of concert I want to go.
Then make sure you buy tickets soon, they sell out quickly.
