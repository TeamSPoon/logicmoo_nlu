So what do you think about the Sox this year?
They could use a third-base man.
I know. It's the worst in the AL.
I can't believe they really thought Sandoval would be the answer.
He looked good in Spring Training.
True. He actually lost weight.
He did. Maybe he'll be OK when he's back off IR.
I think they should bring up the kid from Portland.
I think he needs at least a few months there. Maybe August.
Hopefully they're in contention come August.
Well, David Price goes tonight I think in Pawtucket.
That would be a big help. Sale can't do it alone.
True that. But he's been must see TV this spring.
The guy has struck out double-digits seven games in a row and counting.
When's his next start.
I'm not sure but I think it might be tonight as well.
Yeah. But it's a late start west coast game.
I hate those games. Oakland tonight right?
Yeah. I'm not sure how they're doing this year.
Me neither. But hey, Billy Beane always has them close it seems.
