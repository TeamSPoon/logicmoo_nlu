Do you listen to classic rock?
Yes I do, quite frequently. What are some of you're favorite groups right now?
I really like Rush, they have really long guitar solos in some of their songs.
What are some of your favorite Rush songs?
Fly By Night and Working Man are great rock songs. I really love listening to them when I work or have a long drive.
Those are good songs and I like their song Freewill.
Yes that's a good one too, so is Tom Sawyer.
They have many great songs and they sound great live in concert.
I saw them in concert too they put on a great live show.
Yes it was almost a three hour concert and I really enjoyed it.
Do you like the band Yes?
I do, Owner of a Lonely Heart is a great song.
That's one of my favorites too.
The Roundabout is another great song of theirs.
They're considered progressive rock do you know any other bands that fit that category?
I think Emerson, Lake and Palmer are part of that genre of music.
Is Jethro Tull considered progressive rock?
Yes they are and I think Deep Purple is too.
I forgot about Deep Purple, and I think the band Triumph is as well.
I haven't heard Triumph in years, I used to like their music.
