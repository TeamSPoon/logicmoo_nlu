Hey did you ever listen to Aerosmith?
Of course!  I even saw them live a long time ago.
Oh wow, I bet that was amazing!  I've always loved their music.
Yeah, me too.  They had so many great songs.
Yeah, and they are still great.  I love What It Takes.
That is a great love ballad.  I love almost all of their music.
Stephen Tyler was a true artist.  I wonder what happened to him?
They're still around, they just don't make music anymore.
They must be pretty old.
Yeah, I think they are.  Remember Love in an Elevator?
Oh yeah, it was great.  And Crazy!
Yeah, that one had a good video with Alicia Silverstone.
I know, I remember it.  A lot of their songs had great videos.
Yeah, that was another unique thing about them.
So what were they like in concert?
They were pretty awesome live.  Their music sounded just as good as it does on the albums.
That's great.  Sometimes it doesn't sound so great live.
Yeah, I know.  We had seats pretty far back but it was still great.
I'd love to see them someday.
I think you've missed your chance for that, bro.
