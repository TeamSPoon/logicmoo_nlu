what kind of music do you listen to?
i listen to a little of everything.
i like techno a lot.
how can you listen to that stuff?
its really relaxing if you listen to it.
all it sounds like is a bunch of noise to me.
i think techno is a kind of new age classical music.
i guess i can see where you're coming from.
you should try listening to it more.
do you have any recommendations?
well, techno has a lot of sub categories to it,
what kind of sub categories?
i like breakbeat the most, but there also dnb, trance, and a lot of others.
who is a good breakbeat artist?
i would recommend dj icey.
ok, i'll check him out.
he's from florida also.
that's where most breakbeat dj's are from, right?
breakbeats blew up in florida in the late 90's.
sounds like something i might be interested in.
