What is your favorite Disney movie? Mine is The Lion King.
I love The Lion King, but I cry every time Simba's dad dies!
Yes, it is literally the most heartbreaking scene in a movie.
It's worse than when Bambi's mom dies.
The music is great, though, right?
Oh definitely - who doesn't sing along with Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa?
What is your favorite song from the movie?
Probably, "I Just Can't Wait to be King!"
Did you like the sequel at all?
No, I thought The Lion King II: Simba's Pride was totally unnecessary.
