I'm trying to decide which Christmas songs to use for the party.
I think i t should be a mix of the classics and some good modern ones.
I have some of the classics like White Christmas and The Christmas Song.
Don't forget All I Want for Christmas is You by Mariah Carey.
That's a good one. I was also thinking of doing Green Christmas.
Oh ya I remember that one. I love Do They Know It's Christmas by Band Aid.
Ya that songs has a good messuage.
I love Mary's Boy Child by Boney M.
I think I will throw a litlte Elvis in too with Blue Christmas.
Yes of course you have to have Elvis.
I also have Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.
Do you have O Holy Night or A Holly Jolly Christmas.
Oh I think I forgot Holly Jolly Christmas.
I also like I'll Be Home for Christmas. Michel Buble has a great version of the song.
How many songs do you think I need.
Hmm.. how long is the party?
It's supposed to last two hours.
I would think twenty songs an hour.
Maybe fifty to be safe.
Thanks I think you should also include Jingle Bell Rock too.
