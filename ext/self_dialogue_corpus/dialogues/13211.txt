What part of Star Wars made you sad?
I got sad when Ben died.
That was sad.
I did not think Vader would kill him.
I also got sad in the third one when that big monster died.
Yes and that one guy was really hurt by it.
I got sad when the thing Luke was riding in The Empire Strikes Back died.
Me too.
There are plenty of sad moments in those films.
Yes. Even an adventure movie like that has sad parts.
