Did you see that Britney Spears is making music again?
I did see that but I haven't listened to it yet.
It's actually not bad.
I wouldn't expect it to be. Britney is a queen.
I think the song I heard was called "Make Me" and it had G-Eazy on it.
I'll check it out. Is it from a new album?
Yeah. The album is called "Glory".
That's awesome. I doubt it will top her old stuff, though.
It definitely doesn't. It's cool she's keeping up with the times, though.
Yeah, it would be sad if she just stopped releasing music altogether. She's an icon.
