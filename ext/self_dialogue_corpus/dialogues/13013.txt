Who's your favorite Star Wars character?
I've never known too much about the films, but I always thought that Darth Vader looked like a cool character.
Not a bad choice for someone who doesn't know much.
Like I said, I always thought he looked and sounded cool.
He is a very cool character. One of the more memorable ones of the series.
I figured as much. I see his face on a lot of Star Wars products in stores.
You're talking about his masked face, right?
Yes, why? Has he ever been unmasked?
Yes, and he's hideous.
Oh. That's a new detail for me.
