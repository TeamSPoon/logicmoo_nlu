Would you consider Rihanna to be a pop artist?
I would consider her to be one.
Her most recent songs are more influenced by hip hop, but her older songs are more pop.
I agree. I love her older songs.
Me too. My favorite is Don't Stop The Music.
My favorite is Umbrella.
I love the music video for that song
Me too, and I love Jay Z's intro in the beginning.
Really? A lot of people don't like that part of the song.
Hm. I've never heard that, but I just think it's nice to see artists working together.
