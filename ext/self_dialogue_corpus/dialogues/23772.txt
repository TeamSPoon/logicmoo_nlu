Let me ask you a question what's your favorite Disney cartoon?
You won't believe me when I tell you it's one everyone forgets.
Well are you going to leave me in suspense?
I actually love the Robin Hood movie it's one of my favorite.
What are we talking about the Robin Hood with the fox from the 70's or 80's?
Yeah it seems like no one even remembers I was a thing.
Wow I barely remember anything from that movie.
It was so old that the animals didn't have names yet.
What you mean?
I mean these days you  you see a bear and you think to yourself oh that's Baloo  but back then when the credits were old it would just said Robin Hood played by "a fox".   The fox didn't have an official name yet.
That's pretty funny.
Yeah I don't know why I always thought that was funny.
That's the only reason you like that movie?
No, you know what's crazy is when you go back and look at those movies how open Disney was with negative portrayals of things.
What do you mean?
In the movie there's a scene where they're super sad music playing and there's animals chained to balls in prison starving.   You could never get away with that today.
You think it would be too graphic for today's audience?
Definitely.
Yea it'd probably cause some social media protest.
What doesn't these days?
