Do you think the upcoming Star War movies will be as good as the original trilogy?
I think it's on track to be.
The Force Awakens was great.
I'm excited for The Last Jedi.
What do you think you think or the prequels?
I think that they're important but not as good as the other movies.
To be fair the bar was set very high.
They recovered and the future seems bright.
I love that they're bringing back the original characters from the first movies like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.
I might cry when I see Carrie Fisher in her last Star Wars movie.
