I was reading this morning about how the Wonder Woman movie broke a record.
What was the record for?
It's the highest earning live action film ever directed by a woman.
Wow. Who was the director?
Her name is Patty Jenkins. She won an Oscar for the movie Monsters, but it's been 14 years since then before she got offered another feature film to direct.
Well, I bet she doesn't have to wait 14 years for another opportunity.
She is supposedly in talks to do the sequel.
It's nice to see women get a chance and succeed.
I love the star of Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot. She became a fan favorite of the Fast and Furious movies, so it probably helped bring fans to the theatres to see her in this.
I heard the movie had done really good at the box office.
It made almost 290 million at the box office. It's in third spot for the highest selling films of this year.
What were the top two?
Beauty and the Beast was first, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was second.
Beauty and the Beast stars Emma Watson in the lead role, meaning women have earned the top two out of three films.
Heroines are really popular these days.
It's really nice to see.
I know, maybe it will set a trend for the future.
Well, they are plotting a Wonder Woman sequel already.
The critics loved this film, they called it "a breath of fresh air."
People are tired of dark, depressing, violence. They want something inspiring and fun.
