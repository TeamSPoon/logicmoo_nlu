Do you think anyone will ever take Michael Jackson's crown as "The King of Pop?"
I highly doubt it. There's some really good artists out there that seem to definitely have the respect and clout though!
Who do you think would get close?
I think the first person who comes to mind is Justin Timberlake. He definitely has been trying to emulate Jackson since N'Sync!
Do you think any new artists get close?
I think The Weeknd is going to be next. He sounds so close to Michael Jackson! I could totally hear him doing a cover of Man In the Mirror and it just being super close to Jackson
I wonder if The Weeknd wrote something more like Jackson if it would resonate with the public though. Pop is so different from the days of Jackson.
I think that Jackson is timeless. It's why every Halloween every knows and does the dance from Thriller. No one in pop comes close!
I guess that's true. JT and The Weeknd seem like they would be next then!
Only time will tell. But I don't think you can replace Jackson!
