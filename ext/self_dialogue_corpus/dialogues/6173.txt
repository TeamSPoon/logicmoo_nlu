I'm trying to find The Lion King on DVD.
Why?
For our Disney collection.
Great movie. Love the music too.
Me too. I can't find it.
Even though he loses his Dad, that is such a happy movie.
Yes, there's a lot of bad going on, but it is cute.
I like Timone and Pumba.
Me too.
The second one wasn't bad either.
