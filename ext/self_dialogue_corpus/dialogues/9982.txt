The most recent Indiana Jones movie was just awful.
i remember seeing it at the theater when it came out and wondering what they were thinking.
It was just a bad plot.  Aliens?  Come on now.
It didn't help that they made it so unrealistic.
Which part are you referring to?
Well, take your pick, but I mean the nuke scene.
Oh, the one where he hid in the fridge?
Yep, that's the one.  Completely ridiculous.
To me, that pretty much signaled the end of the Indiana Jones ever being in danger.
Agreed.  Kind of takes the mystery out of it.
