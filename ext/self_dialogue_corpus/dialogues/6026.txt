You know, ever since Disney took over Star Wars, they've been doing a lot with it.
Star Wars is a popular series. People remember it from when they were kids and they're kind of banking on that to draw people in.
I guess...
I mean, look at the newer stuff with Rey and all. They kind of redid the old stuff by having history repeat itself.
I see what you mean, but it's still kind of about how people can work together to make good things happen if they believe.
Well, yeah, that and the thing with Kylo Ren and Darth Vader and Han Solo.
I miss Carrie Fisher.
Oh, she was amazing. I miss her, too.
Gotta love Princess Leia.
Yeah, gotta love Princess Leia.
