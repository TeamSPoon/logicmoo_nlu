Did you like the Avengers?
It was a great film
Who do you think its the best avenger?
Iron Man, he is the fastest and is pretty strong
The hulk is cool too
He would be better if he could stay under control
It was cool to see iron man in his big suit fight the hulk
They couldn't build anything to contain the hulk
Did you feel bad for Jarvis when you thought he died?
It was kind of sad
