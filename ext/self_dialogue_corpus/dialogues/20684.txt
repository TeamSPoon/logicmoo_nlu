What are some movies that would blow my mind?
What are you trying to do?
I am trying to start thinking a different way.
Have you ever seen the Matrix.
Yes I have already seen that.
Have you seen all three of them?
Yes I have seen the whole trilogy.
Well, what about the Animatrix?
No, I haven't even heard of that!
Are you a fan of anime?
Yes I love that art style!
You should check out the Animatrix then.
What exactly is it?
A bunch of anime directors each did their take on the matrix. There are a bunch of different short movies within the one movie.
That sounds so awesome! So how does it expand on Matrix?
It tells you a bunch of things that the other movies don't.
What sort of stuff is left out of the trilogy?
They don't really say too much about what happened before the events of the movie.
Ah, I see. So all the plot holes get filled.
Pretty much. Go check out the movie and you will never see things the same again.
