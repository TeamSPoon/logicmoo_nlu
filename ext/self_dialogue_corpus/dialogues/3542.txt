Have you seen the new Aliens movie?
Yes. Have you seen it?
No, but i really want to because I loved the first one.
I can't recommend the new Aliens movie because it was really boring.
Oh No! I think James Cameron's movie are always blockbusters!
I agree but this time he missed the mark. The movie was a lot different from the first one.
What was the biggest problem that you had with the movie?
It did not have Sigourney Weaver, the actress from the original!
That is funny! Okay, so you are just in love with the original.
Yeah,  I did like the new reclining seats at the theater so I guess you can go wrong with that.
