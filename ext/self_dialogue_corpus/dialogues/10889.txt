Have you seen the newest Fast and Furious movie?
I haven't actually. The Fate of the Furious, right?
Yeah! That is the one!
Was it any good?
It wasn't my favorite, but I liked it quite a bit.
I just can't imagine the series without Brian.
I know, it was pretty sad. Dom named his baby after him, though.
Dom has a baby!?
Oh shoot! I am sorry that I spoiled it.
It's okay. I will definitely have to watch it now!
