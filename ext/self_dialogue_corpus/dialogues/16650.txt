Hi, so do you like listening to music?
Yes, I love music!
What kind of music do you like?
I like alternative rock, a lot of early 2000s alternative rock that is, and a lot of older stuff too.
What is your favorite band in particular right now?
I like The Cure, I just recently learned about them, but I love their music!
The Cure is a great band, I like them too. What is your favorite song by them?
I like the songs Just Like Heaven and Lullaby, what about you?
With The Cure, my favorite is Love Song.
That's a good one too. What is your favorite kind of music?
I like alternative rock too and rock from the 90s.
What are your favorite bands?
I like AFI and Nirvana the most.
Wow! Those are two very different bands, I haven't listened to AFI much, but I've listened to a lot of Nirvana when I was younger.
Yes, those were the days! Smells Like Teen Spirit was a staple for me!
I like that song too. What is your favorite AFI song?
Gosh, this is a hard one. I've listened to them since I was younger. I'd have to say, silver and cold or Days of the Pheonix.
Days of the Phoenix was like the first song I ever heard from them on MTV.
Same here, I fell in love with their music right then and there.
I can see how, they have some great songs.
