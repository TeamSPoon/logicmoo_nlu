Did you finally see the Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightly?
I did. I ddin't like it as much as I thought I would.
I think you need to watch it again as crazy as that sounds. It's better if you have seen in more than once?
Oh really? I had trouble following the characters and the mom was annoying.
I used to think she was annoying also, but after seeing it a few times I think she was just doing what she thought was best for her daughters.
Hmm... I guess that makes since. I did like the love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy
Yes that is one of my favorite parts. I think it's actually the main theme of the movie that people may not be as they seem at first.
Interesting. So maybe the whole movie isn't how it appears at first?
That was exactly my thought. I didn't really like the movie the first time either, but now that I have seen it a few times I love it.
Well maybe I will watch it again then.
Yes and keep in mind what I said about the mother. I mean even Mr. Darcy seems nicer when you realize he is just protective.
Yes and like with what Mr. Bingley thinks that Jane doesn't really like him.
Yes but she does and she is just too shy to say anything.
Ya that's a good point. Elizabeth is kind of the same as Mr. Darcy but we know why she is acting the way she does.
Ya that's another good point about the movie. I think one of my favorite things is how much depth each character has.
Ya and it took a few years for the whole story to take place I think.
Ya I think you are right. Can you imagine having feelings for someone but then you can't see them again for a few months and you can't even call on a phone?
Yes that would be rough.
Well maybe I will watch the movie again then.
yes please do and tell me what you think the second time.
