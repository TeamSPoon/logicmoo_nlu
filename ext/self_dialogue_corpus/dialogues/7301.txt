When I was in high school Disney re-released some of their iconic animated movies.
I remember that. Did you see many of them?
I saw a lot of them. I recall going to The Jungle Book with a boy I had a crush on.
That must have been fun.
Well, I didn't know he was bringing three of his little nephews with us so it wasn't the romantic outing I had hoped for.
But you enjoyed the movie, yes?
Oh, of course! How can one not enjoy a Disney film?
Did you see the live action version of it?
No, but I hear Idris Elba was good.
He was, and I adore the song .... Bear Necessities!
