Hey is that the new "Katy Perry" song I just heard you playing?
Yes it is
Sounds a lot different from what she usually does
Yeah she decided to try a different approach to her sound this time
Reminds me a lot of "Lady Gaga"
You know what I actually can agree with that sounds very similar
I kind of liked her other hits like "California Girls"
That was a great summer anthem
I know we just had it cranking out at the pool yesterday
Speaking of which you need to have me over sometime to take a dip
