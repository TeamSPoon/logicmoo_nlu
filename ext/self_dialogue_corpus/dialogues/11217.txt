This new trend of barely wearing your coat seems silly to me.
Barely wearing your coat? Isn't that defeating the purpose of wearing a coat?
Yeah. First they came out with that editor's cape foolishness.
I think I remember that one. That was the one where you wore your coat like a cape.
Yeah. The look of oh-so-casually wearing your coat perched atop your shoulders without your arms slung through the sleeves.
I tried that one. I didn't like it much.
Why would anyone like it? It left your arms free to do whatever buy you couldn't raise your in editors' shoulders.
That look was way too restrictive.
The editor's cape is fading into distant memory and is being replaced by something even less practical.
Let me guess. The laid back look of  shrugged shoulder?
Oh. So you have seen that one?
Yeah.  That is worse than the editors' cape.
I think so too.
I mean. Your shoulders and parts of your chest are exposed to the cold.
There is no way you can stay warm on a chilly day dressed like that.
Makes me shiver to my bones just thinking about it.
Especially with the below freezing winters we have had over the past five years.
Yeah. You would freeze to death if you tried that look in our part of the country.
It could work in a state like Florida.
I don't think so.  They don't get all that cold there.
