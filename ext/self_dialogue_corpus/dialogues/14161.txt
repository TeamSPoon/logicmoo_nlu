I can't stop listening to telephone!
Is that a new band?
No it's a lady Gaga song.
Oh, the old one?
It's not that old but yes.
Is that the one she did with Beyonce?
Yeah, it's so catchy.
I really liked the music video to that song.
I don't think I've seen it. I'll have to youtube it.
It's really good. You should.
