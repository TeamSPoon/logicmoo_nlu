Who's shot is it.
It's my shot.
Okay, here is the ball.
Thank you.  What's the score?
I have three, you have two.
I thought that I had three as well!
No, you missed your last shot.
Yeah, okay.  You have to take this shot with your eyes closed.
I can't believe you made that!
Remember, your eyes have to be closed.
There was no way I was going to make that.
It was a pretty good shot.
So now we are tied at 3?
Yes, we are tied.
Do you want to call it a game?
Yeah, that sounds good.
Can I have my basket ball back?
Sure, here it is.  Thanks for the game.
Yeah that was fun.
We'll play again soon.
