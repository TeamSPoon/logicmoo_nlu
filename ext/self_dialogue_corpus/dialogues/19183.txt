Do you like Vince Gill?
I absolutely love Vince Gill.
I do too, he has a one of a kind voice.
He sure does, his song Look At Us is fantastic.
I know! I am going to play that song at my reception for my grandparents to dance to.
That is a great idea.
I thought so, I think it is the perfect song to sum up their life together.
Another good song he sings is Pocket Full Of Gold.
Yes, I like that song too.
Do you have a song picked out for your first dance?
Not yet but I have narrowed it down to three.
What are the three you have chosen.
I Need You by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill is one of them.
That is a good choice.
Ellie Goulding Love Me Like You Do is another choice.
That is unconventional, I like it.
Last but not least is George Strait, I Cross My Heart.
That is going to be a tough decision.
Tell me about it, any suggestions?
I like Ellie Goulding, Love Me Like You Do.
