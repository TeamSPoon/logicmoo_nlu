Have you ever seen the Land Before Time?
I love it. I have the first on DVD.
I do too. Do you like the sequels?
Some of them are OK. There are lots.
I don't like them all.
How many have you seen?
About ten different ones.
I've only seen a few.
You can get the whole collection on DVD now on Amazon.
That would a good gift for y little sister. She loves dinosaur movies.
Doesn't she love movies in general?
Yes, she really does. I think I'll buy her that.
I love big movie collections like that. You get so many for a good price.
True. I buy them sometimes.
I just got a fairy tale one for my boyfriend's daughter.
Does she like it?
I think so. I enjoy fairy tales so it gives us something to watch together.
That's nice. Watching movies together is a good activity for kids and adults to do together.
I like doing that with her.
I like watching with my sister.
