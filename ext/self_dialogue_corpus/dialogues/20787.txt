What your favorite snack for the movies?
I stick with the standard popcorn usually.
That is so boring.
I said usually. It depends on the movie I'm going to see.
What does that have to do with your snack choices?
Well it depends on what I expect from my movie experience, how interactive I'm gonna get.
Interactive...do I even want to know?
Oh come on, I just mean how much I'm going to be moving around.
That is still not a good enough answer.
Well for example if it's a scary movie I don't want to waste a lot of money on other treats in case I start jumping in my seat. You were there with me at Freddy vs. Jason.
Yeah you did get a little...animated.
Hey to be fair when Jason just pops up after someone kills him, you jump or you die.
This is why I don't go with you to movies anymore, but anyway what a bout a comedy?
That's a tricky one sometimes, if it's a movie I know I'm gonna be laughing a lot at I stick to quick swallow snacks like m&ms.
I'm pretty sure you're overthinking this whole thing.
Well don't come crying to me after you choke on a Jujube cause you started laughing.
At least I'd die with a smile on my face and a mouth full of greatness.
True there are worse ways to go, but I choose not to tempt fate; I've seen all the Final Destination movies.
By all means, lets not tempt the gods. Next time we go I'll just stick with Snow Caps.
Dude, don't even joke like that. Those are one of the deadliest candies to get at the wrong movie.
