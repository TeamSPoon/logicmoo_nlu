I have been finding more rock bands I like lately.
What makes a band stand out for you?
I like when they really sing instead of just yelling or growling.
So which bands do you think do that?
Shinedown is an example.
Oh, I love them. Brent is a great singer.
I agree. He has talent.
The best song is 'If You Only Knew.'
That one is good. I love lots of their songs, though.
They are one of my favorite bands as well.
