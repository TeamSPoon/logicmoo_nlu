Do you like the New York Jets?
They are a pretty good team.
Who is your favorite player on their current roster?
I think Matt Forte is good.
Yeah he gets a lot of yards.
I think he is talented.
Who do you think will be starting Quarterback for them?
I think Christian Hackenberg.
Well it depends if Bryce Petty is amazing in the preseason.
Yeah if he plays much better he may start.
They will be competing for sure.
Yeah it could also change throughout the season.
Hopefully whoever they choose does a good job.
Yeah I'd love to see them have a good season.
They haven't won a Superbowl since 1968.
That is a long time.
Yeah it will be 50 years if they don't win next season.
Well hopefully they make a good run.
Yeah even if they don't win they'll want some momentum for the 2018 season.
You are exactly right.
