Have you seen Memento?
Yes! That's a great thriller.
That movie just kept me guessing the whole time.
I had to watch it twice.  It took me a long time to realize it was going on backwards.
I was really suprised that he had already killed his wife's killer.
Me too.  I was really sad at the end.
I'm glad they didn't make a sequel.
Or a prequel.
It was very suspensful.
And very dramatic.
