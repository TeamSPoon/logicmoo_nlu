Did Titans pick up any WRs? They sorely needed some
Mariota is useless withotu anyone to throw the ball to.
Seriously Titans have the worst receiving crew if you ask me.
Yep. They're pretty bad. They picked up that WR from WMU, what's his name?
Oh, Corey Davis!, he was a beast at WMU.
NCAA FBA Division I Career receiving leader. 5278 yards
Of all time?
Of ALL time, going back to whenever they started tracking it.
Dude was a beast at WMU, but he was realy the only WR they had so they had to use him.
Well they had other options, but none were as good as Davis.
i wonder how well he will do with Mariota
Well, at least he will be able to catch his ball unliek Titan's current WRs.
I heard Davis scored 31 on Wonderlic test.
Yep, That's pretty high for a WR. They usually range 17 or so
Yeah, usually QBs have high Wonderlic scores.
The lowest score ever in the NFL was Morris Claireborne who got a 4.
Janitors score 14...
Yep. We're talking borderline retarded. 10 is the cut off for being literate, I think.
Haha, good thing he's good at football.
Probably won't be able to do much else.
