Did you see the Dodger game last night?
Oh yeah. Kershaw was pitching. I never miss the game when he pitches.
I know. I feel the same way. But I thought he looked off last night.
I didn't. Why do you say that? They won.
I know but his fastball was missing bigtime.
But they were swinging at it anyway. I guess they just think it is going to be in there all the time.
The only reason they won was that the big bats were working. I couldn't believe how the game ended.
I missed that...my phone rang and I forgot to pause it. But I heard about it on Sports Center this morning.
Well, it was the bottom of the ninth and they were only winning by 2. Don't you know the Rockies get a single putting a man on 1st base. Then the closer walks a guy. Now a guy on first and second.
Then what happened? How many outs were there?
There were 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth and the count is 3 and 2.
You've got to be kidding.
No way...with 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth, the guy lines one into left field and the players take off running.
Who was on base?
Two of the Rockies best runners.
What happened?
The first runner scores, the score is now 3-2.
I bet the place was going wild.
It was...until the second runner was thrown out at home! The throw from the outfield was perfect.
I could kick myself for not seeing that.
