Inside Out was such a great animation film.
I thought the tones of it were amazing.
The actors in it played their roles perfectly.
Disney does a great job lining up voices and really making it work.
The tone of the conscience now versus back then made me think.
Those are the best kinds of films.
I was not expecting it to be so quick.
The movie flowed amazingly well.
I think they should definitely do a sequel.
Sometimes you have to leave well enough alone though.
