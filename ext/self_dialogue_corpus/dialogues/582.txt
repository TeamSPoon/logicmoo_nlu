Ready for the Patriots to win another Superbowl?
What!
You know it is gonna happen this season.
I know that the Patriots are a bunch of cheaters.
No way they are the best Football team in the NFL
I think the Steelers will destroy them.
Never we have Tom Brady the best quarterback in the whole NFL.
Oh no you are mistaken Ben Rothinsberger is so much better then Brady
Why would you say that.
Ben can actually take a hit if needed and not whiny like a baby.
Tom Brady never gets hit since the Patriots offense is so strong.
Really thats why he was complaining last year about them not protecting him.  At least Ben tries to run when theres an opening
oh no thats the side effect of not being able to throw this year since he blew his fingers of on a fourth of july party.
That was a fake news story.
sounds like something he would do.
No it was fake and he is an excellant quarterback.
Hes no Tom Brady and they are no where near as good as the Patriots.
Guess we will see since preseason is right around the corner.
Thats true we should take our families to a preseason game
Good idea the tickets are cheaper durning the preseason.
