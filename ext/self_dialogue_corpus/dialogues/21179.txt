Did you like The Hangover?
I thought it was amazing.
All 3 of the main actors did a great job.
Even Ed Helms?
Even him
Wow you must have really loved it.
Cooper stole the show but they were all great in what they were doing.
Did you think they needed 3 of them?
No that was probably a dumb decision.
The 2nd one was alright
It was mediocre. Not bad not good at all.
I would concur with you on that.
But the third was just awful.
I thought it had its moments.
It just used the same formula from the first 2.
Dont all movies like that do it?
Yeah but this took it to a new level.
They already had the plot in place just needed new characters.
And thats why I think it stunk
The box office echoes those sentiments!
