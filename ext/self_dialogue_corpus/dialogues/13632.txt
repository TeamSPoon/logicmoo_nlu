I read somewhere that the first Star Wars movie was based on classic mythology.
Yeah, Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth details the elements of classic myth, and Star Wars (I don't call it A New Hope, that's for youngsters) hits all of them.
I think the classic myth elements are what made it such a strong story. You can't beat story structure that's been used for 3000 years, right?
Read Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces and the parallels become really obvious. A young hero called to adventure, training with a Mentor, going on a journey.
This is great stuff. And Lucas modernized the hero myth in order to reach a 20th century audience in a visual medium.
Exactly. I remember when the film first came out. It was such a sensation - it played in theaters for over a year, which in this day and age would be amazing, unbelievable.
Yeah, that was back in the days when there weren't DVDs and Netflix rentals.
I must have seen the movie in a theater over a dozen times, because it was so entertaining. Heck, I saw it two times in a row the first time I saw it - I hid in the bathroom between showings and went right back in for the second go round.
I think it really changed the way science fiction was presented in movies. Everybody wanted to do a Star Wars type film.
Even the second trilogy wanted to be the first trilogy, in the sense of setting a precedent, awe and wonder. But Lucas tried to do it with special effects instead of a good solid story, which is why the prequel trilogy sucked so hard.
