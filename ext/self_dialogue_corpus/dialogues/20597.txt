Have you been to the movies recently?
Yes, I went for the first time in a long time.
Really, what did you see?
I saw the Captain Underpants movie.
Did you go by yourself?
No, the kids talked me into talking the family.
What did you think of the movie?
I wasn't a big fan of it.
Why is that, it got some good reviews?
The language in it was really crude for kids that young.
I bet the kids loved it.
Oh yeah, they couldn't stop laughing, which I guess is the point.
What showing did you go to?
We went to the 9:45am showing, the early bird special.
Was it cheaper?
It's 1/2 price if you go to the first showing of the day.
Wow, that's not bad at all.
I know we always try to hit that showing.  It allows us to buy more snacks at the snack bar.
What's the nest movie you are going to see?
It's going to be Minions 3, can't miss that.
