My friend at Penn State University signed up for a class on The Beatles this semester.
That's brilliant! I wish I could take a class on The Beatles.
I know that Coursera, the free online college course website was offering one at one point.
I'll have to look into that. At the very least, I want to take a book about The Beatles out from the library.
I can only imagine that there are so many quality books about The Beatles. They defined 60s culture in a super significant way.
Yes, as far as Anglo-American culture goes, I don't know who can plausibly be claimed to have a bigger impact.
People talk about Dylan having a huge influence.
That's true, but not Beatles level.
Well, what about the Velvet Underground, weren't so many famous bands inspired to start bands after seeing The Velvet Underground.
There are some prominent examples, but I think if we made an attempt to quantify influence that the Velvet Underground would pale in comparison to the Beatles.
