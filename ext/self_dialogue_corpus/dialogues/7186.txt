Wow, I just watched Tarzan. What a great movie!
You're going to have to be more specific. There's like at least a dozen different movie versions of Tarzan.
I'm talking about the animated Disney version from the 90s.
Oh that one. It was alright, I couldn't get over the gorilla with the Brooklyn accent though.
Are you talking about Terk? I loved him in that movie!
I think you mean "her."
Wait, Terk was a girl? How do you know?
Yes, it was obvious if you were actually paying attention. Disney even got Rosie O'Donnell to voice her.
I had no idea. I'm going to go re-watch it again, I probably missed some other obvious stuff.
Yea, have fun with that.
