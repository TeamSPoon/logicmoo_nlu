Have you heard any good rock songs lately?
No, not really. Music has really gone down hill since the late 90's.
You aren't kidding. I wish music today was like the music back then.
Yes. Everything is too commercialized today.
Even though early 90's music and rock was good, there were still some good bands in the early 2000's.
Yes, Godsmack, Disturbed, Three Days Grace.
Our Lady Peace, Slipknot.
Oh yeah. I forgot about those two bands.
How could you forget about Slipknot?
Maybe they blew out my eardrums and part of my brain.
Haha. Yes, they were loud and intense.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
Nope. I wish I had back in the day. I went to a Rob Zombie and Godsmack concert back in 2001.
Rob Zombie. He's awesome.
Yes. He was awesome. His newer stuff really mellowed out and became uninteresting.
I tend to agree with that.
His early stuff was headbanging, and then sometime around 2007, he really went down hill.
I think maybe because he was focusing more on making movies than making music.
That's a shame because he was a music genius when he put his full energy and time toward music.
Yes. For sure.
