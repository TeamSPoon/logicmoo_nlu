Did Cleveland lose their NFL team?
Yes and no.
What do you mean?
In 1995, the owner moved the team to Baltimore. But, through a complex set of agreements, the franchise remained in Cleveland.
So, one team became two teams?
Yes, but it didn't happen all at once.
What happened?
The Browns franchise became dormant for several years.
When did it return?
The Browns again took the field in 1999.
How have things gone since their return?
It can be argued that they are the worst NFL team in the new millenium.
Wow, that's pretty bad!
Yes, there are several pieces of evidence for such a bold claim.
What is this evidence?
They have no playoff wins during that time.
Have they even made it to the playoffs?
Yes, in 2002, they made it. But, they immediately lost.
How about winning seasons?
They have had only two winning seasons in the new millenium.
