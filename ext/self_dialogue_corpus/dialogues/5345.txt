What's your favorite Disney movie?
I'm not sure, maybe Cinderella.
That's an old one.  Why that one?
I don't know, maybe because it's a traditional story.
Have you been to Cinderella's Castle at Disney World?
Yep, I have pictures of the kids there.
What's the wicked stepmother's name again?
It's Lady Tremaine I think.  And the cat's name is Lucifer.
Hah, that's fitting I guess.
Yeah, and the evil stepsisters are Anastasia and Drizella.
