By far, the strangest thing that has happened in baseball in recent history was White Sox pitcher Chris Sales going nuts with the scissors.
Why, was he running with scissors?
No, seriously, he went nuts with a pari of scissors. It got him suspended.
How do you get suspended for a pair of scissors?
He was pissed off because he thought the White Sox were way too focused on selling jerseys and other merchandise.
Was he mad they weren't focusing on him?
Well, sort of. He thought they would care more about the players than they did the sale of merhcandise.
So what happened with the scissors?
He grabbed a pair and cut up a bunch of the throwback jerseys in the team's clubhouse.
You mean those jerseys displayed with great pride and highly valued?
Yes, pretty much. He cut them to pieces.
And how did that go over with the team?
He was suspended for 5 games.
Is there a specific rule about not cutting up jerseys that aren't yours?
No, but he destroyed team property or equipment, violated team rules, and was insubordinate.
Insubordination: that's code for "you pissed off the wrong people", isn't it?
Yes, pretty much.
Did they do anythng else to him.
Besides the suspension? No I don't guess so.
They should have given him a pair of those safety scissors with the round edges that can't cut anything.
