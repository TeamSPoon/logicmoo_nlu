What did you think of the new Nemo movie.
Finding Dory?
Yes, with Ellen Degenres.
I thought it was so cute!
I loved the way they showed her family.
The dad, even as a fish, some how managed to look as if he had a receding hairline.
A receding fin line.
It was also kind of sad.
I cried when it showed the flash back to her family.
I was glad it ended on a high note though.
