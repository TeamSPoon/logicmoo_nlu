Football season is almost here!
Yes, it is. Are you ready for some football!?
Of course. Falcons gonna take it all the way this year.
You're crazy. How can they come back from that beat down in the last Super Bowl?
Their offense is prolific. You'll see.
Prolifically silly, considering the fumble they had last year.
Shut up! You know Matt Ryan was on fire last year.
That's true, but that's not enough for a ring.
Whatever. Who will you root for this football season?
I don't really have a team, but I like what the Raiders look like.
Oh, yeah. They are going to be amazing, I think.
I think so too. Derek Carr is an amazing QB.
He reminds me a lot of Big Ben, actually.
I can see that. I think he's better than Cam.
Me too. He just needs a better supporting cast on defense.
Exactly. Their offense wasn't the problem last year.
Yeah, if anything, their offense was too good. Their defense was always back on the field so soon.
Same issue you Falcons had in the Super Bowl!
Oh, man, too soon. 28-3... I'll never forget it.
Good, don't! Use it for fuel next year and maybe they will win a Lombardi Trophy!
