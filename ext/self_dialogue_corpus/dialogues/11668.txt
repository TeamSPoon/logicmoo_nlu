Hey what is your favorite Beatles song?
I want to Hold Your Hand
Any reason why?
Oh yes, when my mom had me as baby about a month old they sang the song on TV and she was holding me and dancing to it
Wow how special! What other songs?
Hey Jude
I like that one too! Any others?
In my life!
I love that one too!
They are one great band! So sad what happened to John Lennon.
