Have you seen any good Sci fi movies lately ?
All the time !
Like what, what are some good ones
The Star Trek series is always great.
The new movies right ?
The new ones. The old ones. They all have their own appeal.
Aren't they like Star Wars ?
Not in any way!! They are not even remotely similar movies.
In space right. Same.
No. Star Trek movies are about humans. From earth.
And Star Wars is aliens. No aliens in Star Trek movies ?
Yes! It has aliens. But it's about humans. Exploring. Learning.
So. No ewoks in Star Trek movies.
Not even one. Whole other  world.
So there is no Death Star in Star Trek ?
No. Just stars.  And beyond them in the movies.
Are the old movies the same characaters as the new ones?
For the lost part the movies are kind of similar.
So it's just a remake ?
No it's similar but a newer premise added
