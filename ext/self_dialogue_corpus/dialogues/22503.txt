Have you seen Moana yet?
No.  I have not.
Neither have I but I really want to because my little niece and nephew watch it all the time.
I have heard it is really really good.
I am serious girl.  They watch it at least twice a day, every single day.
Oh!  Now I understand what all those internet memes are about.
When I saw the preview though, it made me so nostalgic for Hawaii.
It does look like the animation and design are very well done.
And come on, it has The Rock in it.
Right?  Who doesn't love The Rock.
He even sings in the movie.  I really want to hear it.
He is the last person that I would picture singing.
I do think though that it is based on true Hawaiian myths and legends.
I just love that whole culture.  Is the movie out on DVD yet?
Yep.  I need to just borrow it from my sister in law and watch it.
And you haven't yet!
Hah, No, just too busy lately.
Well, we should watch it together sometime.
Ooh yes!  That sounds like a great idea.  Let's plan a girl's day watching Moana.
I'll bring the popcorn.
