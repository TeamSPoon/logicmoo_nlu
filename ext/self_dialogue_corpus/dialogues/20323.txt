Peter jackson brought the best books to life
But they had flaws
And what does not have flaws
I guess that is true
Everything has flaws
Well yeah
But that does not mean it cannot be amazing
Well i guess
I am serious
I know you are
Well you sound like you think i aint
Well i just disagree
Have you seen all his films
No
What ones have you seen
Just the lord of the rings
Well duh
What?
He has done so much better
Has he?
