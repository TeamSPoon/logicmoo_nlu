Ok, so horror flicks.  What's your favorite?
Got to be Nightmare on Elm Street. All of them.
Yeah, I really liked the first one.  Thought Freddy Kruger was real creepy.
What is your favorite?
Oh, I'm more of a horror of the mind kind of guy.  Like Hannibal and the Wolfman.
Anthony Hopkins kind of stuff.
Yeah, horror but makes you think too.  Another one is The Rite.
Seen that.  It's pretty intense. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
That's the kind I like.  Where you are biting your nails but still trying to figure just what's going on.
Yeah, but still nothing like a big old clawed hand coming at you.
