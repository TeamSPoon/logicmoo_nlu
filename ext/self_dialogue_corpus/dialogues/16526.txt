Barry Manilow is on tour again. Have you ever seen him live?
No, I haven't. He's not really my musical cup of tea.
You don't like any of his songs?
I guess "Mandy" is good.
That's a classic.
And I like "Weekend in New England".
All right. So you do like his music?
A couple of his songs are OK.
I can't believe he's still performing live. He's in his 70s.
He's still got to make a living.
I think he just loves performing. He probably has enough money by now.
My mom is a big fan of his.
Mine, too. My whole family. I've seen him in concert a few times.
Where is he on tour?
He's got a gig coming up in Uniondale, NY.
I see. Well, I don't think I'll be going. You?
Yeah, I was just about to get tickets.
How much are the tickets?
Why? Do you want to see his show?
Yeah, maybe. You might be able to talk me into it.
