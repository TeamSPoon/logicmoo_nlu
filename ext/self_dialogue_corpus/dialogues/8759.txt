So, check it, I watched this documentary the other day on Quiet Riot.
Oh, man, there's a name I haven't heard in awhile.
Yeah, I know!  Love their song "Cum On Feel the Noize".
That brings me back... I used to listen to that as a kid a lot.
Me too.  So, anyway the documentary is about the band's drummer and the history of the band, and how he's trying to reform in current times.
Oh, did they succeed in that?
Yes, sort of.  The lead singer died from a drug overdose, so they had to hold a audition to replace him.
Oh, I bet that didn't make a lot of the fans happy.
Yeah, they mention that in the documentary, and even really a powerful scene where the guy interviews the leader singer's mom and gets her permission to do it.
It sounds pretty good, I'll have to look it up!
