Did you go to cinema to watch Cars 3 during the weekend?
No, I am not a fan of Disney's cartoon movies.
That is a pity. The movie is quite entertaining indeed.
What do you like most about Cars 3?
Well, I like many things, like the characters and storylines, but I like the music most.
Do you like other Disney movies?
Yeah, such as Pirates of Caribbean and Star Wars.
Star Wars is produced by Disney?
Yeah, Disney bought Lucas's films a few years ago.
That is interesting. It looks Disney produces many different types of movies.
