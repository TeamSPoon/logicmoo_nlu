Did you know American Football grew out of English sports such as rugby and soccer?
Yeah, it became popular on American college campuses in the late 1800s. The NFL was founded on August 20, 1920.
I did not know that.
Technically, it was the American Professional Football Association. 2 years later it changed its name to the National Football League, which would ultimately become the major league of American football.
You are just full of fun football facts, aren't you?
Yep.
Did you know the most watched television event in the United States is the Super Bowl?
That's not surprising. It's almost like a major holiday.
Did you know it takes about 600 cows to make one full seasonâ€™s worth of NFL footballs?
Wow, that's a lot. I guess all that beef gets served during the game!
Seriously, Wilson Sporting Goods Company from Ada, Ohio, has been the official football supplier for the NFL since 1941.
That's a good gig to have.
Yeah, they make more than 2 million footballs of all sorts every year.
Crazy! They don't call it America's favorite past time for nothing!
Isn't that baseball?
No, football, especially the degree to which those NFL players play is so major.
Yeah, well think of the cow.
The cow?
A cow has only a 1 in 17,420,000 chance of becoming an NFL football that is used in the Super Bowl!
That is nuts, you would be better off playing the lottery. Though I don't think becoming a Superbowl ball would be a big win for that cow!
