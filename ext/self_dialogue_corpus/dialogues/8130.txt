What do you think about pop music these days?
For the most part, I think there are some pretty entertaining songs out there.
I agree.  What artists do you like?
I hate to admit it, but I do like some of Justin Beiber's stuff.
Yes.  I wouldn't run around admitting that, especially to your kids.
I also like some of the other stuff.  I think Lady Gaga is super talented.
There are so many people that aren't that talented, but they have the right people behind them.
The also have the benefit of studios that make their voices sound in tune.
There is so much variety right now.  I think you can usually find something you will like.
I agree, and there continues to be more and more songs coming out all the time.
