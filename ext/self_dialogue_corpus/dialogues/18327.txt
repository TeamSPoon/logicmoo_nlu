What do you think of Bruno Mars?
I am pretty tired of him
Really?
Yes.
I love his stuff
I do not like pop
You don't like any pop?
None, except maybe 80's stuff
Like Britney Spears?
No. I mean New Kids on the Block
Oh, who are they?
They are a great band. They have some great songs
I shall give them a listen
I do not like Bruno though, or the other pop artists
Those are like our only choices now
I know. It seems like there is no other music around
I bet there are still some you would like out there
I doubt it
Then try listening to Bruno Mars
Okay, let me hear a song I have not heard yet from him
