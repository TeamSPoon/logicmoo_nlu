If Walt Disney were still alive, he would have been really proud of "Frozen".
Definitely, with the beautiful animation and memorable songs.
Did you know they created a whole new software just to animate Elsa's braids?
That's dedication!
I've always loved the colorful, surreal animation in Fantasia.
Me, too, especially the Vivaldi "Four Seasons" section.
Who do you think should play Mary Poppins in the sequel?
Why not Lady Gaga?  She sung "Sound of Music" songs so beautifully when she presented the award to Lady Gaga.
One of my favorite surprises for an attraction at Disney World was the comedy show for Monsters, Inc.
I liked it, too!  It was like a Disney version of Don Rickles.
