I just saw Rogue One.
Cool.  I've lost count.  Where is this in the chronology?
Just after Star Wars 3.
What happens?
A young woman tries to save her dad, a Death Star designer.
Neat.  Does she succeed?
No, he gets killed.
Too bad.  What else happens?
She gets the schematics to Princess Leia before getting killed.
Tragic.
