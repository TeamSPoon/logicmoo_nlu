Hey, have you started using Spotify yet?
I actually signed up a month ago! It's changed the way I listen to music.
Me too! I love being able to download playlists for listening on-the-go.
Have you discovered any new bands on Spotify?
I actually have been obsessed with this group called Dove & The Wolf.
I've never heard of them. Tell me more about them!
It's two French women, and they make dreamy pop music. It's very relaxing music.
That sounds great. I'll have to check them out.
What about you? What have you been listening to?
Oh, you know how much I love Andrew Bird.
I listened to him a bit in high school, but what new material does he have?
His latest album "Are You Serious" is a masterpiece.
He's quite the wordsmith!
And playing the violin like he does?
Have you been to any concerts recently?
Actually, yes! I just saw Conor Oberst. He's fantastic on recordings, but even more so live!
I love Bright Eyes! His solo stuff is pretty good too.
Agreed! He's just an all-around genius. Our generation's Bob Dylan.
Check out Dove & the Wolf and you've inspired me to go listen to some Bright Eyes.
Will do! Talk to you later!
