I got an extra ticket to see Iron Maiden this weekend. Do you wanna go?
Iron Maiden! Yeah I wanna go. They're fantastic.
I know! I hope they play Empire of Clouds from their new album, Book of Souls! Its so epic!
Didn't Bruce Dickinson write that one?
Yeah, he did. He's a great songwriter. Have you heard any of his solo work?
A few songs, but I'm less familiar with his solo stuff.
I recommend the album The Chemical Wedding. Its so good.
I'll have to check it out. You know, I heard that Bruce Dickinson is also a pilot.
Yeah! He usually flies the band around when they're on tour too!
Awesome! I've heard the plane is Iron Maiden themed too! I'd love to see it in person.
