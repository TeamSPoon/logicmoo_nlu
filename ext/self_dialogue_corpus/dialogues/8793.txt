I'm glad to see Third Eye Blind still going strong.
I am too but it's also bittersweet knowing that there's only two left from the original lineup.
That's always disheartening but new blood can bring new flavors to the music.
I guess so but Kevin Cadogan and Stephen Jenkins were magic together.
That I cannot deny so I agree that it's sad to see them not writing together.
Not that I don't like their new stuff, Dopamine was a great record.
Glad you agree, lots of great and catchy stuff on there.
Heck, I even liked the follow up EP We Are Drugs.
I think that EP is their strongest work since Blue in my opinion.
Better than Out Of The Vein, you're crazy.
