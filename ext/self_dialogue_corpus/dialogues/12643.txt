Do you remember that scene in 'Return of the Jedi' when Leia tells Luke she remembers her mom's face?
Yes I do.
Well, how does Leia remember?  Didn't Padm√© die during childbirth?
That brings up a very interesting dilemma.  You're right.
Do you think Leia was referring to her adoptive mother?
Or maybe it's possible because Leia is force sensitive, like Anakin and Luke.
I think the Force answer makes more sense narratively than the adoptive mother theory.
Though, perhaps we're giving too much credit.  Maybe it was just a plot hole between the prequel and main series.
That is probably the most likely scenario.
This kind of thing just reminds me why I didn't like the prequel movies.
