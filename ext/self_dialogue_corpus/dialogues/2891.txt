Have you seen the 49er depth chart this year?
Not yet.  Why do you ask?
Because it's arguably the worst in the league.
I thought they were okay on the defensive side.
Their defense is young and they've stockpiled some talent there.
Right, I'm not too concerned about that.
They drafted that Solomon Thomas and he's supposed to be super good.
Plus Eric Reid and a good stable of linebackers.
Defensively, they can hang, it's offense that's the problem.
Their offense is pitiful
With Kaep gone, I think Brad Hoyer is starting?
Seriously?  Yuck, that's all I can say.
It's the worst QB situation in the league by far.
Who's their backup even?
I think it's Matt Barkley who's on his 4th team by now or something.
I can't believe they didn't go after a QB harder.
I imagine that this year's draft will see them look for their next Montana or Young.
I would accept a shell of that over Hoyer.
They will struggle this year.  They just need some playmakers.
Give them a few years and maybe they can push.
