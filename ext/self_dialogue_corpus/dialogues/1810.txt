You ready for some NFL football?
My jersey hasn't been worn in 6 months. I can't wait to break it out.
Who is your team?
The Patriots are my passion.
I can't stand the Patriots but I recognize they are doninating the sport.
You can't argue that Tom Brady is the best QB in ages.
Maybe he is. He has had a strong team surrounding him.
True and we have a great coach.
There are a lot of good quarterbacks in the league.
I thought Aaron Rodgers would have had a great season last year.
Me too. That guy is distracted my something off field.
Brett Favre never let the pressure get to him.
It is a shame Favre didn't retire with the Pack.
At least they retired his jersey.
I know but he went and played for the rival Vikings.
You do what you got to do.
That would be like Tom Brady going to play for the Giants.
Peyton Manning continued to play for the Broncos and got another Superbowl ring.
That was inpressive.
It was a beautiful way to retire after a wonderful career.
