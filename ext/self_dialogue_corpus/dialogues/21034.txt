Have you seen the new Star Wars movie?
Rogue One or Force Awakens?
Rogue One is the one I'm talking about.
No, I haven't seen it yet.
You should go see it.
I heard that it wasn't that good
I thought the movie was alright.
I might watch it then.
What about the Force Awakens?
I saw that on opening day.
What did you think of the Force Awakens?
I thought it was a fun movie.
Agreed, it was visually stunning.
It was a good looking movie. I hope the next one is better.
Have you seen the trailer for the next Star Wars movie?
Yeah I saw The Last Jedi trailer.
What did you think of the trailer?
Looks pretty good. I'll probably see it in theatres.
Same. I feel they are can't miss movies to watch in theatres.
I would agree with you there.
