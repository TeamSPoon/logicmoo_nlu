Do,you think there will be any surprises in the NFL this year?
There is usually a couple of teams who surprise us.
Yes. Some teams catch some breaks.
I've seen a few crazy predictions.
What have you seen?
I've seen Tennessee predicted to win 13 games.
That's a bit of a stretch.
I've seen someone having the saints winning 14 games.
Wow,that's a bold prediction.
Some think the Cowboys will win 12 games.
I don't agree with that.
I don't either.
How about Houston and the chiefs winning 13 games.
Wow,I'm not agreeing with that.
Crazy things happen in the NFL.
Every year brings surprises.
I've even seen the bengals are picked to win 12 games.
Even the eagles are picked by some to win 11 games.
That's a tough NFC east.
It's like the old days.
