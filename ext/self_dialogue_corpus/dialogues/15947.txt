What's your thoughts on The Beach Boys?
I never cared for them.
You know,me either.
I just didn't get the whole beach and car scene.
I have to agree.
My brother thinks I'm nuts not liking their music.
Why does he think that?
Because I'm a huge Beatles fan.
Oh I get it. The Beatles say The Beach Boys influenced them.
Exactly. He's right about the harmonization. I get that part.
I understand that too.
It's just like I could never get into the songs or the music for some,reason.
It never flipped my switch either.
I guess if I lived in California it would be different.
Oh it would be much different.
I've always lived on the east coast.
Me too. Give me the Beatles any day.
Oh I am with you there.
Brian Wilson touring with Pet Sounds I hear.
Yes he is. No thanks for me.
