Do you think they'll make an Auqua man movie?
I'm not sure.
They kind of referenced him in Batman Vs. Superman.
And he will be in the Justice League movie.
True, but I don't know if he'll get his own feature.
I hope so. I really like that actor.
What else has he been in.
He's the lead on a Netflix Original.
Huh...
Also, he was in Game of Thrones.
