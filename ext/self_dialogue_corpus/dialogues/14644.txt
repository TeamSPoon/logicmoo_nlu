Excited for Game 7 on Monday?
Yeah I am I just dont know why it cant be Sunday
I agree, bigger audience.
That and they need to do every other day.
These playoffs do seem to drag.
If you think about it, its almost half the season long!
Well who do you think is going to win?
I will say Boston.
Yeah me too, its crazy to think how it got to a game 7.
Well Thomas has played really well but Wall has as well.
I think Cleveland is just resting and gonna sweep whomever makes it next.
That could be true but the opposite could happen.
LeBron is too good to have stagnancy set in.
He is, him in the Finals is getting ridiculous.
Still not on MJs level though.
He will never be, its time to stop debating.
We just dismiss Kobe too.
Well he never had a run of dominance like that.
He had the supporting staff to do it.
Yeah he might be the best we never talk about. Just always James or Jordan
