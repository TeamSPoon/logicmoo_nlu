Do you like rap or hip hop?
I used to, but this new stuff sucks!
What about the new rap is bad?
I can't even understand them anymore!
But before it was a lot better? I've always had a hard time understanding
Well they used to be fast like Twista or Busta Rhymes, but that was okay
But now with XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert it's gone too far?
oh yeah, way too far
They just mumble and use too much auto tune!
Autotune isnt a bad thing though!
Well if T-Pain uses a little bit it's okay but there's a point where its too much
Where can I get good rap then?
I like Hopsin?
Is he famous or is he new?
he is popular on Youtube but  not very mainstream yet
What's he rap about?
He raps about how rap sucks
That's pretty ironic!
Yeah, his lyrics are dope though. Like on par with Eminem
Well I'll give him a shot and tell you what I think!
