Did you hear that Prodigy from Mobb Deep died?
Yeah i heard, he was only 42 years old.
Mobb Deep was one of my favorite groups growing up.
Yeah they have some great song in their resume for sure.
One of my favorites is Quiet Storm.
That song tore up the charts for a while when it was first released.
I know, it still holds weight till this very day.
I love the song Shook Ones.
Man that beat gives me chills every single time i hear it.
I'm a have to blast The Infamous album later today in his memory.
