Did you like adam driver as kylo ren?
Yes.I think he is very talented. I also liked daisy ridley a lot.
Ya the rae character needed someone like her not too sexual more badass female.
I am interested to see her develop now that she has meet up with luke.
Me too. I think she is desitined to be super powerful as hinted at.
I  am sure it will take some convincing on her part to be trained by luke.
Maybe or maybe he knows she was destined to play a certain part and convinces her.
Either way the star wars movies are getting really good again.
Ya, some of them were not as good ... episode 2 for instance.
Agreed, but now they are back to really captivating story and acting as well. Too bad george isn't more involved.
