Did you see the Dodgers game last night?
No. I was watching a different game.
It's too bad that you missed it.
Why's that?
It was a 9-0 shut-out.
Wow. The Dodgers are doing great this year.
They sure are. What game were you watching?
I was watching the Red Sox and Yankees.
They are such an intense rivalry.
They are. That's why I usually try to catch their games.
So, who won?
The Yankess beat the Sox 2-1 in extra innings.
How late did the game go?
I watched until about 11:30 until I finally had to go to bed.
How many innings was it.
Oh, I think it went to like the 15th inning or something like that.
Wow. When games drag on like that sometimes it just becomes too much baseball.
Yes. The whole thing was a real ptichers battle.
I'm not surprised. Both teams have really good pitching staffs.
I think so too. Their sluggers usually don't do much when they play against each other.
