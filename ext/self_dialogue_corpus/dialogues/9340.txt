Do you prefer west coast or east coast rap?
I definitely prefer west coast rap.
Tupac has always been my favorite.
It's a shame he died so young.
I also loved old school EZ-E and NWA.
Yes, that was when rap was at it's infancy.
Are there any current rappers you like?
I definitely like to listen to Eminem.
He's for sure one of my favorites. I love his lyrics.
His music can take you to dark places, but he always keeps it real.
