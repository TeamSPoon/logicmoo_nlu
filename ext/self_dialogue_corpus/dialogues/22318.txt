Did you go to the movie theaters this past weekend?
Yeah. I did.
What did you go and see?
Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales.
How was it?
I thought the beginning with the good, visually this film is fantastic.
Okay, what about the rest of the movie.
the special effects of all of the ships, the destruction, the villainous characters, it's all very well done and doesn't take you out of the film at all.
What about the story line?
The first half was great but it just got so strange after that. The final battle was so confusing and weird but some of the sexual jokes were quite funny.
So this is not as the good as the first two Pirates of the Caribbean is it?
Not to me. It could've been better and had a really quirky second half but it was at least enjoyable.
Well, at least you thought it was enjoyable.
For the most part. That Turner kid was a boring character and for some reason Jack don't sound like he used too.
Do you think you went into this movie expecting too much from it?
No. If I am paying my money to be entertained, then I should be entertained.
You think this movie is over hyped?
Yes. Yes I do.
I guess it time to retire this franchise.
Nah, just time for something different with it. Because what they are doing now, is killing it.
