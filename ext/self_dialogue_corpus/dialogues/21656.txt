I'm kind of surprised DC Comics hasn't tried to make another Constantine film.
It probably wouldn't fit in very well with the DC Cinematic Universe they're building.
Please, if Doctor Strange can fit in with The Hulk and Spider-Man there's no reason Constantine can't join Batman and Wonder Woman.
Who would even play him? Should Keanu Reeves back?
It's not like he's aged a ton. But no, I'm sure they'd want to start fresh.
It's probably for the best, that Constantine movie wasn't that great anyway.
You know, I actually kind of like it. It's not great, but it's not bad.
I don't know what the deal with that film is. It's sort of like a cross between a gritty R-rated supernatural thriller and a big budget comic movie.
Hmm, I suppose it sort of is a bit of both, but not really committed to either one.
There are a few action scenes, but not too many. What's there is good, but it's short.
Come to think of it, I think Ghost Rider actually had stronger action scenes than Constantine.
Well, the first one anyway. Either way, Constantine is better than both Ghost Rider films.
I'm not arguing. The second Ghost Rider was terrible.
I can't believe they got the guys behind the Crank films, and somehow managed to make a boring Ghost Rider movie. Crazy.
Eh, it happens. Sometimes despite a director's best efforts, things just don't come together right.
Yeah, yeah, whatever. It doesn't excuse the film being boring.
Yeah, at least Constantine is entertaining all the way through.
It definitely had interesting ideas if nothing else. The way they use water to travel to the other side was neat.
I could definitely go for another Constantine film. A sequel or a reboot or whatever.
I don't think it'll happen, but I never thought we'd see a movie where Batman and Superman fight each other, so anything is possible.
