Do you think the Beatles are the greatest band ever?
I really do.
What's your reasoning?
They were unbelievably innovative and their music still holds up.
Don't you think they're a bit overrated though?
Not at all, their music crosses so many genres.
Do you think anyone could top them?
I really don't know how, because there isn't much room for innovation any more.
So what's your all-time favorite Beatles song?
I would have to say the Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End meddly
