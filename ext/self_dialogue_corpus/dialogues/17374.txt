Hey, how was the Sigur Ros concert?
Oh, man, it was really good.
Where did they play?
They played Stage AE.
Was that the inside stage or the outside?
Originally it was supposed to be outside but because of the threat of rain they moved it inside.
Cool.  What did they sound like?
Pretty good.  They were really mellow.
I bet.  What was the crowd like?
Very loud, actually.  I could hardly hear the band.
Oh, that's disappointing.  But you still liked it?
Yes, they played a lot of my favorite tunes.
Like what?
Staraflur, Aegetis, and a few others off that same album.
I've always been a big fan of Valtari.
They played Ekki m√∫kk off that album!
Wow!
Yeah, it was very cool.  They played their guitars with actual bows.
I bet it was cool to see.
It really was!
