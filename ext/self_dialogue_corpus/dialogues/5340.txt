I'm so excited to see that Toy Story has a new movie coming out.
Oh really! I didn't know that.
Yeah it doesn't come out until 2019 but I'm super excited.
Are they keeping with the original cast?
Yes. So far Tim Allen and Tom Hanks willbe taking their roles.
Oh now I'm excited! I wonder what this one will be about.
It's suppose to be about Buzz and Woody going to rescue Bo Peep and bring her home.
Well we will have to go see that in theater for sure. I'm so glad they are keeping with the classics.
I know I love being able to share my childhood favorites with my own family.
I hope they keep going with the Toy Story movies, so more generations can grow up with true classics.
