Can you help me find a movie? I can't seem to find "Kill Bill".
Oh, yes m'am. It's right over here in the Action section.
Can you tell me anything about it? One of my friends recommended it.
Of course! It's of my favorites, mainly because Uma Thurman is so amazing in it.
It's a Quentin Tarantino film, right?
Yes! It's full of his signature style: Great music, crazy samurai fights, and funny dialog.
So what' so great about Uma Thurman? I mean other than she's a beautiful blonde?
She's a very strong actress, and her stunts are just about unbelievable in this. She really worked hard to make it exciting.
Does she do sword fighting in this? How did her character learn how to do it?
She's one of a group of new-age samurai, that all work for this guy named Bill. he's played by none other than David Carradine!
The name sounds familiar, but Ican;t place him. What else was he in?
He played Quai Chang Kane in the old series, "Kung Fu"!
Huh, oh,yeah. I remember that. "Grasshopper!"
Hehe, yeah, but in this he's an older American dude who loves to train gall and guys to be mercenaries.
Does he do any Kung Fu in this?
No, it's mostly Uma who does the fighting, along with a lot of other characters.
So what's the storyline? I really can't seem to get it from this DVD cover.
Uma's character is a mercenary who defects from the group and decides to get married and raise a kid. Bill doesn't like that, because he's in love with her, so he has his bunch kill her off.
But...how does she survive? I don't get it.
She goes into a coma for years, and when she wakes up, she gets revenge upon Bill's group by killing them off, one-by-one. Enjoy!
