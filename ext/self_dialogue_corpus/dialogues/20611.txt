Have you seen Blood Sport the movie?
Of course, it's a classic.
Yea that's my favorite Van Damme movie.
I don't know that it's my favorite Van Damme movie.
What's your favorite then?
I'm not sure. Maybe Time Cop.
Oh yea Time Cop was really good.
Yea, blood sport was great too, but Time Cop actually had a story.
Blood Sport had a story. It was about a martial arts master honoring his teacher.
I guess you can call that a story. But there was no actual reason to fight.
There was after the main villain put his friend in the hospital.
No there wasn't. It's called Blood Sport, that's part of the game.
I guess so. But the fight scenes alone in that movie got me so motivated to get in shape.
Yea me too, I remember working out in my room while listening to the soundtrack.
Van Damme actually has been doing a lot of movies recently.
Yea, I know he did that documentary piece, and then started doing a lot of straight to dvd films.
Yea but he was also in the expendables, and in my opinion, was a great villain.
He was amazing. Too bad they killed him off.
Yea, I would love to see him return as a bad guy.
Who knows, maybe we'll see him in Fast n Furious some day.
