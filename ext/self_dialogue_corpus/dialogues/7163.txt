The Lion Kind was such a classic
I think it was one of the most popular movies
the part when his dad died made my dad cry
it made me cry also ! It was so sad
The hyenia's really scared me, they were so gross
they were, I liked the pig though he was funny
the music was also really good, what was your favorite song ?
The Circle Of Life was the best song in there
It was one of the best, it made you feel like anything was possible
it did and when he grew up he was the king and he had a son, a happy ending.
