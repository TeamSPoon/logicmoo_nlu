Did you get a chance to see the Pittsburgh and Ottawa game?
Yeah, It was a crazy game.
I am just really surprised that Pittsburgh didn't win.
Yeah me too.  Especially all the talk around Crosby taking them to the Stanley Cup again.
To be honest I am tired of everyone talking about Pittsburgh going back to the Stanley cup.
Yeah me too.  They are a good team, but I don't think they are good enough to go back or to even win.
Your right, especially the way Nashville is playing.
Nashville has been a total surprise.  There was talk about Pittsburgh, and the Capitals over and over, but Nashville has continuously been overlooked.
I thought that the Blue would have beat Nashville, but boy was I wrong.
Me too, I thought Nashville was going to loose in the first round.
It is amazing how well they played against the Blues.
Yeah, if they make it through this series, they will definitely win the Stanley Cup.
I think so too.  Look how bad Ottawa and Pittsburgh are struggling to just win.
Yeah, neither team look really good.  Pittsburgh's defense has been off the last couple of games.
If Pittsburgh doesn't get their defense in line, they won't make it to the Stanley cup, and if they do, Nashville will destroy them easily.
Yeah, It will be nice to not have to hear about Ovenchkin and Crosby anymore.
It does get tiring hearing those name over and over.  They may be good, but they are not the only players in the NHL.
I agree, and what makes it worse is every sportscaster just talks about them continuously throughout each game, even if neither of those players are playing.
I noticed that too.  It seams they build up and tear down certain players.
I am really hoping Nashville, pulls it off and through a huge kink in their plans of who is the greatest!
