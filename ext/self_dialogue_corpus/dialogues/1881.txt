Are you looking forward to the preseason?
I already bought more sports channels.
Which ones do you have?
I got all the ESPNs & TNT sports. They included free streaming.
I only stream right now. I was going to wait until the season to get the bigger channels.
So, you missed the Manning interview by Smith.
Did Steven A interviewed Manning?
Yeah, they had a sit down for about an hour.
Did he talk about his injuries at all?
He only mentioned his workout routine.
So, Smith didn't press him.
No, he didn't. He seemed to go easy on Peyton for some reason.
That's probably because he's a fan favorite.
Oh, it was favoritism for sure.
When Matt inteviewed Manning, he didn't hold back.
Yeah, Matt was the one who got Manning to admit to his injuries.
He sure did. Matt let it be known that Peyton was still in recovery.
I want him back next season, but it's pointless if he's still injuried.
There is absolultely no need to lie about his injuries. There is no way his team would trade him even injuried.
I agree, but I think it's a natural fear injured players have.
