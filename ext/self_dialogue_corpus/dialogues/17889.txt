Do you ever listen to Kansas?
There are a few songs by them that I like.
Which ones are your favorites?
I really like Carry On My Wayward Son.
Oh, that's a classic.
Yeah, it really rocks.
It plays a lot on one of the shows my sister watches.
Supernatural?
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, that song plays one like every other episode.
Do you like Dust in the Wind?
Dust in the Wind is okay, but honestly it can't touch anywhere close to Wayward Son.
I guess.  Are the band really from Kansas?
Yeah, I think they are from Topeka.
Do they still tour?
I don't know.  I think they are.
Would you like to see them?
I think it would be an awesome concert.
Who do you think is touring with them?
I don't know, but it's probably another awesome eighties band.
