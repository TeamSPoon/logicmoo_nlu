What is your favorite horror movie?
I love everything made by James Wan
What films has he made?
The Insidious series, The Conjuring series and others.
What do you like about them?
I like the way he can make anything look scary.
Are there jump scares?
Yes. Although, Wan uses a jump scare as part of the build-up to the actual scare.
How is the music in his films?
That's one thing I especially like. He doesn't use music in the scariest scenes. The silence is terrifying.
