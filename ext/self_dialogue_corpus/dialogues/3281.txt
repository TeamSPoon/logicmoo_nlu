When did you see your last movie in theaters?
I went and saw Fate of the Furious about a month ago.
Oh yeah I saw that one too.  I didnt really like it thought. What did you think?
I was a fan but I am a sucker for that series.
Or maybe more specifically you are a sucker for Vin Diesel.
That is true, I do like movies he is in.
Does that include the XXX movie franchise.
Oh absolutely! I love all of those.
I did not like the newest one, The Return of Zander Cage.
Yeah that one took a dip but I still loved it.
