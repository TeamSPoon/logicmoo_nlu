You mean the woman who wore the meat dress.
Thats the one! Your thoughts?
I dont know, I prefer the classics. I'm a beatles fan.
What! Too new age for you?
Yeah, always thought she was a little bit weird.
Really now. She's weirder than a bunch of old brits?
What can I say, I like the classics.
Well I guess we are just trapped in a bad romance.
You're awful.
