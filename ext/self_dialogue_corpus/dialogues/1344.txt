How is it that Ryan Fitzpatrick scored so high yet he sucks?
Fitzpartick went to Harvard.
Whoa, what?
yep. he was a math major at Harvard.
But Harvard doesn't have a football team do they?
Of course they do! They play in the IVY league. And they don't have a football scholarship, so people who play for Harvard got into Harvard got in on their academnic merit.
Whoa dude. I wonder how many Harvard football players end up in NFL then
Not many.
How many though>Are they any good?
Fitzpartick is pretty good. I mean he's not the worst.
So one?
There are others. Cameron Brate, TE for the buccs. He'll be a good target for Winston.
He's ok. Not that good as a TE. Who else?
Let's see... Oh yeah Desmon BRyant
No way, Desmond Bryant played for the Crimson?
yep. And let's see whoelse. Oh Yeah. Kyle Juszczyk
The big fullback for bills?
he's with 49ers now
Wait, that's our team, why did we get him?
Maybe he's worth it.
