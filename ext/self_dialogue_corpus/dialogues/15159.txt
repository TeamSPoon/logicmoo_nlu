What do you think about correcting pop and rap lyrics?
What do you mean?
There's a YouTube channel called "Grammatically correct rap" or something.
Sounds like something I'd love!
Yeah, I'm sure.
I correct lyrics all the time.
I know, it's kind of irritating.
So what's your beef with it?
Do you think it's insulting?
I think it's insulting to disrespect basic grammar.
Can I offer an explanation as to why?
Sure.
English teachers don't write music. It's not entertainment, really.
So?
So, music in all forms doesn't keep proper grammar because it doesn't work.
Why not?
Think about rhymes.
okay?
It's way harder to rhyme grammatically correct words than those considered incorrect. It's easier on the ears.
Yeah, but if it's more difficult, it should be more respected, like art music. They always use proper grammar and it's just as fun.
