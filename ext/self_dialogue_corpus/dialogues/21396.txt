Have you seen the movie 47 meters down?
No, I haven't yet. Have you?
no, but I really want to see it soon. It looks so good.
It looks really scary too.
Have you heard anything about it?
I heard it was really good.
It got really good reviews too. I know Mandy Moore is in it.
Do you know who else is in it?
No, do you know what the story is about?
No, do you?
It is about 2 girls who get trapped in a shark tank under water.
oh, that sounds terrifying.
I think it is in theaters now. Do you want to go see it tonight?
Yea, maybe, do you know how long it is.
I think about 90 minutes.
oh ok, that is kind of short.
Yes it is.
Do you have any idea where it is playing?
The theater by my house has it.
ok, lets go tonight!
