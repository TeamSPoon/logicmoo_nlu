How's it going?
Pretty good, how about yourself?
Good as well.  I'm actually in the process of watching all the James Bond movies.
That's always a fun way to pass time.
Time-consuming, but so much fun.
Who is your favorite Bond?
I think that while Sean Connery was the best, Daniel Craig is the face that I see when I think "James Bond."
Any particular reason?
I think it's just that he was the James Bond when I started watching.
That does seem to be how a lot of people pick their favorite Bond.
Who is your favorite?
I've always been a Roger Moore fan.  He had a campy sort of charm about him in his role.
Yea, he was another classic Bond.  I was very saddened to hear that he passed away.
The man was a legend.  He was great in 'The Spy Who Loved Me.'
I actually just saw that one.  What makes this one stand out to you?
This movie was the character Jaws' debut.  It was also outlandish fun.
I agree.  I think the director, Lewis Gilbert intended this, and made the film all the better for it.
Do you want any recommendations for which one to watch next?
Sure thing.
I would watch 'From Russia With Love' next!
