What do you think about the Jedi in Star Wars?
I think they're awesome. And you?
Me too. Its interesting how some of their customs come from Eastern traditions.
I guess those customs were an influence on George Lucas at one point.
So the Jedi had their own style of martial arts.
Very cool right? And low-key at the same time.
And Jedi are supposed to fashion their own lightsabers.
Using a crystal, right?
Yes, the khyber crystal I think I heard.
I guess that accounts for the different colors of light coming off individual lightsabers.
