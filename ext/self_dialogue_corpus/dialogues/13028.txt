Do you have to watch the Star Wars movies in order?
I'm not sure. I've only seen the first one.
I think I'm going to start from the beginning.
I can't get into the older ones. The special effects are so bad.
Maybe I should watch a new one first.
Rogue Wars was great! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
Is that your favorite?
Yes, for sure. It was really amazing.
I guess I'll start with that one. If I can't get into it, I quit!
You will love it!
