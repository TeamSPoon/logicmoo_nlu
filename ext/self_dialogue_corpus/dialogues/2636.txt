Do you like Odell Beckham Jr?
I don't like his attitude.
I don't either.  What about as a player?
I guess it is fun to watch him play.
It is.
The one handed grab might be on the highlight reel forever.
That is what he is known for.
That and his crazy hair.
Yes, that is a little bit out there as well.
The wide receiver I like to watch is Jarvis Landry.
I have heard the name but I don't really watch Miami.
I watch them but you must have seen some of his catches.
I'm sure I have.
He is a very talented player.
There is a ton of talent in the NFL.
I guess that is why they make the big bucks.
I suppose so.
Are you planning to watch week one.
Of course.
Me too, I wouldn't miss it.
