What do you think of thrillers?
As long as they're not violent they're OK. I don't like a lot of violence in a movie.
Neither do I. It's not entertaining to me.
I don't understand why it would be to anyone.
I saw 'What Lies Beneath' and the suspense was great.
That's an older one, right?
Yes, it came out about 15 years ago.
I may have seen it but I can't remember. I think it used to be shown on HBO.
Yes, that's right.
I couldn't believe the ending in that. I was surprised.
