Dude, have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel yet?
No, I don't like science fiction.
That's great because it ain't science fiction, it's fantasy. You like fantasy, right?
Who doesn't like half-naked people bashing each other with swords? But it takes place in space.
Oh, you uneducated worm. Science fiction is based on physical laws, fantasy is anything goes.
I don't get it. There's laws in space. And I'm not a worm.
In science fiction, the writer must establish that the action or plot is able to take place following the physical laws established by the writer. The laws don't have to be the same as in the real world; the author can create alternative laws. Fantasy, in the other hand, requires no physical laws.
I don't get it. What about Star Wars?
Star Wars is the worst example. Please explain to me how starships can teleport across the galaxy in a matter of minutes? In the last movie, a villain teleported across the galaxy during a conversation.
The ships have special engines.
Did Lucas make any attempt to explain what those engines were?
They went through hyperspace.
Did he make any attempt to explain hyperspace?
Well, no.
Lucas totally ignored the fact that it is impossible for vehicles to cross millions of light years of distance in a handful of minutes. At no point did he establish that this was going to be possible in his movies. He left the viewers believing that the action was going to act according to our physical laws.
What if he did address it?
Then Lucas would have been establishing that the action was taking place in a universe of different laws, which would have been fine.
So, establishing place first can make a book or movie science fiction; not establishing place can make it fantasy?
That's it buddy.
Thanks, you just ruined movies for me, jerk.
