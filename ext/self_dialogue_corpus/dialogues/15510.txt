Are you a fan of Aerosmith?
Yeah I really like them why?
I have two tickets to their concert.
Are you asking me to
Now that I know you're a fan, yes.
Now that I know you're asking me I would love to go.
Great the concert is next Saturday.
Awesome! I can't wait to see them live!
It should be a great show I'm really looking forward to it
do you think they're going to perform all the classics?
I'm guessing they play all the hits.
That should be really cool.
I think it's going to be a great time do you want to get an Uber or should one of us drive?
Why don't we split an Uber?
I think that's a great idea.
I'll call and set it up.
Perfect. I can make us dinner reservations before the concert.
That sounds great, let's do Chinese.
Great idea!
Thanks!
