Did you hear about the live action lion king remake?
I did. Waiting for them to ruin my childhood yet again!
Did you not like the jungle book or beauty and the beast remakes?
Neither were terrible, but Hollywood is getting very unoriginal.
Gee. Are there ANY Disney movies you'd like to see remade?
How about cars since it wasn't good in the first place?
I'll pass since their sequels have been even worse. Who knows how much they'll mess up a remake!
Very true! It's also a bit soon for that remake.
My guess is they'll find a way to remake Mary Poppins next.
That wouldn't surprise me at all.
