How often do you purchase CDs?
I dont think I do anymore.
Even if its a huge release from a band?
Yeah I dont even have the ability to play a CD in my car!
So how do you listen to music?
Usually I purchase the album on iTunes.
Thats interesting, a new way to listen.
Its not that new, its been around for years.
I didnt know that many people do that.
Its the easiest way. Plus it saves to the cloud so you dont have a mess in your car.
And I guess you can port it to different phones when you upgrade.
That too
So you think the era of the CD is going to be gone soon?
I think within 20 years we see no more production of CDs.
Funny because album sales are all the sudden a thing.
Thats a bizarre twist
Yeah its such a big product
People love the retro-ness of it i guess
yeah thats what probably drives the sales
I wouldnt want that bulky product in my house
