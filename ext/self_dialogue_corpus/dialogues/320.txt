What's your favorite superhero movie man?
Hands down Doctor Strange. I love Benedict Cumberbatch.
Good choice man, but I'd have to pick Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Both movies have really great visuals though.
Yeah dude, I've seen them both. The special effects for both movies were amazing!
So, any superhero movies you looking forward to?
Honestly, if you haven't seen the trailer for Black Panther, watch it now. That movie is going to be sick!
Already have man! Personally, I can't wait for them to come out with the Justice League movie.
I agree too man, Wonder Woman was great. I haven't really liked many DC movies, but after Wonder Woman, I feel like they're going in a good direction.
Nothing beats Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Batman trilogy man, have you forgotten about that?
Of course not, but that was years ago! Christian Bale will always be a better Batman than Ben Affleck.
