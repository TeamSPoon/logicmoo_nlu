What do you think about Bruno Mars?
I think he is a great artist.
Do you think he is the new Michael Jackson?
He's had some good song, but not Michael Jackson level.
I would say Beyonce is closer to the new Michael Jackson.
I would agree with that.
She has had so many hit songs like Michael Jackson.
The think I love about Beyonce is you never hear anything bad about her.
Has Beyonce and Bruno Mars done a song together?
I don't know, but I would image they have.
