What thriller ending surprised you most?
For me it was the sixth sense.
I wish I could say that.. someone told me the twist before I saw the movie.
Oh no, that sucks, that is one of the greatest reveals of movie history.
I know, and I will never be able to get that shock. Suck for sure.
So what is the  thriller ending surprised you most then?
I suppose shutter island. I was shocked when the twist was revealed in that one.
They did a good job having you believe one thing and it being a completely different reality in reality.
For sure, I find films like shutter island get more interesting although less shocking the more times I see them.
Ben kingsley's performance and character was very masterful in creating that aspect.
