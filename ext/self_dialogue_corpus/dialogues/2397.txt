Have you  been paying attention to the news coming from the all team practices?
Not as much as most people, but I have a pretty good idea about most of the teams.
What do you think about the news about the Bronco's?
I think they had that one run two seasons ago, and now they have to slow down to train up all the new guys they have.
Yeah, that's true. I like what I'm hearing about the Bucaneers so far.
Yeah, it seems like Winston has really stepped up during this offseason.
Do you think they can take the NFC South?
I don't know. If Carolina comes out like they are capable of then there won't be much contest.
What do you mean? The Saints are still in that division.
When was the last time they had a chance though?
That's true. And you know last season was a total fluke for Atlanta.
Oh yeah, they won't be back in the post season for a few years.
Matt Ryan just doesn't have it in him. They got lucky that the rest of the division was sort of crappy.
It's funny that we get that, but actual Falcon fans would beg to differ.
Yeah, but when was the last time you listened to someone from Georgia anyway?
I'd have to say never.
Agreed. And of course you can't talk about a football season without bringing up New England.
Oh please, we were well on our way before you said that.
It's totally possible that they come out and win, even if that's not what you want to watch all season.
It's never what I want to watch, but sometimes you just have to accept the inevitable.
