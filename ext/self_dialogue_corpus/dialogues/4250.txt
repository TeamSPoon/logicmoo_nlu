Have you ever seen Zodiac?
No.  Is it about the Zodiac killer?
Yeah, it's a pretty good movie.
It sounds interesting.  I've read a lot on the Zodiac killer.
Yeah, it focuses on a detective trying to catch the killer.
Sounds good.  Who's in it?
There's a few big names.  Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr. to name a few.
Wow, I'm surprised I didn't hear about this one.
Yeah, it came out like ten years ago.
I'll need to find it.
