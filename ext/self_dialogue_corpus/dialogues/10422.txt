Hello.
How are you.
I'm doing fine. How about you.
I'm doing okay myself.
What have you been up to lately?
Not much. Just listening to music.
Yeah, like what?
You ever listen to the Red Army Choir?
What? Aren't those guy commies?
Well, yeah. But they make goofd music.
Good propaganda music, more like.
Not really! They sing, like, folk songs and stuff.
Are you sure? because they sound like a propaganda orchestra to me.
Sure I'm sure, a lot of their songs pre-date the communist revolution anyway.
Well, if you say so. And yeah, I've never listened to them.
Well you should give them a listen.
Honestly, I think I'll pass.
Suit yourself then.
Listen to anything else?
Sexualizer.
