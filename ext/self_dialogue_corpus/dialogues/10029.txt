What did you think of the original Mummy movies?
The ones from decades ago, or the ones with Brendan Frasier?
Those, but keep in mind they WERE decades ago.
Woah...
Yup. So, opinions?
They were a lot of fun and not overly serious.
My favorite part was in the second movie where he runs in late and yells "Nie!!!!"
"Noooooooooo!!!"
That was hilariously bad acting.
The CGI of the scorpion king was just awful, too.
