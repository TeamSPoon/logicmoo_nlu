Hey what Hip hop artist is the best in the game right now?
I would have to say Meek Mills.
Oh really ya think?
Yeah or maybe Drake.
Yeah Drake is alright just a bit corny.
Yeah too corny for my taste.
But I did like his last album.
Yeah that was really cool.
He did his thing on that.
Yeah that was hot.
