I just watched the entire Harry Potter series this past month and it was fantastical!
You are so lucky! I have seen them all but it has been a while. It is so magical.
Yeah, the wizards and witches and Hogwarts!
The author J.K Rowling has a fantastic mind to be able to create all of these people and worlds!
I agree that she is a genius! How did she come up with names like Albus Dumbledore?
Right, or the character, He Who Must Not Be Named.
Thats hilarious!
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was my favorite of the series, I think.
That was a great one but my pick is Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows part two because of all the answered questions.
I wonder of they will ever make another to add to the series, I hope so.
