Do you want to go see a ball game some time?
Ball game, like baseball?
Yeah. It would be pretty fun.
Aren't those game expensive though? And we'd have to go to the city.
Well we can see a minor league game.
Where do those team play?
There's a minor league team over in Somerset.
That could be fun I suppose.
It really is a good time even at the minor league level.
Well what do the tickets costs?
I am not sure, but I think no more than $12 usually.
That's not bad at all. I could go for that.
I have been to a few of their games in the last few years.
How did the team do?
I think they won most of the games I went to. Go Patriots!
Hahaha! Maybe I'll show up as a supporter of the other team for fun.
That may just cause a riot in the stands!
That doesn't scare me. As a die hard supporter of whatever the other team is, I will not be shaken.
I admire your dedication to the sport of baseball.
It truly is America's pastime.
