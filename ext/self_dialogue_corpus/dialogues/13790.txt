Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest album?
No, I kind of tuned out after "Born This Way".
Some of the new stuff is pretty good, particularly "Million Reasons".
That sounds familiar - I might have heard that one before.
Lady Gaga sang it at the Super Bowl, and it did pretty good on the charts after that.
That's right, I remember seeing that performance.
That said, I'm still waiting for the dance-oriented, "weirdo" version of Gaga to return.
It's been several years since "Just Dance", "Paparazzi", and "Bad Romance".
I know, and since then she's dueted with Tony Bennett and has become almost too "normal".
I agree, I think her songwriting is strong enough to stand on its own but I gravitate more to songs that aren't really straightforward.
