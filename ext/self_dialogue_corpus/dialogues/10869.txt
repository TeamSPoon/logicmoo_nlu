Have you seen the most recent Fast and Furious movie?
I haven't yet. I plan to, though. You saw it?
I did. I wasn't sure if I was going to after Paul Walker's accident.
That's kind of why I haven't seen it yet. I think it'll just be too sad.
That's what I thought, too. And it was sad, for sure.
I bet. The whole thing with the way he died is just so ironic.
I know. Too much like the movies, but no happy ending.
But the movie was good?
It was. I actually feel better because they had a really beautiful tribute to Paul in it. It was very well-done and emotional.
Wow, I really respect that they did that. He deserved it. He was a good guy.
