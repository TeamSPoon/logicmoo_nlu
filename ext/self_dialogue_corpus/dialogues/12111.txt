Did you like the part when the ewoks were introduced in the Star Wars movies?
The first time I watched it, I was a little freaked out.
Me too!
The ewoks looks like teddy bears.
I know! It's amazing that there were so many.
Some of them were cute, but some of them scared me.
I am glad that the ewoks were able to help Han Solo, Princess Leia and the others.
Yeah, without them, it would of been hard getting inside the base.
My favorite part was when the ewoks went into the big robots.
That was so funny!
