Do you know The Planets suite by Gustav Holst?
Yes, but I've only performed Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.
Have you heard the other movements?
No, I don't think so.
Well, did you hear what the CSO is doing with Bell's Brewery?
No, and which CSO? Every city that starts with a C has a CSO.
Cincinnati. You know, the town we live in.
Oh, right, right. What are they doing?
They are performing each of the movements with beer tastings.
WHAT? How's that work? That's awesome!
Bell's has brewed seven beers inspired by the movements.
What styles are they?
Well, Mars is a Double IPA, Saturn is a barleywine, Uranus is a Black Double IPA...
Heh, you said Uranus.
Grow up. Anyway, it'll be fun.
I'm definitely interested. What are the costs?
I think it's $6 per performance for students, and it's in the park.
That's over $40 for six beers and music, seems pricey.
Are you kidding? Each beer on tap is like $8 and each concert should be $10 minimum.
Yeah, okay, that's a good deal.
