Have you heard of Wax?
No, who is that?
He's a rapper. Not too well-known, but one of my top 10.
Well, I haven't heard of him, but maybe I heard a song of his. What are his best?
His most mainstream song, and I think his only one, is Rosana.
Nope, never heard of it.
I think its the only one of his that made it on the radio and in various other places.
So how does he get exposure and whatnot?
He started on Youtube.
Oh, a Youtube rapper.
Kind of. He put out a couple albums and mixtapes, but I don't think his goal was mainstream.
Give me some of his best songs.
Old Ways is great, pretty much all his Scrublife songs.
Scrublife?
Thats one of his albums. His best in my opinion.
I'll check it out.
He also has a ton of creative, funny songs.
Like what?
Low budget is one where he just makes all the beats from household objects.
That's sounds cool
