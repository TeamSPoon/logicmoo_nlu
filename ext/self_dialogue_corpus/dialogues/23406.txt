Hey you! What's crackin?
Funny you should mention that, Kraken that is, as the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie is.
Is what?
Kraken... as in release the Kraken! Nevermind.
Oh! Haha! I never really watched those movies after the first one.
That's a shame. They're really good.
That's what everyone keeps saying. It must be true if they're on their sixth film.
Dead Men Tell No Tales is actually the fifth one, but I think Joachim RÃ¸nning hinted that the sixth may be the final chapter.
Maybe I'll check it out whenever it's truly done... if that ever happens. You know how I like to binge watch things.
Haha I'm the same way normally, but I make the exception for Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars.
Normally I'm the same way with the latest Marvel movie, but as chaotic as life has been I did catch Doctor Strange until dvd and at this rate won't see Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 until it hits the dollar theater sadly.
That's a shame. What's taking you so long to see it?
Waiting on another friend slash crush thing. Things are... complicated between us so not sure if we're still on for more movie dates at the moment.
That sucks. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters though.
Oh I have no doubt. Like hell I'm missing it or Spider-Man Homecoming.
Spider-Man Homecoming looks sick! Not a fan of the young Peter Parker, but Tom Holland nailed it in Captain America: Civil War.
I agree completely - he's the whole reason all my doubt's went out the window & I'm seeing it opening night. Still wish we had Andrew Garfield though.
Yeah, he made a great older Peter Parker. And Emma Stone was the perfect Gwen Stacy.
I couldn't agree more, and I have such a total celebrity crush on Emma.
You would. I'm more into Eliza Dushku myself.
