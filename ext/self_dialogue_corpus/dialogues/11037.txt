Ice hockey, huh?
Yeah. It's my favortie sport.
I can see why. It looks like fun.
Yeah. I played in high school for a bit.
I've never played. Can't skate
Skating takes practice. But It also takes skill.
FOr sure. It looks dangerous.
It can be. I had a buddy lose a finger once
A finger?!
Oh, yeah. Got sliced right off.
Wow. That is crazy.
Hockey gets crazy. That's why they have the pentalty box
The box? I know a little about that
Yeah. Sucks being in there. You miss playing.
Did you ever want to go pro?
Sure. EVery kid dreams that.
Bet most don't make it though
Nah. I don't know a single dude who did
That sucks man
Sure does.
