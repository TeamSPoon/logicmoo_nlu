Have you heard the new Lorde Album?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
It's a really great followup to Pure Heroine.
That album was really great!
I really loved the song Royals.
What is your favorite song on the new album!  I will check it out when I get home today.
You should just listen to the entire album, but If I had to choose, I would say "Liability."
Is it up beat or danceable?
No it's a slower song.  I think it's really sad, but the song is really emotional and beautiful.
I prefer more upbeat songs.  Got a better suggestion?
The title track Melodrama is pretty danceable.
Melodrama is the name of the album?
Yes, but the first single that was released was called Green Light.  I think you would like that one.
Can I dance to it?
Absolutely.  It will have you dancing all day and the chorus will get stuck in your head.
So it's got a good chorus?
Green Light has a great chorus.
Cool I need more Lorde in my life.  Maybe I will just buy the album now.
I bought it yesterday. I own all of her music, even the songs she's released for soundtracks.
Wow so you are a superfan!
