Hey, are you tired already of the "Despacito" song?
Well, I can't believe how much they are playing the song everywhere, but I kind of like it.
I also liked it at first but I'm am starting to get fed up with it.
I know it has been kind of extreme how you hear it everywhere.
And the worst part is that I hear it and I get it stuck in my head for hours and hours...
It happens to me too. The melody is extremely catchy.
Did you know Luis Fonsi before the song was popular?
Well I have some Venezuelan cousins who hear a lot of music from him so I did know him from before.
Oh, ok. I had never heard from him. But he is a good singer.
He is a very good singer in fact in my opinion. You should listen to some of his old stuff.
Well, I'm not a fan of music in Spanish, but I could try it.
Go ahead and listen to these 2: "Imaginame SIn Ti" and "Yo No Me Doy Por Vencido"
Okay. Are they also kind of dance latino music?
No. These two are more pop, like romantic songs.
Okay then. Talking about "Despacito" again, it's incredible how Justin Bieber makes everything popular these days right?
The kid has a gift for being in the right songs lately.
What is your opinion on him?
I like him. I think he is very talented.
Well, I think he is an interesting character, but he is surrounded by too much drama.
He is just groing up while everyone is watching. Of course there are going to be some objectionable things about a teenager.
