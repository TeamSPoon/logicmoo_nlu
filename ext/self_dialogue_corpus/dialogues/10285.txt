I just watched the Expendables, have you seen it?
Yes, I saw it a while ago. What did you think?
It was really cool seeing all of my favorite action stars on screen together.
Who was your favorite character?
I was looking forward to seeing Jason Statham. He didn't disappoint.
Yeah, he was good but Sylvester Stallone will always be my favorite.
I was a little disappointed that  Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't have a bigger role.
I agree, I expected more than a cameo.
Maybe he'll have a bigger part in one of the sequels.
That would be the best. I hope that happens!
