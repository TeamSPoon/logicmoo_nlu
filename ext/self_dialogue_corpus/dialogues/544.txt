What is that you're wearing?
My fan outfit.
Fan outfit? For what?
For the Redskins game!
But you look like a farm animal!
What's your point?
Redskins are indian braves...proud warriors and something to be feared, respected, and revered.
Yeah. So?
What does your outfit have to do with that?
Nothing.
Then why would you dress up like a pig in skirt?
I'm not a pig, I'm a hog!
Pig...hog...same thing!
You obviously know nothing about the rituals and traditions of football.
I have been a Bills fan for 20 years. I have never dressed like a farm animal.
It would be an improvement on your part.
You're avoiding the issue!
The hogs are a tradition!  We represent the enormous, powerful, snorting beast that resides in every Redskin offensive lineman.
Well, if that is the best you can do, I feel sorry for you. I'll make it up to you by bringing the Bar-B-Que sauce to the next game.
The only ribs you'll be seeing will be your own!
