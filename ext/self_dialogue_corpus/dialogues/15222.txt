Did you go to the Wind Symphony concert last night?
Of course! I always go.
Thanks for supporting us!
No problem, I love the kids at this school.
What did you think of the Maslanka Symphony?
Honestly, you all played it super well, but I hate his music passionately.
Really? It's deep and religious.
I get that, but it doesn't mean it's good music.
What was wrong with it?
Well, his music has no true structure.
Sure it is, it's theme-and-variations.
Kind of. His music is very ADD, and there are other issues as well.
What's wrong with that piece specifically?
Well, it's too in-your-face sectional theme-and-variations. There's no subltety.
Anything else?
The clarinets blowing on their mouthpieces in the middle made no sense. It was 'weird for the sake of weird'
Yeah, I wasn't a fan of that. But what about the brass?
The brass part was great, I loved it, but of course it was just a slow major scale.
Did you meet him after the concert.
I've met him before, actually, so I left.
