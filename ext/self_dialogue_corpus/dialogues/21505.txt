I'm really excited to see the new Wonder Woman movie!
Eh, I'm kind of lukewarm about it.
Why is that?
The D.C. Universe comic book movies haven't really done it for me.
You like the Marvel ones better?
Definitely! I loved the Iron Man and Captain America series.
Yeah, they were pretty decent. But I'm not a big Robert Downey Junior fan.
Really, I thought he was great as Tony Stark.
He just comes across as kind of smug and superior.
Yeah, but in a pretty hilarious way.
Regardless, I've heard some really good things about Wonder Woman.
I saw a trailer that looked pretty good, but the D.C. thing still has me wary.
What about the Christopher Nolan Batman movies? Those were great!
Yeah, they were awesome, but I kind of put them in their own category. Not quite in the same realm as the other D.C. stuff.
Why is that?
I think mostly because of Christopher Nolan's influence. Take a look at the Joker?
What do you mean?
In Dark Knight, Ledger as the Joker was pretty much the best thing ever! In Suicide Squad, Leto was cringe worthy.
Yeah, I can't really argue.
So anyway, I probably won't see Wonder Woman. At least not in theaters.
