Hey, you think the Raiders will take another step forward this year?
Not sure, I think Derek Carr may be overrated.
Hmm, that could be true but I hope they do.
Me too, give Oakland something to celebrate.
What about other sleeper teams you think can take a leap forward?
I like the Buccaneers to move forward in a weak division.
True, it's time for Winston to take the next step in his career.
Exactly, he has shown promise.
Who do you think wins the AFC South?
I like the Titans if Mariota stays healthy.
True, but they can't seem to catch a break.
That's accurate and the Texans are always pretty decent.
Yeah, but I think JJ Watt is getting old and overrated.
Nah, he was injured last year, he deserves another look.
Yeah, but it's amazing how quickly players regress anymore.
Players have gotten bigger and faster, injuries are inevitable.
Very true, I think 30 is now considered old for the NFL.
It's so crazy how that used to be considered prime age for the NFL.
The game has changed so much in a few years.
That is definitely true.
