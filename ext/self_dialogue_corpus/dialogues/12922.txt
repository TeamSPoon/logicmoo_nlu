I was just reminiscing about when I saw "The Empire Strikes Back". You know, I felt pretty helpless after watching that movie.
I didn't see it when it was in the theaters, I was too young. Didn't it come out in 1980?
Yeah, I was in ninth grade back then. I saw it because I loved "Star Wars: A New Hope" so much.
I think I saw it on TV. So what made you feel so helpless?
Well for one thing, Mark Hamill's character, Luke Skywalker wasn't the focus of the film, he was only half of it.
And what else? I mean, didn't he spend time with Yoda, and do Jedi training?
Well yes, he did, but following Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia was starting to get on my nerves. They seemed pretty unfocused.
Yeah, and then they got into trouble in Cloud City, when they hung out with Lando Calrissian. Though Billy Dee Williams was interesting.
I found the ending to be the most shocking thing, ever. Luke, losing his arm to Darth Vader, and Han being encased in carbonite - it was really too much for me.
It was the end of times. The seventies were over, the oil crisis past, the war in Vietnam complete - people didn't know what to expect, and "The Empire Strikes Back" reflected all of that.
