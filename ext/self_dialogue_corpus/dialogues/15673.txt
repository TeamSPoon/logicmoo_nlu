Do you enjoy experimental music at all?
I pretty much enjoy a little bit of everything musically.
That's awesome. I've been getting really into experimental electronic music lately.
Is there an artist in particular that you like?
There's this producer called Oshi that makes really pretty sounds.
Didn't he do that Kali Uchis remix?
Yeah, he has done quite a few remixes, actually.
That song is so catchy.
It's his most popular one by far.
I have it on a couple of my playlists.
Another experimental artist I've been listening to is G Jones.
I haven't heard of him yet.
His stuff is a lot more aggressive but it's very unique.
What's his best song?
He did a song with Ekali called "Dark Matter" and it's amazing.
I will check that out. I do like the more aggressive stuff sometimes.
I find it's a lot more fun to go see live.
I've heard that Tipper is a good artist in that genre, too.
I keep hearing about him, also. A lot of people seem to like him.
Same here. I've heard about his music at least ten times this month.
