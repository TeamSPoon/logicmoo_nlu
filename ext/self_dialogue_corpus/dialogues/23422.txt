Have you seen that Keanu Reeve meme?
The sad Keanu memes? Yes
I wonder if any of that stuff is true...
Some of it is. He does have a small flat. He did give 80 ill fro his 114 mil earning from Matrix series to the staff.
That's still 34 mill from just 3 movies.
More money thn I can spend in my life time.
i don't know about you, but I can spend 34 mil.
Buying things you need not just to buy stuff. You need a house not a mansion, you need a vehicle, not some rocket, and you need food, and company
And buying all that will go over 34 mil easily.
i don't even...
What? House will cost what 10 million?
There is NO human being alive that "needs" a 10 million dollar home. They don't exist.
Depends on the location. 10 mil in upper east side is not that much,.
Anyway. Remember that slide phone on the first Matrix movie?
Yeah, yeah. That was good looking phone.
That was a Nokia phone. Nokia 8110
People actually used that phone in real life?
Oh Yes. it wqas already an existing phone when Matrix was released.
That's why Samsung copied the idea with their own phone
Yep, with SPH N270. it was made to look like Matrix phone. Now it'ssold for 100 bucks on ebay. Collector's item you know.
