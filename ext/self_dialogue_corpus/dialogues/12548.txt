So have you seen the new Star Wars movies?
I just did, actually.
What did you think of them?
I really liked them. I feel like they are getting more back to the feel of the originals.
I like them too. I really like the new characters they are developing.
Which is your favorite?
Well I am very interested in Rey's storyline.
Me too, I want to see what happens with her and Luke.
Oh I think that will be a great part of the next movie.
I am so excited to see more of Luke.
