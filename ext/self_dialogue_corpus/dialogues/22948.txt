Do you remember the movie Hollywood Shuffle?
Yeah. That's the movie that Robert Townsend made.
Yeah that's it. Have you ever seen it?
Yeah. That thing was funny.
What to you was the best part?
I liked when they were playing the movie critics.
Yeah, when they were reviewing the movies and keeping it real.
Keeping it real ain't the word. They were cussing up a storm doing those reviews.
I know right. That was my favorite part too.
There hasn't been a movie like that since.
You mean like the way he had it broken down to like three or four separate little movies within a movie?
Exactly.
I think that was a brilliant idea.
Well it certainly makes it easy if you want to go on youtube and see clips of it.
I wonder if there are any clips of it on youtube.
You know there is.
I remember back when youtube used to have a whole lot of full movies on there for free.
I know right.
Now they want to charge for all them old flicks and stuff.
Trying to make a dollar.
