Would you rather listen to hip hop or rnb?
I like hip hop more.
Why do you like hip hop more?
I like it because I can relate more to hip hop artist.
I can understand because I favor hip hop as well.
I really like how they just tell their life story in their raps.
It is a thing of beauty and I respect their craft.
I'm with you, it is a special thing to witness.
I wish people tell the truth more in raps instead of fabricating stories.
True, but you know there are always frauds.
