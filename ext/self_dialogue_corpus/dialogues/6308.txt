Today I heard that the art Sleeping Beauty was based on old tapestries.
Isn't it considered the gold standard for Disney art?
Yes, now that I'm an adult, I can really appreciate the historical artistic touches.  But I didn't like it as a kid.
I understand.  The tiny hooves on the horse used to bother me, but now I think he's cute.
Can you imagine having to do all that art by hand?  The continuity editors must have had a real headache.
And all the man hours that were involved.
Did you like Aurora's dress better in pink or blue.
I liked both.  But they should have mixed the two and done purple.
That would have been a good compromise.
What they really should have done is asked her what color she wanted her dress to be, and gone with that.
