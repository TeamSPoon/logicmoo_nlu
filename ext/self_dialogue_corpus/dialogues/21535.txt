Have you seen Moana?
Yeah.  I took my kids to see it.
How did you like it?
For a kids movie it was pretty good.
Did you like the songs?
I liked the main song about how she wanted to go out on the water.  That is probably going to be the song that will be up for an award.
I took my kids to see it too.  They wanted me to look up the song on youtube after we got home.
Did they play it over and over?
Oh my gosh yes.  I am so tired of it now.
Does this make your kids want to go see more movies?
Yeah, they saw the preview for Cars 3 and now they are very excited to see it.
Have they seen the other two?
Yes.  We own both of those and they have watched them a bunch.
Maybe we could take our kids together to see it when it comes out?
That sounds good.
Have you heard of any other movies coming out that would be good for kids or adults?
I hate to admit it but I love the Transformers movies.  I want to go see The Last Knight.
The special effects of those movies are awesome but the plots and acting always seem kind of dumb.
Exactly how I feel.  But I love the action and Optimus Prime's voice.
Gotta go.  See you later.
