Hey fellow Zombie!
Hi! You like The Pretty Reckless too?
Oh yes! Taylor rocks!
She sure does! Don't you just love TPR's song "Take Me Down"?
Yes I do! I like the bridge part where she goes "Sign with the devil!"
Yep, that's the best part of the song!
I love how she wears her make-up too! So dark and gorgeous!
Same here. Eyeliner always on point!
Yes. Another great song by her is "Light Me Up".
It is for sure, that song touches my heart.
