Do you like the Ironman franchise?
I think its great.
Same here, it really sparked the Marvel renaissance.
I wouldnt say that, Captain America was great too.
Yeah but Ironman was the original.
Robert Downey Jr can act
Yes he can but he doesnt do much else anymore.
Why would he have to?
They do sign them on for many movies.
If they appear for just a scene, it counts as a movie for them.
Well that means revenue for the actor, right?
Not sure about compensation but more than likely.
I like that their universe creates roles for each of the characters.
It is important to maintain harmony within the plot lines.
I did not like Doctor Strange though
Thor is a bit off as well.
Some of the characters dont really need their own movies.
I think Black Panther is going to be a great film.
So do I, as long as its set in modern day.
I believe it will be according to the Marvel story arc
