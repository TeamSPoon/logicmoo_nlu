So which comedy is your favorite?
I love Blazing Saddles.
What is that about?
It's about a black sheriff who comes to a town full of racists and they all come to love him.
It's a comedy?
Yep.  Mel Brooks directed it.
It sounds kind of dull.
It's not - it's hilarious.  There's tons of slapstick and the sheriff is a great straight man.
When did it come out?
Back in 1974.  It's pretty old by now.
