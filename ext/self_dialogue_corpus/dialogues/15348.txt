Have you ever heard of Billy Joel?
I have! He plays the piano, right?
He certainly does. He is one of my mom's favorite musicians.
Does she have a favorite song from Billy Joel?
I think that Uptown Girl is one of her favorites.
That is a great song. I love that track.
She has seen him in concert several times.
Where was the last place she saw him perform?
I believe that it was at a baseball stadium.
Wow, a baseball stadium? There must have been thousands of people there.
That's true. I believe there were nearly 10,000 people in attendance.
That is incredible. How much were tickets to that show?
The prices varied. But I believe they ranged from $50 to $500 or so.
Billy Joel and his manager must have made so much money during that show!
They certainly did. And believe it or not, that was not the only large stadium he played at on that tour.
Does Billy Joel play with a full band?
He does! Billy Joel plays piano and sings and his band plays the rest of the instruments.
You must have to be a talented musician to play with him.
That is true. His band is comprised of some very well seasoned players.
I hope I can play as well as Billy Joel and his band one day. I better keep practicing.
