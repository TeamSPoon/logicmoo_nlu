Have you seen any new comedies lately?
Yes!  I just saw Central Intelligence.
Was it good?
It was hilarious.
Who's in it?
The Rock.
Oh, is that the movie where he and Kevin Hart are in the CIA?
Yes.  They are so funny together.
I saw a preview of that in the theater.
Did you see where they added weight to the Rock to make him look fat in the beginning?
Yes.  They gave him braces too.
Exactly.  It's a nerd to glory kind of story.
I like the rock in comedy.
Me too.  It's better than his attempts at action.
I like Kevin Hart too.
Yea, he's a great comedian.
I bet they pair well together.
Oh yea, and it's got Jason Bateman as the bully.
Sounds hilarious.
It is.
