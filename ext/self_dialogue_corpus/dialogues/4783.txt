Did you see the game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the  San Diego Padres on Thursday, Mike?
Nope. I had dinner plans and went out with the wife. How was it?
With that a 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres, the Brewers are in first place.
That win was their ninth in 11 games.
Yeah. They are doing good.
Losing two of the last eleven games isn't too bad at all.
Of course every loss hurts when you are trying to get into the playoffs.
Yeah, they do have long odds.
Especially in a tough NL Central where you know the Chicago Cubs haven't yet played their best baseball.
They say the computers are giving  them about 2 percent odds of winning the division, about 10 percent of making the playoffs.
Dang. The computers don't like their odds too much but what do computers know?
Only what you tell them.
Dang straight.
But you know what, though? It's still  fun to be in first place!
I couldn't agree with you more.
I think this season's playoff will be very interesting.
I might try to see a game or two in person.
Really? If you do, let me know.
You want to go to the ball park too?
Of course! I have to support my team.
