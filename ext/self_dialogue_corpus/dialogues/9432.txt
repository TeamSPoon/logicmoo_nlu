Did you ever listen to Nas?
Yeah, I loved Nas!  His first album was amazing.
I know, it came out when, like in 1998 or so?
Yeah it was something like that.  It was truly novel at the time.
I know, I remember being really impressed.  Did he make more albums after that?
I really couldn't tell you.  I think so.
He kinda reminded me of Tupac in the first one.
Yeah, there were some similarities.  His music was definitely deep.
Yeah, it wasn't like the cheap shallow rap you often hear.
No, definitely not.
