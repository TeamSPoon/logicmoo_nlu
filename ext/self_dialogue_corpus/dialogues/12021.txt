I can think of at least four changes made to the Star Wars movies from 1977.
Name one.
The 2011 blu ray release had different lettering and a title in the lead in.
Very good. Another one?
The aunt tells Luke to tell your uncle in 2011, just uncle in 1977.
Wow.  What else?
Obi-wan scares off the Sand people with a higher pitched voice in 2011.
Anything else?
The Mos Eisley characters changed in 2011!
Amazing.  You're an expert!
