Can you tell me something about lighstabers?
What would you like to know?
Well, why are they so rare and hard to find?  I feel like they should be readily available on a galactic market.
You'd think that but there are a couple reasons.
Oh? Like what?
Well the crystals are extremely rare first of all.
Is that all?
No, technically they are only supposed to be assembled by a young Jedi, they are built by the user.
Some sort of ritual?
That's a bit simplistic, more of a tradition among force-sensitives to go from being a padiwan to being a jedi.
