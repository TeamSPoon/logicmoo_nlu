You watch Football, right?
I follow the Ravens and Eagles, but that's about it.
But you watch the Superbowl no matter what, right?
Oh, of course.
What did you think of this years Superbowl?
Extremely disappointing at first, but then WOW.
That's exactly how I felt.
So you wanted the Pats to win?
Yeah, definitely.
I remember turning the game off maybe like 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter because I thought it was over.
I didn't turn it off until the end of the 3rd.
Did you turn it back on eventually or find out what happened afterwards?
I was following on Twitter. When the Pats looked like they were coming back, I watched again.
Same here. It was probably one of the best comebacks ever.
Definitely was. Tom Brady is the best of all time.
I wouldn't go that far, but he is one of the best.
Do you think they'll make the superbowl again this year?
Even though I'm more of a Ravens fan, I hope they do just to see the reaction to Brady getting another ring.
He's like 41, that would be amazing.
He is amazing.
