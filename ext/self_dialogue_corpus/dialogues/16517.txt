So, what do you think was the best decade for music overall?
I think that is easy, the nineties!
Really? That is crazy because I completely agree with you!
Awesome. All of my family says it was the eighties but I do not agree with them.
I am with you, there were just so many classic hits that were born in the nineties. .
I could go on and on with all of the great music that came from that decade!
Yea me to, do you still listen to any nineties music still?
Yes! I listen to nineties music all the time. I actually just made myself and all nineties CD!
Nice. What all songs did you put on your CD?
No Scrubs is my first track, I have always loved that one.
Me to! TLC is my all time favorite female group!
They were so cool back in the day, right?
They are still cool to me! So, any more songs I might know on there?
Hit Me Baby One More Time sound familiar?
Sure does! Britney Spears made her debut in the nineties and that was her biggest hit.
It sure was, who was your favorite artist that made their debut in the nineties?
I have to be honest, I used to love the Backstreet Boys. I thought they were very cool.
Me and you both! I actually had a few of their posters on my wall.
Of course the nineties also introduced us to Justin Timberlake as well!
That is true! The nineties brought us some great music and great artists' to say the least!
