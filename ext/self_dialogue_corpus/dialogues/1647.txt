The Falcons are definitely making it back to the Super Bowl this year.
Think so? I don't know if they did enough in the offseason.
Dontari Poe and Takkarist McKinley are enough.
You think that's enough to beat the Patriots? They added a lot more.
Brady's not playing a full season. He won't make it past the Falcons week seven.
The Falcons D-line is good, but I don't know, man. Sounds like wishful thinking.
Not at all. They will break Brady, and I will laugh.
Even so, the Pats still have Jimmy Garoppolo. He can ball out, and he's young.
Then they'll break him too. You're not going to reason me out of this.
You can't reason a man out of what he wasn't reasoned into, said, uh, somebody.
Well, yeah. Think the Cowboys will be back?
Yeah, who are they losing? One D-line guy got suspended, I think.
Zeke Elliot might miss some weeks on suspension.
What did he do? I missed that.
I think he beat up his girlfriend.
Lot of that going around! Someone needs to get punished bad.
Yeah, until someone really loses their livelihood, it won't change.
What about the Packers?
I don't think they have enough. Severe O-line issues, and their secondary is suspect.
I think they addressed a lot of that in free agency and the draft. We'll see, I guess.
