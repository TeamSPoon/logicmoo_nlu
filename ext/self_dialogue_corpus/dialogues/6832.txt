I wish I had a magic carpet. Like in Aladdin.
Yes! And a magic lamp as well.
Of course! That way we could have a genie to grant us our wishes.
I would love to get a few wishes granted.
And Jasmine is so pretty in that movie.
She really is. She's one of my favorite Disney girls.
The soundtrack is so much fun as well.
Most Disney soundtracks are amazing.
And Robin Williams was great as the genie.
That he was. May he rest in peace.
