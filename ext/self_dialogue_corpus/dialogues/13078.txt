Did you know that Han Solo's "I know" line was improvised?
Yes, I did read about that.
That makes the scene so much cooler.
It's impressive how an improvised line ended up being one of the best lines of the franchise.
It only served to elevate an already incredible and emotional scene.
When I first saw Han get frozen in carbonite, I couldn't believe that was how the movie was going to end.
I felt the same, though it added to the payoff in the next movie when Leia finally rescued him.
If you recall, she even repeated the "I know" line back to Han.
That was a great callback.
One of the many reasons why I love the original series so much.
