Do you listen to Radiohead?
Of course, they're one of the most defining bands of this century, I think. I don't think they've put out anything good since In Rainbows, though.
Uh, are you serious? A Moon Shaped Pool was fantastic -- it came out last year -- and Amnesiac is criminally underrated.
Yeah, sorry, that's just not true. Love all their other stuff, though.
I just don't see how you can be a fan of them, but not like their recent records.
Let me live! Honestly, I just don't think artists can be consistent for that long. I don't know anyone who's done that.
Have you never listened to David Bowie? Bob Dylan?
There's no way you can say Bob Dylan has the same relevancy now as fifty years ago.
Sure, but he's put out some good stuff. All I'm saying is, there have been plenty of artists that have been consistently good for a long time.
I guess you have a point about David Bowie. Although some of his 90s stuff was questionable.
Ha, but Blackstar definitely made up for that. You know, Slowdive is another band that has had a successful comeback recently.
Have they? I didn't know they put out anything new recently.
Yeah, they have a new self-titled album that's pretty good. That's hard to do, you know.
Eh, I might listen to it. I prefer to listen to new artists, though. I guess that's all I'm trying to say.
Good music is good music. Who cares if it's a debut. Haven't heard any good debuts anyway.
You're not going to convince me about this! I'm just going to go listen to OK Computer for the 100th time.
Not even their best album, but okay.
Yeah, I'm not even going to have that argument with you.
Have you not heard Kid A?
Just stop!
