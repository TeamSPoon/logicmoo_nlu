Can you name the greatest NFL football players of all time?
No.
Why not?  You are the biggest fan of the sport that I know.
The game has changed so much over the years that you cannot name one player as the best of "All time"
Ok. So it's not so easy.  But you can give it a try!
And there are 22 different positional roles, each with a specialized set of skills and experience making them best for that role.  The best quarterback might be the worst defensive end.
Ok. I get your point.
And the position foquarterback is differnt on each team.  While each quarterbacks call plays, hike, hand off, and throw the ball, each team has their own style of play that makes the QB position different on that team.
So, it's a tough task. I get it.
A quarterback playing on a team that throws the ball most of the time is different than a quarterback on a team that runs the ball most of the time.  They need a different body type and skill set to accomodate the offensive strategy.
Alright. I get it.
And the mindset of an offensive lineman is quite different than a defensive lineman.
Yes.
And the left tackle needs different physical features than the free safety!
Ok. I'll never ask you again!
Not to mention that the fullback and tailback are uniquely gifted to fill diferent roles in an offense!
Ok....Ok already!
And some of the best players only played a few years, while other players proved their worth based on steady, reliable, long careers!
I give up. You don't have to tell me who the best player of all time was!
But all things considered, I would say Joe Montana was the best.  Hey, where are you going?
