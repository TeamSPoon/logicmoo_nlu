The new Cheap Trick album came out this week.
Oh wow did it really?
Yeah it's not their greatest but it's good to see them still making music.
I was just going to say that even if it's not that great, the old guys still putting out tunes is a relief.
Definitely, it's a pretty heavy record too, they're still experimenting with new sounds.
Oh wow see I would have thought they'd be kind of resting on their laurels a bit.
Nah, not at all, they really bring some heat even if the songs aren't much to my liking.
I wonder if they'll tour to support the album.
They probably will but everytime an old band tours to support a new album it's boring.
You're right, they always end up just playing the hits.
