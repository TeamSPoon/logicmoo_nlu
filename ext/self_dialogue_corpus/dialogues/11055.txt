Hey did you see the Bruins vs Penguins Game?
Yeah Marchand had a hatrick and the game winning goal.
He is on fire this season
Yea i just hope Crosby stops scoring
Why?
Because i cant stand him
Oh Ok yeah i hate the penguins too
Hopefully they lose the next game.
The Bruins havent won since 2011
I know i feel like its been forever.
Sometimes its hard to watch these guys play
Why
I mean the hits these guys take
Yea it can be brutal
The league has tried to do something
yeah unfortunately its part of hockey
Well I got to go
Me too
Go Bruins!
Oh Yes Go Bruins!
