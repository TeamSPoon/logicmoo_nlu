See anything good lately.
Oh, man, you know what I just watched? Blade runner.
Oh, cool. With Harris on Ford.
Yeah, me and Harrison Ford watched Blade Runner together.
Cool! Which version did you see?
I don't know. The Blade Runner one.
Duh, but there's like a million versions of Blade Runner.
Well, I don't know.
Did it have voice over at the beggining?
No, I dod not think that it did.
Well, then it was the director's cut, or the ultimate cut.
The director's cut isn;t the ultimate cut?
Brah, it's complicated.
Yeah, well, it's like dope anyway, you know?
Daryl Hannah is great in it.
She'd the best. And that part where the dud is like "How long do I live?" and Harrison Ford is like "Four Years!" And the guy's like "Longer than you."
I didn't get that part. Harrison Ford was older than four.
Unless he was a replicant!
Oh, wow, you just blew my mind wide open, bro!
Yeah, well, it's a really good movie.
