What movie do you wish they'd remake?
Robin Hood would be a good candidate.
I agree with you, but only kind of.
Don't get me wrong, the original musical stands out on its own.
It has a great hand-drawn quality to it.  It fits a movie that was made in the 70's in tone and substance.
It also had some great musical numbers that fit into that time period.
I recognize the guy who voiced the bear voicing the other bear in The Jungle Book.
Yeah, that's kind of a nice, interesting trivia question.
What was his name?
Phil Harris.  Aren't you impressed with my vast knowledge?
