Do you remember  tomorrowland?
oh yes, I went there once in Disneyworld
well, I'm talking about the movie
I have seen the movie too, brilliant movie. It makes me admire Disney even more, such a visionary
I can't agree more. It's just amazing how he made all his dreams to come true, and his dreams are carried on by his successors
yeah, talking about Tomorrowland, I wish I could have a pin that would teleport me to a different reality
that would be awesome, wouldn't it
well I could do it today
how?
in my dream
