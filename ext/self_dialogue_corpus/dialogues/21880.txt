Why do you think the sequels to the matrix were so bad?
Yea, they were awful compared to the first, its hard to tell.
It had so much potential.
I think the storyline just got way too complex
The characters were awesome, it just got confusing.
I really liked Keanu reeves too.
The action sequences in the films were the best part.
Yea, the slow motion scenes were epic.
Lawrence Fishbourne was probably my favorite part.
I liked how the science fiction aspects made me think
Yea, especially in the 1st film
How society runs in the real world and how our minds control it, was interesting to think about.
Maybe, they will do another film
I hope its a decent one
If they look at the feedback from fans, they can make it work.
I did like the directors who made it.
They did some good work with other films, so there is hope.
Yea and Keanu Reeves would help make the movie good.
I'd definetly like to see a new story and new characters
That might be for the best, a completely fresh start.
