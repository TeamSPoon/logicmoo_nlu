Do you like Lifetime movies?
No I Think they are all campy
The acting in them is so generic.
I watched one the other day with Eric Roberts.
He probably played an alcoholic husband who is abusive right?
Yes! It was so generic
Yeah was it called The Husbands Decision?
Yes and I hated it
Do you watch the entire thing through?
I do, I cant believe these movies kept getting made.
Well as long as you keep watching them, theyll keep making them
I just dont find them appealing
So what makes you watch them?
I dont know its a good question
They all follow the same formula
Yeah it really is a rinse and repeat way they do things.
OK do you think that they will ever go off the beaten path.
No I think we are going to constantly read and hear about how dumb it is.
Thats pretty funny if you ask me.
Yeah I wish I never got into it
