Bye Bye Man was the worst Horror movie I've ever seen!
Oh yeah that movie was terrible, completely unoriginal and not to mention boring.
Yeah totally, I saw Lights out though and though that was really good.
Definitely, that one was really scary, by the same guy who made the Conjuring movies right?
Yeah I think so.
Conjuring two was pretty good I thought, did you see it?
Yeah I liked it a lot, thought the monster looked a little cheesy though.
Yeah I think so too, the nun wasn't very scary looking. I liked the voice when the girl was possessed a lot though.
Yeah that was pretty creepy.
Still, I thought the first one was a little better.
