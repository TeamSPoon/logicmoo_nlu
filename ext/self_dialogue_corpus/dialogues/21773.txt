I watched The Great Wall last week.
I wanted to see that but never got around to it.
I was pretty disappointed with it.
Really? Like how?
Well it just seemed to be rushed and you didn't really engage with the characters.
I have noticed that the movie industry is more about rushing a movie out before they truly have a sense for what people want.
I think a lot of it has to do with opening weekend revenues.
Yes the bottom line is money.
The movie was long and drawn out and too loud.
That's how I felt about the last Transformers.
Now that was a great movie.
My family liked it but I didn't get into it.
Did you like the others?
Yes I had no problem with those.
Maybe it's just starting to play out and you're getting tired of the storyline.
That could be it. I just want the movie industry to bring new and fresh movies.
They have relied on sequels and existing stories for a while.
Yes it doesn't take much to make a super hero movie.
Yep, and you're likely going to have a lot of stories to tell.
Yes and that seems like an uncreative way to make movies.
