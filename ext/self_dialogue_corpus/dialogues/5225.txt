Did you see Moana is on Netflix?!
Yes!! We already watched it twice with week!
My kids love that movie.
Same! I wonder if Disney will do a Moana ride.
That would be so cute! They could have Moana's journey with Moui.
I have to say Hei Hei was one of my favorite side kick characters.
I loved the songs !
Me too! Our schoo sung them for three spring show!
Now I need to go rewatch the movie for the umpteenth time!
Enjoy!
