There's a video on youtube that knocks me out.
How to make a bump key that opens any door?
No, I think they took that down after your little adventure. It's Peggy Lee singing while Benny Goodman plays the clarinet.
Who are these people?
Well, he was a clarinetist, duh. He found fame as a bandleader.
And her?
She developed this sophisticated voice, but she was a prairie girl from North Dakota.
When did they make this tape you like?
I don't know, the fifties I guess. It's jazz, which I know nothing about.
Okay, then why do you like it?
It's because they're playing together.
Yeah? I don't understand you. It's music, so of course they're playing together.
Yeah, but they're playing playfully.
Huh?
It seems to me that she is somehow imitating a clarinet, that tone or timbre, or whatever you call it.
That's nice.
And he's imitating that slinky tone she puts in her voice. And they toss it back and forth.
I don't think I'd get it.
I dont know if you would. I may be imagining the whole thing.
I'll listen, just to see if I get it. If it's even there.
