I just put the movie House of 1,000 Corpses on last night.
You mean that scary one?
Yes. From Rob Zombie.
Those people are just scary to look at.
I know what you mean. Can you imagine being stuck in that house with them.
Sick people. Had to love their dinner table set up.
Yes, and Captain Spalding was a total creep.
He is my least favorite character in that movie.
My least favorite was Baby.
The girl, why?
Just the tone of her voice and that laugh.
Yeah, her laugh was terrible.
I did like Otis in the movie.
He was the one with the long hair right?
Yeah. He was a killer but out of them all, he was the best.
Yes, he wasn't irritating.
Even the mother was annoying.
Karen Black played her right?
Yes. She was a nut job.
She did play a good nut job though.
