On my way to work the song "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston was on the radio. I love that song.
You mean by Dolly Parton?
No, Whitney Houston was sing it.
I know but Dolly Parton wrote that song.
Really, I didn't know that.
Yes, she wrote it to Porter Wagoner when she was quitting his show and wanted to go out on her own.
Was she in love with Porter Wagoner.
No, she loved him as a friend and he was angry with her for wanting to leave.
So she wrote that song for him?
Yes, she recorded it back in 1973.
Wow, I have never heard anyone sing it but Whitney.
You should listen to Dolly's version on youtube.
I think I will tonight. Is it as good as Whitney's version.
Well, I like the way both of them sing it. Whitney sang for the movie "Bodyguard".
I remember that, that is when I fell in love with that song.
It sold over 4 million singles and won 2 grammys.
That is pretty impressive, but it is know as one of Whitney Houston's signature songs.
Yeah, I think that is because you really never hear Dolly singing it on the radio anymore.
I love the verse I wish you joy and happiness but most of all I wish you love.
I know it really is a beautiful song.
