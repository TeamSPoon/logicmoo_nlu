That Hunchback of Notre Dame movies was insane, but in a good way!
I remember that movies, I was also so scared to watch it when I was older.
Same here! I watched it again recently and was amazed by the animations and songs.
There was music in this film? I guess I was really scared.
Yah there's this song called Hellfire in it, it might be Disney's greatest song.
Are you sure. Better than Circle of Life, Tales as Old as Time, or Let it Go.
Well anything is better than Let it Go but it is definitely up there,
I guess I will give it shot. I have heard similiar things from other people so it must be true.
I swear you will love it! The music is the greatest and it does stay true to the source material.
Fine! Your already convince me! I think it is on Netflix or something.
