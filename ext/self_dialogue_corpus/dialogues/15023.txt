What do you think about Liar Liar?
I like that one.
Yes Jim Carrey is always funny.
I like when he beat himself up in the bathroom.
Me too that was funny.
Do you see him in The Cable Guy?
Yes that was funny too.
He was something in that one.
Yes he latched on and wouldn't let go.
Yes wow the guy couldn't get rid of him.
