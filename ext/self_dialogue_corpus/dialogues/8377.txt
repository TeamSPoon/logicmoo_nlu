Have you listened to much Shakira?
I used to, but not lately.
She has a new song, it is as great as any of her old songs.
What is the name?
It is called Me Enamore.
Ok I will have to listen to it.
It is a true jam, it is energizing and relaxing at the same time.
Wow that is an interesting combination.
Yes it is a unique song that sounds so good and is exciting and energizing as well.
I will check it out, thank you for mentioning it.
