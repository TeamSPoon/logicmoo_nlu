Who was the baddest bad guy in Star Wars?
Easy, Darth Vader.
Nah, he goes soft in the end
Well who do you think was the baddest?
Darth Maul. That guy was pure evil.
No way! He dies super quick in the first prequel.
Well yeah, but he was like really evil.
If that's your qualification then the Emperor was the baddest.
Oh yeah, I totally forgot about him. Yeah he's the baddest.
I'm still going with Vader.
