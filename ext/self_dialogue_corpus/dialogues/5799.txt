Hey, did you watch Disney movies as a kid?
Actually, I didn't watch that many. Why, do you want to watch one?
I was definitely one of those kids that was super into Disney. My favorite was the Lion King.
Yeah, now that I'm Googling it it turns out a lot of movies I watched were Disney! Just mostly live-action movies.
Oh! Did you ever see 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?
Yes-that one was my favorite! It made me want to be a marine biologist. I also loved Treasure Planet.
That one is animated though, right?
Yep! I didn't say every single one I'd seen was live-action, though.
Well if you haven't seen the Lion King yet, you better!
That's what everyone says. I guess I'm just stubborn!
