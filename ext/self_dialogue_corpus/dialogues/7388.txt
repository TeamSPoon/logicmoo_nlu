So I have watched the new Beauty and the Beast like seven times already.
I loved Dan Stevens as the beast!  But I love him in just about everything he does.
I had no idea he could sing!  He did a fantastic job on the song Evermore.
I have listened to that song on repeat.  But I have pretty much been listening to the whole soundtrack on repeat.
Emma Watson has a pretty good voice too.
I loved her as Belle, she looked the part perfectly.
I was afraid I would hate all of the new songs, but I actually loved them.
I'm a pretty hardcore classic Disney fan so I was worried too.
I almost left the movie crying during some scenes.
I loved that they answered some of the questions that needed answering from the cartoon.
