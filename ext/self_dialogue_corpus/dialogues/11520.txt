How do you feel about the Beatles?
The band? My family likes them but I'm not that familiar with their songs
You've probably heard some of their songs, though, right?
Yes, like All You Need is Love and popular songs like that
They have a pretty big range of songs that cross genres, so you'd probably enjoy some of their music if you gave it a try
What's your favorite Beatles song?
It's too difficult to choose, but I like Girl from Rubber Soul and Here, There, and Everywhere from Revolver
I'll have to check those out sometime
Those albums came out around the same time, yet they're so different. You should check out Abbey Road, too.
Sounds cool, I've heard of that, so I'll give it a try
