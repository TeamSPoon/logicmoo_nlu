Do you just love the Muppets?
Oh yeah.  I loved the Disney film The Muppets with Amy Adams.
Oh it was sooo cute. Good story too.
Right.  Restore the Muppets to their former glory.
They got the team back together!
With some newbies.
Oh like Jason Segel.  Mmm hmm.
Who is your favorite muppet?
Kermit of course!
Mine is Miss Piggy.
