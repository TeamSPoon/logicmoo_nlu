How much do you know about the first Super Bowl?
I know it was Green Bay Packers against the Kansas City Chiefs and that the Packers won.
Do you know where it was played?
In Los Angeles.
It was the only Super Bowl game ever played that wasn't sold out.
I wonder why.
Because journalists were telling people to go other places to watch it on TV because ticket prices were so high.
How much were they?
Twelve dollars.
Twelve dollars? That's nothing.
Not these days, but back then, it was a lot of money.
Wasn't the first Super Bowl played back sometime in the 1960s?
1967. Also, for the only time in Super Bowl history, the game was aired on two different networks.
Why is that?
NBC had the rights to the AFL games and CBS had the rights to the NFL.
I think it would be fun to watch the game and see how different things were back then.
It would be, but you can't.
Why not?
Neither network saved the footage.
That sucks. At least that doesn't happen today.
