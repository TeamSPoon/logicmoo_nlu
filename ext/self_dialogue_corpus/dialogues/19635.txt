am having a feeling nicky minaj might not show up on today's street show
why?
meek mill is also billed to perform as well and you know they both had split up recently
but if she's been paid then she have to show up regardless
i know because i for one actually paid to see her perform,so would feel short changed if she doesn't
but you'll still be thrilled by some classic sound from foxy brown and lil kim
oyeah i know but they were meant to be the icing on the cake for me not the cake itself hahaha.
you know nicky admitted to have fall in love with rap through lil kim?
so?
so lil kim can fill that vacuum if nicky doesn't show up hahaha
oh you not serious , lil kim  already sounding too old for rap,i think she should let it go.
I wouldn't buy to that ,her come back single "touch it" is trendy now you know.
its only trendy and sounded nice because she had rihana on the hook
so you saying kim can't lunch a comeback on her own?
am afraid not, the song would have been nothing if rihana wasn't on it.
but its always been like that, rappers always employ the help of singers to take most of their hooks, eminem did same with rihanna "love the way you lie" and was a hit,
true though but facts remains that kim rap era is passed
well thats for you though as i would still bump to a lil kim tune anytime any day, her punch lines are amazing
am not saying i wouldn't , rather i just feel too many good femcees in the industry right now for her to compete with.
but that's if she's out now to compete with any of them,think she's just doing her thing.
