I really want the Spurs to win the Finals.
Yeah I really like watching Leonard play.
It is nice to see someone play on both sides of the ball for sure.
Yeah the fact he isn't being more considered for MVP is a crime.
I totally agree.
I mean who else in contention plays defense as well as him.
No one, but I mean if we were being serious about MVP Lebron would win each year.
Well that is true but I think we have Lebron fatigue.
Yeah it seems like people do that.
Yeah everyone wants to race to anoint the next great one.
Yup its become a real problem.  If I had a vote it would go to Lebron for sure.
Yeah but I think this year Westbrook is going to win.
Yeah everyone seems to love him.
I am not sure why though.
He only plays offense and he only plays offense for himself.
Exactly.  I am so sick of hearing about him
I think it comes back to always wanting to find the next guy.
Yeah I think you are right.
Lets just agree it should be Lebron
OK and lets also agree the Spurs would be fun to keep watching.
