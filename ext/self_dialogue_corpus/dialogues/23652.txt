Is movies good to talk about?
Yes movies is a great topic
I figured it a more diverse topic
Of course
Do you prefer any genres?
I mainly like horror and action, you?
Comedy mostly.
I love all horror movies
Like saw and Texas chainsaw massacre?
Exactly.
I never watched Texas chainsaw saw massacre, because it's based on a true story
That's the best part about it.
Not for me.   It's creepy
I love it, it makes it more exciting
Was it a good movie?
YES!
Maybe I'll look into sometime
I doubt it
Me too, if it wasn't based on a true story
It's so good though
