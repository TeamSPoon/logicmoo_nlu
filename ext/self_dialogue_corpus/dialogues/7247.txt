Did you like the first, or second Rescuers movie more?
The first one.
I agree. That stuff with the mean lady was more memorable
I liked th swamp setting a lot.
Did you like the Australian setting in part 2?
Yes, but not as much as I liked the swamp
They are both great though
I agree
Did you lik Tomorrow is Another Day?
Yeah, that song fit in the movie perfectly.
