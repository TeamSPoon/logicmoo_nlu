You're about 25 years old right?
Yep, 26 actually.
Nice, so you got to grow up in the wonderful world of classic, hand-drawn Disney films.
I did! All the classics. I must have watched The Lion King at least 100 times as a kid.
The Lion King is hands down one of the best Disney films of all time.
Oh for sure. There probably isn't a person my age out there that hasn't seen The Lion King at least once.
Yea you're probably right. Even with how graphic the scenes with Mufasa and Simba's dad were, it was a great movie for kids.
Yea that scene was heartbreaking. It made the film feel real though.
It made it step away from the classic formula of the good guys always winning and everyone having a happy ending.
Which in turn is probably why it became such an intant classic.
