I am looking for a song by Glass Pear, the one they used in vampire diaries I think?
Oh I know what one you are talking about, "Wild Place" right?
Yes! That is the one, I just love the sound of it.
Do you listen to any of their other music?
No, maybe I should check some out.
Yeah, he has a very good sound in my opinion.
He's not American is he?
Nope, Welsh I believe?
I wonder if his songs have been used in any other tv shows.
Probably, they seem to do that with artists that are good, but not well known.
I'm going to look him up, if I like the one song so much, I'm sure I'll like more.
Wouldn't it be cool if he was putting on live shows?
Yea, but not being main stream, what are the chances he'd come anywhere around us?
True, but maybe we could find a page or twitter or something to follow so we'll know if he does.
Oh I just googled it, he has a web site.
Is he doing any shows?
I'm not seeing any updates since 2014. That's sad.
Maybe he's working on a whole album or just had a kid or something.
Either way, looks like he has a fair amount of songs here, I'm going to have to give them all a listen
Sounds good, let me know of any really good ones!
