Do you like 90s rock?
Of course, grunge was very influential!
There will never be another band like Nirvana, that's for sure, but Soundgarden was just as good.
Shame about Chris Cornell, he had a really powerful voice.
He had one of the best voices in rock. He wasn't grunge, but Mike Patton is up there!
I know! He's awesome, but too many people will only know him for Epic and not for his actual variety.
Yup, incredible range. He can scream in one song, croon like Frank Sinatra in another, and he's even done an opera album.
He's fluent in Italian and always wants to experiment, so that's no surprise.
You really should check out Mondo Caine, since that's his opera album.
Thank you, I will!
