What do you think of classical music?
I kind of like some of it.
Do you think it gets repetitive?
Sometimes, but it also can be very varied.
I do like Bach.
How about Mozart?
I think everyone likes Mozart but doesn't even realize they are hearing his compositions.
He was amazing.
Yeah, I heard he was a boy genius.
Most of these composers had to be genius.
Music is challenging to figure out.
Sure is, I tried lessons and didn't do so great.
Yeah, I took piano for about 5 years and didn't get anywhere close to where these musicians got.
Do you have a particular song you enjoy?
Yes, I do like Beethoven's 5th.
That's a classic classical song.
I tried to learn to play it when I took piano.
Do you remember it?
No, I don't remember too much but it was fun at the time.
These classical music songs are gems.
