Hey, can we listen to the Frozen soundtrack?
Sure, that sounds fine to me. I dig on that soundtrack for sure.
It's a really good one. I must have heard it a hundred times and I still like it every time.
Yeah, the singing is great. Hey, remember that thing-- the lovely and talented Adele Dazeem!
What? Is she one of the singers?
Well, I mean, no, the singer's name is Idina Menzel. But there was some awards show where John Travolta was introducing her and said her name wrong.
I mean, I'm... I'm not a Broadway person, so I don't know anything about that.
That's okay. It was a thing for like two weeks, like four years ago. I'm not surprised you don't remember it.
Okay. Well, whatever. Let's listen to the Frozen soundtrack!
Yes!
