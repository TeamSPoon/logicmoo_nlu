So what did you think of that new Young Thug album "Beautiful Thugger Girls"?
I freaking loved it! I think it was his best yet. What did you think?
I liked it but it's not my favorite of his.
What's your favorite Young Thug album or mixtape?
Mine is still "Barter 6".
Ah, that is my second favorite by him. Did you happen to listen to the new 2 Chainz album too?
Yeah! I really like that one. "Good Drank" was my favorite song and "Riverdale Rd" was my second favorite.
I really wasn't feeling it all that much. I thought the lows were pretty low.
Yeah, I can see that. By the way, check out Let Me Breath by Action Bronson when you get a chance. That joint is fire.
Ok, I'm always down for some new Bronson. Can't wait for that Blue Chips 7000.
