I just saw the film Unfaithful.
Oldie but a good one, what did you think?
It kept me on my toes.
Wondering what was going to happen next?
Yes, I really like the genre now.
There are several thrillers that are sort of similar.
Like which ones?
A perfect Murder, is one.
What is it about?
It is a remake of an old Hitchock film, "Dial M for Murder". Lots of thrills and lots of twists and turns.
