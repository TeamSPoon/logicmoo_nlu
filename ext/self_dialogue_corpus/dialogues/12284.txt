Who is better, Rey or Finn?
Finn is much more entertaining. He's funny.
But Rey seems like she's the main character.
Maybe that's the problem with her. She does everything too perfectly.
What do you mean?
She flies the Millenium Falcon better than Han Solo does!
Not really. She only repaired something Han didn't know about.
Repairing the Millenium Falcon is something Han Solo should be the expert in.
Han hadn't seen the ship in years, though. It was stolen from him.
I guess they wanted us to know Rey is an expert pilot.
