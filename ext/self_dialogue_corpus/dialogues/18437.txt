Ever here Perry Como live?
No I haven't.
I've seen him three different times.
That's pretty cool.
I grew up in a bar and always wanted to hear Perry Como.
On the juke box?
Yes,on the juke box.
You were very young.
Yes,I was told I danced to hot diggity dog when I was around three.
No kidding.
Then I just grew to love him.
Different to hear being that young.
Some of my favorites is just born,kewpie doll,what did Delaware.
You know a lot of songs.
How about it's impossible,you're following me,round and round.
