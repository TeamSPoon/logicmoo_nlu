What is your most favorite Disney movie that you have seen recently?
It has got to be Moana! The movie is so good! Plus hearing The Rock sing is really silly!
I'm surprised that they had The Rock actually sing in the movie!
Well, you can tell that's not his main talent, but it fits really well. And the songs are awesome!
Did they use Tim Rice like usual for their musical numbers?
No! They actually had Hawaiian songwriters for the movie to help with the songs!
That's really cool and fitting.
Yeah they did a really good job in terms of hiring people of either Hawaiian or Polynesian decent.
Is there any other actors or people I know of in that movie?
Nicole Schreizenger has a role in the movie as well!
The girl from The Pussycat Dolls? I didn't know she could voice act.
Well, she sings in a song or two as well. So it works.
Makes sense. I think I would pick ZooTopia for my favorite Disney movie recently. Or maybe Star Wars Rogue One.
It's so weird to say that Star Wars is actually a Disney movie..... That being said, The Last Jedi looks AMAZING!
Absolutely! I am definitely seeing the midnight showing of it! I can never have enough Star Wars. And Rian Johnson does amazing work!
Isn't he the guy who did Looper?
Yeah he is! He does some really weird but cool work. I think he is a perfect fit for the Star Wars universe.
Do you think they will say who Rey's Parent's are in this film?
Johnson said it isn't really addressed too much, but it may be a red herring!
Just say she's Luke's daughter already!
