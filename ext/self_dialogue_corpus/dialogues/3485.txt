Are you going to see It when it comes out?
I really want to.
Did you see the original one?
I have it on DVD and VHS.
Oh, so you are a fan.
I've read the book as well.
What do you think will be different from the first one?
I think they'll include more what's behind the monster.
What do you mean?
Pennywise wasn't the monster, he was the manifestation.  I want to hear the background of the monster, which is more terrifying.
