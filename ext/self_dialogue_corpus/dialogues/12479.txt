Who would win a fight, Darth Maul or Yoda?
I think Yoda would win
Why do you say that?
He is 100 times more powerful than Darth Maul
Well Darth Maul has two lightsabers pretty much
But Yoda is the strongest Jedi to ever live and is very agile!
But Darth Maul is younger than Yoda
That doesn't matter, Yoda has enough of the Force to take down any evil thing
I'd like to see him try! Yoda is way too old!
Yoda will do flips all around Darth Maul and then cut him in half!
