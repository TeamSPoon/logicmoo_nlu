I want to Rock!
That's funny. I like the newer stuff like five finger death punch or adalitas way.
Yeah I'm not big on the old stuff either. Metallica and and pantera is about as old as I go.
Oh man. I love cemetery gates.
It's a shame what happened to dime bag Darrel.
Yes it is a loss for sure.
Did you see that one of the members of five finger death punch quit on stage?
I did. Do you think it's funny how they had a replacement lined up?
Yeah I think they knew it was coming.
For sure. Drugs and rock and roll right?
