What do you think of Pop music?
I mean, it is such a big genre every one is bound to like something from it.
Everything from the Beatles to Katy Perry.
I think the best pop artist would have to be David Bowie.
I think he was really a game changer for pop music.
He made the genre be something more.
I like the way he mixed a bit of rock in .
Starman is one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life.
I loved Changes. I think it changed, get it, the whole genre.
He influenced so many other stars.
