What is your favorite movie music?
That covers a lot of time!
Okay, in the last 40 years.
Star Wars. Hands down.
What about Jaws?
I thnk that might be outside the timeline given?
That doesn't answer teh question . . .
I like Jaws but it is really tied to the movie.
I like the Harry Potter music.
Oooh. Those are good.
But I wish they did something slightly different for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
I think I agree with you.
What about the them from the Titanic?
Ha! You make me laugh. That's so silly.
It's a good song! But it is overplayed.
I think the Bodyguard is the best soundtrack.
Hey, what happened to Star Wars?
Star Wars is the best music, Bodyguard has the best songs.
Did you know that Dolly Parton wrote I Will Always Love you?
Yeah, I heard that.
