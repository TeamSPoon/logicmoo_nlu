Have you ever been to the stadium in Arizona where the Cardinals play?
Yeah, many times. It was only 10 minutes away from where we used to live.
I was wondering if it gets really loud because the roof is closed.
I guess so...then again any football game can get loud.
Where do they train before the season? In Arizona?
Yeah, the Cardinals training facility is in Flagstaff. It's in northern Arizona. Much cooler there.
Did you ever get to see the players up there? Like Larry Fitzgerald?
Yeah, I saw him and Kurt Warner back when he used to play.
Oh, he was a terrific player. Didn't he play for the Rams?
I think so. He is a great guy, too. So is Larry Fitzgerald.
Do you think they have a shot this season?
There's no reason not..but I say that every year. It is a great team.
I feel that way with the Titans. too.
I agree, they are good team. They are kind of an underdog team. I want to see them do good.
They had a really good season last year. With Mariota coming back after the injury, I think they will surprise us all again.
It will be nice to see some other teams go to the Superbowl besides Pats and whoever...
I know, right? I don't want to see them or the Steelers.
I agree. I'm not big on the Packers either.
Maybe even the Browns will do better this year.
How can they do any worse? They had the worst season ever last year!
