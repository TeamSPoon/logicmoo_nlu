We should watch a Disney movie tonight.
Which one did you want to see?
I think I want to watch Alice in Wonderland.
The live action version?
Yes, that one. Its my favorite.
Did you know that Anne Hathaway was originally offered the role of Alice?
No I didn't. Why didn't she do it?
She felt it to was too similar to other roles she played.
The White Queen was a great role for her then.
It was. I liked that was completely different than her normal characters.
