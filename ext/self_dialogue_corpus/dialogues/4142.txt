What is the difference between a thriller movie and a horror movie?
In my opinion, the movie genres are very similar.  Sometimes the words can be used interchangeable to describe the same movie.
At first, I thought that horror movies dealt more with the supernatural--like The Paranormal movies.
You have movies that are called thrillers that also incorporate the supernatural like The Shining.
True.  I have to admit that I have never really liked supernatural horror movies because I never get scared!
Have you seen Silence of the Lambs?
Yes.  Now, that movie is unnerving to me.
I would classify that as a thriller movie.
I think it is unnerving to me because it is closer to reality than a movie with the supernatural.  The actor who played the serial killer Buffalo Bill freaked me out.
That is a good point.  Someone like Buffalo Bill has or probably does exist in our world right now.
