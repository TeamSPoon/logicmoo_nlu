So what are you up to this evening?
Movie night at home. My choice!!
What  genre are you going to choose?
I have chosen for our fine viewing pleasure the  for a dramatic evening of suspense. TMNT!!
What are you talking about? I have no clue what TMNT is.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!! The movie with real people not animated. I love to watch those movies.
Are you kidding me! I totally forgot about those movies.
The one where they go back in time is my favorite. TMNT 111
I used to watch the animated series.
I like the animated stuff too but the movies are fun.
Will you ever grow up?
No too late now. I'm stuck in this forever weirdness that is me.
I have to say you keep me guessing what is going to come out of that eclectic bean of yours!
I don't know why I like some of the things I do at my age. I guess it's because age is just a number. It always has been.
Who's in that one that i might know?
No I don't think so. It is a time travel back to feudal Japan.
Time travel of course it makes total sense that large turtles would go time traveling!!
Who would have it otherwise.
Maybe I'll just leave that whole class of movies for you to enjoy.
Thanks I shall do that!
