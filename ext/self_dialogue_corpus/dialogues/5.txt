What is your favorite Nolan directed Batman movie?
I think Batman Begins.
That is a good one. Where it all started... for nolan anyways with batman.
I love a good origins background story. I love to see superheros develop into the new stronger persona.
Yes agreed. I also thought this film established a new tone to the batman movie.
It did, it became more dark and much more serious overall.
Which is good and bad. I enjoy the comic book aspect others but each decade seems to have a different take on the batman franchise.
I am glad that they got away from the cheese of the horrible george clooney era batman.  Michael keaton I love but george was just no good in this role.
Clooney was not as his strongest that is for sure. I thought katie holmes was super good in batman begins, I wish she would not have left.
Me too. I did not care as much for maggie in that role. Katie seemed better suited and had more chemistry on screen with bale.
