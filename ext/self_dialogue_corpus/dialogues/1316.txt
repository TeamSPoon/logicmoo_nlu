Hey are you ready for NFL preseason?
Yea man I have been waiting on it all year!
Can not wait for the first game to start already.
Hopefully its a good year for the Seahawks again.
The last few years they have been doing very good.
That is why I think they will be good this year.
They will have some competition on their hands this year though.
What team is their competition?
They have a few teams that are ready to beat them to the Super Bowl this year.
Which team do you think has the best chances for the Super Bowl this year?
I hope that the Colts make it this year finally.
That would be nice to see them make it this year.
It has been almost 10 years since they made them last year.
Wow! I did not realize that it was that long ago.
Yea it has been that long.
Well maybe this year it will be the Colts versus the Seahawks this year.
Our two favorite teams facing off would be fun.
So you wanna come over and watch the first preseason game at my house this year?
Yea sure that would be fun.
Alright then Ill see you there!
