Are there any bands you listen to that have heavily gendered fan bases?
Oh, for sure. This one band I love, The Hold Steady, tends to have a heavily male fan base.
Why do you think that is?
I don't know. Craig Finn the songwriter for sure writes from a male perspective and doesn't have a great voice, he sounds like a big Springsteen fanboy.
Ah, Springsteen idolization is definitely more male centric.
So what can you tell me about The Hold Steady?
They're a highly literate, bar rock band.
What makes them highly literate?
Well, Craig Finn writes these really novel-esque lyrics and he tends to write concept albums.
What are Hold Steady albums about?
Separation Sunday is about trying to find faith in something. There's a lot to unpack.
Let's try to unpack it.
There are five major characters on the album: Narrator, Gideon, Holly, Charlamagne, and Mary.
Okay, and what's their deal?
They're all from Minneapolis. It's really an absurd story about drugged out twenty- and thirty-somethings and how their experience relates to Christianity.
I don't think that sounds too interesting.
It's not for everyone for sure, but it brings together all the songs in a way that adds to each of them.
So the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Yes, but only if you're following the narrative across the songs. There are songs that are good, that get even better when you understand the story.
That's a neat thing for fans. That the album keeps giving.
