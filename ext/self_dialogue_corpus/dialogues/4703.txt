Boy the Mets are really spiraling out of control.
They have looked horrible lately.
yeah everything seems to have fell apart for this team
These guys have lost 7 in a row.
Yeah and 8 out of their last 10
It doesn't get any easier because they have to face an Angels team with Mike Trout
Well they have DeGrom on the mound tonight, maybe they can get a win.
They desperately need it. Right now they are 8 1/2 games behind the Nationals
They can't worry about the Nationals right now. They have to worry about not dropping to last place
Yeah, things had started out so well for this team this year.
Yeah they were 0-6 this last road trip. Abysmal.
Yeah and they are going up against Trout who has hit 5 home runs in 6 games
Yeah this couldn't be worse for the Mets
I smell another loss coming to this team.
Maybe they can right the ship. It is still early in the season and anything can happen.
Maybe you are correct, but they better start turning this thing around fast.
Yeah they have definitely looked like a underachieving ball club.
Exactly and their pitching has left a lot to be desired.
Their startes are not giving them quality innings right now.
Nope. And I fear more of the same tonight.
