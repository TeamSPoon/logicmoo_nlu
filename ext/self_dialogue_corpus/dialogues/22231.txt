How often do you go to the movies?
I go probably two to three times per month. It just depends on what's out at the moment and if friedns are going.
Yeah, I don't really like going to the movies by myself either. What movies are you into?
I generally like action and comedy movies the best, but I'm pretty open to whatever.
Yeah, I'm the same. Not too picky.
Any movies you're looking forward too?
Yeah, I really want to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Oh cool, yeah, I've heard those movies are really good. I've only seen the first one and really liked it.
Yeah, they're awesome. They seem to be really popular.
I didn't know if you were into movies based on comic books, but did you hear the director for the Justice League movie stepped back from the project?
I like movies based on comic books and no, I hadn't heard that.
Yeah, I think his daughter past away very recently. She must've been pretty young because the director doesn't look very old.
Oh man, that's awful. It's completely understandable that he'd want to step away from work for a while.
Yeah, hopefully he can make a come back after such a tragedy.
Yeah, definitely. Speaking of movies, I hope this doesn't make me sound immature since I'm an adult, but I'm really looking forward to Despicable Me 3.
Not at all, I'm an adult and I like those kind of kids movies. I haven't seen any of the Despicable Me movies, but I generally enjoy computer animated kids movies.
Okay cool, yeah, I know they're for kids, but they usually make the humor and action pretty enjoyable for adults too.
Yeah, I agree. I've liked those kinds of movies going way back to the first Toy Story movie.
That's a great series of movies. I'm pretty sure the first Toy Story came out in the mid-90s.
Oh wow, has it really been that long? It doesn't seem like it's been over 20 years since it came out.
