I went to see Micheal Bublee in vegas last week
Oh yeah, he is very talented
He puts on an amazing show
I have heard he really looks out for his fans
He really does, he sang till 2 am, and didnt go home until every autograph was signed.
Have you ever heard a duet with him
he has quite a few, my favorite is with celine dion
They both have amazing voices
Do you like Josh groban?
He is absolutely my favorite
If anyone could sing like an angel, its him
what about Elvis
I think everyone loves Elvis
My Mom was addicted to him
My Mom loved Kenny Rodgers
We are really dating ourselves
Yes, I grew up with Crystal Gayle, kenny rogers and lorretta lynn
They are all amazing
Did you know crystal Gayle and Lorretta lynn are sisters?
wow, I sure didnt
