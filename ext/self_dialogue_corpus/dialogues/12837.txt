Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?
Which one do you mean?
I mean The Last Jedi.
Oh yes, I can't wait!
Are you also excited for the Han Solo movie?
Yes, I am. I am a little worried that it will be as good as Rogue One or not.
Yeah, me too. I did hear yesterday that Disney fired the two people who were directing it because their creative vision didn't align.
I heard that too, I think that is a good sign.
I bet they were trying to make it all artsy and have the characters be all sexual and emo and that's not what Disney is about.
Yeah I take it as a good sign that Disney is willing to fire directors if they feel they aren't taking Star Wars in the direction they want.
