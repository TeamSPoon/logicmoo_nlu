Do you think Busta Rhymes is overrated?
The exact opposite.
How can you call him underrated when hes featured in alot of stuff.
Because no one mentions him among the greats.
So you think hes less of a rapper?
No, I just think hes a bit undervalued.
He does have a unique delivery.
I think When Disaster Strikes is a hallmark rap album.
In what sense?
That it should be considered genre defining
