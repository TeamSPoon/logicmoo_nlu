I'm excited to watch my favorite movie of all time tonight.
What movie is it?
The Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland.
Oh I love that movie too.
It's such a classic and it's an awesome story I watch it about once a year.
I like some older movie too like Willy Wonka.
Oh I love that movie too I could watch it over and over.
I loved it when that boy got stuck in the TV.
The whole movie is so creative and it was made so long ago, the cinematography is amazing.
The movie also has a really good message.
It does and I love Charlie!
My favorite character is Charlie's grandfather.
It was so great when he jumped out of bed to go to the chocolate factory.
I also loved when Charlie inherited the factory and told his family.
I know they were so excited and happy.
I was sad when Gene Wilder died.
Me too, he was an amazing actor.
I agree but I think Willy Wonka was his best movie.
I think so too, I'm going to watch it now.
And I'm going to watch The Wizard of Oz!
