What would you say is the most beautiful song of all time?
When you say 'beautiful', do you mean something other than 'best'?
Definitely! There's a big difference.
How so?
Let's say you think the song 'Angel of Death' by Slayer is the best song. It would be hard to also call that the most beautiful.
Because it's got a harsh sound to it? OK, I get it.
Yeah, so my question is about what song you find most beautiful.
I think I might choose the song 'Volare'.
I've never heard of it.
It's not an American song, nor is it sung in English.
Ah, that's interesting. That's probably why I don't recognize it.
There are actually two versions of the song, one Spanish and one Italian.
Which of those do you like most?
The Italian one is my favorite.
Is it sung by someone in particular?
Yes, Andrea Bocelli does a beautiful rendition of it.
I've heard of him. He sings mostly Opera music, right?
That's where he got his start. But I think he's kind of a cross-over singer.
I'll give 'Volare' a listen when I get a chance.
You will really love it, I think!
