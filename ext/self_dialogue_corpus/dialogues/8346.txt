Do you think Olivia Newtown John was a good pop singer?
I think she was a great pop singer.
She had a lot of hits back in the day.
Yes she did.
Her song The One That I Want from grease is good.
I like that too.
How about Hopelessly Devoted To You from Grease.
I like that one better.
Magic is my favorite.
