You were in marching band, right?
Yes.
How did you like it?
I hated it passionately, for the most part.
Why? I know you hate a lot of things, though.
I never wanted to do it, but it got me out of the house and sort of socializing.
Didn't you enjoy the shows?
Not really. We once were marching in a Halloween parade and kids threw candy into my sousaphone bell.
Hahahahah, I'm sorry!
Wish I smacked them with it, or used them as a mute.
Did you like the game experience?
Sort of. I enjoyed playing in the band in the stands, but on the field there was too much multitasking.
Yeah.
And you know high schoolers. They suck at nearly everything.
That's harsh.
Go watch high school marching bands. Terrible.
You're getting a bit bitter. Tell me something nice about it.
After each home game, we'd go out and get pizza at Valley Pizza until late at night.
Well, at least there's that!
Gotta love putting calories back on after a long day on the field.
