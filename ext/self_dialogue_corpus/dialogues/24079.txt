Have you ever seen the movie dirty dancing?
Yes, I love that movie.
Me too! Patrick Swayze is a hunk.
Yes he is!
So I was thinking of doing the dance from the movie at my wedding.
That would be amazing.
I think it will be fun.
Are you going to do the lift?
Ww are still deciding on that.
Well no one puts baby in the corner.
That is my favorite line in that movie!
What other Patrick Swayze movies do you like?
Ghost was another great movie of his.
Yes, it was so heartfelt and romantic.
Have you seen One Last Dance?
I haven't, is the dancing as good as dirty dancing?
I don't know I have never seen it either.
We should rent that movie and have a movie night.
Yes we should! How about Saturday at my place.
I will be there.
