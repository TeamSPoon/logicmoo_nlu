Do you have a favorite movie of all time?
Not really, I think there's too many to choose from, you?
I love the avengers, maybe those movies.
Those were pretty good
I love how all the DC comics movies come together.
I enjoyed that too
They were all made and scripted very well.
I agree and they casted great.
They do all seem to do their parts good.
Casting is the most important part of the movie, some directors dont get that
Exactly like the Twilight saga.
Those were so horrible.
I wouldn't watch them again if someone paid me
Nope, me either
There was so much hype about them and they turned out to be awful
They had so much potential too
Exactly, I'm glad the casting isn't that bad.
Exactly, that would have bad
I love thor
I liked loki
