I think I really like Beyonce, do you?
I think she's alright. What is your favorite song she's done?
I don't know. I think I really like stuff from the Lemonade album.
I agree. That album just blew my mind.
Well it was a visual masterpiece as well. Did you see the last track where she's dressed in a turban?
Yeah. That was amazing. What about the one where Serena Williams was in the video?
Yes I loved that! Did you know Saturday Night Live did a parody of that?
No way. What was it about?
It was about Melania Trump as Beyonce and she was saying "bye" to Donald Trump. It was so funny.
There have been other parodies of Beyonce's Lemonade album. Do you watch "Unbreakable" on Netflix?
Yes. Why did Beyonce make an appearance on there?
No. The guy who lives with Kimmy pretended to be Beyonce when he broke up with his boyfriend.
Oh yeah! I think I saw something about that. He was wearing a yellow dress and carrying a baseball bat just like Beyonce!
Exactly. It was really good.
Do you think her marriage to Jay Z will last?
I don't know. That whole album was supposed to be about his cheating.
Yeah. It's sad. But they seemed to have made up.
Yes and she is pregnant again.
I know! Can you believe it? I guess she's pregnant with twins.
Yes, and if they turn out looking like Beyonce they're going to be gorgeous.
