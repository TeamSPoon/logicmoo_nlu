Do you think the Celtics can beat the Lebron?
No chance. They can push them to six games though.
I don't think any team is going to give the Cavs a game until Golden State.
Yeah, and even then I don't think Lebron and the Cavs have much of a chance.
Don't underestimate Lebron.
There's no way they can hang with the Warriors for 7 games.
Probably not. The Warriors have too much firepower.
Yeah, and the Cavs don't have any if it's not Lebron or Kyrie.
Do you think Lebron is the best player in the game?
Yeah, he still is, at least for one more year.
Next year I think Kawhi overtakes him as the best.
He keeps getting better every year.
I know. I hope he shuts down Durant in the upcoming series.
I do too. I think San Antonio can win 1 or 2 games.
Even if Kawhi shuts down Durant, Steph and Klay will score at will.
That's why nobody will beat Golden State.
There are 4-5 guys on the team that could be number one options elsewhere.
Most teams are lucky if they have two of those types of players. The Warriors have 4.
And some teams don't even have one.
But if your team has one, and he's the best player in the world, don't count them out yet.
