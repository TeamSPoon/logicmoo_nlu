Do you like accapella music?
I'm not really sure. Do you mean like old barbershop quartets and that kind of thing?
Sort of like that, but more contemporary. I mean they use their voices to sing and to create rhythms.
Oh I get it! Like beat boxing, right?
Yes! I really like the accapella group called Pentatonix. Have you heard of them?
Actually I have. I never heard their music but I have heard the name.
Would you like to watch a YouTube video featuring Pentatonix?
I'd love to. It seems like something I might enjoy.
My favorite video they have on YouTube is called The Evolution of Music. It is like fast forwarding through hundreds of years of musical styles.
What do you mean hundreds of years?
Well, it starts off like Gregorian Chant from the Middle Ages and then goes all the way up to the stuff you hear on the radio today.
Doesn't that take a long time to listen to?
No, actually it's just snippets of songs and it goes really fast. When I first listened to it I was amazed at how many of the tunes I actually knew.
Okay, sounds cool. Who is your favorite singer in the group?
I like them all and they are all very talented musicians but I think I like Avi Kaplan best. I just love his deep voice!
I like bass voices too so I'm sure I'll enjoy it. How many members are in the group?
There are five in total. Four of them are men and then one woman.
How did they get started as a group?
You know I'm not totally sure. I think they were in high school together and sang in show choir or something.
Wow! Who would have expected show choir geeks to make it big? Let's go check it out!
