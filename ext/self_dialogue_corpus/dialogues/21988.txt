Have you seen the new star wars movie?
I have not, is it good?
Yea! The special effects were great.
How was the story?
It was easy to follow for me, and had some good twists.
There are so many of these movies, when do you think they will stop?
Probably never, they are super popular.
Yea, its like Mission Impossible or James Bond, a good franchise goes on forever
If it's making money, and people like it, why stop?
I would say James Bond is my favorite movie franchise.
It's so good. I love Daniel Craig
Who's your favorite Bond out of all of them?
I would say Sean Connery
He does have a great accent
Yea, and he just delivers a powerful and confident role.
What about your favorite bond villian?
I would have to go with Mr White
For me, its Jaws.
They are all good, who are we kidding.
Yupp, a fantastic franchise that I hope never ends.
