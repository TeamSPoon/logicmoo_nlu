What do you think of the whole cte stuff.
Its scary for anyone
You dont mess with concussions
I know Ive had a couple
Really
Yup
Not as bad as players though.
Brain trauma is the worst
and how the nfl covered it up is worse
i know right
if some of these players had gotten help
maybe they would be alive
to many good players taking their lifes
at least now they're studying it more
and its not a secret anymore
It's a shame that these older players went through what they did and made nowhere near the money that players do now
At least they can help now
Hopefully
People know what to look for
that is true
