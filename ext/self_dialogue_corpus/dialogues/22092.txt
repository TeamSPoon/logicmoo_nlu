Wait, do I have all the dreamworks movies?
How should I know? Do you have all the dreamworks movies?
I need a list of ALL the movies dreamworks made.
Even the shorts?
They made shorts?
You know, to be honest, I have no idea. I have to go check. Let me get to a list here, let me see here. Whoa.
What? Whoa, dude, they made 34 movies?
Well, 34 feature films, meaning full length theater movies. So, yes. 34 movies.
That seems a lot. and I don't think I own them all. I wanna check, go down the list and read them off. I wanna check.
Ok. Want me to read the names of the movies? Ok Fine.
Phew. I have seen all their movies, but I don't have all of them. Maybe half of them at most.
Half more than I have.
I like animations. Obviously. You know looking at this list does remind me that some dreamworks movies were flops.
Not all studios can produce hits all of the time, every time.
More like "NO studios can do that." See though. Sharktale shouldn't be ranked a low as that. That was a great movie.
Rottentomatoes rankings are not that reliable if you ask me. I think IMDB is much better at ranking the quality of the movies than RT.
Yeah, maybe, and this movie ratings is an example.
So which ones do you not own and want to own now?
Rise of the guardians. hat's the Christmas Movie I told you about. it's so cute. It's a brand new spin on old Christmas stories.
The one where Jack Frost loses his memories and turns into the guardian of having fun? That one?
