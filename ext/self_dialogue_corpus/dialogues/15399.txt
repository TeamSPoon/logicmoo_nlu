Have you heard of Katy Perry's new song?
She came out with a new album?? What's the song?
It's called "Swish, Swish."  Sounds familiar?
Oh my gosh, does that have a reference with Taylor Swift?
It sure does, it has some pretty interesting lyrics.
I am so stoked about it! What did she say about Taylor?
"A tiger don't lose no sleep, don't need opinions from a shellfish or a sheep" is one of the lines from the song.
Whoa, that's pretty intense! Compared to Taylor's "Bad Blood" this is definitely bolder.
I would have to agree, this feud they have is getting some crazy attention.
They have been in the news a lot lately.
Speaking of Taylor, she is back on Spotify!
What?? Since when? She did not like Spotify at all!
Right! I guess she had a change of heart.
I am so going to add her on my new playlist.
I just thought it was a really interesting move.
Well, she is a businesswoman after all and when you're not getting enough monetary credit I would pull back too.
I guess you are right, but do you think it may have something relatable to a publicity stunt?
Just like the Perry/Swift feud? You might be on to something.
Regardless, I love the new song "Swish Swish."
Haha "Blank Space" by Taylor Swift is still my number one.
