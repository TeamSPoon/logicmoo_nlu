Hey, you ready for the next Marvel movie?
Already? Didn't they just have one come out?
Yeah, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 came out earlier this month.
Man, there's so many I can't keep up. Which one's next?
Spider-Man Homecoming, I think in Mid-July.
Haha, wow, I can't believe they're rebooting Spider-Man for the fifth time.
Well, it's only the third time--there was Toby McGuire's, Andrew Garfield's, and now Tom Holland.
You get my point, that's a lot of Spider-Mans in like fifteen years.
True, but I think Tom's going to do a great job.
Wasn't he already in a movie?
Yeah, he had a cameo in Captain America Civil War.
Oh I saw that! Yeah, he was funny.
I loved his snark in this so much, I think they're really going to nail him this time.
Well, I thought the Garfield one was good, it just had bad writing.
That's true. Good writing will really make or break a film.
I'll give it a shot, I guess.
It should help that RDJ's in it too.
Wow, pulling star power!
Yeah, having his acting expertise should help the film.
Sweet, then I'll put it on my calendar to go see!
