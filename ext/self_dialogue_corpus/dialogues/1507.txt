The 2017 NFL season is about to start.
I have heard that and I am excited.
What team do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
I think that the Oakland Raiders have a good chance to win it all.
The Raiders are good but they play in a tough division.
I think with the addition of Marshawn Lynch that they will be unstoppable.
Don't you think Beastmode will struggle after being out all of last season?
I think his short retirement will leave him feeling healthy and ready to go.
The New England Patriots are always in contention in the AFC.
That is true, but Tom Brady is getting old and he can't dominate forever.
Who do you think is the best out of the NFC.
I think that the Atlanta Falcons with be the top team from the NFC.
The Seahawks are always in contention.
Seattle's offensive line is not good enough to be a contender this year.
Do you think that the Carolina Panthers can return to the competitive team they were two seasons ago.
Yes, Cam Newton will be healthy this year.
Who will win the MVP award?
I think it will be Derek Carr.
I think that Russel Wilson will win it.
He might be able to win it.
