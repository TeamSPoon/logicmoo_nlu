Paranormal Activity was pretty good
It was and made you think about if it could be real.
How did you like how the storyline unfolded?
I though it was a bit dsijointed.
Id say it was more along the lines of a horror film.
Yeah but where do you think the film could have gone
In a direction where you would see something
The aura of not knowing was the entire plot.
Yeah it was a strange way to go about it
But audiences were freaked out I bet.
