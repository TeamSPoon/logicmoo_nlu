I love Christmas music.
What is your favorite Christmas song?
Oh Holy Night but song by Josh Groban.
Oh that is a wonderful piece of music.
It really makes me think of Christmas when I hear that song.
And that song really goes through you and feeds down to your soul.
I also like simpler pieces to though like We Wish You a Merry Christmas because they are such fun to sing  along to.
I really like Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas.
Oh that is another great song. I like that too. It goes from slow to fast and really draws you in.
Hall and Oates Jingle Bell Rock is another classic song.
Their version of that song is the best.
It puts me in the Christmas spirit.
White Christmas is another classic.
Yes, but I find that one a little too slow.
I guess it could be a little bit of a downer.
Yeah, I would rather hear more upbeat music.
Well then you can never go wrong with Jingle Bells then.
That is a a fun one the kids love to sing along to although they change the words.
Yes, I think they stick Batman and Robin into it.
Christmas music does have many different styles.
