Did you like when the Sants won it all?
Yeah, it was cool
But, you're a Cardinals fan.
I know, but I was still happy for them
That's interesting
I did not like when the Ravens won
Why?
I was in a casino and there was a terrible fan there
I see
Fans can ruin teams for me
Well, Baltimore has not been back in a long time
They never will be either
You really don't like them
I don't
Are you a 49ers fan?
No
Well, they are the team the Ravens beat in the Super Bowl
I like the 49ers, but I am a Cardinals fan
Do you think they'll do good this coming year?
Maybe
