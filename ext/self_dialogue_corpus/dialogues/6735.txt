Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Hmm, probably Peter Pan if I had to answer.
Ooh good pick. Who was your favorite character.
Pan duh, who was yours?
Hehe, the crocodile!
What? Why?
Well without the crocodile there is no ending, hook would still be going after Pan.
Exactly! That's why he shouldn't have been involved, it could've been longer.
What was your favorite part?
When Pan flew for the first time.
