Which Psycho did you like better?
The original was fine.
Norman Bates was seriously a disturbed character.
Yeah the entire premise was bizarre.
It was a great film because of its gruseome demeanor.
The updated version was not bad either.
Yeah but the original really made Bates who he was.
I think he was so disturbing
There was alot of truth in the film
I think thats why it scared so many people
