You know what movie that I saw recently? The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai.
Across the 8th Dimension?
Yep, that's the one. One of Peter Weller's finest films.
What exactly was the 8th dimension?
Beats me. I never figured it out. But he drove through a mountain.
Wasn't Christopher Lloyd in that as well?
He was. I think he played John Bigboote.
Who else was in it?
Well, John Lithgow played the villain.
That's a heck of a cast. What was it about?
Beats me, I was drunk through most of it. But it was a ton of fun. Something about aliens trying to destroy the Earth.
What was the best moment?
This doesn't sound like much, but I really liked the scene when Buckaroo and his rock band are performing and he stops the performance because he hears someone crying in the crowd.
That sounds really stupid.
It was, but it worked.
So how did it end?
Buckaroo saves the day, of course, and Lithgow blows up in his spacecraft.
What about Bigboote?
He was in the spaceship with Lithgow.
Next time I feel like drinkin', I'll check it out.
