Have you heard of Cardi B?
No, who's that?
The girl from Love and Hip Hop... you know her.
Oh, yeah! She raps, right?
Yup, she just dropped a new song called Bodak Yellow.
Oh wow, how does it sound?
I really like it. She can flow well...
Oh wow, I'm surprised.
Why so?
You know, a lot of these rappers on these shows aren't that talented.
But, Cardi is... she's improved at every project
Oh wow, that's good to hear. What type of music does she make in particular?
She makes rap, she's a Bronx girl, so it's hard.
Oh wow, would you think I'd like it?
Maybe... her lyrics are very explicit...
Ok, I can attempt to listen to it.
Yep, just wanted to let you know. But, her vocals are dope.
Ooh, I gotta check it out.
She's so unique and true to herself. It's somewhat inspiring to be honest.
Oh wow, so I need to hear her music now.
