Hi.
Hi.
Do you like comedies?
Yeah sure who doesn't.
What's one that you watched recently that was really bad.
I watched Baywatch, that was pretty rough.
Oh yeah I heard the critics tore into it.
Yeah that's right.
The rock was on twitter trying to defend it, but it was a lost cause.
Yeah I saw that.
