What version of Batman do you like better...the version with Christian Bale as Batman or the latest version with Ben Affleck as Batman?
Definitely Christian Bale.
I would agree. Not really a super fan of the new Ben Affleck Batman, though he's alright.
Yea. I feel like they should have just stopped after Christian Bale was done playing Batman.
Those movies with him as Batman were so good. Like the best Batman movies ever.
Yea, Christopher Nolan did such a phenomenal job on those movies.
He should just direct every superhero movie ever.
Haha, they would all be so good!
Well we'll have to see if Ben Affleck's version of Batman gets any better with the coming movies.
I hope so. It would be such a waste.
