Have you heard of System of a Down?
I think so, I don't know.
How about the song Toxicity?
It doesn't sound familiar.
It goes like "Disorder, disorder, now somewhere between the sacred silence is sleep".
Oh yeah, I love that song.
Yeah it's fantastic.
I saw it on MTV.
You should check them out.
I will. I really liked that song.
Yeaah, it's classic
No doubt.
Also, watch their song, "Sugar".
Oh, okay.
It's even better.
Oh neat. Thanks for the advice.
Anytime, man.
Thanks for the heads up.
No problem.
See you then.
