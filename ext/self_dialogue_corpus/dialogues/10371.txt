Hey, how's it going?
Not bad, it's a lovely day today.
Yes it is, makes me want to sing.
Me too, reminds me of good times with good friends and great music.
I agree, I haven't seen a show in so long.
Me neither, when's the last time you went to a show?
I think it was 3 years ago to a Bob Dylan concert.
Whoa, he's still alive?
Yup, he looks old as dirt though.
How was the show?
Not bad, he still has a terrible voice but there's something to love about it.
Yes, he's a legend. I think he got famous because of his strange voice.
That or his genius writing skills.
True. Did you know he wrote a bunch of popular songs sung by other musicians?
No I didn't, which ones?
Well the most famous is "all along the watchtower."
Wow, I always just assumed Jimi Hendrix wrote it.
Nope, it was Bob.
Very cool, are there more?
Tons more, you should google it.
