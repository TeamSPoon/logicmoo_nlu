What defines a rock and roll band?
I guess it's just a matter of opinion. Modern, classic, new age?
Right, there are so many catagories.
I love classic rock. We just seen an Aerosmith concert on tv last night.
Oh wow, how did they sound?
Pretty good. Very entertaining.
They have so many good songs.
Yes they do. Steven Tyler swore so much, I was shocked.
Not that it bothers me but I agree sometimes language in rock music can get back.
It's just not nessesary. Classic rock didn't have so much vulgar words.
