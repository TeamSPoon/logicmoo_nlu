Do you remember the "Brat Pack"?
I think so. What were some of their movies again?
The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, stuff like that.
Yes, most of those actors sorta fizzled out didn't they?
Yeah, when was the last time you heard anything about Emilio Estevez or Andrew McCarthy?
Who's Andrew McCarthy?
He was the rich kid in Pretty in Pink.
Molly Ringwald's crush?
Yup, that's the one. What in the world happened to him?
Beats me, I completely forgot about that guy.
Who was the rich jerk in that movie? The dude with the slicked back hair?
James Spader wasn't it.
Yeah, that's right. He's really come into success with his TV career.
Pretty in Pink was a John Hughes movie wasn't it?
Shermer in Illinois all the way.
Kind of weird that all of Hughes' films took place in the same town.
That is kind of weird. The Breakfast Club was my favorite.
Judd Nelson was fierce in that one.
Molly Ringwald was really cute too. Where's she at now?
I have no idea. Probably married with a couple of kids.
