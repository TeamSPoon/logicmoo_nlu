Why do you think Johnny Maziel was such a bust?
I think the guy had some talent but he was way too interested in partying and not improving himself in the game.
Do you think the browns gave up on him too quickly?
No, if anything I think the Browns stuck with him for too long. It was evident that this guy was a cancer.
I really think he might have succeeded if he had been drafted by another team.
I agree that the browns did him no favors by drafting him but I don't think there would have been any difference if he went to a different team.
You could put almost any quarterback behind the browns offensive line and they wouldn't be able to move the ball.
True. However, Manziel was way too short for the game and he was too big of a kid.
He won the Heisman though. He's got to have some talent.
There were some flashes of hope with him. Maybe if he were to clean up his act, he could have gotten better.
Do you think he will ever get back to the NFL?
I kind of doubt it. Maybe one day a team will take a chance on him as a backup.
I think a team might grab him sooner than you think.
I doubt it. It would have happened by now.
Yes, but teams situations are always changing along with their needs.
I don't think anyone is going to take a risk on him after all of the goofing off he has already done.
Why do you think the browns took a chance on him?
At that time, it wasn't as much of a risk. The guy looked much more appealing because he had just won a heisman.
I think Haslem regrets drafting him
He has openly admitted to it.
