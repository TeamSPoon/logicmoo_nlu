Do you listen to hip-hop music?
Not really man, unless The Roots on Jimmy Fallon counts.
I don't think that counts.
I watched Dave Chapelle's Block Party movie.  The Roots were in that.
I still say you can't count that, unless you're like watching the movie every day.
Yeah, well who should I listen to?
I don't know man.  I was hoping you listened to it so you could recommend some hip-hop to me.
I guess sometimes I do listen to NWA.
I've never heard of that.
It's great, you should check it out.
