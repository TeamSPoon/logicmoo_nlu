I am thinking of starting a fashion line.
Will it be like the Apple Bottoms brand?
No, I was thinking of a line modeling the Chanel brand.
I love Chanel. Everything is so classy and elegant.
I especially love the idea of the pearl.
Yes, I once had a beautiful pink Chanel peal necklace.
I remember that necklace.
Do you think you could replicate that design?
I would have to see a picture of it to do a replication.
I think i have a picture right here in my phone.
I could create one without looking at the picture.
How would you do that?
I could just get the pearls and string them into a beautiful style that's my own.
That sounds like a great idea.
You would surely need a dress to go with the pearls.
Would you be able to design the dress as well?
I sure would, I could use you as a model for all of my designs.
I would be honored.
It is my pleasure.
When can we start?
