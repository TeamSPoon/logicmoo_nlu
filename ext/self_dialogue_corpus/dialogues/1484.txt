What do you think is the worst team in the NFL?
Without a doubt it must be the Cleveland Browns
That's what I was thinking also
They haven't done anything noticeable in years
I remember some seasons where they didn't even win a single game
Just terrible
It must be hard to be a cleveland fan
I know a few, thankfully they have one of the best basketball teams in the NBA
Yeah that must make them feel a little better
I think the jaguars are a close second worse
Yeah I totally agree, they've been about as good as the browns
They are starting to show promise though
Their quarterback is starting to do good
Blake Bortles has a lot of potential
I think that team will improve over the next few years
Yeah but not superbowl material
Hey but you never know, anything could happen
Those two teams are definitely not winning that anytime soon
I have to agree with that for the most part
But I still like to cheer for the underdog
