You by any chance a fan of a particular type of music?
Yeah. I'm a pretty hardcore rap fan.
Really? Who's your favorite?
Right now, or all-time?
How about both?
Right now, my favorite rapper is easily Kendrick Lamar.
And what about all-time?
That's got to be the Notorious BIG.
A bit of East and West. I like it.
Glad to hear it!
