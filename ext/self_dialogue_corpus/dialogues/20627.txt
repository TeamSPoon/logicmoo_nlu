I saw your ex-boyfriend at the mall yesterday.
Was he with his new girlfriend?
He was with a woman. He stopped and said,"hello" but he did not introduce her.
Your girl is lovely, Hubble.
Huh, what does that mean?
It is a line in the movie "The Way We Were".
Oh, like don't sit Baby in a corner.
Yes, or Frankly my dear I don't give a ....
Ha, ha I could have been a contender.
How about, Toto I've a feeling were not in Kansas anymore.
What line would you tell her?
Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.
Okay, what line would you tell him?
What we've got here is failure to communicate.
How about,"I love the smell  of napalm in the morning".
That too. How's this one "A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."
Oh gross, "I'm walking here! I'm walking here"!
Me too, well that was fun.
I glad you can laugh about it now.
Of course because now, "There's no crying in baseball" at least not anymore.
