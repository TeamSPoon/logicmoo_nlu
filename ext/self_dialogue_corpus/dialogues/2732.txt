So do you like American football?
I love it! I am a big fan.
So do you have a favorite team in the NFL?
My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns.
What? Are you being serious or are you just joking around?
I am totally serious.
Wow. Ok. I did not mean to be rude, it is just that I have seen the videos.
What videos.
You know, the ones of the Browns fans tearing off their jerseys in the stands or staring off into space in disbelief as yet another game is lost.
I think they are an exciting team.
Ok.  And that is good. That is part of what makes watching football fun.  Every year is a new beginning.
This was a good year for us.
How do you figure?
Well, usually we win just enough games to ruin our draft picks. This year we didn't do that.
Well, I have to admit, you did get a lot of good draft picks.
I think it is really going to help us be competitive.
You are probably right, might really take hold in a few years.
Seriously, losing fifteen games was the best thing we could have done this year. We weren't going to win in the playoffs anyway and what does 8-8 do for us? Nothing.  We had a really good year.
If you say so, I mean you are the Browns fan, so you would know.
You got that right.
