Have you seen the latest Star Wars movie, Rogue One.
Yes, I did.  It was really well.
I loved the blind Chinese guy who had the force.
I know, he was awesome.  He kicked some ass.
Even, thought you knew how it was going to end based on the Original three movies, it was still suspensful.
Did you like "the Force Awakens"?
Yes I did,  most of it was awesome?
The part were Kylo Ren got beat up by the girl was ridiculous?  She had never done any training or anything.
That part was a little stupid.
I guess they were trying to show how powerful she was.
