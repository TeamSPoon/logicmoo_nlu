Do you remember Marcus Allen?
Or sure, played for USC
Yeah and the Raiders
Oh yeah I remember that.
Yeah, he was a great running back.
Didn't he win a Super Bowl with them.
Yes, two times I believe.
Did he finish his career with them?
No, he ended up playing for the Chiefs for awhile
The Chiefs of Kansas City?!
That's the one.
Man I had no idea.
Yeah, Joe Montana played with them for a bit as well.
Man, land of the washed up players.
Well I think he was still pretty good with them.
How many Super Bowls did he win in total?
I think just that one.
Oh really, I thought the Raiders won more.
They did earlier, but not recently.
That's too bad for them.
