Have  you seen the  new  Eli roth   film  Clown ?
I have not  is  it  very  scary ?
It has more of a  comedy feel in the  start of  it .
So is it more like  idle hands ?
It  does have some of that dark  humor  to it   just not as  well  portrayed .
So  what is  the main  story in  it ?
It describes  a  man that  slowly becomes  a demon  clown  and  starts to  eat  children .
Is the  special  effects  good in it ?
I thought the make up on the clown was  very well done .
so  i  take it  he really looked like  a demon clown then
