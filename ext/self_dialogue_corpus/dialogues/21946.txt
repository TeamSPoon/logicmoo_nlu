I finally saw The Lego Movie the other day.
Oh, yeah? Did you like it?
It was definitely, very alright.
That's it? Just alright.
It was okay. It wasn't as deep or funny as I expected.
Well, what did you expect? It is a children's film after all.
Just because a movie is made for kids, that doesn't mean it can't shoot for the stars.
I suppose. What didn't you like about the movie?
Mostly all the live action stuff involving Will Ferrall and his kid. Not his kid, but you know, his movie son.
But that's the best part of the movie!
No, no, no, it's all cheesy and kind of takes you out of it.
But it's really meta! It shows how ultimately Legos are just toys to encourage kids to grow and have fun.
Yeah, I get it. It's still stupid.
You've gotta be the only one that feels that way.
Well, I just feel like the movie is trying to be deeper than it is. It doesn't help that everyone hyped it up and it didn't live up to expectations.
Oh. I felt the same way about Avatar.
Maybe I would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't heard all the praise for the movie. The Peanuts Movie was sort of similar.
You didn't like it?
It was better than The Lego Movie. If nothing else, it was beautiful; really stunning how they captured the look of the cartoon.
I'll agree to that. It's a great looking movie, especially on Blu-ray!
