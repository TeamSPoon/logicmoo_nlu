What music genre have you been into lately?
I've been into two, first Pop.
Okay.
It's just always on the radio, you know?
Definetely, and your other one?
I've really been getting into rap.
Really? I didn't know you like rap.
Yeah, I think a lot of people make good beats.
I gotcha.
They also make really good verses, like rhyming.
Well whose your favorite rap artist right now?
Hmm, well I really like Drake.
Yeah, Drake is pretty good, hasnt released anything in a while though.
Nah, he's on No Frauds with Nicki Minaj.
Yeah, but I'm talking about personally, and solo.
Hotbling Bling isn't even a year old yet.
Oh, really? It feels longer than that.
Yeah, it's only been a year, but it was insansely popular for a while.
Well, that explains it then.
He is a good artist besides that, though.
