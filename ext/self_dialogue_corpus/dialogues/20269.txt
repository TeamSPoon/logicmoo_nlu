Are you planning on seeing the new Stephen King movie?
It?
Yeah, I think that's the name.
I really want to.
It looks pretty good, right?
Yeah, it looks better than the original.
Do you think it will be scarier?
Oh, yeah.  The clown looks a lot worse.
Did you ever read the book?
Yeah, a couple times.
Did you like it?
Yeah, it was pretty horrifying.
Did the first movie follow the movie pretty well?
I think it was okay, but this one will probably touch on some things that the first one didn't.
Oh, was there a lot that the first one left out?
Yeah, there was a good bit.
The movie was in two parts, I didn't figure they would miss much.
Well, the book was like 1100 pages.
Wow.  How long did it take you to read that?
I don't remember.  Maybe a couple weeks.
