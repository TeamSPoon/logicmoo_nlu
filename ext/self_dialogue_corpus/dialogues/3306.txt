Have you seen Dracula?
The 1990's version?  Yes, one of the best movies ever made.
The score to it was amazing and creepy.
Plus the way Dracula seemed to unbeatable.
I remember just being in shock when he fed that baby to his wives.
And how he controlled wolves to seduce Mina.
Gary Oldman was fantastic as well.
Don't forget Anthony Hopkins.
Yes, as Vanhelsing.  He was awesome.
He always is though.
