There are a few other's in the movie too, but they're really just supporting roles.  Except for Walton Goggins.
Who was he in the movie? Did i see him in any of the trailers?
He plays a dubious sheriff. They all actually play some sort of archetype or role. Jackson is "the Bounty Hunter", Russel is "the Hangman, and Leigh is "the Prisoner."
Okay, that is four of them. Who are the other four?
There is an old man who is a general, he is "the Confederate"; then there is an English man who is "the Little Man."
So they all have nicknames? How long is this movie that they all came up with nicknames for each other?
No, they didn't give each other nicknames. These are just the names you see if you look at the billing or different movie posters.
Okay, I get it, so who were the last two?
There was also "the Mexican" and "the Cowpuncher."
That first one doesn't sound racist at all.
I guess. Maybe it is today, but it's a time period piece, so there are going to be a lot of offensive things in the movie. You just need to put it into context.
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I can guess why the "Mexican" is called that. the "Cowpuncher" sounds stupid though.
Well, you have to see the movie for it to make sense. The cowpuncher is this rancher who has been herding cattle all of his life running them from one place to another selling them. It's a really common story in old westerns.
Did people used to really do that?
Someone had to move the beef, and moving thousands of them by train would have been impossible.
Okay, and somehow all of these people come together and hate each other?
Not exactly. Kurt Russel is quickly established as a very paranoid person. He questions everyone and always sees conspiracies around himself.
So he spurs the anger?
Exactly, he feels there is something off with someone's story in the group that he ends up in, so he starts to create dividing lines between everyone.
So wouldn't that mean it was all Russel's fault?
