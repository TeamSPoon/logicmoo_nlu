Did you see that contract that Derek Carr signed?
Yeah, but it wasn't all that surprising.
How is a record-setting contract not surprising?
Everyone knew that he'd get an elite contract as one of the top young QBs.
Do you think he's really proved enough, though?
Yeah, I mean, the injury was a total fluke, since he's been pretty healthy to this point.
But still, $25 million per year?
Salaries keep creeping up with the cap, plus it's not all guaranteed.
But do you really think he's better than Andrew Luck?
I'm surprised to say this, but yeah, he's been more consistent than Luck.
Luck has definitely put up gaudier stats.
Yardage-wise, definitely, but he hasn't been as efficient lately. Luck's had more picks and not more TDs.
I think it helps Carr in the red zone, though, having Amari Cooper instead of TY Hilton.
Maybe, but Cooper's young, and you'd think Luck would have more TD throws with that running game.
I don't think Frank Gore is that bad.
Come on, he used to be good, but he's running on fumes now.
Marshawn Lynch isn't a spring chicken, himself.
Yeah, that'll be interesting, but he's not being paid a ton, anyway.
So do you think the Raiders are legitimate contenders?
Yeah, but even I'm surprised how well that rebuild went, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
