What's up Phil, what are you listening to?
Hey man, just blasting some progressive metal, it isn't for everybody.
I actually like that type of music, which band?
That's awesome, I'm actually listening to A Perfect Circle.
Oh wow, that is one of my favorite bands!
Really, what's your favorite track?
I obviously love The Outside, but Blue is so reflective and incredible.
I completely agree dude, I love Maynard!
Maynard is a metal legend, his voice is so distinct and melodic.
Do you like his other projects as well?
Yeah I actually started with Tool, and moved on to his other bands.
That is sweet, you know your stuff.
Thanks man, I also love Puscifer.
I want to see them live when they come to Los Angeles next!
Hit me up because I'd love to go with you!
That would be an adventure, I hope they play the hits though!
Humbling River, Momma Sed, all classics.
I completely agree, such a unique band.
I want to see Tool once in my life also!
Hopefully their album comes out before we go too haha!
