Some professional football players have had some really strange names.
Like Ben Gay?
Yes, the former running back for the Cleveland Browns.
I think one of the weirdest was Fair Hooker.
Seriously, someone named their kid that?
They did. He drafted by the Cleveland Browns.
Have you heard of Captain Munnerlyn?
No I haven't.
He played for the Panthers and Vikings.
I wonder why he was named Captain.
He was given the name by his grandmother who named him after her great grandfather.
OK. That's actually kind of sweet.
Here's another one for you. C .J. Ah You.
How did someone even come up with a last name like that.
Well, he's of Samoan heritage.
Maybe that's a normal name in that culture?
Maybe. Here's one more. Lawyer Milloy.
Think his parents had a career goal in mind for him when they named him?
Could be.
A lot of football players really have weird names.
