The Royals have been terrible this year.
Yeah, they can't win many games.
Vargas is pitching well though.
Yeah he is.  Too bad Herrera is struggling.
Trying to watch the Royals is like watching paint dry.
Their offense is horrible
They don't need to worry about making the postseason.
No they might have to start trading away assets.
I heard Herrera is a prime trading prospect.
Yeah they should be able to get some good, young talent for him.
Yeah, they'll probably trade him to the damn Yankees!
The Yankees already have the best bullpen in baseball.
Who do you think wins the AL Central?
I bet the Indians.
Cleveland is good, but I think Detroit has a chance too.
The Tigers are too old and they aren't nearly as good.
Do you think the Indians can make it back to the World Series?
I do. I think they'll beat the Cubs this time.
No way, the Cubs are too good.
We'll see.
