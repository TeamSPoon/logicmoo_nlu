What was your favorite movie growing up, as a kid?
I used to watch a lot of movies as a kid.
Me too! Was there one that really stood out, for you?
Yeah, it was 101 Dalmatians.
The old animated one?
Yep, I'm way too old to have watched the modern live action one with Glenn Close.
Ah, that makes sense.
As a child, I couldn't get enough of that movie.
What did you like so much about it?
Probably mostly just the cute dogs! But also, I think I liked Cruella DeVille as a villain.
The cute dogs I get. Why did you like Cruella?
I think as a kid, she was just the perfect level of scariness. Not too scary, but scary enough.
Yeah, I could see how as a kid, you don't want something too terrifying, but you like to be frightened just a little bit.
Yeah, that's what it was like.
I used to watch Care Bears movies a lot as a child.
I think I watched the show a little bit, but never all that much.
There was a movie where the Care Bears went to the world of Alice in Wonderland. That was my favorite.
That sounds pretty out there!
Yeah, I bet it seemed super weird to my parents, but I loved it.
And of course, you'd never read Alice in Wonderland, so all that stuff was pretty fresh for you.
