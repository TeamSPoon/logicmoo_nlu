So what are your thoughts about LA this year?
Oh man. I don't know
I know people are in love with Goff but I think its too soon
I totally agree
He is good but so raw
Did you see him last year play? Ugh.
I never understood the learn on the job idea.
Exactly. Whether it be football or day to day live, it rarely goes well.
In football it will get you killed and injured
Valid point
I guess LA is under such pressure to win now
At least the defense is good though.
For sure! They are lights out when they are on.
I just worry about the lack of depth
Well they are a young team. Maybe in the future it will be better?
I would hope so
For the fans sake
Ugh, no kidding. There were some real stinkers last year
Its never good when the coach gets fired either
True enough
