Have you ever heard of the rapper Vince Staples?
No, I don't think so, who is that?
He's good. He's based out of California.
So West Coast Rap? Where exactly?
Long Beach, Cali. He's got a few songs about it.
That's cool, what kind of rap?
Definitely West Coast, hard rap. He is real powerful
I'm surprised that I've never heard of him.
Well, he's pretty young. I want to say he's only 23.
That's impressive, for sure.
Absolutely, his album Summertime '06 came out back in 2016.
I'll have to check it out. Any songs in particular.
Yeah, check out "Blue Suede" and "Norf Norf".
I'll check him out. Who does he compare too?
Good question, he reminds me of Earl Sweatshirt and Schoolboy Q a bit.
Makes sense, West Coast style.
Yeah, and very introspective. He's on Def Jam too.
The record label?
Yeah with both of those guys.
Thanks for the recommendation, I'll download his album tonight.
