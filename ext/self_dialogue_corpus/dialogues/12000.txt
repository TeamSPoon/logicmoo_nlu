Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I would have to say Han Solo.
I've always liked Princess Leia because of her dry humor.
She's a good one. I think there was a lot of Carrie Fisher in the character.
I also like how she's the classic damsel in distress in Epsiode IV, but immediately takes charge upon being rescued.
She's an early progressive example of a strong female character in film.
How did you feel about CG Leia in Rogue One?
It didn't bother me since it was only one shot. Tarkin was a lot more awkward.
I can't help but think there coule have been some way around having no Peter Cushing that wouldn't have looked so dumb.
They should have taken notes from Young Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America: Civil War.
