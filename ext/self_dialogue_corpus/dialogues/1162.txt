Who is the best team in football?
The Patriots
I agree
That comeback was historic
I did not think they would come back
It was the best comeback of all time
I wonder why the Falcons just did not run it on their 3rd down.
That was a costly mistake
Hopefully they do good next year
Yeah. They still have a good team
I hope the Texans have another good year too
Yeah, they deserve it
What did you think of the draft?
I was happy with it.
I hope the Browns draft pick does good
They need someone to step up.
Yes they do
Where are the Browns from?
Cleveland
Oh yeah.
