We watched Disney's Mary Poppins last night.  Ever see it?
Yeah but way back in the day!
Sounds like you liked it too?
Definitely, especially the music. "A Spoonful of Sugar" is my favorite.
Yeah, cute.  I like "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."
That's a mouthful.  I guess the cartoon animation was new at the time.
I don't remember other movies with that.
I wanted to be Mary Poppins for a while.
Ha ha! I see what you mean though.
She was practically perfect.
