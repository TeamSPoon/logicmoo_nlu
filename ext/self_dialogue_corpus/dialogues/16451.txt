What do you think of Ed Sheeran as an artist?
I have no idea who that is, can you tell me?
Sure! He is a Caucasian guy with red hair and sings different popular songs like "Shape of You."
Oh I think I have heard of him actually!
Isn't he great? I love his lyrics.
Yes I remember that song from the radio now. It's a favorite of mine.
What's funny is I feel like his face doesn't match his voice.
I can see what you mean but I really do love his music.
I do too, I downloaded some of his songs to my phone last night.
I think I may do the same, I could use more music on my phone when I travel.
What other music are you into?
I really like Twenty One Pilots.
Oh I do too!
Actually one of my favorite songs by them was on the movie Suicide Squad.
Oh really, which song is that?
Their song "Heathens."
Oh I know that one! I like it a lot.
Me too and I love the movie as well.
I do too, it's a favorite of my hubby's.
Yes I can't wait to watch it again and listen to the song "Heathens."
