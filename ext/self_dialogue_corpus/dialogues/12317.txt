I love The Force Awakens, but it left me with so many questions?
Like who are Rey's parents?
Yeah.  But I think she's Han and Leia's daughter.
Me too.  What other questions do you have?
The biggest one is "who is Supreme Leader Snoke"?
Right!  I wonder who he is too.
Some fans think he is someone we already met in one of the other films.
Really?  Like who?
Well, maybe a Jedi gone bad.
Well, Leia did act like she knew who he was, so that theory makes sense.
