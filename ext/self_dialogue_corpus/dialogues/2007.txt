What do you think of the Chicago Bears' chances this year?
ESPN predicted that they would go 6-10, but I think that is too optimistic.
Why do you think that they will win less than 6 games this year?
My number one concern is at quarterback. I think that the Bears overpaid for Mike Glennon.
I think you're right. And then after they spend all that money on Glennon, the Bears turn around and draft a quarterback in the first round!
God, what a terrible decision that was.
But if Trubisky turns out to be a franchise quarterback, then the trade will look great.
That's an awfully big "if".
I don't think that you're giving the Bears enough credit after this last draft.
Well, they did not get a good draft grade on any website that I saw.
And don't forget about all the injuries that the Bears had on defense last year.
True. That defense was decimated by injuries all year.
I think that Vic Fangio is one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL, and that the defense will be great once it's healthy again.
So then you're putting all of your faith in the Bears' Defense?
Yes. And I'm not disagreeing with you that the Bears have a QB problem.
I really hope you're right.
Me too. It really ruins my Sundays when tbe Bears are terrible.
Me too. I'm just getting my sons to watch football with me, and they'll lose interest if tbe Bears are awful this year.
They won't be great, but I also don't think that they'll be as awful as you fear.
I love your optimism!
