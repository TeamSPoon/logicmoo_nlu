When did you first start watching football?
All my life.
Which team did your parents root for?
They were Washington fans when I was young
Who are they fans of now?
They switched to the Panthers when we moved
Did they get in on the ground floor?
Yep. Fans since 1995.
I always rooted for the Saints
Were you around for Archie Manning?
I was. I remember the paper bags.
I can't believe two of his sons now quarterback in the NFL
It's amazing right?
I like Eli better I have to say
He's not as good of a quarterback.
No. But he seems like a better person
I'll give you that.
I don't like Bellichick either
Yeah he's dodgy as a coach
That's why the Patriots always win.
