So did you know the first Disney movie came out 80 years ago?
No.  Which one was it?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Don't you mean dwarves?
No.  It is dwarfs.
Dwarfs?
Yes.  The term dwarves was actually coined by Tolkien, you know The Hobbit etc., about 80 years ago as well.  He said it gave his dwarves a dignity that regular dwarfs could hardly attain.
So Sneezy and Dopey were not dignified?
I guess not.  But they have sure been glorified.  Have you seen the outside of the Disney building?  The dwarfs are featured sculptures.
Well, I guess there is dignity in that.  I think it might be time for me to watch that movie again.  I cannot believe it has been eighty years since it was created.
