Have you seen the last Terminator movie?
Yes, I have. I've got mixed feelings about it.
Oh? Why?
Well, I guess I'm just too much of a fan of the first two movies. The girl didn't work for me as the newest terminator robot.
I don't know, I kind of liked her.
I suppose it's just me. She was all right, but I would prefer to see a guy.
I guess it was too hard for them to come up with yet another guy robot who would be cool. Instead of "same old, same old," you know.
I see what you are saying. They had to think of something new, so they introduced a girl terminator.
Yep. So, what else did you find disappointing?
John Connor. Yet another actor to play John Connor??
You know, I thought of that, too. Why not cast the same kid who played John in Terminator 2?
Exactly. He'd be the right age by now.
Yes. Unless they had offered him the part and he declined, they should have hired him.
Other than that... It was a decent movie, I suppose. Arnold was good.
Yes, I enjoyed seeing him as the robot again. He's getting old though.
Yes. Probably the last time he's doing it.
Well, if they want to keep it realistic, as least to some extent, the terminator shouldn't age, right?
Of course. Even now, if you compare him in the first movie and in the last, there's a big difference.
Very noticeable, yes. I suppose most fans will be forgiving of that though.
I know I am.
