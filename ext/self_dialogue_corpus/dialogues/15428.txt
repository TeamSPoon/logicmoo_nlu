Have you heard of Ayreon?
No. What kind of music do they play?
Mostly progressive rock and progressive metal. They just released a new album that I really enjoyed.
What was the name of the album?
The album is called The Source. It follows a science fiction story in which the singers act out various characters.
That sounds really interesting. Maybe I should listen to a few songs.
I can recommend the song called The Source Will Flow. The video is pretty special too.
What's so special about the video?
They actually had a competition where they selected a fan made video to be used as an official one.
That's really cool. How long have you been a fan of Ayreon?
I've been a fan for years. I actually own most of their albums and some are even signed by Arjen Anthony Luccasen.
Who is Arjen?
He's a singer, musician and a record producer who is the creator of Ayreon. He puts it all together.
Oh, so he isn't a singer in the band?
No, he is the one who selects the singers and pretty much designs albums in their entirety. They are more of a project than a steady band.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
No. Actually they usually don't hold concerts due to difficulties of having all the performers in one spot, but they will have a concert in Netherlands this autumn.
Did you get the tickets?
Unfortunately they were all sold out very quickly so I didn't get the chance to buy one.
That's a shame. Hopefully you'll get another chance in the future.
