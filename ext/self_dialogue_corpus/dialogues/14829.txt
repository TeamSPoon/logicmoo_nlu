What is the greatest comedy movie of all time?
I don't think there is one.
Why don't you think there is one?
Comedy is so subjective.
Well, I think Half-Baked is the greatest comedy movie of all time.
Even Dave Chappelle doesn't think that movie is as funny as it could have been.
It has everything.
Just because it has marijuana humor.
That's the best kind of humor.
I think that is very subjective.
