Yo you see that Columbus Cottonmouths game?
Dude isn't that like a kiddie team?
No! it's like it's own semipro team
Oh ok, nah when they play?
Last week! Dude it was epic!
What happened?
Ok so it was like the last 5 minutes of the game right?
Yeahh....
And the goalie decided to take off his mask and grab the puck
oookkk
He ran over to the other goalie and just got in a fight
No freakin way
Yeah man, and mid fight, he stopped and just stood there
The heck? What he do then?
He threw the puck in the other goal and won the game!
No freakin way, really?
Yup! And everyone stormed the rink!
DUDE that's epic
Yeah everyone slipped on the ice and about 20 people had to go to the hospital for concussions
Bruh. People are stupid.
