What Philadelphia Eagle's coach do you like the most?
Well, we had the most success with Andy Reid so I am going to say Reid.
Something about Reid always infuriated me.
But compared to Chip Kelly he was the best.
Don't get me started about Chip.
Just about all the fans dislike Chip by now.
I think he was the worst coach in Philadelphia Eagle's history.
It started out promising, but the guy was just too stubborn in his methods.
I agree he went out and got DeMarco Murray then insisted on sweeping him out.
Every down he just never learned how to use his players.
His blind faith in his system is what killed him.
I am nostalgic for the Buddy Ryan years.
At the time he could be infuriating but it was always interesting.
He had to be the most colorful coach.
He put together some great players.
He was kind of stubborn as well though.
And had a temper.
But the players loved him.
The players would do anything for him.
He knew defense and kind of coached lopsided though.
