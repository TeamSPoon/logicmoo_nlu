Do you like classic movies?
Yes I do, I appreciate them. My favorite is A Streetcar named Desire.
With Marlon Brando right?
That's right. That was before he did The Godfather.
Oh he was excellent in both. And so handsome in Streetcar.
Yes he was Stellllllaaaaa! That was his famous line from that movie.
That's been repeated so many times in movie history since then.
I like Whatever happened to Baby Jane.
With Bette Davis and Joan Crawford right? That movie was incredible.
It was. Bette Davis was totally insane, literally.
Oh yeah that makes me think of Mommy Dearest.
That was based on Joan Crawford's life right.
Yes. You wouldn't have ever thought she was so mean and cruel.
Apparently she was good at hiding it. No wire hangerssss!
If you know no other line, you  know that one! That's the famous quote of that movie.
Faye Dunaway did an outstanding job as Crawford.
I wonder if she won an award for that.
I hope she did. She definitely deserved it.
Another old favorite of mine is Psycho. That's an all time classic.
Oh and the twist in that movie I think is what started the whole plot twist craze.
