You know who my favorite character is in Star Wars?
I don't know, Luke?
No, Vader is my favorite.
Why is that?
Well he's kind of like a cyborg for starters and his voice sounds scary and intimidating.
That's a good point I never liked him though.
He's also not scared to use his powers for what he believes in.
Do you like villain characters more than the good guys?
Not really but Vader does end up having a very good ending to his story in my opinion.
I agree that moment when he took his mask off and the following minute or two were epic.
