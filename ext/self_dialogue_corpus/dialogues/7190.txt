Did you know Disney is making a live-action remake of Mulan?
Really? When will it be in theaters?
It's not being released until November 2, 2018.
That's a while off. Has a cast list been released yet?
No not yet. The film is still in pre-production.
I can't wait! Mulan, is one of my favorite movies.
Same, I love the story and music. Though it's not clear yet if they'll be adapting the songs as well.
I hope they include the songs. I'd love to see a live-action version of "I'll Make A Man Out of You".
Me too. Disney also needs to keep Mushu, the dragon, in.
He'd probably be computer-generated. It'd be cool if Eddie Murphy could voice Mushu again.
