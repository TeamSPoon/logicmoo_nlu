Have you heard of the Flight of the Conchords?
Yeah, they're musicians?
And comics too.  They're music is great.
Is it all funny?
No, some of it is a touch sad too.
They do a pretty good rap as well.
That Hippopotamus song you mean?
That's the one. You should hear it.
I heard they have a good album.
Its completely awesome.
