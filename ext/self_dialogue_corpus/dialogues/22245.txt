Mel Gibson seems to be making a comeback lately.
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.
Yeah, he has Hacksaw Ridge for one thing. That was pretty big.
Oh yeah, I didn't realize that was his. I thought that was a Clint Eastwood flick.
No, no, it was all Gibson. He actually has been doing movies here and there for some time now.
Oh really, what else did he direct recently?
Well, actually, I meant starring. He did a movie called Blood Father the same year as Hacksaw Ridge.
Ah, I haven't heard of it. Was it a small movie?
Kind of, it only had a budget of a few million. Like 10 or 15 million or something like that.
Well, that explains why I've never heard of it then.
Even before that he played the villain in Machete 2.
You mean Machete Kills.
You know what I meant, but he was the villain there. Sort of like how Tom Cruise did Tropic Thunder.
Man, everyone loves Tom Cruise again. Still, I doubt that'll happen to Mel.
Even so, he's doing better than he was. He had that weird Beaver movie, a while back, and things since then.
Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right. Wasn't he in The Expendables?
He was in the third one. Another villain role.
I guess he just has to stick to antagonist roles from now on.
Or just keep making movies like Hacksaw Ridge.
That would probably be best. I think people like him more behind the camera than in front of it.
