Who's your favorite member of Migos?
I like Takeoff the most.
Wow really? He never gets the props he deserves.
I know, right? He's the best rapper out of the bunch.
I agree, Quavo is the melodic one with a great voice. Takeoff has the best technique, Offset is in the middle of the two other members.
What's your favorite Offset verse?
I loved his verse on "Dat Way". What's yours?
I always liked his verse on "Hanna Montana".
Nice, I forgot about that record, I need to go back and listen to their older albums.
For sure!
