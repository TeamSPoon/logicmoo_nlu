Hey do you remember Paula Abdul's music?
Who is she, isn't she some judge on American Idol or something?
Something like that, but back in the nineties she was a pop singer!
Oh really?  I didn't even know that!
Yeah!  She had some great songs like Opposites Attract and Straight Up.
I don't think I ever even heard of her back then.
Wow, she was pretty popular.  I bet you heard them you just didn't know it was her.
Hmmm, maybe so.  Why did she quit making music?
I think she just fizzled out or maybe got too old.
Was she like a one hit wonder?
No, there was more than one hit.  She had a bunch.
A bunch of hits or a bunch of albums?
I think there were at least several albums but she had a bunch of hits.
I loved Janet Jackson back then.
Yeah, so did I.  But they really had the same style of music.
All that dance pop music of the nineties was great.
I know!  I'm surprised you never heard of her.
Well I have now.  I can go google her and listen to some of her old stuff.
That's funny, I'm sure you'll find some of it.
I'm sure I will!
