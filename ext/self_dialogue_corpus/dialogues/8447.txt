Have you heard of Noah cyrus?
Miley Cryrus's sister?
Yep. I really am enjoying her music.
I do think I like some songs, but prefer Miley overall.
Have you heard Noah's Stay Together?
Yes I like the carefree attitude in it.
I think the beat is so good.
It really reminds me of miley's , We can't stop.
I suppose both have a carefree party message. But noah's is softer.
Ya it is a bit more romantic in the chorus lyrics.
