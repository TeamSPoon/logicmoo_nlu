Ok so... those are the scales Debussy used, Why are we talking about Debussy anyway?
Um... you asked about"modern music and who was the best, and I gave you my favorite.
Oh yeah.. I remember... ok continue
Sigh. Ok. So What set Debussy apart from his contemporaries, his scales, the use of bitonality....
Oh yeah explain that. you said bitonality isn't atonal.
yes, and no, bitonal is not atonal. What would you say if you have to guess what bitonality is?
A tonality that is confused sexually?
That is just so mature. Whatelse?
I don't know. Really I have no idea. I guess two tonalities. but what does that even mean?
Well, that's somwhat correct. Tonality refers to the centeredness ina musical piece.
I have no idea what that even means.
Yes you do. If you return to the center you feel the finality of the song. Like it's the end of the song.
Oh... ok.
That happens because you have returned to the tonal center in a tonal piece. Or the tonic note or the chord of the piece which is in a tonic key.
hm... ok.
Now in a bitonal piece, there are two tonal centers. How do yo think this is possible?
I have no idea. Use two tonic notes at the same time?
That's basically what it is. Bitonal pieces have two keys with two different tonic center at the same time, and aim to harmonize or contrast using the devices.
Um... confusing.
Like stravinsky's Petrushka uses C and F# major at the same time.
