So, with The Last Jedi coming out this Christmas, do you think Luke's gonna die?
No way, man, Luke's too important for the series.
I don't know, all the actors are getting pretty old now.
Yeah, but Luke's the only one left now, since Han's dead and Leia's actress died.
I guess that's true, but they didn't know that and they might have already killed him off before that.
I think it'd be too repetitive to kill Luke off right after Han died. Besides, someone has to teach Rey!
That's true, but they could always use force ghosts.
That's true. Do you think Obiwan will show up any?
I sure hope so, he's my favourite character from the prequels.
Well, he was in the originals too, but I get what you mean.
