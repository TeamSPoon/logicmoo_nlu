Have you heard of Lady Antebellum?
Sure. Country music right?
Right. Did you realize they won Record of the Year in 2011?
Was that for Need You Now.
That's the one.
I had no idea. Who were the up against?
Jay-Z, Bruno Mars, Cee-Lo Green among others.
Wow, I'm surprised they took home the prize that year.
Yeah, I would've picked someone else like Bruno Mars
How about Cee-Lo
Nah, he was way overrated.
Yeah, he had that one song, Forget You
Well, that was the radio version. The real version contained a naughty word.
Oh, I never heard that version.
Not many did.
Whatever happened to Cee-Lo?
Well I know he was on that show The Voice for awhile
Oh yeah I remember that.
But I haven't seen him much later.
Fast rise and fall then.
