Dude, what happened to the Panthers last year?
I don't know, but man, they were bad.
They were so feared in 2015.
Yeah, they looked like Super Bowl champs for sure.
Well, Denver ended that train of thought.
Yeah, that was a total blowout.  Not what I expected.
Cam Newton is a bit overrated.
He had a down year for sure, but he was the MVP.
Was is the key word.  Not anymore and not even the best QB in the division.
They don't use him very well.
They should have him running the ball ten times a game.  You can't stop him.
He's a load to bring down.  I think they are worried about injury though.
I get that, but play to your strengths.
But you can't utilize your strengths with a broken leg.
Speaking of which, didn't that happen to their linebacker?
You mean Luke Kuechly?
Yeah, that's who I'm thinking of.
I thought he got knocked because of concussions.
I thought he had both or something.
It was a tough year for him.  When healthy, he's a top 5 defensive player for sure.
