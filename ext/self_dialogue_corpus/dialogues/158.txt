How did Kryptonite became a thing anyway?
What do you mean?
I mean Krypton blew up. right? So how did they find the rock that's only supposed to exist on Krypton?
it was first mentioned in 1943 radio show so that the actor playing the Superman can take a vacation.
What? That's so stupid. That's how it all begin?
Well, The Superman creator actually had written about a rock that drains his power, but it was only used in order for the actor to get some vacation time
So what did they do instead?
They had a stand in actor groan once in a while as they explained that Superman was trapped in Kryptonite cage. That was in 1943.
This is the dumbest origin story there is. That still doesn't explain where it came from.
Only because the planet blew up doesn't mean the rocks disappeared. And yep, the entire Kryptonite thing began because dude wanted to take a vacation.
