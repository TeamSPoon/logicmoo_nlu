Aln Rickman is an amazing actor.
I love him he was the perfect casting choice to be Snape.
What's you favorite Snape scene.
I like it when in the Prisoner of Azkaban he gives hints that Lupin is a werewolf.
My favorite scene is when Hermione lights his robe on fire.
I still can't believe he ended up being one of the good guys.
Yeah even after all this time he still regretted Lily's death.
He sacrificed himself just so Harry could lived
I like how he hoodwinked on the greatest wizards ever.
That final scene with Dumbledore is just so touching.
