Have you seen The Accountant?  It has Ben Affleck in it.....
Yes!! I really thought that was a good film.  What others have you seen recently?
Oh, let's see....I saw Passengers over the weekend.  Watched "The Founder" a couple of weeks ago...
Ok, OK, I've seen Passengers, and I liked that.  What was "The Founder" about?  I don't think I've seen that.
The Founder is about Ray Kroc - the guy who really got McDonald's rolling!
Ray Kroc....Oh, right!
