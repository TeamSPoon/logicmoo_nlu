Do you like 80's hair bands?
I like Bon Jovi, does that count.
Yes, I love Bon Jovi too.  Jon still looks just as young as he ever did.
What do you think about their new album Burning Bridges.
Well I wouldn't call it new, it was 2015.
True, but newest. I guess.  How do you like the new music compared to their 80's hits.
Actually I prefer their 90's albums the best.  Keep the Faith was my favorite.
That was a good one, I remember the videos were all over MTV at the time.
They've been together a long time.  Most bands don't last this long.
True, they've come a long way from the Slippery When Wet Album.
Jon Bon Jovi never seems to age.  He's still just as handsome as ever.
Richie Sambora on the other hand.
Poor Richie, he's had a lot of bad road under him.  Lots of wives and drama.  I guess it would take it's toll on anyone.
Well I guess he would probably respond to that in the words of another song of their's - It's My Life.
Maybe so.  That was a pretty good album too, Crush.  It made a come back in the 2000.
Yes, much to the delight of fans like myself.  Have you ever seen them live in concert.
No, but I always hesitate to , I'm afraid I'll be disappointed.
Oh believe me the band will not disappoint.  You would love to see them live.
When is their next concert?
They are coming to New York in August.
