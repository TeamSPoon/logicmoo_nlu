Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequel movies?
I love the original trilogy best. I grew up watching A New Hope and waiting for the others to come out.
The Empire Strikes Back was awesome, including the soundtrack. I can still hum The Imperial March!
Don't forget the wampa cave, Yoda training Luke, and the lightsaber battle on Bespin.
That movie had some of the best scenes!
So do you like the original trilogy best too?
Yes, but I also love the prequel trilogy. I know some scenes were cheesy, but the arena battle in Attack of the Clones was unbeatable.
That, and the duel with Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace.
That was such an iconic scene. It made everyone who watched the movie want a double-sided lightsaber.
And they wanted a podracer after the race at the beginning of episode one too!
