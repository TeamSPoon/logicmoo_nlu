My birthday was last week, and I was pleased to see that Wonder Woman is out and I got to see it that night on my birthday.
Oh! Great! What did you think of it?
I hoped that it would be amazing, but it definitely had pros and cons.
So, it wasn't everything that you hoped it would be?
No, it had some plot holes for one.
That's a movie that many people, especially females, have been hoping to see on the big screen for many years, so that is a shame.
Yes, it is! They finally did a superhero for females, so it should have been made as close to flawless as possible.
What were some of the flaws?
The most glaring thing is that about 75% of the way through it it seemed to drag on because not much was going on.
I hate when that happens. What was another flaw?
The first half of the movie seemed very believable, but at some point, they turned into a cliche love story.
Hm, that's annoying. What did you think of the actress who played Wonder Woman?
Oh, she was amazing! Now, she was totally believable, and she is beautiful, too.
What about her love interest?
He was okay. He was really handsome, but I didn't love his acting.
Was there anyone else who stood out?
Yes! The love interest in the movie had a secretary. She was great! She has a heavy accent and she was very funny.
That sounds great. Did the audience laugh out loud at all?
Yes! We did, many times. I thought the movie was worth seeing because of her and the actress who played Wonder Woman, though.
I will have to check it out. Thank you!
