Did you ever listen to Guns and Roses?
I used to listen in the 90s and a little bit after that.  Not any more.
Do you remember the first album?
Yes the first album was Appetite for Destruction.
It was kind of disgusting actually.
Yes at the time the lyrics were dark.
Now days people don't notice as much about stuff like that.
People do not seem to be into music as much as they used to be.
Welcome to the Jungle was a high energy song.
That is the most well known
I'm not sure Axl Rose has that good of a voice.
He screeches out the songs.
But it fits the kind of musical background of the songs.
It does any other type it wouldn't work.
Definitely not.
He tried to make a come back didn't he?
I think so Guns and Roses came out with Chinese Democracy in 2008.
That was a flop?
I never bothered with it.  Do not think it had much success.
All of their popular work occurred in the late 80s and 90s.
