I can't wait for the upcoming NFL season!
Why?  So many games are going to be played in London.  We won't get to see a lot.
It'll still be on TV and that just means better crowds when the games are played in the US.`
I hope the Jaguars finally do well - new coach, new players, great draft pick!
if not I bet they'll be the first US team to sign full time in London!
What about CA moving to Las Vegas and the new CA stadium?!
Yeah tons of new changes in the next few years.
The new female Ref should be good, too.
hopefully she makes the right calls and people don't focus on her being a woman rather than a ref
yeah she'll have to go through the same issues like the female reporters I guess.
who will be the breakout star?
Tom Brady as usual, maybe Eli Manning?
I think there's a lot of new blood this year a whole new game!
are you going to do fantasy football?
I will!  you?
I am going to sit this season out because I don't know enough about the new dudes.
yeah  I mean focus on NCAA, too
Yeah I do love the SEC, too but not as much as NFL.
Well the Jags have that large screen and pool area so I might go to the game just for that!
yeah lets get tickets regardless of who is playing
