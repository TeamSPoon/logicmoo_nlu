Do you have a favorite Disney movie song?
Yes, Under the Sea from the Little Mermaid. I can play it on the piano.
Great song, when did you learn it?
Quite recently, which might surprise you give that I'm thirty years old.
That is slightly surprising.
What's your favorite Disney movie song?
That's a tough one. I have two from the Lion King.
Hakuna Matata has to be one, right?
Yes, Hakuna Matata is one and the other is "I Just Can't Wait to Be King."
Wow, I forgot about that one. Great song.
