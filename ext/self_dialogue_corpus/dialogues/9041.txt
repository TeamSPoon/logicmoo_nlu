What do you think about the band Hole?
I like some of their music, like Celebrity Skin.
That song is really good.
But I like other female-lead bands better.
Oh yeah? Which ones?
Well, Garbage for one.
True. Shirley Manson is amazing.
As well as The Cardigans.
Everyone forgets that they made excellent alt rock music.
Yeah that makes me sad they get forgotten like that and only remembered for Lovefool.
