Have you heard DAMN. by Kendrick Lamar?
Yeah, and I loved it.
How do you think it compares to To Pimp A Butterfly?
Exponentially better.
How do you figure?
To Pimp A Butterfly had some powerful messages, but it couldn't stand alone as a musical piece.
DAMN. certainly has some catchier songs.
Exactly. It was more like Kendrick's earlier stuff, like Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.
Did you like that album?
Yeah, that's where all of his radio hits came from.
I think he does a good job of combining politicism and musicality for this album.
I agree.
Did you hear there were rumors there was supposed to be two album releases?
He ended up canceling the second album?
No, I think it was people misunderstanding him say that DAMN. itself could be two separate albums.
I can see that.
Do you like the song "Loyalty"?
It's catchy but it's kind of cheesy.
Definitely cheesy, but I love Rihanna's voice.
Yeah, Rihanna has a good voice in general.
