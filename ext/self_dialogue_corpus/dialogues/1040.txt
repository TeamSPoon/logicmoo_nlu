So what about the Seahawks this year? Think they can get back the glory?
I think it all depends on how well Wilson plays.
That depends on if he has an offensive line this year.
Last year was brutal up front, but they did bring in some new guys.
I sure hope they can help. Maybe Jones can come out of retirement!
Why not? Marshawn Lynch went to the Raiders.
They're going to be really disappointed down in Las Vegas when he fumbles away half his touchdown chances.
The Raiders are still in Oakland for a couple of years. Lynch will retire again before they move.
He will be released well before then.
No,  he will be a beast down there with all those wild fans.
Who backs up Wilson this year?
You mean besides Ciara? I bet the Seahawks sign Colin Kaepernick.
That would be mistake in my opinion. His choking against Seattle was a good part of the Seahawks success in the Super Bowl years.
He may throw a lot of silly interceptions, but the guy can sure run.
Their backup from last year, Boykin,  can run also and would be a lot cheaper option.
Better to bring in a veteran. Too bad Robert Griffin III appears to be out of the picture.
Hopefully it is a moot point because Wilson is supposed to be in better shape this year.
He also has a big running back now to absorb some of this hits in the backfield.
Big is the key word. If Lacy balloons up to 260 pounds like last year when he was with Green Bay then nobody will be able to find Russell in his shadow.
His weight should not be a problem. The man is skinny now that his contract requires him to be or else no bonus money.
