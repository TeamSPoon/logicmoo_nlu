I am interested in getting into baseball.
That is good baseball is a great sport and past time.
Where should i start i am confused.
To start just read up the rules online but here is a quick rundown.
Ok lay it on me.
Points are scored by homerunning the ball and running around the bases.
Seems simple enough to me then.
That is not all their is a little more to it.
What more is their to it?
If someone in the outfield catches the ball then the runner must stop is the next thing.
Is their anything more to the game.
When the batter is batting he has three chances if he misses that means he is out.
That seems rather forgiving to get three chances.
It is  but the game is fun for that to be able to try.
What stations can i watch games on?
They play lots of games on the local channels and you can watch some online.
That sounds great what site do you use to keep track of the players though?
Just check out ESPN they got the source for everything.
Wow thanks their is alot here it is almost overwhelming
One day that will be simple just read up on things and watch the games you will make heads of it in no time.
