i am loving Dying Fetus new album it slams so hard
I loved their first few albums but their later work is not as good to me.
What do you mean their new stuff is amazing.
I just cannot get into it
Why can you not get into it?
I do not know something about it does not gel that well with me honestly
You should give their new album another try or at leas the singles
The singles are usually the best songs though
Sometimes but if you like them you might like the rest
Where can  i listen to these singles
Their record label released a few videos for them awhile back
Where did they release the videos to?
They released them on youtube where else!
I do not watch to much youtube how would i know!
Well just go check it out on their it is pretty simple
Well i might then if it is free
Yeah it is free does not use the RED subscription of youtube.
Good i do not like that idea part of why i do not use it often.
Well tell me what you think when you get back from listening to it
Will do my friend.
