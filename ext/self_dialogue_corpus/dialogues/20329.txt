What's one of your favorite movies?
Like favorite of all time?
Sure, or at least give me one you really like off the top of your head.
Hmm, I really like Pulp Fiction. That one is definitely up there.
I love that movie! It's so slick!
Yeah it's very stylish, that's for sure.
What do you think of the actors in there?
Oh wow, there's so many good ones it's hard to pick.
Well what did you think of Samuel L. Jackson?
I thought he was very cool, a little vulgar but his character was very interesting.
Yeah, I think so too. I like his buddy a lot.
The guy played by Travolta?
Yeah, him. He seems like he's just along for the ride and trying to survive.
He definitely has that kind of vibe.
I like all the crazy situations they get caught up in.
Me too, like having to take a crime boss's girlfriend out on a date.
That was a very strange ordeal, but the girl was a lot of fun to watch.
Yeah, she was a great actor.
She's in a lot of other Tarantino movies, right?
I know she's in Kill Bill.
