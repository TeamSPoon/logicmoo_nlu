Did you watch the movie and tv music awards?
Yes they were good
Who's outfit did you like?
Zendaya looked amazing.
She did I loved her hair and that green dress was so cute.
I liked how it was covering and went all the way down to her ankles, but was still sheer and hot
And the plunging neckline, loved it
I also love Allison Williams sequined dress
Oh yea, I really liked that one too, and it wasn't too revealing either.
I think Allison Williams was my favorite, that dress was so beautiful.
My favorite was Zendaya and her green dress.
Did you see the leather jacket and red joggers?
Yes that was not cute at all
No it shouldn't have been worn to an awards show.
Sometimes people express themselves too much when it comes to clothes
And there was the girl wearing that plain white dress and white cowboy boots.
That was too plain. There is a fine line between too much and not enough
Exactly. I hated that all white dress.
It was not worthy of an awards show either.
No it wasn't.
