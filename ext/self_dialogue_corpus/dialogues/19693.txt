I just heard "Shut up and Dance." I haven't heard that song in over a year.
That's a good song. I like "Walk the Moon."
Thanks. I couldn't remember the band's name.
Yeah. They're an Ohio band, from Cincinnati; I think. That song was all over the radio when it came out in 2014.
Do they have any other hits?
They're kind of a new band, not even 10 years old. "Anna Sun" was popular back in 2011, but not quite the hit of the song you mentioned.
I don't think that I've ever heard "Anna Sun."
Maybe you have, you just didn't know it was that song. "Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges my feet are still sore my back is on the fringes"
That sounds familiar. I just can't place it right now.
They're style is definitely unique. They say that their influences are "The Police," "Tears for Fears" and "Phil Collins" but they don't really sound like any of them.
I remember seeing them on that New Year's special last year.
Oh. That was the show that Dick Clark hosted. They performed "Shut up and Dance."
I had never seen the band before that.  It's a pretty big sound for such a small band -- 4 members.
There have actually been 9 members since they formed in 2008. But you're mostly right. At one point in 2008 to 2009 they only had 3.
What's the singer's name?
That would be Nicholas Petricca. He also formed the band.
I wanted to see them in concert, but something happened that year.
Last year they canceled their "Work This Body" when Petricca had to spend more time with an ill family member.
I describe them as a dance band, but they've got other sounds too..
They've been categorized as alternative rock and pop rock at the awards.
