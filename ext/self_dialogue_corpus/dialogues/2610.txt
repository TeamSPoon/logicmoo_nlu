Who do you think will win the AFC West this year?
I think it will be either the Broncos or Raiders.
The Raiders were good then they fell apart when they lost Derek Carr.
Yes, that really hurt them in the playoffs.
What happened with Denver last year?
They lost both of their QBs then had to start their third string from the Super Bowl year.
Peyton Manning retired and Brock Osweiler went to the Texans.
It was the defense that won it all a couple years ago.
True but you still need a quarterback.
It's been a wierd offseason for the AFC West.
The Chargers are moving to Los Angelos.
And the Raiders will be moving to Los Vegas.
Los Vegas Raiders?
That sounds wierd doesn't it?
I wish they would stop moving teams.
I hate it when teams move from their traditional city.
NFL doesn't respect the fans that make it in the end.
Especially if the team has been in a city for years and years.
I forgot about the Kansas City chiefs.
They are always competitive to win the division.
