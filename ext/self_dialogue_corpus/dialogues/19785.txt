What type of music do you prefer?
I'm definitely a rock fan.
Interesting, who is you favorite band?
I would have to say Pearl Jam.
Not a fan of anything recent?
Not really, I think rock has been a shame since the 90's ended.
Why do you say that?
Can you name one band that's Hall of Fame worthy since that time?
Now that you say that, no, not really.
Exactly, it's all been formulaic garbage since the 90's.
Why do you think that is?
I think rock has always been about rebellion, and Grunge was the last form of rebellion.
Yeah, but people always are rebelling, so why nothing new?
Because other forms of music took over the rebellion platform.
What do you mean by that?
Emo, punk, those sorts of genres became the anthems of the new generations.
And you don't consider those to be forms of rock?
Not really. I would say that they are actually borderline pop.
So is there any hope for rock's future?
I think a return to the sounds of the 70's and 80's could go over well at this time.
