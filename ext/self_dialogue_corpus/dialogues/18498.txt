What is your favorite kind of music?
I like 80's new wave music.
Oh really? What kind of bands?
Basically like Depeche Mode, The Cure, Duran Duran.. the list goes on.
What's your top favorite from that genre?
Probably Depeche Mode, I've listened to them my whole life.
That's cool! What's your favorite song from them?
I really like Get the Balance Right! from them, the synths are awesome in the song.
What's your favorite album from them?
Violator is amazing. It stood out from their other albums because it sounded less synth-electronic and more new wave/alternative.
Nice! Is The Cure good too?
Yes I would recommend them! They are the pinnacle for the goth community.
How so? Are they like goth?
Yeah, their music was dark for the time and kind of became the beginning of gothic rock.
Wow I didn't know that!
Just because they're labeled as that, doesn't mean their music is depressing or anything.
They have happy songs?
Some are upbeat but there are a lot of love songs that are really beautiful.
That's really nice that they have love songs and aren't just dark and sad.
They have a well known song called Lovesong, which was covered by 311. Check both of them out!
