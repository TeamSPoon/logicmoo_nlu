wanna go to a rock concert?
depends, who's playing?
two of my favorite bands! metric and imagine dragons. some girl named halsey is opening.
halsey? haven't heard of her. metric is pretty good, though.
not a fan of imagine dragons?
i could do without them. they remind me of twenty-one pilots. just some wannabe emo stuff.
yikes, okay. so i guess i won't invite you to the twenty-one pilots concert.
yeah, that's probably for the best.
what about metric, though?
metric i can do. do you think they'll play lost kitten?
