What did you think of Game 6 between the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards the other night?
That was a really tough loss for Boston. I was hoping they would keep their lead and pull it off in the end.
Me too, I can't believe they lost by 1 point.
It seemed like the Celtics were really struggling to make their shots in the first quarter.
I know, what was strange was that they made 4 out of 17 shot attempts but we're still only down by 5 points at the end of the first quarter.
Avery Bradley's alley-oop dunk right before halftime was awesome!
That was great to watch. I was so excited when the Celtics had the lead at halftime.
One of the reasons things didn't work out for them is because John Wall had a tremendous game.
True, his shooting was terrible in the first half but he still came back as aggressive as ever in the second half.
It was Wall's 7-0 shooting run that brought the Wizard's back and tied the game.
Wall wasn't able to make his  three point shots but he had his jump shot down and it showed.
He dominated under the basket as well.
As usual, Isaiah Thomas was integral in keeping the Celtics in the game.
His step back jumper to take the lead in the last quarter was poetry in motion.
I just don't know what happened. The Celtics were up by 2 with only a little over seven seconds left in the game and possession of the ball.
It seemed like they were either frazzled or sloppy and that's how they ended up turning the ball over to Wall.
My heart sunk when Wall put up that 3 pointer from way out there to take the lead.
Me too, I was hoping it didn't go in but he drained that shot right over Avery Bradley like it was easy.
That's when they took the lead. It was over from there.
True, but the desperate shot Isaiah Thomas put up at the buzzer didn't look horribly off.
