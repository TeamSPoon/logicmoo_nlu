I just turned on some really chill music and it feels good to be peaceful
What is it?
It's a 4k aquarium video with great ambient music.
Ambient music can be wonderful and then sometimes it's like crappy elevator music.
I like any kind of ambient music that can be playing in the background while you are talking and it doesn't distract you.
Moby's Ambient album with the ambient music is good.
I don't understand why a lot of people dislike him?
I really don't know either. He seems like a pretty cool guy
It's because he is unique and some people can't wrap their brains around that.
Would you go to a concert of his?
Yes I would if the opportunity arose.
His Music from Porcelain is very jammy starting out . I need to listen to some more of the album to see if i really like it
That one came out in 2016 didn't it?
yes it did. It's  a little like trance/house music to my ears.
That is a musice genre that is a little borderline to my liking.
Trance/house/EDM music?
Yes it can be too loud and repetitive for me after a while. It just gets boring.
I need to be intrigued for sure.
How much longer before you are going back to Ireland?
Next week. Maybe we can get together and you can hear some of the celtic pop music that  is popular
