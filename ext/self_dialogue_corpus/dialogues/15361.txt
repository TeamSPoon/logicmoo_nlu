Lady Gaga is one of my favorite musicians of all time
She is stunning I saw her in the Super Bowl one year, and she rocked the house!
Oh yes! That was an amazing performance by her.
Her voice is so clear,she really is one of the greats.
Her last two albums came out , they are Joanne and Artpop.
Wasn't there another one called Cheek to Cheek?
Yes I think a Tony Bennett tribute I think.
I have no idea how she finds the time to produce so much music, and also do tv work as well.
The woman is amazing.
Just Dance is one of my favorite songs of hers.
Yes that is a great one, and I like her song Poker Face too.
That was beautiful video of her on VH1, I remember that one.
She always makes it look so easy.  That is when you can tel someone has a gift.
Till It Happens to You is a great hit of hers too.
The Fame album is one of the best albums she ever produced.
I never got to buy that one.
If you want, there is a sale going on over at the music store.
You mean the music store at Crossroads?
Yes, that one.  You may be able to buy it now for a great price.
I will check it out.
