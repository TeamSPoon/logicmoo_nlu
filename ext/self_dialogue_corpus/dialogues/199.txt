I just rewatched spiderman 3 and now I want to throwup
Yea, it was pretty bad
I can't believe how much better the previous 2 were.
Most superhero sequels are bad
I liked the x-men movies though.
I do wish I could marry someone like Mary Jane
Yupp, she is awesome
Or just the ability to shoot webs out of my hands would be a great skill
Spiderman is a territic superhero.
I think he is my top 5
