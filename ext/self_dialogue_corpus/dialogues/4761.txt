The Cubs play the Cardinals Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Are you going to attend?
I wish I were.
I have some extra tickets.
I would love to go, but I can't afford the tickets.
I will sell them to you half price.
Oh, I wouldn't  feel right about allowing you to do that.
Hey, we are good friends.
Yes, but I just would not feel good about not paying full price.
I would love for you to go to the game with me.  I made some extra money this week and can afford to let you have them half price.
Oh, that's so nice of you.  I will talk to Ray and see what he says.
It would be fun if you go; Mary is going too.
I will let you know tomorrow evening.
Well, I sure hope you decide to go with me and Mary.
I know Ray would enjoy going to see the Cubs play.
Yes, he would - he's been a Cub for a long time.
He sure has - 65 years...
Well, I sure hope you will go.  We will have a good time.
I talked to Ray and he said that we will go with you and Mary.
Great! Just what I was hoping to hear!  We will pick you guys up around 8 in the morning Friday.
