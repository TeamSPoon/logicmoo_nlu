Did you catch Step Brothers on TV last night?
Yeah but I'm not a fan of it.
Oh that's not good to hear.
The jokes didn't really land for me, delivery seemed off.
Well to be fair it was on cable and a lot of censored.
Oh then why would you tell me to watch it there?
Was just a suggestion, it was on TV so why not?
I'll have to watch it on DVD then, because I didn't hate it, just not a fan.
The movie is very vulgar and a lot of jokes land because of it.
If the jokes are good though does it need the profanity?
I think you can argue that sometimes profanity makes the joke.
Can't anyone just make a profane joke then?
The joke still needs to be funny, there's a reason not everyone is a successful comedian.
True, I guess I'm just a little bummed I spent two hours watching this and didn't laugh.
Trust me watch the movie uncut and you'll get some payoff laughs.
Alright, do you have it?
Yeah I have the DVD, I will bring it the next time we see each other.
Sounds good, bring me some complimentary snacks in case I still don't like it.
Whoa wait what is this now?
It's my new thing for recommending me movies I don't enjoy.
