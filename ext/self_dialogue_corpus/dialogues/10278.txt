It is hard to choose a favorite action movie or actor.   Which ones do you like?
I liked John Wayne.  He was in hundreds of movies and always came across as the tough guy hero.  Right to the end with "The Shootist"
Yeah he sure did the hero role well.  He was even tempered all the time, just don't cross him.  Heck, a real man was like him for real, Ted williams the ball player.  But he made no movies.  The Duke stuck mostly with westerns and war movies.
He also did some dramatic roles like in the "Quiet Man"  where he was a boxer that retired to the Irish countryside.  That was one of his best roles.
Sure, "The Duke" was one of the greatest of all time and Clint Eastwood sure had a good run of it.
Who could forget his run with the "Dirty Harry" series where he was the tough cop rogue who always took out the worst criminals
Then he always got in trouble with his boss.  His line "Go ahead make my day" was a classic tough guy line used by many afterwards.
Then he had some comedy/action movies with "Every which way but loose".  Pretty funny with the primate co star.  Clyde they called him.
As he got older he leaned to dramatic roles and back to action in "Grand Torino" where he played a dying old man with little more to lose.
He hade the bad guys think he had a gun when he pulled out his lighter and they shot him dead.  A sad ending but he did it for a good cause, defending his unlikely young friend to protect the neighborhood.
