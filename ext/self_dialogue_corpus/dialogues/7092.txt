Yea I consider myself a fan of those movies.
Do you know when its coming out?
I heard it was coming out in December this year, im pretty exited about that.
Yeah I am exited about that too. I want to watch it bady.
I am curious about the Jedi fighting.
I think this is one of the things the other Star War movies are missing more light saver action.
Yeah I know and it will be cool to see Luke in action.
Hopefully it will be a great movie.
Yeah, I have high hopes for it.
