Me and a friend of mine was having a music debate the other day.
Really? What was the debate about exactly?
We were going back and forth about who the best female group of all time was.
That is a tough one, there have been so many great ones over the years.
I know! Sometimes these discussions just need to happen though!
That is true, so who were your guys' picks for the best?
He was adamant that it is Destiny's Child. While I think it is TLC without question.
Those are both really great groups.. I would have a hard time picking between the two.
They are both great, but TLC has so many hits. Look at songs like No Scrubs, Waterfalls, and Unpretty. Those are classics!
They do have some songs that people are still singing to this day.
So, you agree with me about this whole thing?
I did not say that! Destiny's Child has some classics of their own.
I know they do, I enjoy a lot of their songs myself.
Survivor, Say My Name, and Soldier are fantastic songs as well.
I just do not think their overall material is quite as good as what TLC delivered.
I will throw another group into this conversation actually.
Who? Now things could get real complicated!
What about considering the Spice Girls as the best female group ever?
They did have some good songs like Wannabe, and Spice Up Your Life. Not better than TLC though!
To each their own I guess! Either way, it is a pretty interesting debate!
