Rogue One is my favorite Star Wars film.
Whoa really, even over the original trilogy?
Yeah it manages to capture two themes really well.
What themes are those?
Bleakness and hopefulness, the movie is full of them both.
Oh good thinking, I agree on that.
The fact that they had the courage to actually end the film the way they did, was nothing short of impeccable.
Indeed, a very dark but hopeful ending that paved the way for our heroes in the original trilogy.
I can only hope the next Star Wars spin offs are that good.
Honestly with Disney at the helm, I can't see that being anything but the case.
