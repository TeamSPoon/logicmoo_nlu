The Beatles had a long and prolific career.
Yes they did.  What was your favorite song of theirs?
I think it was Hey Jude.
Why that one in particular?
Paul Mccartney wrote it for John Lennons son and i think it's sweet.
It's a shame what happened to him.
Yes he would definitely have made some more great music.
His talent was unsurpassed.
I think he would have had a lot to say about the current political situation too.
Yes he would have been mortified.
