If you had to pick the best rapper of all time who would you choose?
That's a tough choice, let me think.
Can you think of one?
I think Dr. Dre was the best.
Yes he was definitely a great one from back in the day.
He collaborated with a lot of artists as well.
What was your favorite song of his?
I think probably "Forgot About Dre".
Yes that's one of mine too!
I also loved his song "Kush".
