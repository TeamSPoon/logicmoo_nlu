Did you see they are making a new Pete's Dragon?
I believe it is out already.
I wonder how Pete looks in this new one.
Definitely not the goofy green dragon like the original.
I loved the songs from that movie.
Me too, it was such a nice story.
Oh and how Pete cooked those apples with his fire, I used to laugh at that part all the time.
I remember that.
I should look online to see if I can buy a copy of the original.
You should look to get the new one too.
