What's your favorite NFL division?
I am partial to the AFC.
I am too.
It's really just because of the teams that I like.
Same here. Who do you think is going to be the best AFC team next season?
I'm not sure but I hope it's the Titans.
They very well could be. I thought they were the best team in the division last season.
I've felt that they have a really high skill ceiling for a couple years now.
I would agree with that. Their offensive line has been great.
They are great in the quarterback position, too.
Yeah, Marcus Mariota was underrated last year.
They've also had a great drafts both this year and last year.
It does seem like they're shaping up to be a powerhouse team.
They were averaging 30 points a game midseason last year.
Yeah, I remember them being explosive for awhile.
It would be crazy to see what that team could do with a top rated receiver.
Yeah, I feel they still have a couple roles to fill.
You never know, though. Sometimes people you wouldn't expect start performing at huge levels.
True, there have been some very surprising rookies that last few years.
Either way, I'm excited to start watching some AFC division football this season.
