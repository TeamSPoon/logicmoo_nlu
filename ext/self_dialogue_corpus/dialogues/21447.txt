Have you heard about the movie "Get Out"?
Yeah, a lot of people have said it was really good.
Did you see it yet?
No, I haven't gotten to see it yet. Don't spoil it for me!
I won't, but you should really go see it. I thought it was both entertaining and insightful.
What did you find insightful about it?
There was a lot of really interesting social commentary regarding race relations, within the narrative of a horror story.
How so? What was it about?
This black guy goes home with his white girlfriend to meet her family, and it's just really uncomfortable. It kind of gets out of hand.
Okay, don't tell me too much about the plot, but how does it comment on race relations?
I thought the whole plot was really kind of a metaphor for the experience of black people in a majority-white country. It's both overtly and covertly hostile.
How does that play out in the movie?
Many of the things that the white characters say and do are straight out of real life, but in the context of a horror movie, it's easier to see how damaging they are from the black protagonist's perspective.
So you felt like you could understand what it's like to be black in America?
In some ways, yeah. It often seems like racism has mostly died out here. I never thought about how all of these experiences could add up to create a really hostile environment.
That's interesting. I'll have to check it out. Was it mostly horror or were there funny parts also?
Oh, it was definitely a comedy as well as a horror film. There's a lot of dark humor. No pun intended.
I like dark humor, so that's probably right up my alley.
Definitely! Go see it so we can talk more about the social commentary.
I will try to see it this week!
