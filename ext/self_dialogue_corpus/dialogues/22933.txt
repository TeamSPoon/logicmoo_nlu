Do you remember when the original Home Alone movie came out?
Yes it was in 1990.
That's right, I remember I was pretty young when it came out.
That's a classic movie!
Remember those  robber guys?
Of course I do, a huge part of the movie.
Which actors played them do you know?
One was Joe Pesci and another was Daniel Stern.
I remember now. They did a great job.
Yes a great job at acting stupid.
You would think that real robbers would not be that dumb.
Of course not!
That kid was brave for being left alone.
I know, can't say I would have acted the same.
Me either! Let alone in a big city.
It's a good thing he was okay.
I know, I think I probably would have just cried.
I probably would have too.
Did you know that Kieran Culkin played in that movie?
No actually I did not know that.
