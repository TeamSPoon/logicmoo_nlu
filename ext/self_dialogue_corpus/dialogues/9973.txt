Did you ever see the Matrix?
Of course I saw the Matrix, its one of the top movies of all time.
Yea I really loved those movies.
The special effect style of the fight choreography was very original.
Yea, the way they slow-motion dodged bullets was really cool.
Yea it was.
What else did you like about it?
The fighting they did on the cables to make it seem like they were flying around was pretty epic.
Like when Morpheus was training Neo in the dojo?
Exactly, that was awesome.
