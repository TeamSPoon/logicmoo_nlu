Zootopia is still my favorite Disney film.
I thought that was a great movie too!
Have you seen the Behind the Scenes of it?
No, I haven't.
Well, the original story of the movie was supposed to be much darker. There were government regulated collars for predators so they are oppressed from their natural instincts.
Oh wow... That sounds really interesting. I wonder why they changed it.
I'm not too sure but it was definately a late change. They scrapped it after finishing 2/3 of production!
Woah! That is crazy!
Honestly, I'd like them to bring the idea back.
Same! Maybe they were struggling with how to make the setting work with the characters, but I know Disney can do it.
