I have a confession.
What's wrong?
I'm kind of a Disney princess fanatic.
What's wrong with that?
Sometimes I feel weird admitting that as a guy.
It's 2017, don't let social standards deter you.
I'm kind of a SUPER fan though.
Oh, Who's your favorite princess?
I gotta say Elsa from frozen, she's a newer character but already one of the most complex.
That's an amazing choice!
