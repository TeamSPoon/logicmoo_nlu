So, do you have plans today?
Not really, I am thinking about watching some movies.
Do you have anything specific in mind?
I love to watch anything with Eddie Murphy.
I feel the same way. He is so funny!
Have you ever seen The Nutty Professor?
Yes! I have both of them on DVD.
I enjoyed the sequel, but not nearly as much as the original.
He played several different characters in those films.
I know, he is so talented!
Have you ever seen the Beverly Hills Cop movies?
Those are my favirote action movies of all time.
They are classics at this point.
A Vampire In Brooklyn is also a great film.
I do not think I have ever watched that one.
It is good; it is a very interesting role for Murphy.
I think my favirote Eddie Murphy movie is Coming To America.
That is a wonderful movie.
I have probably seen it a hundred times.
He also played several characters in that movie as well.
