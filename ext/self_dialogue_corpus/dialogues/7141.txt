Where do you think the writers came up with the idea of 101 Dalmations?
I don't know. Maybe it was a book or something.
Maybe it was, but what about that author?
Maybe that author loved dalmations.
Well you would have to love dalmations a lot if you wanted to have 101 of them.
Yeah 101 is overkill, but 100 is just right.
Haha what a joke!
I can't even begin to imagine having 102, like in the next movie.
Don't even get me started.
How about 101 Beagles?
