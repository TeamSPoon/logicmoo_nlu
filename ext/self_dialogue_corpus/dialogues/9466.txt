who is your favorite lyricist of all time?
that would be Keith Murry
yeah he is good and his vocabulary is off the chain.
my favorite song is most beautiful thing in this world.
I haven't heard that song in years. I bought the cassette when it came out.
cassettes, I remember those day. Rewinding the tape over and over until it didn't work any more.
I wonder if Keith Murry has any new songs out. I haven't looked for him on youtube in a while.
me either
I'm going to see if I can find any new tunes from him today
that's what's up I'm going to do that too.
