Have you seen Saw?
Yes, that was an awesome movie.  Had me guessing the whole time.
Every-time I see it, those games he has everyone play.  Kill or be killed basically.
But the best part was at the end.
When he finally caught the killer.  I was surprised to see he was playing the game as well.
I would have never thought it.  And when he cut his own limb off.
That was gross and shocking.
But the biggest surprise came at the end.
Turns out Saw was the guy on the floor.
That was one of the most suspensful movies I've ever scene.
