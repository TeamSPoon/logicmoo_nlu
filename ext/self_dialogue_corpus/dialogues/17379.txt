i like badlands better
i like hopeless better
badlands had drive and hold me down
hopeless is still fresh in my mind

sorry and bad at love are so good
she can sing so well
she is underrated in singing
she is a queen
i love her voice
its so sensual and soft
and it is powerful as well
yeah, when she belts it out
like in the chorus of bad at love
yeah, i cant wait for a new album
