How have you been doing lately?
I have been good, just catching up on a lot of movies here lately.
Yea that is what I love to do sometimes; just set around and watch movies.
Have you saw any good ones lately?
Yea I just recently watched Fist Fight.
I have been wanting to see that one, how was it?
I loved it; it was very funny and entertaining.
I might go buy that one tomorrow and have a movie night.
You will not regret it, I think you will enjoy it.
Lately I have been watching a lot of eighties movies.
That was a great decade for movies, which ones have you watched?
I just finished License To Drive. Have you ever seen it?
I watched that one many years ago, but I remember liking it.
Yea me and my wife like watching old ones like that every now and then.
Yea sometimes those old ones can bring back a lot of memories.
Do you have any favorites that are from that decade?
I have always been a fan of the Back to the Future movies with Micheal J Fox.
I have probably seen every one of them like ten times.
They are movies that you really can watch over and over without getting bored.
Micheal J Fox is a great actor that will always be a favorite of mine!
