Do you think the new Spiderman will be any good?
I think it could be.
It does have Tony Stark in it.
It also seems that Sony is letting Marvel take the lead in the writing process.
I'm just glad with didn't get another origins story.
How many of those were there?
I can think of 2 but I think there was 3 of them.
How many times can they kill Uncle Ben?
What about finding a new way to say 'with great power comes great responsibility'?
Yeah the last one with Kevin Cosner was stupid. He didn't even say the line right.
