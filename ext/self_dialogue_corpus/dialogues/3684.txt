Have you ever seen 10 Cloverfield Lane?
No, what's it about?
It's about two people that get taken to a bunker and are told that the world is ending.
But they arent sure?
No, and the guy that brought them there is kind of unhinged.
So what do they do?
They try to escape. But, only one makes it out.
Was the world really over?
Yea, but at first it seems like everything is fine. But then she gets attacked by aliens.
Oh wow, nice twist.
