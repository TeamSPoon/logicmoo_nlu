So where do you fall on the Beatles vs. Stones debate?
The Stones, but both are bands one should respect.
I think so too. I'm more of a Beatles fan personally.
I think they had a couple of very good songs, but I just can't get into them that much.
Have you tried Revolver?
I have, but it didn't really do it for me.
What about their solo material?
Well I think Paul did some good stuff.
You should check out George Harrison's solo material. It's very underrated.
That's for the recommendation!
