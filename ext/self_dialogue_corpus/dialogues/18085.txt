Have you ever heard of the Monkees?
Sure I have. They're animals that say "oo oo, ah ah!"
Uh, no. The musical group the Monkees.
No. Who are they?
They're basically like the American version of the Beatles.
Really? How so?
Well, they did similar music.
Oh. Like what?
"I'm a Believer" is one song.
I know that one!
The most interesting thing is how they got together as a band.
Were they friends?
No. They weren't friends.
How did it happen, then?
They were put together for a TV show.
Really? Like the current "Boy Band?"
No, it was a fictional show. A comedy.
This sounds really interesting!
You should check them out, their CDs and show, The Monkees. Another popular song of theirs is "Last Train to Clarksville."
I definitely will look into this more. This sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
