Have you ever seen Hancock?
I don't know.  Who is in it?
Will Smith is the main character.
What was it about?
He plays a superhero that kind of turned into a drunk homeless dude.
Oh, yeah.  That was actually a pretty good movie.
Yeah, I liked that it mixed comedy with action.
What was your favorite part?
I don't know.  Maybe when he got in the fight at the prison.
Oh yeah, that was funny.
