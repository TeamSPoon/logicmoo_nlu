So who's your favorite rapper?
Mine's Nas. You?
Mine's Nas as well. Why's he your favorite?
There's no one better at painting a picture with words than he is.
Yeah, he definitely transcends the rapper moniker. He's a true poet.
His first album just blew my mind.
Illmatic is a classic, for sure. Do you remember when you first heard it?
Yes, I'd seen the review in Source magazin in 1995...
The famous Five Mic review.
Yeah, and I was waiting and waiting for it to come out. When it finally did I got the singles on vinyl as well as the CD.
And when that grimy piano first came on for NY State of Mind you knew it was something special.
Hell yeah! I've heard that was his first take of that song.
Yeah, you can hear him saying "I don't how to start this" right before he begins.
And DJ Premier, who was producing, thought the first take was so good they used it.
So what's your favorite song?
I think from a beat standpount, it might be Represent.
What about from a lyrical standpoint?
I think the last verse of One Love is one of the greatest verses of all time.
Definitely. Talk about painting a picture with words. He sets the stage perfectly with that verse.
Yes, he captures a moment in the life of a kid in Queens Bridge project perfectly.
