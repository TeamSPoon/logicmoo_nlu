Have you ever watched the classic Disney movie, Fantasia?
No. I've heard of it though. Isn't it about a vampire bar?
HaHa. No. You are thinking of a television series that is no longer showing.
Well, tell me about the movie, Fantasia, then.
Oh gosh, I can't remember what year it was actually made, but it is completely antimated.
Was it made before we were born?
Uh, yes, we're not that old. (Laughing)
Speak for yourself. haha
It's just incredibly amazing. It must have taken the cartoonists literally years to finish it.
You mean every scene, every illustration in the movie was hand drawn by the artists? Wow!
