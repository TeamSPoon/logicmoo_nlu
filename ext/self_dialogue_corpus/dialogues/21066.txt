I finally broke down and watched Don't Breathe last night.
How did you like it? Did you like it?
No. I did not.
I didn't think it was too bad.
I didn't like it how the one character who didn't want to do the job ended up dead.
You know, that stung me too. If he did not try to save that girl...
He would still be alive.
A home invasion story gone wrong.
It was intensely a smart thriller. But not as many jumps and scares as I would have liked.
I didn't jump at all.
It did have me holding  my breath more than once.
It had you scared to breathe, huh?
Some but if you think about it, the entire  premise of Don't Breathe was stupid.
Because a 65 year old blind veteran living with his dog and is sitting on a pile of money. But he is able to overtake 3 intruders.
Maybe he was a special kind of blind. He did serve in the military.
That makes no difference. Blind people are feeble and portraying this guy as some sort of buff super villain is idiotic.
I saw that as ironic. The man is blind, you want to rob him but he over powers you instead.
It's kind of messed up to rob a blind guy, isn't it?
The moral of the story is.
Don't mess with the blind?
