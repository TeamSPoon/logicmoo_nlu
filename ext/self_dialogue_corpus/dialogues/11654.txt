My favorite Beatle is Ringo because I like his voice.
So do I. He sings some weird stuff, though.
I don't like that stuff. I like the love songs or the earlier stuff.
I do like 'A Little Help from my Friends.' That's Ringo.
Yeah, that one is good.
Do you like the cover they used on Wonder Years?
Not at all.
I wish they'd just used Ringo's version.
That would be better for sure.
I'd love to hear more of his stuff used in different shows and movies.
