What do you think about Rey being a feminist hero?
I love her but they went overboard.
Don't be misogynist. Why?
Well, I love strong women. But they force-fed it and it wasn't natural.
Example?
"Stop taking my hand!" while letting him take her hand and not letting go.
Hmm, go on.
"Get off!" when he climbs on her. Why did Finn climb on her to get a view in a plane?
That was a bit forced, I'll admit.
Told you. I'm right.
