Are you excited for preseason.
Yea, preseason is my teams only chance.
Wow, who is your team?
I've been a Bears fan forever.
Yea, looking like a rough year.
I think they will miss the quarterback from Vanderbilt.
I miss the days of Ditka.
Yea, the Superbowl Shuffle is awesome!
I miss William Perry.
I wish Walter Payton was still playing.
I miss that defense!
Oh my God, Wilbur Marshall was a beast.
Mike Singletary could hit too!
Jim McMahon was a character.
Little did we know Jim Harbaugh was even worse!
I still think Payton should have gotten a touchdown in the Superbowl instead of giving it to Perry.
I bet they regret that decision.
Did you know Payton's brother played in the NFL?
No I didn't!
Eddie Payton played for the Lions.
