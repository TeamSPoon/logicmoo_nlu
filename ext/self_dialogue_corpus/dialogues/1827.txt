I've always been a San Francisco 49'er fan. I watched them with my father growing up.
They were so awful last season. How can you stay so loyal?
I have great faith in Coach Shanahan. They had some great draft choices this year.
I think it may take more than a couple of good draft choices to regain their top tier status.
Yes, I agree. Do you remember the years when Joe Montana was the quarterback?
I'll say. I was at the game when Montana threw the pass to Dwight Clark in the last seconds to win the game. It was not called the "Immaculate Reception" for nothing!
Those were the days! The team franchise stayed so strong for 14 years. They went to and won 5 Super Bowls during those years.
The team had such a long list of talented players like Freddie Solomon, Steve Young, Deion Sanders and so many more.
I think they had 17 players inducted into the Pro-Football Hall of Fame.
There have been a lot of great football dynasties over the years. Remember the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It took a lot to create those dynasties so that they could dominate the other teams for so many years.
This is where the New England Patriots are now. They have been dominating the game since 2001
I think they have been to 7 Super Bowls over the past 16 years and won 5 of them.
I wonder if the Seahawks will be able to unseat them this year and win the Super Bowl.
It is almost impossible to create this kind of dynasty now with the advent of salary caps and free agency.
It shows what an amazing coach Bill Belichick is despite these handicaps.
I agree the coach is crucial to the team. There have been some great ones over the years like Bill Walsh, Chuck Knoll and Don Shula.
I love watching these kinds of coaches become commentators once they retire. Their perspective is so insightful.
I especially love the comments on why a play succeeds and why another play fails.
This is why football is so great.  I can't wait for the season to start.
