So you think Haggrid and Madame Maxime got together after everything was settled?
Good question. I think we all just assumed Haggrid was still game keeper at Hogwarts.
Yeah, probably. How do you think the Fantasical Beasts tie in to that?
It would have been cool for Haggrid to meet Newt Scramander. I think they would have had a lot to talk about.
Yeah, that new movie was pretty good. I'm not sure how I feel about the Cursed Child.
It sounded a little to far off base for me. Like the description of Harry sounded completely out of character.
I thought so too, but I'll probably still go see it. I love the Harry Potter movies though they are different from the books.
Yeah, it's a different vibe but still good.
They did an excellent job with special effects.
Considering how vivid the descriptions are in the book and how my imagination wandered...they did great.
