Did you see Fast and Furious 8, the Fate of the Furious?
Yes I did, and it was great.  Amazing.
That was good how Jason Statham got to be a good guy this time!
Yes it was, and he named his baby after Brian, the Paul Walker character.
Yeah, that was a nice touch.
I could tell he was going to do it when his ex-girlfriend told him she only named his middle name so Dom could give the first name.
I think I had an inkling too.
Then at the end they were having the barbecue and I knew what he was going to say..."Brian!"
Haha, yeah that was funny.
He always brings that "family" thing into everything, that's what makes it a big hit in addition to all that action!
