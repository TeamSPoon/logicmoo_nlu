The horror genre intrigues me, but I have to admit that I don't know many good horror movies to see.
Well, you could start with The Exorcist, considered by many to be the best and scariest movie of all time.
Oh, I don't know if that's a good one to start on for a novice like me. It might be too scary.
Perhaps. Maybe you can let me know if you like gore, supernatural, or monsters.
Well, I do find supernatural movies to be interesting - ghosts and the like, but I like the other subgenres you mentioned, too.
Well, in terms of ghost or haunting movies... I found the original Paranormal Activity to be very scary. It kept me up for days.
But is that considered a classic?
I think it might be in time. In terms of a classic supernatural movie, you might try The Shining.
Yes, I have heard a lot about that one. Do you like it.
Yes, it's an extraordinary movie that can be watched over and over. There are some many different levels to this movie. You should see it.
What about monster movies?
Well, since it seems like you are into classics, you should try either the Universal movies of the 30's and 40's or the Hammer moves of the 50's and 60's.
What's the difference between Hammer and Universal?
Universal is the studio that introduced the world to Dracula and Frankenstein. Hammer is a British studio that also incorporated their own spin on these movie monsters.
I guess to round it out, what about gore or slasher movies?
Well, there's always the Halloween and Friday the 13th movies - they really started the slasher movies of the late 1970's and early 1980's.
Hmm, I'm not sure about those.
Well, a more sophisticated movie might be Silence of the Lambs.
I saw that - it creeped me out! So many avenues which to pursue.
Horror is the gift that keeps on giving!
