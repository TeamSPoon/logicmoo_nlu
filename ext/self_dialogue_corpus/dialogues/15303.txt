Who has been your favorite to see in concert?
I think for me it is between Michael jackson or the killers.
Wow, Both great artists but I think michael jackson would be much better to see live.
Well I was really young at the time, but still really enjoyed it . It was the bad tour.
Oh wow , what a show to have seen.
It really was, I still recall all the lights and the roar of the crowd was crazy loud.
How can The killers be in the same arena even?
Well I think because they are now one of my favorite bands. I was older seeing them and a smaller venue.
Small venues can make all the difference, how small are we talking here?
Well it was a cincinnati casino show. It is an outside stage but it is small so you end up super close even in the back.
Sounds good, but I would want it to be a closet small to compete with michael.
Alright jackson's concert will go down in history as the best for me, but killers was a close second. What about you?
Favorite to see in concert would be paul simon, graceland tour.
I love paul simon.
Me too, my parents took me to this concert when I was young. It was so cool to see the tribe perform with him.
Wait there was a tribe ?
Yes the south africans who were featured on the album actually came on tour. It was very incredible.
You mean Ladysmith Black Mambazo?
Yes I think that is their name. I was really young at the time. but still goes down as the greatest for me.
Funny how impactful those first memories can be in your mind.
