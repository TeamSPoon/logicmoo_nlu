Man, I'm bored with these movies.
What's up?
I wanna watch a good, scary movie. What's good lately?
Well, there was The Bye Bye man. I liked that one.
What was that about? Was it scary?
It was kinda scary. It was about this curse that comes when you say this guy's name.
Sounds all right, but, gimme some more.
All right, how about Annabelle: Creation?
That name sounds kinda scary already, Go on.
Well, it's in the Conjuring series. It's the fourth one, I think.
I liked those movies. Let's go see it!
Easy now, friend. It's not gonna be out until August 2017, so we've got some waiting to do.
Oh, so you were just teasing me. Not cool.
No worries, there's other movies out in the meantime.
All right, like what though?
Well, there is Saw 8, if you're into that.
Didn't they rename that one to Jigsaw?
Oh yeah, you're right, they did. Plus, it's not coming out until October 2017.
Then I guess for now it's back to watching re-runs of Halloween.
I'm up for that. Pass the pizza.
