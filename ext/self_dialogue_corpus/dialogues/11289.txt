What is your favorite Beatles song and why?
I say Eleanor Rigby, it had such an interesting sound.
I did think that song is one of the best. Such moving lyrics.
Lyrics yes but also the violins and string section of that song was impactful.
Really a different take on the typical beatles sound. I think they were great in so many areas.
what do you mean areas like lyrics, instrumentals or what?
I mean in terms of having so many different sounds and styles yet they all feel like true to the band.
Well the band was around so many years makes sense their sound would change to.
Yes they just really have a big span, they started kind of do-op sounding in a way, then rock , a more spiritual indian sound emerged at one point.
They have had a very diverse career soundwise. I enjoy it all!
