What kind of music have you listened to lately?
I'm digging classic country.
What sort of artists do you consider classic?
I really like Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Waylon Jennings to name a few.
Yes, those guys were masters of their genre.
I really dig how they just sang about whatever, especially Willie.
Yes, music is so different today across all genres.
I know what you mean.  I can't stand pop music these days, or modern country.
Modern country is the worst.  It's all about hanging out with your boy and girls wearing short shorts or something silly like that.
I know, it's sad cause people should sing about things that matter.
It is all about money now a days and what sells!
Very true. I have found that I like Chris Stapleton, he is kind of old school.
He has a great voice for country.  I heard he writes alot of songs for country musicians.
He does write alot.  Ironically his song Tennesse whiskey is a rehash from the 80's.
I've heard that.  George Jones made a hit out of it bach in the 80's.
I'll give him a pass for now, but he does have a lot of original songs.
Have you ever heard of Dale Watson?
Yes, he is sort of country, sort of folksy too.
Yeah, I saw him a couple weeks ago in Austin.  It was entertaining!
I'd love to see a guy like that. He's in it for the entertainment factor and love of music!
