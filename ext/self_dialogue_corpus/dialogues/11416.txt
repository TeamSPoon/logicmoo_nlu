What's your opinion on the Beatles white album?
I love it. It's a masterpiece.
It sure is. It came out when I was a freshman in high school.
I bought it right away.
I think it's one of their best.
Lots of oddball songs,and their only double album.
Some great stuff on there.
Another timeless Beatles album.
They all seem to be timeless don't they?
You got that right brother
