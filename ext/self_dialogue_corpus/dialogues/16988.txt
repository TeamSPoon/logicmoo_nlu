Do you like of Monsters and Men?
I love them.
Yeah, Little Talks was really good.
Yeah, emotional too.  I had a friend who had a different take on the meaning of that song.
Oh really?
Yeah, instead of it being about a recent widower, his wife had Alzheimer.
Whoa!  Mind blown because that makes perfect sense.
I know right?  Such a good song though.
You know what else was good?
What else?
Mountain Sound.  Really great song.
Yeah, they make some good coffee shop stuff.
I wonder how they are in concert?
No clue, I bet they're just OK.  I mean they're great but it's not like a rock concert where their style is crazy.
Yeah I bet you're right.
Aren't they from Iceland or something?
Yeah I think they are.
That's crazy.  Although I heard Iceland speaks pretty good English, at least as a second language.
Yeah, they do a good job singing in it for sure.
Yeah, and writing lyrics for it too.
