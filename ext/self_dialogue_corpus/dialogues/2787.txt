Hey sis, it's almost time for some NFL watching.
Oh Lord.
What's wrong?
That means I won't hear from you again until February.
Ha, you crazy.
It's True!
Yes it is, but you know I love me some football.
I hope your team remembers how to play this season.
Oh you got jokes. My Panthers will be just fine.
If Cam gets back in the game.
He was in the game last season, but Luke got hurt.
Oh yes that's right.
He was hurt at the beginning of the season and it went downhill after that.
Hopefully he'll be back this season.
He will. Plus Olsen is going to help out more.
He plays great already. I like that dude.
I do too.
They need more good defense players though.
That's true. I haven't seen the new roster yet.
I hope your Panthers get far this year.
