What do you think of The Purge movies?
They're a bit ridiculous but they seem like they could happen in America.
How could that happen?
If the NRA took over, it would probably happen.
Would you consider it horror?
Yeah, definitely. It's basically home invasion, but the whole country.
I only saw the first one. Did you see the others?
Yup.
How were they?
The second was awful, but the third redeems itself a bit.
