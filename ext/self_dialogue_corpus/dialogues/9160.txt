You ever hear of the band July Talk?
No I haven't what are they like?
They're a rock group from Canada with a male and female vocalist.
Oh that's cool, I like bands with two vocalists.
I know you do, these two play off of each other really well, great chemistry.
What do they sound like?
July Talk kind of has this indie/bluesy feel to them, with a hard edge.
Oh that sounds right up my alley.
They're playing a show two hours away next month if you wanted to check them out.
I sure do, just get me familiar with some of their tracks.
