So tell me, what era of rock music do you think was the best?
Well that is hard because what was considered rock was so different in differetn decades.
That is true. So who is your favorite modern rock group?
I really like Coheed and Cambria.
They are pretty good. I enjoy them.
I think that 80's rock groups with always be the best though.
Who is your favorite from around that time period?
I would say probably metallica  or KISS.
They are both kind of still around, aren't they?
I think in a way they both are.
