What's your opinion on Bon Iver?
Pretty mixed, to be honest.
What do you mean by that?
I love his old stuff, his new stuff is just okay.
What makes you say that?
I don't really like all of they synthesizers in his last album, 22 A Million.
I guess I see what you mean there.
I'm not saying he's not talented you know, it just felt kind of fake.
I never really felt that way, he still plays everything.
Really? I thought it was prerecorded?
Nah, not at all man. He composes all the music and has a back up band in session and on stage.
Really? I didn't know that. I thought he just recorded the sounds.
Nope, you should give it another shot.
Maybe I will. I really liked For Emma, For Ever ago.
Yeah that really landed him on the stage.
Yeah, it's funny. He doesn't look like it but he has such a great voice.
I know, he can hit so many high notes.
Skinny Love! I loved that song. Heck I still do.
Great tune. I'm telling you, give his stuff another shot. It's a new style, but still pretty good.
Thanks for the recommendation. I'll give it another whirl.
