So it loks like the Bucs want Ali Marpet as the center lineman.
I'm not happy with that decision.
Why not?
Kevin Pamphile should be center lineman.
Why do you think that?
Look as his stats last season and in 2015, superior numbers each season.
Yes but Ali is looking really good this year.
Well, yeah in training camp. It will be different come pre-season.
I think he will shine, give him a chance.
Well, that;s the problem too many seasons have elapsed to create a good team.
It takes time to do that.
Yes, but with the Bucs they shave off people every season and it's like starting over.
I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team.
Exactally. Times up. lets win games.
I hear ya but i think theres more to it.
How so?
Well, these are sports experts and they know more about this than we do.
True, but like with everything there is a bit of common sense with everything. Somethings they do make no sense.
I share your frustration. Hopefully this season will be different
I'm hoping so as well.
