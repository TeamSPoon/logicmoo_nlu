What kind of movies do you like?
I LOVE animations.
What kind of animation, Japanese kind? Anime?
Oh, well, I guess I'm not such a big fan of that kind of anime.
Oh? Why not? Anime is pretty cool. Great animations, great story lines and so on.
Great animations, yes, but the ones I've seen were so violent, and incredibly sexual.
Hm. Which ones? Do you remember?
Um, There was this one... It's about this ninja, and he's, like, being chased by these super mutants, or other ninjas or soemthing.
I think I know this. Did it has a ninja that turns into a stone?
Yeah, that's the one. he has sex with a drugged up woman or something.
Ninja Scroll.
Yeah! I didn't like that too much.
Well, you're a girl, it's understandable. Have you seen inside out?
Oh my god. yes. that's the type of animations I like.
That was hilarious. I generally like ALL of pixar's films.
Me too. They've made some amazing animations.
You know Steve Jobs started that company.
Really? I thought it was Disney company.
Well, it began under Lucas films, then Steve Job bought it, and then he sold it to Disney for close to 8 billion. 7.6 or something.
All that money for making computer animations. Whoda thunk?
