Do you want to watch Iron Man with me?
Yes sure.
Have you seen the first movie before.
Of course it's one of my favorites.
What's your favorite part.
Probably the beginning cave scene.
Why is that?
Well it shows his creative genius and how Iron Man came to be out of necessity.
I never thought of it like that, I always just liked his personality.
I liked the creative genius parts the most.
