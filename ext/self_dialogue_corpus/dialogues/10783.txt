I loved the backstory with Dom in the Fast and the Furious
Yeah, that thing with his dad was scary.
Did you like the date scene?
Yeah, that explained the group and how they formed.
I was really into that romance story with Paul Walker and Dom's sister.
Yeah, it was very cool.
I liked how he ordered the tuna everyday at her shop
Yeah. That was funny
I knew they were gonna get together
Me too
