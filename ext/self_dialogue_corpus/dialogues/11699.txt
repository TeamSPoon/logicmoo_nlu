I can't stand music today. I feel like true artists are gone.
No one is as great as The Beatles.
Oh my, so true. They are classic.
You know what one of my favorite songs is that most people don't know?
What is that?
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band is a so great.
You know, that is not what pops in my mind as a Beatles song right away, but it is a classic.
It is a shame that more people don't listen to them these days.
I think a fair amount of people still do.
I know I will never stop being a Beatles fan.
