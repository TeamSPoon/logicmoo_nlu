who do you consider the best female vocalist?
I would say Aretha Franklin.
She has a wonderful voice and a bunch of grammys.
18 Grammy Awards to be exact.
Those are all deserved.
Do you have a favorite aretha song?
I like Respect such an anthem for so many women.
Very true,I also like Think!
Think, is a great track.
She is such a force of nature.
I just heard she had some health problems recently.
Ya, I saw she had to cancel a concert.
I really hope she is going to be ok.
Me too, obviously.
She would be on my list of top vocalists.
who would be your top?
I think maybe celine dion.
Really? I stick with aretha.
Fair enough, but celine is an incredible talent.
Oh no denying that at all. I just respect Aretha more.
