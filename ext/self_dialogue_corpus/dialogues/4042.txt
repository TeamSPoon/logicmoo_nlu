Hey, what was the last thriller movie you saw?
God, it's been awhile since I've seen one. Probably Fast 8.
Why do you think you haven't seen a Thriller since Fast 8?
Well I love The Rock and Vin Diesel. Haven't seen a cast or story that matters that much in a thriller!
What about the new Transformers movie? Didn't it just come out?
Yeah it did just come out, but I have no interest in it. It looks really really bad! I don't think they are even trying anymore with the movies!
Michael Bay sure does love his explosions. What about The Mummy?
Hey that might be a good one worth checking out! I'm not that big of a fan of Tom Cruise except in MI and Top Gun.
Well they are working on another Mission Impossible! It's supposed to be out soon I think!
I'll have to look into it! Those are some killer thriller movies!
