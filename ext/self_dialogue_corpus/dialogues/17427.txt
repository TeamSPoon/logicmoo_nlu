Do you like I'm sexy and I know it.
I have never heard of it.
How about lmfao?
Nope.
How about Party Rock Anthem?
Yeah, they play it at the bar all the time.
Well Lmfao made both songs.
Oh, I see.  I might have to listen to it.
You have to watch the music video the song is great but you have to see the video too.
Why is that?
Well it just puts everything into perspective let's just say that.
Alright now i'm intrigued.
Want to come over tonight and I can pull it up on youtube on my tv tonight?
Definitely.
Bring some beer too and i'll get pizza and we'll listen to a lot of their music.
That sounds great.
I think you will like it, they make funnier songs but the pace and beat of the songs are just pure genius.
Like Weird Al?
No not like Weird Al.
Alright, look forward to it.
