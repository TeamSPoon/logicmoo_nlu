Have you seen the Spy yet?
I have and it is so funny. It is one of the best movies that came out recently.
Who plays in it?
Melissa McCartney, Jude Law, and also Jason Statham got to play his first comedy in a while.
I never got to see it when it came out a couple years ago, but I will stream it on Netflix.
That sounds fun. Do you want me to come over and watch it with you?
Yes that would be great.
Do you need me to bring anything?
Please bring some popcorn . and I will make lunch for us.
Ok see you then!
