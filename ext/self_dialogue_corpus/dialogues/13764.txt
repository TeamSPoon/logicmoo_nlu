Do you like Lady Gaga?
I do. What about you?
Yea, but I like the early Lady Gaga stuff better than the stuff she came out with lately.
Agreed. She is very talented.
She is, but she can be a little too weird for me at times.
True, but I like weird. i think she is a pioneer.
Truth!! She is unique and the music world needs more singers like her.
I couldn't agree more. Do you like Bad Romance?
Of course. I think it may be my favorite song.
Mine too. All of the songs on that album are great.
