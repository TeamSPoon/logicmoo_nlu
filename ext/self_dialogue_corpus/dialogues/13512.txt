Something bugs me about Star Wars.
Yes, me too, but what is it?
So, they are traveling in hyperspace, sometimes for LONG periods of time.
Yes, and?
And they have to eat.
Yes, and?
Some of them are in super tiny planes by themselves.
Get to the point.
How do they use the bathroom? They don't have space suits like astronauts do.
That's disgusting but a good point. They probably have a tiny airplane-sized room and have to be super careful. Or, they disintegrate it using the force.
