Did you see Dr. Strange?
Yeah. Pretty weird.
I was never much of a Strange fan.
I didn't even know about him until the movie.
Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty good though.
He is a fabulous actor.
He has a flawless American accent.
He does at that!
If they made a sequel I'd watch it.
I'd probably wait for the DVD.
