So did you ever listen to Bon Jovi?
Oh yeah, I loved Bon Jovi!  He was one of the greatest artists of the nineties.
I'd say it was more like the eighties.  Slippery When Wet came out in 1986.
Well you may be right, but he was still very popular in the nineties.
True.  Keep The Faith came out in 1992.
Well yeah, and they were still releasing music in 2000 believe it or not!
I didn't know that.  What did they release in 2000?
It's My Life.  And they had another album in 2007 which actually included country music.
Whoah, I wouldn't have seen that coming.  So their music has spanned several decades.
Yeah, hard to believe isn't it.
Yeah, it is.  Most artists aren't around so long.
I know.  I think they've released something like 13 albums total.
That's crazy!  So what are their favorite songs of yours?
I guess I always loved Blaze of Glory.  That was one of their original hits.
Oh yeah, I love that song too.  I still listen to it.
Yeah, and Livin' On A Prayer.
Oh that's a great song!  I learned to play it on the guitar.
Yeah, it's one you can definitely sing along to.
That was the case with most of their music.
Yeah, it's probably one of the things that made them so popular.
