Do you listen to pop music?
I like older pop music from the 90's, but I will listen to newer stuff.
What bands did you like from the 90's?
I was a huge boy band nerd. I loved BSB and N'Sync
I was secretly a fan as well, but we can't admit that!
Right?  I also like newer pop like Bruno Mars and Adele
Yeah, Adele has some pipes on her.  I think Bruno put on a great SuperBowl show
I agree, he really took it to another level.
We need more artists like him out there
Yes, he is a modern Michael Jackson.
