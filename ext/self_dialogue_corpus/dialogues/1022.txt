Well another NFL season is getting ready to start.
Thank goodness, I hate when there is no football on tv!
I hear you there.
How do you think this year is going to go?
Well, unfortunately I think the Patriots are probably going to have another good year.
I am so tired of them. Tom Brady is getting old though.
He is, but I think he still has a couple of good years.
True, and with the players around him I think that they will still do well.
Well I am pulling for the Packers do well.
I think that they have a pretty good chance.
They have both Jordy Nelson and Aaron Rogers. They are always very good.
True. I think they will have a good season.
Who do you think will be the worst team in the league this year?
I think it is probably not to different from who it has been the last few years.
I think I saw a prediction that the 49ers and the Browns will be the worst.
Yeah, that is not suprising.
Wouldn't it be great if they suprised everyone and one of them made it to the Super Bowl?
It would certainly turn heads.
And a lot of fantasy footballers would be upset.
True. Lets just hope the Patriots don't go to the Super Bowl again.
