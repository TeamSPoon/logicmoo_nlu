Hey, I've been listening to a lot of Alice In Chains lately.
Oh yeah, I love them, such great harmonies.
Jerry and Lane, their voices just mesh so well, some songs are so haunting.
I know, the Jar of Flies album is full of dark thoughts, which we know are Lane's.
I can't believe he and the drummer are both dead, and all because of stupid drugs.
Yep, did you ever see Mike Starr on Dr. Drew's Celebrity Rehab?
I did, you know both guys must have really been in a lot of emotional pain.
Yes, and you know, the songs really tell us that, don't they?  Down In A Hole is one of my favorites.
I love Rooster, and oh yeah, Whale and Wasp is super haunting.
I agree, I still enjoy checking out Jerry Cantrell's music, I just really miss Lane.
