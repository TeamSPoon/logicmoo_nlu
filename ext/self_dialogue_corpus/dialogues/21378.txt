the new 2pac movie?
yeah, it is in theaters now.
I dont care too much.
how come?
i've never been a pac fan.
Are you a biggie fan.
I am. east coast represent.
2pac was so much better.
i heard bad reviews
people say it is not as good as the straight outta compton movie.
i didnt care for that movie either.
are you serious?
i liked nwa too but it was just boring.
yeah, it was not for everybody.
i thought they made eazy look like such a fool.
he got scammed and wasnt much of a gangsta.
i always knew him as the biggest gangsta.
the movie didnt showcase that much
ice cube was more tough there.
