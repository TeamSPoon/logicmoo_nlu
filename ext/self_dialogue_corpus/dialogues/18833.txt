Hi, have you listened to the newest Sia album?
"This is Acting?" Well, it was released last year; year 2016.
I am sorry that's what I meant. How do you like it?
Well, as usual I love Sia's songs.
Me too! Why do you love her songs?`
Well her songs are usually inspirational. It is not the typical; pardon me, cheesy love songs.
I agree. It is about life and how to survive in this world.
That is correct. This is because she had her own demons.
What do you mean?
Well she used to be addicted to alcohol and certain illicit drugs. As the results, her songs relate to how she managed to break through.
Wow I never knew that! Well I know her song "The Greatest" is to respect the massacre victims in Pulse Nightclub in Orlando.
Yes. That is correct.
If you look at the music video, people say that the amount of dancers represent on how many people were killed during the tragedy.
Oh I did not know that! But I know at the beginning of the music video, Maddie the dance smeared her face with paint that resemble LGBTQ flag.
That is correct. The song has so many level of interpretations!
Right! Going back to that album, I heard that alot of the songs in that album are reject of other singers.
That is true! I head that "Alive" was for Adele. Adele rejected it at the last minute.
Oh well, I feel Sia's raspy voice is more suitable for the song anyway.
I agree. Same with the song "Summer Rain." Rumor says that Christina Aguilera rejected it.
Oh wow. Again I feel that Sia's voice is more suitable for that song.
