I just saw highlights of Superbowl XXXIX.
The Patriots' third Superbowl championship?
Yes, this time not won by a last minute field goal.
Philadelphia was a worthy opponent.
They had a 13-3 record that year.
It was a pretty tight game, I recall.
0-0 at the end of the first quarter.
Who scored first?
Philadelphia, but the Pats tied it up.
The halftime show was tame compared to last year.
I heard Paul McCartney was a safe choice.
What happened in the third quarter?
The Pats scored, but the Eagles tied it.
So it was tied going into the fourth quarter?
Yes, 14-14.
Who scored next?
The Patriots, a touchdown and a Vinateri field goal, 24-14.
But McNabb came back with a td pass, 24-21.
But there was almost no time left, and the Pats intercepted in the end.
The dynasty was established.
