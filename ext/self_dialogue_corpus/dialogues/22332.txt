When you've just started dating someone, picking a movie is easy.
Right, you both want a romantic comedy, a rom-com. One that's not too gross or explicit.
You've probably both checked out the selection, and might even have settled on the same one.
You both want one that sounds truly funny, in case the date itself is a dud.
Yes. And it's a good sign if you laugh at the same things.
And it's a bad sign if he insists on a dreary war movie, or something pornographic, or a kid's movie.
Or if she does.
True. It's also bad if you're sharing snacks and one of you takes most of it.
I never do that. Hardly ever.
But if the relationship seems to be progressing, choosing movies gets harder.
Right. What if only one of you likes art?
Or the two of you have radically different ideas of what art is. Bad.
Right--I hate all those made from comic book movies. Zak loves them.
Let him go without you, that's all. I hate anything with Tom Cruise--it's a prejudice, I know.
It is. I think he's adorable.
And Ron likes his movies too. How perfect for you.
Yeah, but he talks all through them. People turn around and shush him!
How awful. And how distracting!
Yep. If he'd only done it on our first date. But I'm hooked on him now.
Well, shush him yourself, silly girl.
