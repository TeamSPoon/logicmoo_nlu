You know Lady Gaga?
Haha, yeah. That meat dress is classic.
What do you think about her most recent album?
I didn't really think it was as good as "The Fame" or "Born This Way."
Really!
Yeah, it just wasn't as good quality.
Interesting. What do you think your favorite song of hers is?
Probably "Poker Face," what about you?
I think "Bad Romance."
Yeah, that one's my second favorite.
