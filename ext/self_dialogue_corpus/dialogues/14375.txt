Hey, do you like basketball?
Yeah, definitely. I played in high school and I like watching it.
Oh cool, I played in high school as well, but only junior varsity.
That's cool. I played through high school on both junior varsity and varsity.
Oh wow, you must have been pretty good.
I was alright, but nothing special. Do you follow professional or college basketball at all?
Yeah, I mainly follow college basketball, but I pay attention to the NBA on and off.
I'm kind of the opposite. I am a die hard NBA fan and sort of follow college basketball.
Oh okay, yeah, it's just hard for me to get super interested in the NBA. The season is fairly long and my team isn't very good.
Yeah, I can see that. I'm a fan of the San Antonio Spurs, so it's been easy to get excited about the NBA in recent years.
Well yeah, the Spurs have been at least a decent NBA team for the past 20 years. They've won like 4-5 championships in that time or something like that.
Yeah, they're great. They have a great coach and have been really good about managing personnel.
I'm a fan of the Charlotte Hornets, who aren't very good and haven't been for a while, so it's hard for me to get excited about it.
Yeah, that's understandable
My college team is the North Carolina Tar Heels, who have had much more success in college than the Hornets have had in the NBA.
Oh yeah, that's one of the more famous basketball schools. Didn't Michael Jordan go to school there?
Yep, and we won the national championship this year, which was awesome.
Oh yeah, I remember that. That must've been exciting.
It was awesome and I got super pumped when they won.
Yeah, I can imagine. Unfortunately, I don't think the Spurs will even be getting to the championship series this year, but maybe next year.
