Have you ever seen the extended version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Of course! I own both versions.
Which music is better?
They're the same, dude.
No, they're not.
Yes, they are. How are they not?
Howard Shore wrote the music for the extended versions, and they were edited for the released version in theaters.
So he wrote 4.5 hours of music to only have it be 3?
Yeah, thanks to production who thinks we can't handle long movies.
So, what difference does that make?
Well, shore is like Wagner.
He uses leitmotifs?
Yes, and he even says which is which in his writings.
Okay, and?
Well, the music makes far more sense when played in the extended version as everything is in its right place.
Were they basically plucking themes out of thin air and putting them into the score?
Essentially.
Know what's crazy, then?
What's that?
The music still works, it's still beautiful, and it fits. Even when it's not what he intended.
