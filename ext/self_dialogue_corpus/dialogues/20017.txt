Did you ever like Paula Abdul?
Wow, that was a long time ago!
I know, did you have any of her CDs?
I think I had her first cassette.
Yeah, I think I had that one, too.
I think it was actually pretty good.
You remember the song with the cartoon video?
The one with her and the cat?
Yeah, I think the name was MC Skat Cat or something.
Yeah, what was the name of the song?
Opposites Attract.
Oh, yeah.  I could only remember the "Two steps forward, two steps back" part.
Wasn't there a song that had Elijah Wood on the video?
Was there?  I don't remember.
I think it was "Forever My Girl."
Whatever happened to her?
I don't know.  I think she might have had one more album.
I don't even remember that.
Yeah, there was that "Rush" song.
Oh, now I remember.
