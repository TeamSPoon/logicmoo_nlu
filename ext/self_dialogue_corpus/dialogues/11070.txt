Season's over.
Yep, the Wild tried this year, but the blues goaltending is hot at the right time.
When do the blues play again?
I don't know. Sometime later this week
DO you think they will make the finals
No. To be honest, their offense just isn't good enough. They need to rely on defense.
Given their goalie's performance in this series, no kidding.
Tarasenko could give most teams a run for their money, but that's about it.
And do think we lost to a team that's just bigger than us and clogs lanes.
Yea, the Wild didn't learn fast enough, did they?
Do you think we keep big name talen like Suter and Parise around?
Yea, I think we are just a couple tools short of a cup.
I hope they want to stay.
Yea, Suter is young and could be lured away.
I am worried that losing Suter or Praise will take our punch away
Totally agree, but it's a business
Well, to next year's Wild.
let's do well in the nhl draft
Or spend a bunch of money and tradw
that too
