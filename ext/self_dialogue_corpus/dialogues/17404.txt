Please tell me what the big deal is about Jason Robert Brown.
He's kind of a big deal I guess, depending on who you talk to.
Right, and I don't know any of his music so I'm trying to understand.
Ok, I can try. Let's start off with the ridiculously hard piano parts.
What are you talking about?
Most of his music is for singers with piano and maybe a small band, but always piano.
Ok, I'm with you so far.
Good, but the thing is he's a really good piano player so his piano music is really difficult to play.
Is that a good thing?
I don't know if it's good or bad but it definitely makes his songs a bit different in style. It's like the whole orchestra is all in the piano.
All right, I guess I can imagine what you mean and that would be different from a lot of broadway music where the piano's pretty straight-forward.
Ok, and then add to that the fact that most of his songs are written with lyrics like a person's talking to you.
What does that mean?
Here's an example. If you listen to "She Cries" the whole time this guy's talking about how messed up his life is by this woman he can't leave because she cries and it stops him.
That sounds kind of depressing.
It isn't though because it's like being inside of his head while he's having this whole debate with himself It's complicated but it's also really funny in a way.
That might be worth listening to.
Most of his songs are like that. They're someone trying to explain themselves either to someone else or to themselves.
Like therapy as music?
More like someone trying to solve a puzzle out loud I think. Less creepily personal than therapy would be.
