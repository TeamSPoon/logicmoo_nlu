You know who's the definition of rock?
AC/DC.
Yes!  How did you know?
How could you not.  One of the best bands ever.
Yeah, I love Thunderstruck.
Or TNT.  One of my favorites.
Yeah, great workout song.  What about Hells Bells?
Oh man.  So many hits you could just go on and on.
Back in Black.  I love that one.
And the cheeky but overlooked Big Balls.
Yeah, about ball room dancing.
I know, it's funny though.
It's almost like they have too many hits.
I know, you could go for hours.
Like High Voltage.
Oh don't forget Have a Drink on Me.
Yeah, how about Highway to Hell.
One of the best songs they have.
A pretty good road trip song.
Oh year for sure.  Just have a drink on me while you do it.
