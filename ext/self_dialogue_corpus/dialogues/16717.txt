Party Plates and Vanilla Poppers will be playing
Sounds awesome
It will be i love punk music it is my favorite genre
It is good but not quite my favorite
What is your favorite type of music then
My favorite would be Hardcore i love me some breakdowns.
Hardcore is cool but it is just not quite the thing i need everyday
What do you mean it is awesome and exciting
I get that but sometimes it can just be a bit much
I guess if thats how you feel
I mean i do like it though.
Well no duh i already knew that
Just making a statement
What is your statement?
I think punk is better than hardcore
Never ever will i agree
