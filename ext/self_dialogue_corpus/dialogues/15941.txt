Can I ask your opinion about Justin Tmberlake?
Sure. I think he is very good. Intelligent businessman also.
Do you know he is called the President Of Pop?
It doesn't surprise me. He deserves it. That kid has made an impact.
Yes. I also think he has.
The strategy he used with his 2 albums of "The 20/20 Experience" was perfect.
Yes. Nobody even knew he was back in the music industry and all of a sudden he makes it public and like in a month the album is out.
Right. And then a month later he goes out with a second album.
Yes, it is unbelievable. The kid is a whole industry himself.
And he is quite a good singer too. And a great showman.
Do you think he will keep on with music?
I'm sure he will eventually surprise the world with another comaback like the one he did.
The las albums had some great songs!
Yeah, I mean he does high quality music. And he takes risks you know?
How do you mean?
Having songs that are 7 minutes long, that change dynamics drasticaly.
Yes that's right. And the songs keep the listener hooked anyway.
Absolutely. Plus, the production is flawless.
Yes, him and Timbaland make a great team.
One for the books my friend.
