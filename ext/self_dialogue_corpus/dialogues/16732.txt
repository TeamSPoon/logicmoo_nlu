What is your favorite music?
Rock.
Anything specific?
Classic, Alternative, Hard Rock some Metal.
Most of it then, eh?
Yeah, pretty much.
Do you have a favorite band?
I'd have to go with Green Day.
They are really good.
Yeah, I can't believe they were at the Grammys this year?
They weren't?
Not that I saw.
Was there anything good at the Grammys.
Not much. Bruno Mars did a tribute to Prince.
Was that good.
I thought it was. Better than George Michael's tribute.
Oh yeah? Who did that?
Adelle.
That seems odd.
It was really bad.
