There are some more things about Jabba the Hutt I remember.
Me too. I think that was the RETURN OF THE JEDI movie.
There was that creature standing next to him.
That creature had a head that wrapped around his neck.
And Jabba had a puppet creature on his tail.
It would laugh crazy like.
And Jabba had that dungeon.
They dropped Luke into it.
And Luke killed the big monster.
And the monster's keeper cried.
