One small change to make a good movie, great?
I would change Star Wars episode 1. No Jar-jar.
I'd change Rambo back to where he shoots himself after the first one
I can't honestly say I've ever seen Rambo.
Me either, but from what i know, it was a fitting ending
Wait, so how does Rambo end?
I don't know... But he doesnt shoot himself obviosuly as there are four more movies.
haha, so you would just end it so there were no more sequels?
Yeah, it's a great stand alone story. Vietnam vet does what he needs to do and then kills himself.
But doesnt that hit a little close to home?
Exactly, sheds light on an issue. Makes a statement.
For Elf, I would make James Caan still hate christmas.
Why would that make it a great movie?
Santa would crash his sleigh into a bunch of people and then the Central Park Rangers would catch him.
So the cops catch Santa and ruin christmas for everyone?
Exactly. The first noble truth of Buddhism: life is suffering.
I would make the aliens from Close Encounters of the Third Kind the same as the aliens from ET
I don't remember what they looked like.
The aliens from Close Encounters are just the stereotypical greys. Long limbs, large eyes, no nose.
Oh yeah, that would be good. It would kind of connect the UN mission with the government control from ET
