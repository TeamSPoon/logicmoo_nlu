Do you remember that movie with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman?
Far and Away?
No, the other one.  It was really weird.
Oh, Eyes Wide Shut.
Yeah, that's it.  Did you ever see it?
Yeah, I heard a lot about it.  So one night I saw it was on and I watched it.
Did you like it?
It was really weird.  I don't remember exactly what went on.
I heard there's a lot of weird sex stuff.
Yes, that's why it was weird.  They had this crazy secret torture group or something too.
