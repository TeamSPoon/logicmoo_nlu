I went to see Maroon 5 in concert last night.
I really don't listen to them.
How could you not?  Their music is awesome.
I mean, I know some of their songs.  I'm just not a fan.
I've been listening to them since they released their first song.
Wait, how long have they been around?
Since the early 2000's.
Really?  I didn't know they had been around that long.
Yeah, they've had a few albums.
What was the first song they released?
I think it was "Harder to Breath."
Oh, I remember that song!  I didn't realize it was them.
Yeah, they have a ton of songs.
Were there any other songs from that first album that I might know?
They were all pretty good.  You might know "She Will Be Loved."
Oh yeah, I remember that one too!  I liked it.
I thought you didn't really care for them?
I didn't realize they had all these songs!
So, do you wish you went to the concert?
Definately!
