Did you ever see those boring movies created from classic books?
Yeah, some of them are so dull.
My teachers in high school used to make us watch them.
I remember those days.
A lot of them were in black and white.
Yeah, and the acting was so dull.
Those movies were nothing like the movies made from books today.
Yeah, you cannot compare them to Percy Jackson movies.
No way, nor Harry Potter.
The special effect today make imagery so much more vivid.
I do think that it takes away sometimes from kids using their own imaginations.
Really, I think it adds.
Maybe you're right but who draws anymore?
Sure, the computers seem to do all that for you.
I imagine there are some movies that are hand drawn.
I don't know about that.
Even movies are hugely impacted by the technology today.
Seems like everything is.
I don't know if kids will ever want to watch classics again.
I don't know if their teachers make them anymore.
