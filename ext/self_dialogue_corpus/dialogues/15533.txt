I really like video game music
video game music what do you mean
music made for video games
how do you listen to that
on most any stream services
hmmm is it good
yes some of the best music out there
really
yes, you get a combination of sounds from classical to pop
can you suggest one
yes the music to any of the Final Fantasy games is excellent
that sounds interesting
even music and sounds from things like Mario games is great
really you can listen to Mario music
yes, you would be suprised how great it is
can you just pick a game you like and listen to the music
most games have a soundtrack
really I would not have thought that
you would be suprised, but sometimes the soundtracks are expensive to buy but well worth the price
I can imagine they do not produce a lot of those
