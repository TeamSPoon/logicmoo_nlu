Guess what I am watching right now?
What?
The Ghoul.
Wasn't that a Boris Karloff movie?
Yes he is the Ghoul.
He played in a lot of those old horror movies.
Yes he was in the Mummy.
And Frankenstien.
He played a lot of those type characters. So did Lon Chaney
I know.
When did he die?
He died in 1969.
Oh what ?
Emphysema.
Oh that is too bad.
Well at least we can still watch his old movies.
That is true.
Scary movies today are so much scarier.
Yea and gory.
Think I will go watch some old movies.
