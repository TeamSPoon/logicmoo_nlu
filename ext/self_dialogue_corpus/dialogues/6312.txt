One of my favorite film series produced by Disney is The Pirates of the Caribbean.
The film series was an instant classic.
With a cast line up including Johnny Depp, it was hard not to go wrong.
The cast also included Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.
How could I forget the actors who played Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan?
I liked seeing Orlando Bloom act opposite Johnny Depp. For most of the first film, Elizabeth Swan was on her own.
The movie is so quotable.
I quote the movie more often than not.
Captain Jack Sparrow's lines are some of my favorite, especially his quote about rum.
My favorite line is when he is arrested and claims they have heard of him.
