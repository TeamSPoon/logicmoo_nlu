Have you seen Moana that Disney just released recently?
Oh, I have always wanted to see that movie, looks very visually pleasing
indeed, especially the water, they look so cool
I have seen the trailer, the big hawaiian dude with a funny girl, I was really intrigued
yeah, you should go see it, it's really good. Those 2 have a lot of fun lines
Yea, I would definitely go watch that, just for the fact they have cool sand and water simulation
I know right, it's pretty amazing what they made in the studio
All they need is a brilliant idea and a group of artists work together, and voila Moana!
haha, indeed.
alright, I'll mark that on my schedule
