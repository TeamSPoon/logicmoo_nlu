Do you follow American football?
I do. I love it.
Have you ever been to a game before?
I have only been to one.
Who was playing?
It was the Colts versus the Texans in Indianapolis.
Nice. Who ended up winning?
The Texans won. The crowd was pretty upset.
I'm guessing you're a Colts fan, then?
I actually am not a fan of either teams. I got free tickets and I lived in Indiana at the time.
You're not a fan of the team in your state?
I grew up closer to Chicago. I was raised a Bears fan.
Nice. The bears have had a really rough time lately.
They have. A lot of people blame Cutler.
I know. I don't think he can totally be blamed for it, though.
That's true. Their offensive line does a very poor job of protecting him.
You're absolutely right. He seems to take more hits than any other quarterback.
He also seems to be injured less.
He does. Poor guy.
I think it's time for them to make some major lineup changes.
