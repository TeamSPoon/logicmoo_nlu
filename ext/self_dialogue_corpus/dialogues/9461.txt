Do you listen to hip-hop or rap music?
Really I don't very much.  I'm not a huge fan.
Me neither.  I guess there are some rap artists that I kind of like, but hip-hop, not so much.
What rap singers do you like?
I'll admit that I like some of Eminem's stuff.
Yes.  Some of it is kind of catchy.
I always liked the first one I heard of his.  I think it's called Slim-Shady.
He always sounds so angry when he sings.
Do you have any hip-hop music you like?
I don't really.  My kids know some of the hip-hop artists, but I don't listen to them.
