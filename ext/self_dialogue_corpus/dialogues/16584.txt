Whatcha listening to?
It's a playlist of covers by KHS.
Who's KHS?
Kurt Hugo Schneider. He's a really popular YouTuber.
Does he sing, or?
Well, he does sing, but mostly he collaborates with other YouTubers to make cover songs.
What, he can't make up his own music?
You've clearly never seen any of his videos, the guy's brilliant.
Then why's he have to cover other songs?
That's just what he likes to do; he takes a normal pop song and turns it into something really cool.
What's so cool about a cover?
Well, he creates the music by using really random things--one time, for example, he did the entire background beat of a song by using the sounds made by opening and closing car doors, turning on signals, changing gears, stuff like that.
That's kind of cool. So is he like a mixtape artist?
Sort of. He plays the piano, guitar, tambourine, and like I said, pretty much any item you can think of. He sings, too.
So if he can sing, why does he get other people to do it in his videos?
He's a big picture artist, I think, so he wants the singer to match the song perfectly.
That makes sense, I guess.
He's also a brilliant cinematographer. He has several one-take videos that are just fabulous.
Wow, maybe I should check him out after all!
Totally! He's been around since 2010 or so, and all his music is solid.
