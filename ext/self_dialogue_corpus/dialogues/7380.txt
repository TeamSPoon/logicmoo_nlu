Do you know if they are going to make another Peter Pan movie?
I'm not sure.  They have made so many versions already.
I don't know if all of the versions were Disney though.
It would be cool if they did another version like how Beauty and the Beast used real life actors.
They made Hook a while back.  That had real actors.
Never saw it.  But I don't think Disney made it.
Oh.  If Disney did decide to make a real-life Peter Pan movie, I hope they don't use too many computer graphics.L
Computer graphics for what?
Like to depict Neverland and the mermaids and Tinkerbell.  You know?
Oh right.  Very true.
