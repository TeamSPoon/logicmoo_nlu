So is U2 going to have a new album soon or what?
Not sure.  I keep hearing they will be but nothing ever happens.
The last album was pretty critically-panned.
For good reason.  They threw something out there without really making a good record.
Kind of reminds me what they did with Pop.  That was garbage.
Oh yeah.  Remember Discotheque?
Don't remind me.  What were they thinking?
I guess they were trying too hard to be different.
Just stick with the classics.  Everyone loves Joshua Tree.
That's an album I still listen to.
