do you like fall out boy
i liked take this to your grave
that was my favorite too
it was right before they got famous with cork tree
tell mick was such an amazing opener to the album
it was so energetic and brilliant
it was a huge splash and insult to his ex
it was so mean spirited.
he said if she was on fire, he wouldnt piss the fire out
thats hilarious but so mean
yeah, i think patrick wrote the lyrics
who would have thought that.
yeah, he never seemed too angry
pete was probably more of a womanizer
yeah, girls loved his emo makeup
i loved saturday and grand theft autumn
saturday is a depressing song
i listen to it when im upset
i do the same with that
that album is their saddest i think
