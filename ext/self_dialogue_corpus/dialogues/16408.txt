Discovered any good new artists lately?
Not really new, just new to me. I've been listening to the Arctic Monkeys a lot.
Oh, yeah? Which songs are your favorites?
Knee Socks is fun. And I Wanna Be Yours really gets me for some reason.
Hehe. They're good.
I think Arabella is my favorite.
British bands can be so cool.
Well, Queen. No argument there.
Right. Freddy Mercury was a genius.
True, that.
What do you think of Adam Lambert as their lead?
No one could replace Freddy, but Adam does well, I think.
Looking back at his first performances on American Idol, he was good, but so young.
Oh, yeah.
It's been awesome watching him find himself and turn into this powerhouse of artist.
Definitely.
And now he's standing in for Freddy.
Amazing journey.
It'll be interesting watching what else he does with it.
Totally.
