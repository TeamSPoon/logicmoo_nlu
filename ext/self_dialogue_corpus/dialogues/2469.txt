Do you prefer passing or running plays in the NFL?
I prefer passing.
I also prefer passing.
I think the running game is important though.
It is, but the passing is more fun to watch.
Did you see some of the hail Mary passes Aaron Rogers has thrown.
I have.
Some of those passes are nuts.
It is pure luck that his receiver catches the ball.
Of course it is.
But it is neat how far he can throw.
And how accurate.
What do you mean accurate?
Think about throwing fifty yards and not being the field of play or out of bounds.
True.  I never thought of it like that.
Most people don't.
Still the receiver has to make one heck of a play.
Yes they do.
It helps to have a tall receiver.
And one that can jump very very high.
