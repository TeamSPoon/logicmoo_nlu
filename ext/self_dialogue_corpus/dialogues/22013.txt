Is there any movies coming out that you'd like to see?
Ooh I definitely want to see the new Mummy movie!
Really? The new mummy movie?
Yea it looks really cool.
Don't you think that the movie doesn't really follow the mummy storyline?
Not really why would you say that?
Well firstly I think it's weird that Tom Cruise is in it.
Yea I'm not much a fan of Tom Cruise.
I feel they are just trying to rehash old movies and make more money off them.
Yea, but it looks really good!
Well we'll see how it ends up, any other movies you wanted to see?
Ooh there are tons of movies coming out soon that I really wanted to see.
What other movies do you want to see?
Well Despicable Me 3 looks like a lot of fun.
Yea it does, I really enjoyed the last two.
It's such a silly movie, that I always enjoy watching it and it makes me feel like a kid again.
Most definitely. I can't wait to see more of the Minions because they are my favorite part.
I think the Minions are everyone's favorite part. BANANA!
Hah, well maybe we should go see a movie soon!
We most definitely should! Maybe we'll go see Despicable Me 3.
