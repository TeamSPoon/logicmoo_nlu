John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.
You're not kidding. Tons of wide shots.
Right. Yeah. Great choreography.
And the editing.
The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.
None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.
Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.
It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.
And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great. The action is very fluid and not chopped up.
It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene.
