Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Return of the Jedi.
Really? I liked Empire Strikes Back more.
Return of the Jedi is the conclusion to the original trilogy, though.
It takes a lot of missteps with its plot, though. Like with ewoks.
But it has Jabba's Palace, which is a great sequence.
Empire Strikes Back has the scenes on Hoth, which were better.
Return of the Jedi has more emotional depth - especially in the ending duel.
Luke duels Vader in Empire Strikes Back, too.
But Return of the Jedi proves to be Darth Vader's salvation. That's why I like it.
