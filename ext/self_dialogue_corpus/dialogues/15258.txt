Who do you think is a stronger singer adlle or beyonce?
Oh that is tough.. Beyonce for me.
I go Adele.
Why , beyonce has many more hits and is so much fiercer.
I will give to beyonce when it comes to presentation, Lately her performances at video awards are like moving art. But vocally I think vocally adele has her beat.
Maybe but I think adele must have some bad technique why else did she develop nodes?
I don't think it is only caused by poor vocal technique. Julia andrews also had them and she is a pro.
I suppose I don't know enough on the subject. I just thought the two went hand and hand.
Okay who is the better singer between arianna grande and mariah carey?
Mariah carey of course!
Okay this one I agree.But arianna  comes close to carey.
They both possess crazy vocal ranges that are almost unheard of.
Very true , not many singers have the range those two do.
So sad about arianna's london concert.
I know how tragic. I was thinking how awful and guilt ridden I would feel if I were her.
Why? She did nothing wrong at all.
But I would feel badly because they were there for me.
Well she should not blame herself. I think she is being very generous. I think she paid for the funeral costs for those who passed.
Ya I heard that. Also the benefit concert was thoughtful.
yes, it brought a lot of great musicians together for a good cause, just too bad it had to take place at all.
