Do you like Billy Joel?
Yes, Piano Man is one of my favorite songs.
I think that Billy Joel's live performances are great.
Yeah, he has such a great vocal range.
And his piano skills are fantastic.
I also like We Didn't Start the Fire.
That song is definitely at the top of my play list too.
Have you ever been to one of his tour concerts?
Yes, a few years ago - it was a packed house but they played all the classic songs like Upton Girl and You're Still Rock and Roll to Me.
He has even played with Elton John a few times.
I remember when Elton John and Billy Joel did the Tonight Show together.
Dueling pianos makes for a great performance.
I think he's a great performer as well as composer.
Billy Joel even cites Beethoven as an influence.
I did not know that - it would neat to see some behind the scenes jam sessions with his band.
I think he has a great mastery of music theory too.
Yes, that separates the real musicians from those who can't sing without engineers helping their vocals out.
I hope he continues to tour live.
Yeah, and playing the classics never gets old.  I think his music helped to define the 1980s and 1990s.
True - he did not have a bad album.
