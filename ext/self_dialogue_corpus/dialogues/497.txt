What about them Packers?
Well, what about them?
Well we are both from Wisconsin, thought you'd be interested in the Pacs.
You know I haven't really watch much since Brett Favre got squashed into retirement.
Yeah, that was funny.
Sure was funny.
Well then what about them Bears?
What about them?
They are the other football team closest to Wisconsin.
Yep, they sure are, to bad they haven't won any titles since 86.
What's your favorite NFL team?
Its hard to say, it just seems so hard to win a championship.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It doesn't matter much to me, I guess whatever team wins the most.
I think the Patriots win the most.
Oh yeah, is that so?
Yeah, they are like always winning.
Well maybe because they work harder than everyone else.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Defense wins the game.
