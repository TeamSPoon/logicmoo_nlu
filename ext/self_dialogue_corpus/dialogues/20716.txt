Hey, Amazon has Independence Day: Resurgence on dvd, really cheap.
No one would probably buy it at regular price.
What do you mean?
That movie was a travesty to the first.
Because Will Smith wasn't in it?
Because it was stupid.  It didn't make sense and wasn't any fun.
How much fun can you really have when aliens are trying to destroy your planet?
The first one made it fun.  Not to mention most of the characters that survive the first don't survive this one.
Well that's true.  I was sad to see David's wife had died.
Exactly, I loved their relationship in the first one.
And they killed Bill Pullman's character.  He was really the hero of the first one.
Probably did it for shock value.
Maybe.  In the first one they had these characters who were interesting and by the time the movie was ending, you were chearing.
Exactly.. you don't in the sequel.  Most of the characters who do survive have the personality of a dry sponge.
At least the special effects were good.
I guess that's where all the money went because it sure wasn't in the writing.
Why is that?  Why do movies with really good special effects usually have crappy writing and boring characters?
Beats me.
So, I shouldn't buy the movie?
Seriously, dude?
