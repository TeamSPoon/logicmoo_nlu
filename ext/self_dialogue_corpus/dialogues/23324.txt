What was the first movie you ever saw in a theatre?
That's easy. That would be Jaws.
Wow, that's an oldie.
Yes it is. I was young, but I remember going.
Steven Spielberg has been making movies a long time.
He sure has.
Roy Schieder was great in that. Funny how special effects have changed.
Yes, but for how old that is, they did a good job.
I remember how long the lines were to see that.
What year did that come out?
It was nineteen seventy five.
How old were you, like ten?
Actually I was nine.
Wow, that's funny. To think of those oldies but goodies.
Yes, and some channels still run them on weekends.
How many Jaws movies were there?
I think there were four.
Four shark movies.
They also made a documentary about the movies. Pretty interesting.
I'll have to see if it's on Netflix.
