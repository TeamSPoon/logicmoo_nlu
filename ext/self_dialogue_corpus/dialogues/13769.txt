I used to really like Lady Gaga, but her music has been different lately.
I think you're right. She's just not the same as she was when she first became famous.
Do you remember Poker Face? It was one of my favorite songs.
Yes, it had such a good beat! It was really similar to Bad Romance.
That was a good one too, but those two sounded almost like the same song to me.
I used to blast the radio and sing along with those songs when I was in high school.
Yeah, her songs just aren't the same anymore.
I don't think they're bad though.
I don't either.
We should look up her newest song!
