What is your favorite Lady Gaga song from 2016?
I love Perfect Illusion, it has a great beat.  What is yours out of all of her songs?
Monster, I like singing along to it.
What do you think about her music videos?
They are always so creative and have fun dances.
Yeah, they are really artistic.  I was surprised to see Alexander Skarsg√•rd in one too.
She does the artistic look with her outfits too.
I'm glad to see that she has moved on from meat dresses, that was taking it too far.
Yeah, her look has toned down lately and seems to be less about shock value.
It is understandable, she is getting older and wants to be taken seriously as an artist.
