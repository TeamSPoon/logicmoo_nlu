So I'm looking to add some songs to my workout playlist, any suggestions?
Oh, I don't know if I'm the person to ask.
How come? Do you not have tunes on when you run?
Oh definitely! I just happen to listen to top 40 all the time, is all.
Ah, staying current and hip, huh?
I guess, I just really like the beat and rhythms when I'm working out.
That's true, pop does tend to have great timing for running.
They just really make me want to move, you know? The tempo's perfect.
Okay, well, do you have favourite top 40 songs that you listen to?
Hm. I guess Chainsmokers are always pretty great for running.
They have some nice pieces--Roses is theirs, right?
Yeah, I love that one and Closer for working out.
Don't Let Me down is theirs too, I've worked out to that one before.
Me too! I just really like that I can get lost in the rhythm.
That's pretty fair. Do you have any other recommendations?
Well, I don't know about her other hits, but I like Zaza's Never Forget You.
I don't think I've heard that one.
It's not that special in terms of lyrics or anything, just a good strong beat to move to.
That's pretty much the definition of pop, I guess.
Yeah, exactly. And that's what I need it for, so it works perfectly.
