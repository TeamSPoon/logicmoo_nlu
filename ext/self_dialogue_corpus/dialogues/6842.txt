Did you find the Jungle Book 2 annoying?
It wasnt neccesary.
I dont think that I learned much from it.
Mowgli was best in the first one.
That first one was amazing especially the scenes in the jungle.
Yeah I think they combined the acting with the singing really well.
It spawned alot of other movies.
I do not remember anyone getting a spin off?
No but they got some sitcom like shows.
Wow, I didnt think it was that big of a flick to start.
