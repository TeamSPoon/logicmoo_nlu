Who ends up starting for the Texans this year?
Tom Savage will be the guy from day 1
Has he ever shown he can play in the league?
No but that doesnt matter much apparently
Why not sign Kap for just the veterans minimum.
They dont want the headache I guess.
But what has Savage ever done that shows hes competent?
He looked better than Osweiler in the playoff game.
Please, Carr wasnt even playing in that game.
I admit that you are right.
So does Watson come in by game 2?
I think Bill O Brien will slowly bring him along.
You think hes worth the first rounder?
No because of the spread offense he played in.
Yeah I think hes going to be typecasted into a certain role.
This is what was wrong with the NFL.
Why? Because hes black?
Yeah most of the QBs who enter the league are assumed to be runners.
I dont think anyone thinks that with Winston.
He is a whole different breed
