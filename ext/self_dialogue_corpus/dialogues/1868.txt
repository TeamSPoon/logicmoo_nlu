Can you name the teams with the record for the most Super Bowl wins?
The Dallas Cowboys, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Pittsburgh Steelers share the record for most Super Bowl wins.
Really? Are they all the same or is Dallas ahead?
Nope, the teams have won the Super Bowl five times.
That is crazy! Do you think the Patriots will join the likes of them?
Maybe but Brady is getting old.
It's a sad state when 39 is considered old.
I know, right?
Well you know Don Shula, coachog the Baltimore Colts and the Miami Dolphins, won 347 games in his career. That's more than any other coach in NFL history. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1997
That is nuts!
Yeah, did you know Jim Brown led the NFL in rushing more times than any other running back in history?
No I didn't.
He led the league eight times from 1957 to 1965 in his spectacular career.
Spectacular is right. There are so many greats back in the day.
Yeah, you have to wonder with all the high tech training and other stuff like supplements that go on....
How those old timers would have faired in this new world?
Yeah, I mean the advancements in medicine and technology are great but...
But those guys did it before. Yeah, makes me wonder too. How well would the hall of famers do at their peak...
Mano a mano...good question. i would be curious myself.
Yeah, it's not that I'm not grateful for all the advancements but the simplicity of the old days is some thing to take note.
