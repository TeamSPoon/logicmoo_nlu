I started reading the book The Black Cauldron is based on today.
You did? Is it any good.
It's so-so. Very fantasy pulp.
Well, it was used to make a children's movie.
The book is a lot slower. I guess it's a series, and The Black Cauldron is the first two books.
They do cover a lot of ground with that movie.
It's unusual that I like the movie better than the book, but I think that might be the case.
That happened to me with The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
The original is better?
Much better. And much sadder.
