What do you think of prince?
I think he was a good musician.  What about you?
i think he is one of the greatest artist of our generation.
Didn't he change his name to a symbol at some point?
Yes he did.  It was a protest.
What was he protesting?
He was protesting having his art taken away and used however they want.
Didn't he make his own label after a while?
Yes I think he did.  Years ago the music industry was full of crooks.
Really?
Yeah touring was the only way some of these bands made money because the record companies kept most of the royalties.
That's awful.
Unfair as it was, i think it helped get the artists out there and tour, otherwise we may never have seen them perform.
I heard prince was the best performer.
Absolutely.  He wasn't just an artist he was an entertainer. He believed in giving his all to his fans.
Michael Jackson was the same way.
Yes they were both so talented.
Their music was legendary for sure.  But beyond the music they took pride in their craft.
Something I feel that modern artists do not do.
Yes and that is not good.
