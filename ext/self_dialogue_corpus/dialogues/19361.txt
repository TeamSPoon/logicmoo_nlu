Who would you say is the best male vocalist today?
Oh, that's easy. Nate Reuss.
Nate Reuss? Interesting that he's the best when I've never heard of him.
Very funny. Maybe you don't know his name, he's the lead singer from Fun..
Fun.? Remind me what they sing again?
Well their really popular album was in 2012, Some Nights. It had that song We Are Young featuring Janelle Monae.
Oh yeah! Tonight, we are young!
Haha, yes that one. And maybe you know the song he did with Pink, Just Give Me a Reason.
Oh I know that one too. Okay wow you are right his vocals were really amazing on that song.
They truly were. And honestly I think he's an incredible lyricist as well.
Really? I guess I never really listen very hard.
You should. He talks about some pretty real subjects that when you hear 'em you're like -- dang.
Alright I guess I'll go ahead and give him a listen. Any other recommendations?
Well to be honest I'm pretty biased in favor of Fun.. A member of the group has his own band called Bleachers.
So Fun. broke up?
No! And I'm hoping they never will break up, they just work on their own projects sometimes.
Haha, it sounds like a break up to me dude. Would you say Beyonc√© 'just works on her own projects sometimes'?
Well Destiny's Child hasn't made music together since the 90s.
Excuse me, I know you didn't ignore that banger Say Yes released in like, 2014.
Haha that song about Jesus? Please that was hardly a comeback.
