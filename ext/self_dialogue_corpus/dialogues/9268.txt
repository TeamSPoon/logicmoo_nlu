I heard Tribe called Quest just put out an album?
They did, its called We got it from here... thank you for your service.
That's a long album name.
It is.  But it was like 15 years since their last one, so its okay if its long.
Yeah, it has been a while.  Do you like it?
Yeah, one of the best albums I heard this year, hands down.
Does it still sound like them?
Yes, but better, more on point, focused and politial lyrics, really interesting beats and rythem.
Oh wow, whats your favorite song?
We the people, it definitly is the heart of the album.
