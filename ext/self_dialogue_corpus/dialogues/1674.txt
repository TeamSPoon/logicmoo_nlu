Hey, isn't the preseason coming up?
I guess, if you want to watch third stringers.
I'm feeling good about this year.
At least they don't have to play the AFC West.
They are kind of rough.
Is that quarterback healthy? I heard some stuff.
You can't trust the Internet.
Nobody gets the paper anymore.
They will be ok.
I suppose, but they don't get past the first round.
Hey, in it is in it. They have to get a break sometime.
I hope you're right.
You going to watch it at BW's?
Probably not, it is just too noisy there. Just hang at the house.
Maybe I will come by, man.
Bring the beer this time, fool.
I think they open on the road.
Maybe.
Gosh, is it even on TV? I didn't check.
It usually is if it isn't blacked out.
