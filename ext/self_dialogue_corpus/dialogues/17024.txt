I was recently recommended a band with a really beautiful sound.
Oh? Who is that?
Have you ever heard anything by Amy Lee?
Amy Lee... I can't place that name.
She is the lead vocalist of Evanescence.
I am not sure I have heard of them.
They have a really beautiful sound to their songs, a strong female vocal lead with sweeping music in the background.
That sounds nice.
It is sort of a fusion between classic and modern in a way.
That could be good.
They tend to use a mixture of instruments like pianos and electric guitars to great success.
Ok, I am sold. I might have to give them a listen later.
You should, they deserve at least a try.
Got any favorites?
Bring me to Life is probably one of their most well known songs.
I think I may have actually heard that.
You probably have, it is pretty popular.
Any others?
Everybody's Fool, My Immortal, Sweet Sacrifice, and Call Me When You're Sober are all good.
Thanks, I will check them out.
