Did you see that there is a remake of Baywatch coming out?
Yeah I saw. I'm not sure if I will see it but I do like The Rock.
Yeah I understand. I feel like 90% of movies coming out nowadays are remakes or sequels.
I know right? I wish there were more original ideas coming out of Hollywood.
I mean there is another Transformers movie coming out this summer!
What is that like the fourth one? They are all the same movie to me.
I think it is the fifth movie actually.
Did you hear that Michael Bay said they had like 16 other Transformers movies already written?
You've got to be kidding me! This is the exact opposite direction Hollywood should be headed.
Unfortunately it is all about money.
Yeah I know. The big blockbusters are what the studios bank on. I am just over explosions.
I hear you. I definitely prefer the more artful movies like Moonlight.
I loved Moonlight! I was so happy that it won best picture.
Yeah I did like it a lot. Definitely more than La La Land.
I liked La La Land but I thought as a musical it was just okay.
I thought the singing and dancing was average but I thought the cinematography was absolutely beautiful.
It was a shame about the mix-up at the Oscars for best picture though. I felt bad for both movie's camps.
Yeah I cant imagine what it feels like to hear you won only for it to be snatched away.
Yeah although I did not love the movie La La Land, the feeling of winning and then ultimately losing had to be brutal
I agree but everyone on stage was respectful to both movies in the end which was really nice.
