What do you think about show tunes?
I love them and can't ever get enough.
Have you heard the soundtrack to Hairspray?
I haven't heard that one.  What song do you like the best?
You Can't Stop the Beat
What do you like so much about it?
I love the beat!  I could clean house to it all day.
Who sings it?
Zac Efron and John Travolta if you can believe it.  They aren't the only ones though.
Are they any good?
Surprisingly, they are.  The whole cast is amazing!
I will have to give it a try.
Once you start listening, you will be singing and dancing right along.
I'm not much of singer or dancer, so I doubt that.
I bet you are wrong.  I don't sing or dance either, but You Can't Stop the Beat makes me move.
Maybe it would help me get my house clean also.
Did you know that Amanda Bynes and Queen Latifah sing also?
You're kidding me!  I had no idea.
I highly suggest you listen to the whole soundtrack, but if you are in the need for a pick-me-up, listen to Can't Stop the Beat
I think I will do that.  It sounds amazing.
