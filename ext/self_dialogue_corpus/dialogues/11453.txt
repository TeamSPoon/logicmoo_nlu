Do you have any Beatles albums?
No, but if I did which should I get?
Not sure. There's a collection of number one songs.
That might be good. I'm only a casual fan.
I hardly like them. That album is enough for me.
I'm sure it would have most of the songs I like on it.
It has twenty-something songs.
I'll check it out so I can add it to my collection.
Amazon has it.
Good to know. I bet they also have samples I can play.
