Do you like Dire Straits?
No I think they had one hit.
Money for Nothing?
Yeah I think thats the name of it
What other 80s rock do you like?
I thought .38 special was good.
Yeah I liked them
What about Aerosmith?
Nah they were better in the 70s
Scorpion do anything for you?
No I think they were boring
Did you like that era for rock?
Not really the 70s produced a better sound
Did you like The Who?
Yeah Baba O Riley is still a hit in my eyes
Yeah I can listen to that song all day
I guess we cant call The Beatles a 70s band either
Nah they barely made music at that point.
So I guess the 80s was more brit pop
Yeah I would come to that conclusion
