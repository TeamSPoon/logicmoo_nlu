I hope one day that women will have the chance to play on the NFL.
Women are already allowed to play in the NFL.
Really?
Really. The NFL welcomes all human beings.
Then why hasn't there been a female player, yet?
Probably because there hasn't been one good enough, yet, but that could be changing soon.
What do you mean?
Have you heard of Becca Longo?
No. Who is she?
She is the first female to win a scholarship to a Division I or Division II school.
What school is she going to?
Adams State University in Colorado.
What position does she play?
She's a kicker.
This is on a traditional men's football team?
Yes it is.
How old is she?
She's 18 years old.
She must be really good.
I've read that she is.
