I'm not really into most popular music nowadays?
Oh? What kind of music do you like, then?
Honestly, I'm pretty well into folk music.
Wow, that's kind of different.
I know, but I really like the sound of the music and the stories that the songs tell.
That's kind of like country music, with the storytelling.
Yes, but the sound of the music itself is more subtle, and way less twangy.
I don't know if I can even name any folk artists.
Well, according to my Pandora radio station, Mumford & Sons count as folk music, but I think that's kind of a stretch.
It's got to be the banjos that do it, then.
Maybe so. But I like Sarah Jarosz, who's more typical of the genre nowadays.
I've never heard of her, but I guess I should check her out if I want to learn anything about folk music.
I mean, she's not a definitive example, or anything, but I just enjoy her music.
So she doesn't just sing old-timey songs about maidens dying and all that kind of thing?
No, I guess she's more of a neo-folk singer, where some of the songs seem to have an older vibe. But her sound is more modern, I guess.
So you don't like modern music?
I mean, I don't mind it, but there are sounds that I prefer more. And anyway, folk music can still be modern.
I suppose you're right. I guess I'm just more mainstream.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with being mainstream.
Yeah, and I guess folk music was mainstream two hundred years ago too, huh?
