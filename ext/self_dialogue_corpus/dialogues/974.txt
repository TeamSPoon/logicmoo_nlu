I'm pumped for next season! How about you?
You know it. Your Cowboys are going down to my Birds!
No way! Dez Bryant and Dak Prescott will lead us to another NFC East title!
Ha, you wish! Carson Wentz has some new weapons and an improved D. We're headed to the top!
Carson Wentz is a joke! Scouts have him figured out!
Not a chance. He didn't have any help last year.
Doesn't matter. Dak Prescott is the real deal.
You're living in a dream world. Carson is the better QB.
Who made the playoffs last year? Dak.
Yeah, but he had Ezekiel Elliott. Carson had nobody.
I don't know, Darren Sproles is pretty good.
Not on the same level as Ezekiel.
Put Dak with any team, he has a better record than Wentz.
You're living in a dream world. Carson has better mechanics.
Dak threw for more yards and had a better QB rating.
Do you know how many receivers dropped Wentz's passes? Too many.
Dak also does it with his feet, man. He's the total package.
We'll see next season. Eagles are going 11-5 and winning the East.
Ha! More like 5-11!
Your Cowboys don't stand a chance.
