Did you like Bona Fett in Empire?
Yes. That scene where they had all the bounty hunters lined up was very cool.
I did not think he would end up leaving with Han Solo.
Me neither.
I liked his costume a lot.
Do you think it was odd that they made him a kid in the second episode?
Yes. That was a bit out of place.
I also thought it was funny how they got rid of him in Return of the Jedi.
Didn't he just fall into that pit?
Yes. it was comical.
