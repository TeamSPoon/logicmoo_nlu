What's your favorite opera?
La Boheme, what about yours?
I'd have to say Cosi fan tutte
Why would you pick that one?
Well, the music in Boheme is beautiful and it's dramatic and lovely but Cosi is funny!
It's in Italian, how do you know?
I saw a production in English, and also there are subtitles.
Ok, but people don't go to the opera for comedy. They go for the singing!
True, and the singing in Cosi is beautiful. It's pure Mozart with all the swells and sweet harmony.
But where's the drama and the angst that pulls at your heart like a good Puccini?
Think about per pieta, where Fiordiligi is asking her love to forgive her for being weak. She's sweet and pleading, and furious with herself!
Ok that does sound like it has some drama to it.
It really does! She's in love and confused and wants to follow her code of honor and rails at herself for the mistakes she's made.
And this is in the middle of a comedy?
Yeah. The guy she let sweep her off her feet is disguised with a ridiculous moustache.
Because false facial hair is a recipe for comedy.
You have to admit it's a time honored tradition. Beards are funny.
I still think Puccini's drama is more fun to watch just because it's emotional.
I can go for drama sometimes, but the music in Cosi is beautiful and the plot is fun and moves along briskly. To each their own I guess.
We can definitely agree on that!
