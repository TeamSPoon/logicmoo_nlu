This past year I wanted to prepare for the Oscars by watching as many of the nominated movies as I could.
That is a very cool idea. What was your favorite Oscar nominated movie you watched this year?
La La Land was definitely my favorite. It was amazing.
Who is in that movie?
It stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. It is sort of a jazzy musical but also romantic comedy.
Sounds good. Did it win Best Picture?
No! Unfortunately it did not.
What movie won?
Moonlight won Best Picture.
Did you watch that one?
Nope I never got to it. I did watch a couple other nominated movies though.
What was your second favorite?
Probably Hidden Figures.
Oh I have heard of that one! That is about the women who helped NASA right?
Yeah. It stars Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer.
It also has Kevin Costner in it right?
Yeah it does. They all are so amazing in it!
Nice! I saw the previews for that movie and it looked really good.
Yeah. Next year my goal is to watch every single movie nominated for Best Picture before the Oscars happen.
That is a great idea, I think I will do it with you!
