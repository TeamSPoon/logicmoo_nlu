What did you think of the Fast & Furious movies?
I liked them, but it was really sad when Paul Walker died.
Yes it definitely was sad. I was glad they were able to complete the last film anyway.
Yes, it was a nice tribute to him to finish the movie with him CGI'd in it.
But did it seem realistic? Knowing he'd died and all?
It was somewhat unrealistic, I have to admit. You could tell where they made changes.
You definitely could see the changes. Who is your favorite actor in the series?
I love Vin Diesel! He's so good in it!
I like him, too. He's funny, serious, action packed. He can do it all.
Yes, he certainly is versatile in his acting abilities. It's a great series for sure.
