Have you noticed that all the Disney princesses have animal sidekicks?
What do you mean?
Well, like Cinderella has her mice that help make her dress, and Snow White has all the forest animals that help clean the house.
Oh, and Jasmine has her tiger and Pocahontas has the hummingbird and raccoon!
Exactly!
What would your animal sidekick be if you were a Disney princess?
Good question. I'd want to be some kind of forest princess, so any kind of forest animal I guess.
I like that. I'd want a wolf or bear, or something fierce like that.
Mulan had a dragon, that's pretty fierce.
Not sure if you could call Mushu fierce!
