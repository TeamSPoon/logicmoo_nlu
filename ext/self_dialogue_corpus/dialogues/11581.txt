free as a bird by the beatles is one of my moms favorite songs
i like that song to
what other songs by them do you like
yesterday is a good song by them
yeah they made so many i can't  name them all
me and my wife like to cuddle to there music
i do the same with my girl
they love them brown hair dudes
man who don't love the beatles
i can't tell you that cause i don't know, the beatles rock!
