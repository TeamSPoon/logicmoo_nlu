What do you think of the Wu-Tang Clan?
Oh jeeze! I don't know where to start, so much talent!
Agreed, you got GZA, RZA, Ghostface, Method Man, Redman, ODB, and Raekwon.
It's amazing, really. They're all great MCs.
So true. Even RZA, who is predominately a production guy can rap.
Yeah! Have you heard about his new project?
No, what is it?
It's actually a collaboration with the frontman of the indie rock band Interpol.
Oh? Are you pulling my leg...
No, I'm serious. It's called and Steelz.
