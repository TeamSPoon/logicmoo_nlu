Who is your favorite pop singer and why?
I love Sia. I always can relate to her songs!
I agree. Lots of her songs are about the struggle of...well...being human.
I agree. One of my favorite song from her is "I am in here."
I never heard about that one.
Well yeah, she made it way back before she was elevated to stardom. This was pre "Titanium"
Why do you like the song?
Well, I interpret the song as being lonely. I have been in depression cycles due to my anxiety, and sometimes I felt so alone when fighting the depression.
That is deep. I better listen to the song now.
Yes, you can just play it on youtube.
