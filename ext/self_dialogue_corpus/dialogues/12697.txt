What do you think of Han Solo?
Well I think he's a neat character I can explain further but I think Chewie is a vital part to his personality.
Yeah I can't imagine Han WIthout Chewie.
Since you brought it up do you think of Han?
I think he's a really neat character, he's in short a space cowboy in a highly advanced universe.
Never thought of him like a cowboy but I guess if you put a hat on him he would.
Answer me this, did Han shoot first?
Yes that was obvious.
No he didn't.
Yes he did.
