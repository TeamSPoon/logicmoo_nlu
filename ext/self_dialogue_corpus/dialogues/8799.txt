Soundgarden had a huge influence on rock in the 90s
Black Hole Sun was a song that will stand the test of time.
What else did they write?
Spoonman was also big
Cornell was also in Audioslave.
Man they are 2 huge rock bands.
Yeah and their music spanned the globe.
They did tour alot from what I heard
Yes and they wrote so many great rock albums
I just dont remember much being as influential as Black Hole Sun
