Have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable?
Yes I have and it's one of my favorite Shyamalan movies.
Me too, next to Signs and The Sixth Sense of course.
Unbreakable is one of those movies that satisfies both comic book and thriller geeks alike.
You're right. I believe they're coming out with a part two this year.
And I believe the movie Split is going to tie into it. They gave a little teaser at the end of Split.
Oh yeah that's right! I absolutely cannot wait to see it.
M. Night Shyamalan has been doing a lot better lately.
He's definitely redeemed himself from movies like The Village and The Happening.
We don't talk about those movies if we can help it.
