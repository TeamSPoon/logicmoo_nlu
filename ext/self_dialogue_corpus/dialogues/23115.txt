If you like comedies, you'll love Groundhog Day.
Oh, I've always wanted to see that.
It will give you lots of laughs.
Is it one of those comedies you can watch over and over and still find it funny.
Yes, it never gets old.
I know it has Bill Murray in it, but who is the female lead?
Andie MacDowell is the actress in it.
She and Murray seem like an unlikely couple.  Do they work well together?
Surprisingly, they do work well together.
Tell me about the characters.
Murray's character is a weatherman named Phil.  MacDowell's character is someone who works at the TV station.
And he keeps repeating the same day over and over again?
That's it.  It's a really fun concept.
It does sound like it would make a fun movie.
Harold Ramis directed it.  He was good at getting the comedy right.
He hits a happy medium?
That's a good way to describe it.
Are there good supporting characters?
Yeah, there are a couple of really funny supporting characters that add a lot to the film.
It sounds like a well-rounded comedy.
