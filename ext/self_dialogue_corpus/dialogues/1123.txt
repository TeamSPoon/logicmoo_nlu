The one nice thing about summer ending will be it means football season starts.
That's true. I can't wait for the hot weather to go.
I know, another six weeks of this weather, and then we can cool down and sit on the couch on Sundays and watch a game.
I wonder who's first on the line-up schedule?
I already checked! The first game is Thursday September seventh with the Pats against the Chiefs.
New England will be very popular again this year.
Sunday September tenth will really kick it off with thirteen teams playing.
Wow, how do you choose who to watch?
I know. The Steelers versus the Browns should be a good game.
The Steelers are always popular.
There's also the Colts playing against the Rams.
Colts have a very devoted fan base.
So do the Seahawks, and they're playing the Packers.
I hope the Seahawks have a good season this year.
And then there's the Giants playing the Cowboys.
That should be a good game.
It always looks so promising for the teams in the beginning, but then it really quick starts to fall apart, and you can see who's going to end up on top and who isn't.
I know, but that's what makes the beginning of the season so exciting, seeing how well they come out of the gate.
Thank God for cable tv and the internet. You can watch all kinds of football all season long.
I know what you mean, I love the sports channels.
