I've decided on my dream job.
You find a new dream job every month. What're your thoughts this time?
I want to be the person who plays music at the baseball games.
The organ guy who plays the "Duh duh duh duh da-duh... charge!" stuff?
Or girl. But yeah, that job.
Why? It's a horrible job. You're sitting in a cramped booth watching a game.
I'd mess with people so bad.
I should have known this was coming. How would you do that?
Well, you know how everything is perfectly timed and rhythmically accurate?
Yes.
I'd include extra beats, change the tempo.
That sounds irritating
Oh, I'm not done.
Oh, lordy.
Know who those quick "songs" of sorts modulate by a half step each time?
Yeah, the pump-up modulation?
Yup, I'd do random modulations, like by a tritone sometimes, a third another time, a major second...
That's REALLY annoying. You'd get fired.
I'd love it.
You'd have the job for a month. You know it pays minimum wage right?
