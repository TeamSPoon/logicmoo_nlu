Yo, we gonna have the same NFL deal this year?
OK with me.
Same side bet?
I'm good for it.
OK I got Detroit, you got Green Bay
Agreed.
I think Detroit will get to the playoffs
You goy no shot dude.
As long as Stafford stays healthy we're a shoe in.Detroit will do it's usual , fade at the end.
Same goes for Green Bay. It's all on the QB
Rodgers os a sissy
Rodgers is the best and you know it.
Wanna up the bet?
OK double.
I don't know if I should be betting $2.00 on a NFL game.....
Are yoiu a fan or not?
Only a problem if you loose.
You got a problem
If my wife finds out I'll never watch NFL again
Ditto
