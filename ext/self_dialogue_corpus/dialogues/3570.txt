What are some of your favorite horror movies?
I have a lot. I like horror movies. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, The Shining, and Don't Breathe was pretty scary.
Oh, Don't Breathe was awesome.
Yeah, after seeing the trailer I had to see it.
That movie was so different on many levels
Yeah, home invasion is a pretty real world problem.
Yes, and the being chased by a dog is a big fear of mine.
How about that turkey baster scene?
Oh, that was unpleasant.
Yeah, but Rocky got away in the end and the blind man said nothing. Maybe a part two will be coming soon.
