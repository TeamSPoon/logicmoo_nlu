Have you seen Shawshank redemption?
Yeah. Such a good movie.
It's hard to believe its a Stephen King book.
I know
Shows he can right anything not just horror.
You have to love Morgan freeman in this movie
You have to love him in every movie.
Such well written and a great plot
I wouldn't be able to deal with the things that he dealt in prison.
To hatch a plan that took that long was amazing
Weird that he never got caught
yeah right
it was a movie though
well true
I wouldnt hav been able to crawl through the sewer pipe
yeah but you would have to get your freedom
well thats true
The warden was one of them characters you love to hate
sure was
andhe got what was coming to him
