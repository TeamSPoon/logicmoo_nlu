Have you seen Cars 3 yet?
No I haven't, is it any good?
I thought it was hilarious.  My son loved it too
I saw the first one, but not the second.
Really, the second one was good.  You should see it.
Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, that was pretty good.
Emma Watson is hot.
Yeah, she is no little girl anymore.
Josh Gad was really good in it also.
