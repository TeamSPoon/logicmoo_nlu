Did you see what Kimmy was wearing?
Yes, I can't believe so put that shirt with those biker shorts.
Exactly, her pink tunic with her silver jewelry would of been a better combination.
Her pink shirt, it's has too many ruffles. Ruffles are so ugly.
Hey I wear shirts with ruffles.  You said you liked them
Your tall, you can pull off ruffles unlike Kimmy whose short.
I guess that's true
Did you see my new shoes.  They are black heels
Are they leather
It's fake leather and they have 3 inch heel. I'm wearing
