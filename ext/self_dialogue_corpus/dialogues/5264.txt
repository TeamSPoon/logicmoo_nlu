Which version of the Parent Trap do you like better?
The orginal with Hayley Mill!
I agree! The songs are so great.
And Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith are really cute.
It's really like three different movie.
How so?
Movie 1: 2 girls meet at camp and decide to switch place. Movie 2: 2 girls switch places. Movie 3: Divorced couple gets back together.
Oh, that's good! And I love the California house.
Charlie Ruggles is a great grandfaher as well.
But, I do like Natasha Richardson in the new one.
