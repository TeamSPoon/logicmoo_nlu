I love the Beatles music.
I especially like Ringo.
Love love me do.
You know I love you.
Do you think they ever lived in a Yellow Submarine?
Nah but they probably did a lot of acid.
I saw a Cirque du Soleil show that was a Beatles tribuye.
I bet that was fun.
Yesterday had a sad vibe to it.
I believe in yesterday.
