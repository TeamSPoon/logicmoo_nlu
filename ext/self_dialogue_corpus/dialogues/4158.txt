Hey John, have you ever gotten to see the movie Seven with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in it?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It is very scary and thrilling.  The detectives try to find a serial killer before he strikes again.
I have seen things on it, but never took the time to watch it yet.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife of Brad Pitt, and it really is sad the whole movie is well done.
That's right, I heard she played in that, now I really want to see it.  I hope I can see it on Netflix.
You can view it on Demand on cable if you want.
I will look for it.  Did you watch it on Showtime?
Yes, I did. Try it there.
Ok, thanks, I will check it out!
