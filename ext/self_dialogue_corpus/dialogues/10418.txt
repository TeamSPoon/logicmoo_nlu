How is your day going?
Good, been relaxing and checking out movies all day.
Find any good ones.
I just watched the new Beauty and the Beast.
What did you think?
I thought it was breathtaking.
It is a real masterpiece. What did you think of the way they kept singing?
The music?It was amazing, I wanted to replay the songs over and over.
Not too much?
It was a musical, so no. I loved the way they bent the story into song.
They did have alot of the plot displayed in the music.
It was a real twist on itself, like fresh.
I liked the way the personalities of the characters came out in the music.
The songs were amazing.
Did you like the old cartoon version.
Of course. But it was not as deep.
This one had more feel. The music was more mature.
I still sing the songs in my head.
I know the feeling. Did you think the actors sung well.
Tale as old as time was a real beauty, yes.
