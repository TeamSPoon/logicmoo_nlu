Ok, who was the better character, Han Solo or Lando Clarissian
Oh, tough call, a very tough call indeed. I'd have to say they're dead even.
Okay, how do you figure that?
Well, Han had rugged good looks and a roguish charm about him, but Lando was suave and refined, and a definite ladies man.
Okay, Lando did feel little a Old West type gambler, while Han was more a cross between a cowboy and a pirate.
Yes, one was a charming bad boy with fast ship, while the other was a genteel scoundrel with a gambler's flair.
Plus, they both could fight and fly with the best.
Yes, remember Lando had some military experience and was the original owner of the Falcon.
And Han Solo, according to some of his backstory, was once a cadet in the Imperial Fleet Academy.
Yeah, if they haven't retconned that out already.
