I've never gotten around to seeing Zootopia. You've seen it before, right?
Oh, yes. That is one of my favorite movies.
I guess I better go see it soon.
You definitely should, especially because I heard a sequel is in the works.
Really? It seems like the first one just came out.
I know, but it really was a great movie. The voice acting by Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin was great.
I didn't know that they were in the movie.
Oh, yeah. They play the main characters Nick and Judy.
Cool. Is there anyone else I should listen for when I get around to watching it?
Well, you probably weren't expecting this, but Shakira's in the movie too.
