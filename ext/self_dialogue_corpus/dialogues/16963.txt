Are you a fan of Coldplay?
Yeah, I liked some of their older stuff
Yeah, I was a big fan of Rush of Blood to the Head
Yes, that had some great songs
I also liked Parachutes
Yeah, Yellow was a good song.
What about Viva La Vida
Yes, liked it a lot at first, but then it was overplayed
Agree. Played that song way too much on the radio
In some ways I really liked their X & Y album
Oh yeah I forgot about that one.
Yeah, I don't think it went really high on the charts, but has some good songs
When did they start as a band?
I think it was the mid 90s. Like 1996.
Oh, so it's been awhile.
Yes, sometimes hard to keep up the pace after awhile
Well I still think a lot of their songs hold up
Yeah, I think you're right
In My Place still gives me chills.
Yeah, me too
