What do you think of Queen?
Like, the band?
Yeah, obviously like the band.
Sorry! I really like them.
Me too, I think they were ahead of their time.
Agreed! Rest in peace Freddie Mercury.
He was such an amazing artist.
It's so sad he had to die the way he did.
Yeah, luckily he left a giant legacy behind him.
Agreed! I think Queen's music stands the test of time.
What do you mean?
Test of time is when music is popular throughout generations and cultures no matter who they are.
Oh, I see. Yeah definitely they fit in that catagory.
I mean how many people still play Bohemian Rapsody or We Are the Champions?
I do, I know that!
Me too, they are great inspirational songs.
I also like some of their unknown songs, like Bicycle.
Well I wouldn't call it unknown...
Just something that's not the first on someone's playlist.
Exactly.
