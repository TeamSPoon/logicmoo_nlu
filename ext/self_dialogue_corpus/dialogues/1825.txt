Have you watched much football lately?
Yeah I been paying attention to it intently
You like whats going on so far?
The NFL has had a good offseason
Yeah there has been like no arrests
I agree maybe the players are getting better.
Speaking of getting better, how do you like Carson Wentz this year?
He actually has guys to throw to.
Who do you think will be his biggest target?
I think Agoholor will have alot of improvement.
I dont know hes really bad
Yeah but hes going to feed off the competition
I think Torrey Smith is done
Yeah his career went quick.
He might get cut in camp.
I wouldnt be shocked
They already cut Green Beckham
That guy was a waste of talent.
They should be markedly improved over last year
I see it happening
