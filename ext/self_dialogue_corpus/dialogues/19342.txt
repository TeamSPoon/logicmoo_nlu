What's your favorite oldies band?
Hm, I like the Beach Boys. Not sure if you consider them "oldies" though.
Yeah, they are. They are kind of a class above most of the other oldies bands you here.
Agreed. They are a classic pop band, really. What about you?
I'm a huge fan of Buddy Holly.
Me too! He's also kind of in a different class than most other artists from that time.
I think so too.
Do you also lick Richie Valens and the Big Bopper?
Not nearly as much as Buddy Holly. They have a totally different sound than him.
True. What other artists do you like?
Oh, I am a huge Simon and Garfunkel fan.
Paul Simon is a genius.
Yes, both his solo work and his work with Garfunkel are classics.
Did you go to their concert in Central Park?
No, but I have listened to that album a hundred times.
Yes, I love how they sing their classics then do Chuck Berry songs.
They are brilliant. So you are a Paul Simon fan?
Of course! Graceland is one of the best albums I have ever heard from anyone.
I like his album titled "Paul Simon" -- I think his 2nd after he and Garfunkel split.
Oh, that's a good one. I heard him play "Duncan" live a couple years ago.
