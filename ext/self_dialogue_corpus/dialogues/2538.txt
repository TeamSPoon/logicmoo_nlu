Seahawks and Chargers going head to head beginning of Pre-Season.
I saw that. Interesting.
You think it will be a good game?
Well, they both have strong stats nd bot teams pretty much have the same players.
Yup.
An no injuries on either team, the camps look good.
So a game worth watching?
I'm not a fan of either but if they broadcast it after the Tampa/Miami game i'd watch it.
Right on!
I think there will be a little sizzle to that game.
Titans and Jets on Week 1.
Yes, i think the Titans will dominate that game.
You think?
Yes. Titans are looking good in camp play. The Jets..... not so much.
Ah, you have been catching some of the camp play?
Yes, NFL Network is desperate for programming so they will show anything.
HA! So true! Last week they did the Top 10 Players shoes!
That's a riot. Very funny.
You'll know which teams will be performing if they do OT in Pre-Season.
For sure.
