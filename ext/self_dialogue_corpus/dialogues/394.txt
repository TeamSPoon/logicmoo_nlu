Why don't they make a movie about black widow?
Great question! Because you know it would be a hit.
I know it. But at least we get a black panther movie
I'm so excited for It! He's going to be one of my favorite
I'm excited because it has a cast full of black people
And that's so awesome!
And it seems to keep with culture
And it looks like it's going to have awesome
I wish I could be super hero
That would be super
