What's your favorite Beatles album?
I like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but my favorite has to be the White Album.
Really? I thought that album was a bit of a downer.
Are you kidding? The first time I heard, "While my guitar gently weeps," it absolutely blew me away.
That's not even in the same league as "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
I never really got into that song.
Too bad, that whole album absolutely captivated me for an entire year.
It's really hard to find a bad Beatles album, isn't it?
I know what you mean. I can't imagine how they produced so many epic songs.
Yeah, even the song "Imagine" is the first song you thing of when you hear that word.
