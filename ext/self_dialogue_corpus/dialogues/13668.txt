What did you think of the Force Awakens?
It was pretty good.
Did you realize that it is basically the same story as A New Hope?
Yeah it follows the same basic story.
I think that's what made it so good.
It was okay.
Did you atleast like Kylo Ren?
They did that character really well.
I thought it was cool they had Mark Hamill at the end.
I think the next movie in the series is going to be the best.
