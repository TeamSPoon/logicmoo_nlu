What have you been listening to lately?
I've been feeling a little nostalgic lately, so I've been listening to a lot of singer-song writer stuff that kind of reminds me of home.
Oh I like that kind of music, but I don't listen to much of it! Can you suggest some artists?
Of course! I really like Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver.
I've heard of Bon Iver, but not Sufjan Stevens.
His stuff is amazing! 4th of July is probably my favorite song off of Carrie & Lowell.
Where is he from? Sufjan isn't a name you hear every day
He's from the US! I think he's from Michigan.
Cool, I'll have to check him out. Any other recommendations?
Well, are you interested in music that's not in English?
Yeah, I don't mind! What do you suggest?
I like the band Soy Un Caballo - their name is in Spanish, but I think they're from Belgium, and they sing in French.
Wow, that all sounds awesome. Can you recommend a song?
Definitely listen to Volet. It's really soft and pretty and the singer's voice is really calming.
Awesome! I'll check it out!
Fantastic. Who are you listening to in that genre?
I've been listening to Squalloscope lately! Have you heard of her?
No I haven't! Can you tell me about her?
Yeah! Her music is very moving and emotional and has unique lyrics. Check out their song Bloodbath for Birds or Big Houses.
Will do! She sounds awesome
