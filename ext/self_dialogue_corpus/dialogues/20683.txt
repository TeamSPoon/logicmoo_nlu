I haven't watched any good comedies lately.
Actually I haven't either.
What was your last comedy you watched?
I think it was the old movie called Hot Fuzz.
With Simon Pegg?
Yeah and Nick Frost.
Those two are perfect in movies with each other.
They are.
That's only about ten years old.
Yes, it was on T.V. so I kept it on.
I find a lot of good movies on T.V. too.
Simon Pegg has been in so many comedies.
He has. I'll have to google a list and rewatch some.
Has there been any new ones with him?
I don't know. I'm thinking there was.
He is good in serious roles too.
Yes, he was good in Mission Impossible 6.
I didn't see that one.
Good movie, check it out.
I will.
