You know who never gets enough attention or recognition ?
no, who?
Fiagaro. He is an adorable character.
The cat from Pinocchio?
Yep. He was also in other works by Disney.
I never realized that, like what?
A bunch of Disney short films as Minnie Mouse's pet, replacing Fifi.
Wow they must have liked Figaro, Replacing Fifi seems extreme. Poor Fifi.
Walt disney like Figaro so much he made that choice. Also put him in Disney's House of Mouse.
So maybe you are wrong, he seemed to get a lot of recognition and attention from disney. Just maybe not the public as much.
