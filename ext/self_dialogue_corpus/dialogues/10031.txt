What's your favorite Steven Seagal movie?
On Deadly Ground, and you?
I like Under Siege and Under Siege 2.
Yeah, Under SIege is pretty good, but I've never seen Under Siege 2. What's it like?
Well, Casey Ryback(Steven Seagal) is on a train with his niece, when it is hijacked by terrorists looking to use a top secret particle beam satellite to destory Washington
Okay, I little sci-fi, but doesn't sound to bad. Plenty of action I take it?
Yep, Steven does everything from martial arts to improvised explosives to using a truck to get back on the train after being forced off.
Okay, plenty of action then. Do you have a favorite fight?
Yes, Steven fights one of the top bad guys in a one on one knife fight, takes the knife away, beats the stuffing out of him, then kills him in the kitchen of the dining car.
Okay, I'll be giving this one a look in the future.
