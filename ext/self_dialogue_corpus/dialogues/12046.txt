So what's happening in the Star Wars universe right now?
Well, the original Star Wars story has already passed with the Skywalkers and Darth Vader, and the next generation is being followed.
Who are the next generation of jedis?
Well funny you say that. There are actually no more jedi's. And the new movies are new jedis.
Oh! Return of the Jedi!
Yeah exactly. The new heroine is Reya.
That's a pretty cool name. Is she strong?
Yeah, she found out she had Jedi powers in the first movie.
Does she use her powers for good?
I don't know... You'll have to watch the movie!
