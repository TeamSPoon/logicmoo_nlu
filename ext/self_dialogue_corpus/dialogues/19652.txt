Are you familiar with the music of the band Genesis?
Sort of; i know some of their songs but not many.
Do you know any of their early stuff?
You mean like the song, "turn me on again?"
Actually they were around long before that song.  did you know Peter Gabriel was their original lead singer?
What? I didn't know Peter Gabriel had anything to do with Genesis.
Yes, he was the lead singer for the first six or so albums and then left the band.
Was Genesis very popular when Gabriel was with them?
Only in England.  they didn't become extremely successful anywhere else until Phil Collins took over the vocals.
I always thought Collins was the only lead singer the band ever had.
Well, he was with the band from their third album on; but only as drummer and background singer.  then her took over lead vocals when Gabriel left.
Holy cow; i had no idea.  whey did Gabriel leave? was he fired?
i don't think anyone but the band members know the real story.  it couldn't have been very nasty though, because Gabriel did appear with the band in a reunion tour.
that's interesting.  i guess there wasn't too much bad blood about him leaving, then.
either that or he just couldn't resist the money they were offering him to appear on the tour.
LOL, that's right.  what's your favorite Genesis song?
oh, there are so many but if i had to pick one, it would have to be "Paperlate," from the early 1980s
I remember that song.  it was real catchy.
it sure was and it did real well on the charts.  it's been nice talking to you about this legendary band.
definitely; i appreciate all the knowledge you provided.
