Hey, have you seen the Lion King?
Yes!  That is such an incredible movie.
I know.  My daughter wants to watch it together.
My daughter got really upset by it when the lion died.  It made her cry.
Yeah, that's the only thing I was worried about.  It's still a great movie though.
I would maybe just talk to her about it beforehand so she's prepared.
That's what I was planning to do.
There's actually a sequel to it, did you know that?
No, I had no idea.  What's it called?
I don't remember, but my kids have it.  I haven't seen it.
Oh crazy.  I guess it wasn't as popular as the original.
Yeah I'm not sure it even came out in theatres.
Well, if it's anything like the first one it'd be a great movie.
The supporting characters are hilarious in the Lion King.
Yeah, I know.  It's got a great moral too.
It came out a long time ago, didn't it?
It was sometime in the nineties, yes.
I think the older Disney movies were better than a lot of the new stuff.
Yeah, they were definitely different.
It seems like the digital animation really changed everything.
