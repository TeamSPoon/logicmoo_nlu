it's a crying shame that carr broke his leg last season.
i know right.
i think the raiders could have gone to the super bowl.
me too.
how do you think they will do this season?
i don't think twelve and four but i do think they make the playoffs again.
what are they gonna do with beast mode?
you mean marshawn lynch?
yeah.
that's just another weapon. they should do what they do.
i definitely think they win the division again.
that division is weak. you got the chargers, denver, and the chiefs.
yeah, denver had their turn.
exactly. the chargers might be tough though.
chargers are always tough but last year they couldn't keep a fourth-quarter lead.
yeah so just imagine if they keep them leads this season.
no doubt. they will be tough but i still like my raiders.
i like them too. i need to take a look at their schedule.
yeah, last season that did have some gimmes.
hey, all you can do is play who's on the schedule.
