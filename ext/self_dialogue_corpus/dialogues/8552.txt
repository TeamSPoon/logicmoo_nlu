Sting has a real knack for songwriting.
He used to be an english teacher.
Really, I didn't know that.
His Fields of Gold album was the best.
He has spent alot of his social capital on helping social causes.
Yes, he has done alot of concerts along that line.
What's your favorite Sting song?
I would say Russians.
That's kind of an odd choice.
Yes, but I really like the melody.
