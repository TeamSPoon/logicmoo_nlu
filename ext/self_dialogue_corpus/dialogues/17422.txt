what do you think about Lady GAGA
ummm i think it depends on whitch lady gaga you are talking about
What do you mean witch one there is only one
When i hear Lady gaga i think of 2 you have the bare bones lady gaga who can outsing almost anyone and then you have the gimmick artistwho does stuff just for shock factor
But why would you seperate the two tho artists are allowed to have diffrent sides to them you dont have to be one thing
I separate them because the gimmick one doesnt seem to really be her it seems forced
I think when she first came out she really didnt know what she wanted to be as a pop artist when your young your just trying to find yourself but i dont think it was fake tho
I dont think it was find herself as much as it was created by her team to seperate herself from the other pop acts that was out at that time
you think that was all created by her team
yea i do but that doesnt take away from the fact that she can truely sing to me
did you listen to her Joanne album
yes and i found it to be more of her trueself without all the gimmicks so she must of grew tired of them
Or because thats like her 5th album she just grew up as we all do and change nobody stays the same
regardless it sounds more like her now imagine if that would of been her 1st album do you think she would of blew up like she did
Your asking if her 5th album would of been her 1st would she be as famous as she is now?
Yes that is what im asking
Yes I think she would because she is very talented.
Stop it there is no way there is nothing on that album that would of stood out for the long term it would of flopped
I disagree with that i like that album
No she would of just faded into the backround because joanne sounds nothing like The Fame Monster
