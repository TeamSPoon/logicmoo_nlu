What teams will have the strongest defenses in 2017 in the NFL?
I think the Bengals will stay stout, and the Patriots will be strong. You?
I think that the Dolphins will actually have a great defensive year.
Yes, they need Wake to come back strong.
I agree, his injury last year was unfortunate.
Those type of injuries always are - any type of tear.
I agree - what do you think about the Steelers?
They have always had great defenses, and hopefully will have another great one.
We will see. I'm not so sold this year.
Why do you say that?
Well they have been stagnant for a bit and no longer have their older greats.
Troy Polamalu was a stud.
Yes, him and James Harrison used to be great.
Harrison has always been a mad man.
I think that the Seahawks will have another great season.
I forgot about them - their defense is always amazing.
Yes, I agree. They have great defensive talent every year.
Yes, and their coaching staff is top notch.
I agree with this assessment.
We will see this year who has the best defense.
