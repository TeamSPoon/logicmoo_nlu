Could you suggest a good suspense movie for me to watch?
Sure, Phonebooth is a great thriller.
I do not think I have heard of that film before.
It is really good and it will keep you in suspense throughout the whole thing!
Who are the main stars in it?
Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland are great in it.
I like both of those actors a lot.
If you like intense thrillers, then this is the movie for you!
I think you have convinced Me. Thanks for the suggestion.
No problem at all. I am glad to help out!
