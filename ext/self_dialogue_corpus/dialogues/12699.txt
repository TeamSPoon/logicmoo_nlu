Okay, who was your favorite Star Wars Alien?
Chewbacca, obivously!
Huh, I kind of liked Greedo a little.
What, why. The guy was a loser.
Yeah, but he did have the guts to talk tough to Han Solo.
Yeah, right until Han blasted him.
Yeah, that whole edit of having Greedo shoot first was just dumb.
Yeah, Han's a bit of rogue and Greedo was a slimebag, so why not shoot first?
Plus, the whole last minute shift by Solo looks lousy.
Yeah, but it's not like they could really reshoot the scene with him dodging the shot, now could they?
