Who was your favorite Harry Potter character?
I think Sirius Black was my favorite.
Yeah, he was a good guy.
A good guy? Sirius was fantastic!
I don't know, I thought he was irresponsible and wouldn't have been a good guardian for Harry.
Of course he was irresponsible! He spent all of his adulthood in Azkaban.
But he treated Harry like he was his friend, not his godparent.
I think that's because he thought of Harry like he did James, because they were so similar.
He still was irresponsible as a godfather.
I think Sirius did the best he could, considering his circumstances - his best friend was killed and he was blamed for it!
