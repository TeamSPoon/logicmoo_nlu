What is your favorite band for lyrics?
My favorite band for lyrics has gotta be The Mountain Goats?
Oh really? Why The Mountain Goats?
Their lead singer slash lyricist John Darnielle writes brilliant lyrics.
Can you give me some examples?
He can capture a scene so evocatively. For example, in "This Year" he sings: "I played video games in a drunken haze I was 17 years young / Hurt my knuckles punching the machines, the taste of scotch rich on my tongue."
Okay, so he sings about childhood, what else does he sing about?
He has a lot of fun lyrics about love. From International Small Arms Traffic Blues: "Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania / Trucks loaded down with weapon, crossing over every night, moon yellow and bright / there is a shortage in the blood supply, but there is no shortage of blood."
Definitely not your typical pop song lyrics.
Not at all. His lyrics are super unique, he actually recently wrote a novel.
Oh yeah, what was it called and what's it about?
The book is called Wolf in a White Van and it's by John Darnielle, who is essentially The Mountain Goats. I don't want to spoil too much about it, but it's about an isolated man named Sean Phillips.
Hmmm, that's really interesting that he wrote a whole novel. Okay, so what Mountain Goats album should I start with?
Well, there are two main periods for the Mountain Goats. There is the lo-fi period and the hi-fi period.
Let me guess, the lo-fi period is recorded cheaply and the hi-fi period is not.
Yes, that's essentially it. The hi-fi period also has more intricate arrangements.
Which period is better?
They both have some really great stuff, it's hard to say.
Okay, can you recommend me an album from each of the periods?
Sure, from the hi-fi period you should check out The Sunset Tree. From the lo-fi period you should listen to All Hail West Texas.
