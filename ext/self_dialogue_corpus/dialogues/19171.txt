What kind of music do you listen to?
A little bit of everything, why?
Everything?
Well, maybe not polka!
Haha, good one!
What about you?
I actually really like all kinds of music too, but country is definitely my favorite.
I don't know a lot of country music actually.
Have you watched The Voice?
I've seen a few episodes here and there, why?
Well Blake Shelton is one of the hottest country artists of today.
Oh yeah! I know who he is, just never heard any of his music.
Do you like music with a lot of passion and emotion?
Yeah, definitely.
I think you could really get into country music.
I think you're right.
I think I might actually have a mixed CD of some of my favorite artists in my car, let me check.
Cool!
Yeah, I do!
Awesome! I'll get it back to you as soon as I listen to it all.
