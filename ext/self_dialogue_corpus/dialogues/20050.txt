Did you see the new Guardians movie?
No, I have not yet did you like it?
Yes, it was amazing. Really brought him into the Marvel universe.
Really? Don't you think that marvel universe, as far as movies go, is got out of hand.
No, It a huge franchise.I mean look at the whole Xmen set of movies, you like them right?
I liked the first xmen movies.The older ones not the new ones.
You did not like the Days of Future past?
I did not, it was too pushed and kind of silly. I am into the Avengers though.
All the stand alone ones or just the Avengers movies?
I liked them all.The Avengers and their adventures, what is you favorite?
I have to go with the second Avengers, how about you?
Oh man. No way, Avengers the first one always the best.
Really? Did you like they way the action was sequenced in that one?
I did. I thought it was a bit over the top sometimes, but the actin matched the story line well.
Oh, no I like a lot of action. I mean come on , hulk was like a baby in most of the first one.
Yeah, but he was on purpose. You think they will make him more wild in the new Thor?
I sure hope so. I am looking forward to seeing the new Thor.
I am too. I heard it is supposed to be really dark.
I did not hear that. Maybe they will lighten it up, like the first Captain America movie.
I hope so, that one got dark in the second movie as well.
