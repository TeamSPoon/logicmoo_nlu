Were The Beatles from Germany?
No, they were from England.
Oh, that makes so much more sense. They kind of have a British accent.
Yeah, they do. Do you like them?
Yes, my dad was playing them in the car the other day and now I'm really into them.
You've got a dad with a good taste in music.
He's a pretty good dad all around but yeah, I definitely approve of his musical taste.
What other music does he listen to?
Mainly just the oldies. Simon and Garfunkle, Billy Joel, Frank Sinatra, to name a few.
Those are really good artists!
I'm just now I'm realizing that. I never really gave them a chance before.
I feel that all of our musical tastes shift as we grow older.
I would definitely have to agree. I used to love Miley Cyrus and now whenever I hear her sing, I don't understand why.
The same thing happened to me with the Jonas Brothers.
Yeah, I used to be obsessed with them too. I don't really like them anymore but I still really love "When You Look Me in the Eyes."
I actually want that to be my wedding song.
Really? I haven't really put any thought into what I want my wedding song to be.
I want either that song or "A Thousand Years" by Christina Perri.
That's a good one!
Yeah, it's one of my all time favorite songs and I think it would be just perfect for a wedding.
