Have you seen Fate of the Furious yet?
I am planning on going to watch it this weekend with my family.
I won't spoil anything, but I think you're in for a pleasant surprise.
I take it that means that you liked it.
I liked it a lot.
Alright, well I'll go in with good expectations.
If you liked the last 3, you'll definitely love this one.
That just got me excited.
Which of the last 3 was your favorite?
Fast Five without a doubt.
