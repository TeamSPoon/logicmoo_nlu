Have you seen all the trailers for the new Mummy movie?
Yea, the one with Tom Cruise?
Yep, the trailers actually make it look alright, even though I know it will be terrible.
Did you ever see that accidentally released trailer where the sound was messed up.
I do not think so.
The studio messed up and uploaded an unfinished trailer for the movie.
Unfinished in what way?
There was no sound for a lot of it and random voices and noises.
Like they messed up the audio track for it?
Yea, the video was edited fine, in fact most of it is what you see on TV now.
That is pretty funny, someone probably got fired for that.
You should check it out, the sounds make it so funny.
I will, did you ever watch the original?
The Mummy with Brendan Fraser?
Yea, from around 2000 or so.
Yea, I have seen it, it was terrible.
I guess you won't be watching the new one then?
Definitely not, it's not for me.
For sure, I was going to see if you wanted to come watch it but I guess not.
Yea, thanks for the invite though.
