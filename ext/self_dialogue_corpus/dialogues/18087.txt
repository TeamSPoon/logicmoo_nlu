What do you think of Michael Jackson?
Awesome artist for the ages.
Yeah he definitely was the king of pop.
Not many artist can be mentioned in the same breath as him.
Do you have a favorite Michael Jackson song?
Oh i have a bunch, it would take a while to list them all.
I would have to say mine are the classics like Thriller and Beat it.
Word, you can't go wrong with the classics they are timeless.
I remember hearing them play on the radio or on Mtv when i was a kid.
I remember my mom blasting Michael while cleaning the house on the weekend.
Do you think there is anyone that comes close?
Definitely not, but a lot of artist draw inspiration from his music.
Yeah that's tru, you could see it in the way they perform.
I like Neyo and he openly tells people that Michael Jackson is his inspiration in most of his music and dance moves.
Neyo is great, so fun to listen to.
You could see and hear a little bit of Michael in him.
He also sounds like he is influenced by Prince on some songs.
Yeah that's true. Don't even get me started about Prince!
It sucks that the great ones die to earlier.
Very true, rest in peace to both of them.
