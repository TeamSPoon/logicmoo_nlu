I went to the mall the other day, and stopped into the music store.
Did you find anything good to take home?
Well, I did find a Michael Jackson collection of his songs on sale.
Was it expensive?
Yes it was.   Even on sale , some of these collections can be pricey.
What are some of your favorite Michael Jackson songs?
Bad, We Are the World, I Just Can't Stop Loving You are some of my favorites.
Man in the Mirror is my favorite , as well as Bad.
They had a $5 coupon off the collection price, so I bought it.
I like to go into Barnes and Noble music section to find new music too.
Do you have any of Michael's music albums?
I have Bad, Xscape, and One Night in Japan.
Dangerous was won of my favorites that he had out.
Yes , I don't know how many awards he had over his lifetime, but it was amazing his career.
It spanned decades.
I wonder if his children have any talent like he had.
I have not seen any of them take up music much yet.
We will see, they are quite young as of yet.
Michael will be missed.
Yes, forever.
