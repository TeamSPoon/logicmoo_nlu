I heard Mulan was getting remade into a Live Action movie.
Oh yeah, When?
I believe 2018.
2018? That seems rather far away.
Yeah, but we should go see it. I love Mulan.
That sounds good. I'm interested in seeing it in theaters.
I don't think I've ever seen a Disney film in theaters before.
Never?
Not that I can recall. I don't usually go to movie releases in theaters.
Oh, then we're definitely going. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
