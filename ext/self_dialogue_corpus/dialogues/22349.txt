Whats that movie with the boy who makes the rockets?
Rocket man?
No its about a boy who builds rockets for a contest and his dad is a coal miner.
Oh, October Sky! I love that movie.
Thats the one, did you know Jake Gyllenhaa is the brother of Maggie Gyllenhaal?
Really? Which movies is she in?
She was Rachel Dawes, Batmans girlfriend.
Ah, thats right. "WHERE'S RACHEL?!"
I didn't realize those two were related until recently. Its so odd how common it is for families to be involved in film.
Yeah, it must have to do with the genes. If you have the good looks and that magic presence on screen its most likely in your family I suppose.
Yea I think there are some other prominent cases of that as well.
Julia and Eric Roberts, there is another brother sister duo.
Or Joan and John Cusack.
I wonder how their relationship is with each other once they become famous?
Like is there a fight or competition between them over who is more famous?
I bet there is, in the very least it has to be awkward when they see each other.
I don't think so, I think they probably get a long fine. After all they probably grew up together.
Thats a good point, I still think it would be a lot of awkward pressure if you were getting big film jobs but your sibling wasn't.
Well in that case you better stay on good terms with your brother or sister and hope they can get you some movie roles if they become famous.
That's what I would do, I would have no problem helping out family.
