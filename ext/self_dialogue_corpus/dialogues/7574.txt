The first movie seems very kid-friendly to me.
Well, you have to remember that the movies got darker as they went along.
Why's that?
The readers got older.  By the time they got to the end, they'd been at Hogwarts six years I think.
Guess that's true.  Still, it seemed too happy of a movie to me.
He defeated that Voldemort-thingy in the guy's head. Who wouldn't be happy?
But he really didn't defeat him, he just came back again.
Yeah, but Harry didn't know that.  He did what he had to.
It always seemed weird how Voldemort keep coming back.
Would have been hard making more movies if he didn't.
