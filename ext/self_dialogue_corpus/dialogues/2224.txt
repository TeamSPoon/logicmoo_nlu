How long can the Patriots keep their dynasty going?
I think they can keep going for a bit yet, they have the best QB possibly ever, and a great back up QB.  They have the best coach and many of the same players
what do you think about teams drafting a QB as one of the top picks in the first round in the NFL draft?
I think they're fools.   Most of those picks wind up as duds, and meanwhile theyre passing up highly talented position playerswqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq
DO you buy into the safety debate, about concussions?
I think that stuff is real, but players for the most part know what they are getting themselves into.
The NFL is more interactive than ever before, thats one reason why I love it
What do you mean?
OK you have fantasy football, then you can interact with all the players on apps like twitter and see the games from periscope. So many more examples too
Thats a good point I never really thought about that, much different from just watching on your couch in the 1980's.
So what do you think is the future of the NFL?
I think it keep growing big time.  I am excited to see how the expansion team into Vegas works out.
I would love to go see a game when I am out in Vegas, that is very cool that a team is moving into that market
Vegas has been a big player in the NFLs popularity also with people being able to bet on the games, especially the superbowl
College ball has also become super popular I think because of the NFL
Yes students want to follow teams to see if any of those players could make it into the NFL and become stars and be able to say, yeah I used to watch him play at my school
Actually several businesses have flourished on the back of the NFL, like Sunday sports bars such as BW3's everyone wants to watch the games in public with their friends
Nothing goes better with NFL games than wings and beer.
How many games do you think you will go to this year?
well with the cost being so high i'd say I will feel pretty lucky if I can get up to one game
