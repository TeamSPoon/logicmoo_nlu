Know what's an under-rated superhero movie? The Crow.
With Brandon Lee, who died?
Yes, that one.
Sorry, it's not a superhero movie.
Why not?
It's a haunting or horror movie. He's dead and brought back to life and is now invincible.
So? He has powers.
Not really. He just kicks butt after being revived. I don't think that counts.
I think it does. It's listed as a superhero movie.
I prefer action-horror thriller. It's definitely good, but superhero? No. It's revenge.
