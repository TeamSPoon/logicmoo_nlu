Kelly did Akon at one time signed Lady Gaga on his Konvict music label.
oh yes gaga started as a Konvict music artist before she was signed unto Sony music.
because a closer listen to her debut single "poker face" has that Konvict signature tune at the beginning.
yes when she did "poker face" she was still with Konvict Music hence the reason the Konvict signature tune was sampled.
Sony did a good job with her though.
well i would rather say lady gaga did a good job for Sony Music because she was dropping hit songs after hit songs and Sony don't need to promo much as songs are instant hot from first week.
my all time lady gaga song was "alehandro" although the song had so many controversy.
lady gaga has  always been controversial, from her style of dressing, her videos, you name it lol
that's true though there is always something to watch out for when she's performing.
she really put her best when it comes to live performance,her choreography, down to stage management is just superb.
