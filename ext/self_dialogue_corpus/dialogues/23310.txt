What do you want to talk about?
What about movies?
That sounds good, I like movies.
Great
Do you have any favorites?
My all time favorite is Dirty Dancing
Oh hats a good one
It's a timeless, classic.
It definitely is, I can't believe they tried to remake it
Meeither, did you see it?
Yes, did you?
Yes it was awful
I agree, the agrees they had play baby was horrible.
She looked so uncomfortable and awkward.
Exactly, and Noone can touch Patrick Swayze.
Nope, they casting was horrible in that movie.
It sure was.
Nothing can compare to a classic though
Especially if that classic is dirty dancing.
Best movie ever.
