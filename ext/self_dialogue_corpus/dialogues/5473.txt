I woke up this morning and on TV was the Disney movie "The Incredibles"!
I love that movie!
Me too.  Might be my favorite Pixar Disney movie!  I love the story and the animation!
Sometimes I feel like retired Mr Incredible.
Me to.  At least we don't have to worry about a evil villain chasing us.
I don' t know. My boss can be that guy sometimes!
I think anyone can relate to that.
Did you know there is a 2nd Incredibles coming out soon?
I had read that on the internet.
A whole generation will have grown up almost before the 2nd one came out!
