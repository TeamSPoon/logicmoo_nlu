Katy Perry is so beautiful!
She is! She is like the perfect person to be a pop star!
Do you listen to her music?
Yes I do!
What's your favorite song by Katy?
I'm really into "Roar".
Yeah, that's a pretty cool one. Katy is cool period!
I'd like to see her and Ariana Grande make a song together.
Heck yes, me too! Ari would make a perfect duo with Katy!
They're both the queens of pop at the moment!
