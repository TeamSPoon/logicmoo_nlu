Probably Baze's gun to be honest. That thing was incredible.
Yeah it had no kick and was a straight shooter.
Yeah I'm surprised they didn't use it more often.

What's the theory?
Well apparently some people speculate that they are actually in a relationship.
Yeah their mannerisms suggested that they were very close or more than close friends.
Yeah in an interview the director said the Star Wars universe is very open and there are many different types of people.
I'm glad that they're progressive.
