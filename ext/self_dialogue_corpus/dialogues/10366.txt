What was that movie about that cellist genius?
Um. That's so descriptive. Was it a documentary? About Yoyo Ma?
No it was, um.. about this black guy.
That's not exactly the usual racial profile of a cellist
That sounds racist, but whatever. Anyway this dude was like a genius or something.
I think I know. But I'll let you remember if you can. Can you, you know, remember things?
of course I can. it's right at the tip of my tongue...
The... cellists... play... what?
What? Cello... No, that's not what I mean.
No I mean, the cellist play solo music?
Yes of course.
So... it stands to say that a cellist can be a what?
Doh!. The Soloist! That's the movie.
Ding Ding Ding. Yes. With Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Ayers
That's the genius dude! Ayers. Apparently he goes crazy while in music school or something.
Well, he was attending Julliard as a double bassist And then he had to be institutionalized. treated with electroconovulsive therapy etc.
Those will mess you up more than help you.
So he wasn't really a genius, talented yes, but a genius? Hardly.
But anyway the movie was pretty good.
i thought it was ok. Not that great. but the problem of gifted people with mental illnesses is quite interesting. Like, are they more prone to mental illnesses? Why do artists commit suicides at so much higher rate than the general public? It's interesting to say the least.
