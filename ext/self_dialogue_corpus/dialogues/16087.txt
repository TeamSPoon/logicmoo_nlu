Have you ever heard of Flying Lotus?
I've heard of him but haven't heard his music.
It's so creative.
Is he a singer?
No, he really just makes beautiful instrumentals. Sometimes there's vocals.
Oh that's awesome. Instrumentals are getting more and more popular.
He uses a lot of samples from original vinyl.
That's awesome and really creative.
The music kind of sounds like Glass Animals.
I love their song "Gooey".
They've had so many good songs this year.
Yeah I actually like almost everything they release.
The vocalist is my favorite part.
Definitely, he has such a unique voice.
They always release really cool visuals with their music.
I know, that video for "Gooey" is wild.
On top of that they release new music all the time.
If you like them, you should check out Doja Cat. She's like the female version of Glass Animals.
That sounds great. Any song I should check out from her?
She just released one called "Spoiled" and it's great.
