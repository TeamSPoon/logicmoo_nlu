So my better half is obsessed with the movie Knight and Day.
That's the one with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in it, right?
Yes, that's the one.
It is a good movie.
It is. When she has it on i will watch it.
I know you girlfriend loves it, what do you like about it?
Well, it's a Tom Cruise action film but it is different from his others.
Like the Mission Impossible or Jack Reacher series?
Yes, he brings a couple of elements from both but it is it's own vehicle.
That's what i originally thought. Chick Flick meets Mission Impossible.
Ha ha, Yes, that would be a good analogy.
I'm suprised they didnt do a sequel of it.
They may. I know there were a couple of copycat movies like it.
Oh, like Killers.
Yes, that had Asthon Kushner and Katherene Heigl in it.
Yeah, that was ok but not as good as Knight and Day.
True. It didnt grab me as much as Knight and Day did.
it had it's moments.
Well, Killers had a 75 million dollar budget and Knight and Day had a 117 million dollr budget so that may had been a issue.
Well, still when you are in the price range you can get some good dialog and action.
