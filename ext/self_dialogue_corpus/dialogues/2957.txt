You know the NFL has been around for almost 100 years?
Wow, really?
Yep, formed in 1920.
So in 2020 it's 100 years!
Yep, isn't that amazing?
Yeah, although it makes sense cause it feels like the NFL has always been around.
I mean, it has for us!
I wonder what the first games were like.
Probably different in what they are now, but with the same rules.
Nah, I feel like rules would change as time goes on.
Why do you think that?
Well, birth of technology, emergence of illegal tactics....
Oh yeah, like steriods.
Exactly, I'm sure the game has evolved a lot.
And the teams!
I would've loved to watch a game in it's first season.
Me too, and the first Superbowl!
I wonder if any videos survive of it.
Probably, I know a lot of pictures probably are saved.
Now I'm just gonna look at a bunch of them!
