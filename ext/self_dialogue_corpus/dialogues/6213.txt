Which is objectively the best Disney movie, Beauty and the Beast or Mary Poppins?
...Oooooh, we're going to be here a while.
Well one got terrible sequels and a useless remake, while the other's getting a needless sequel that may or may not be terrible.
Hey, Lin-Manuel's doing the music, I'm cautiously optimistic.
That is fair.
Also I'm against judging based on supplementary materials, let's just look at these as stand-alones.
Okay, what are some negatives about these two, since I couldn't find any.
Uh...you could interpret Beauty as being about Stockholm Syndrome and it's better as is without Human Again, whereas Mary Poppins has Dick Van Dyke's bad cockney accent.
...I'm thinking Beauty and the Beast wins, though I could also be saying that because I have a bias in favor of animation.
Yeah, I think Mary Poppins might be objectively better. I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.
