So do you like Bruno Mars?
That depends on what you mean by that.
What do you mean?
Well, I like a lot of his old songs, but I really don't like any of his new pieces.
Really? You don't like 24K?
Honestly I find that one super annoying.
But the beat is so good!
I guess, I just think the lyrics are obnoxious.
Well, what about That's What I Like?
I like it better than 24K, but I still think it's kind of obnoxious.
Do you not like confidence or something?
I do, but there's confidence and there's arrogance, you know?
I guess. What of his old music do you like?
I'm a big fan of When I was Your Man.
Ah, you like slower songs.
That, and also I think it's just a better piece of music.
It does have a good melody, I suppose.
Oh! And of course, I like Just the Way You Are.
Well, at least we agree on something I guess!
Haha, sorry, I guess he's just not my favourite.
