Hey Bill, wanna catch the Falcons pre season game next weekend?
That'd be great what time
Starts at 4
Do you wanna tail gate
You bet what should I bring
The usual, FOOD
Can I bring my wife?
Sure if she likes our rowdy crowd LOL
She loves going to games with me.  She'll bring her hot sister too
Hey there.  I'd like that even better if she's a Falcons fan
She IS..She lives in Atlanta.
Super.  I have great seats for us
Do you think we have room for any more people
Yes, I've got 10 tickets so ask around
Do you think it'll be a good season this year
Hard to say right now, that's why we're going to this preseason game
Hope so, would love another Super Bowl game!
Me too pal,  See you soon
I'll call you in a couple of days
later dude.
