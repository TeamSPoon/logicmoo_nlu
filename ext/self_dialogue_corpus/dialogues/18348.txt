Are you a fan of Sublime?
I like a few of there songs but some I really cannot stand.
Like what, surely you are a fan of Smoke Two Joints.
Yeah, I love that song and have smoked two joints to it on several occasions.
So how do you feel about Modest Mouse?
I like them but the lead sinder Issac Brocks' voice and get annoying after a while of listening.
Do you know of Gogol Bordello?
No, who is that?
They are a punk gypsy band from New York's immigrant diaspora. It is strange and includes a variety instruments that are not usually used.
That sounds like a very bazaar band. They sound kind of russian.
Oh my god, are you aware of the band Iron & Wine?
Yes I have herd of them and I just love the acoustic indie style they encompass.
Some of the greatest music I have ever listened to is some of the most simplistic.
Sure I get that, I would actually say that Iron & Wine is a great example of that.
Do you ever go to live music shows or music festivals?
Sure I have been to a few in the past but not in a few years.
What sort of performances have you seen in the past?
Well I went to Outside Lands in San Francisco a couple times and that was great also I have attended The Blue Grass Festival in Norther California.
Those both sound like a lot of fun but also wildly different. Did you have a favorite?
I really liked Outside Lands primarily because of the venue and there where some fantastic bands like MIA and Tenacious D
