Are you bored of the NBA product?
I mean I like seeing dominance
So you dont mind seeing the same teams win?
Not at all, I can appreciate greatness
Well do you see that as bad for the league?
No it helps gravitate people to the game
Think itll be fun to see those teams go down?
Yes itll be nice to see the next generation.
Do you think it will be the Sixers
I would bet on them to be the next big thing
Will Brett Brown be coaching them?
Yes he is a very good coach
And who will there star be
I can see Embiid not being that guy
Because of his health?
Yeah he cannot stay healthy.
So then what do you think will be their star?
Simmons is going to light things up
I think itll be Saric
He will be good too just not as good as Ben
