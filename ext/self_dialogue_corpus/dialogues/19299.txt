Did you know that Hall and Oates played in Boston last night?
I love them so much did you go?
I did go it was at Boston Garden.
Was it amazing?
It was so good, they played all of the old songs that reminded me of high school.
I wish I could have gone to see them.
My favorite song was Your Kiss is on My Lips
That is a great song and really reminds me of when I was younger.
It reminds me of that too, I ended up knowing all of the songs.
I bet your were singing during the whole show.
I was I couldn't stop singing the whole night.
Was there another act playing as well.
There was it was Tears for Fears
I really like Tears for Fears too.
I wasn't as familiar with their music as Hall and Oates but they were great too.
I used to listen to them a lot when I was younger.
Now that I have seen them live I want to download some of their music.
You should they are great.
I always find it inspiring when bands have been together for so long.
I agree, lucky you that you got to see that cool show.
