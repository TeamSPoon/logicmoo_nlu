I'm so exited that Spider-Man finally is joining with the rest of the Marvel Universe.
Yeah, why did it take so long?
Sony owned Spider-Man and Marvel the rest.
Oh. They finally got it worked out, huh?
Yeah, they made a deal.
What kind of deal?
Well, Sony still owns Spidey, but now they are collaborating.
I heard Iron Man will be in Homecoming.
Yessiree!
I'm so excited!
