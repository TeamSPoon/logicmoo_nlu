Lauren Conrad just released a new line of clothes.
Saw that, I wonder if she will dip her toes into maternity clothes now that she is pregnant?
I bet she will. She seems really down to earth and her designs reflect that.
What's the name of her line again?
I think it's just LC Lauren Conrad
I just love the soft, flowing dresses she has out. I saw one at Kohls.
Me too! Did you happen to see how much it was?
It was more than $100 unfortunately.
Really? Most of her designs are pretty reasonable from what I've seen.
I think her fashion sense is no chic and beautiful
I agree! And very feminine.
Her jewelry is also really attractive. Very simple and elegant.
Have you seen some of her rings? They are to die for!
They are gorgeous but of course beyond my budget!
I did see a few tree-themed necklaces that were reasonable.
Oh? That sounds beautiful! Her bracelets are great, too.
Did you ever watch Lauren on "The Hills?"
All the time. Her fashion sense has evolved since then. But she has always been so chic.
I agree. I love how her line is designed for a simple girl.
Even though she has money! Love it!
