What do you think of It Ain't Me by Kygo?
The music video doesn't match the lyrics.
I haven't seen it. Why don't they fit?
It's about her NOT caring for the guy when he makes stupid mistakes.
Okay, and?
The video is him in a motorcycle accident.
That makes no sense.
Agreed.
I just looked it up and apparently it came out in 2006?
But it's in current top 40? Weird.
