Who's the best lead singer for Val Halen?
Is that even really a question?
I think it is.
It's obviously David Lee Roth.
Based on what?
Because he's the original guy who set the tone for their whole career.
But Sammy has a better tone and voice that David.
Maybe, but there's more that just vocal talent involved here.
Really, like what?
Like personality and charisma.
I think Sammy wins there too.
I disagree, look who sang the biggest hits.
Sure, but Sammy had some big ones too.
Those may have never happened without David leading the way earlier.
David really didn't lead them, he depended totally on the brothers.
But he had solo hits too.
That never would have happened without his stint with Val Halen.
At least we agree that the best wasn't that other guy.
I'm still trying to forget about him.
Truth, we agree again.
