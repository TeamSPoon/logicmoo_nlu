I just saw Fast & Furious 6.
What did you think?
I thought it was really good!
Me too!  What did you like most about it?
I really liked the set and how amazing it looked against the racing cars.
Yeah that was really cool.  They really outdid themselves with the special effects this time.
I also really liked the addition of Luke Evans and his character.
He really added to the plot being the mastermind of the mercernaries.
Yeah it was crazy. I'm glad you told me to watch it.
You're welcome!
