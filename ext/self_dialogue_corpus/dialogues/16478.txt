What have you been listening to recently?
Lots of instrumental stuff. I don't like hearing lyrics when I'm working or reading.
Oh yeah? Anything you'd recommend?
I've been listening to this guy who goes by Rival Consoles a lot.
Never heard of him.
I hadn't either until recently; he popped up randomly as a Spotify recommendation.
Gotta love those Spotify recommendations!
Heck yeah! So anyway, Rival Consoles is cool if you're into instrumental electronic stuff that's kind of dark and not super 'dancey'.
Sounds like it'd be right up my alley.
Yeah, I think you'd dig it.
Anything else? Maybe something a little heavier?
Oh yeah, Blanck Mass' album came out a few months ago, and it is intense.
Dude, I loved Blanck Mass' last one. He has a new one out?
Yeah, came out in March, I think.
So many good albums came out in March, I guess I just missed it.
What was your favorite thing that came out in March
Probably the new Real Estate album.
That was a good one.
I know it's kind of just Real Estate doing what they do, but I dig it.
I feel you; me too man.
