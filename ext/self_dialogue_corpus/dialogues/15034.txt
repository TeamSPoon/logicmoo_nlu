Have you ever seen Fargo?
No. What is that?
It is a comedy, but it is a black comedy.
Black comedy movies are great. They really make you think.
They do. The Coen Brothers directed it.
Wow! They made so many great movies!
They do. Some of their usual actors are in it too.
Awesome! So why is it a dark comedy?
It is funny, but there are murders that happen in it.
That is scary. I will have to check this out though!
