What do you think is the best guitar rock album?
It might be sacrilegious to not pick an album that is blues heavy, but the post-punk album "Marquee Moon" by Television is the best.
Why's that?
The band has two guitar players and their riffs connect, break apart, interrupt, rise, fall, build in ways that are so perfect.
Yeah, I really like the few songs I know by them. Marquee Moon, the title track, has one of my favorite solos of all time.
At that time, I think their sound was with little precedent.
Yeah, Marquee Moon is from 1977 if I'm not mistaken.
Yup! It's so epic and fresh even to this day.
And it's not super showy. They weren't like "rock star" types.
For sure, on the album cover for Marquee Moon they look emaciated and awkward.
I won't put down their looks too much, but it suffices to say they don't look like showy rock stars.
But they do play like rock stars. Such distinct style and flare.
Yeah, their influence crops up everywhere.
I'm thinking of The Strokes, for sure, but their influence is generally all over alternative rock.
Not Creed.
That goes without saying! Their fingerprints are all over artsy, post-punk influence alternative rock.
The Pixies too!
Yeah, and The Pixies in turn influenced everyone, including Nirvana!
Right on. Do you have any suggestions for bands that I might like if I like Television.
Check out Richard Hell.
