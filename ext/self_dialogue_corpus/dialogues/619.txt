Are you ready for some football???
Yes, I am so ready.
I know what you mean, summer drags on.
I agree so ready for football season and the fall to get here.
Who do you think will be the surprise team this year?
I am not sure, but we know there always is that one team that surprises.
I agree.  I am going to go out and say the Browns will make the playoffs!
Really?  No way I can't believe that.
Why not, it would be great if the go from worst to first.
Okay, but I still don't see them doing very well.
Well, we shall see but I called it first.  Browns in the playoffs!
Yeah sure whatever.
Okay, so who is your surprise team then?
I think the Tennessee Titans will surprise and make the playoffs
Well I guess you could be right. They do appear to be on the rise.
Yes, I think they are with Mariotta and all coming into his prime a bit.
Yes, I forgot about him, I agree they might just make the playoffs.
Actually I think they will go so far as to make the AFC championship at least.
Really?  I can't see that at all.
Okay, well we will see.  At least a better choice then the Browns you chose!
