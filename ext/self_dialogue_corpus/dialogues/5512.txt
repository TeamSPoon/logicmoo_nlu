What's you favorite Toy Story movie?
I think each has it's good points.
Yeah, the first was groundbreaking. Our first look at 3-D animation.
I was spellbound when I first saw it.
The second is such a joy, especially because sequels are usually bad.
Toy Story 2 was almost better than the first.
Seeing the relationships develop and following the story of Woody and Buzz was great.
You're not lying!
And let's not forget the songs!
Randy Newman is extremely talented.
