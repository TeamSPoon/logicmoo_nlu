Action films have violence and strong heroes, while thrillers have suspense and innocents in jeopardy. Is Taken action or suspense?
That's easy. All three Taken movies are both; they are action thrillers.
I get you. They're action movies with a strong hero, Liam Neeson as the dad--
Yes. And thrillers with a vulnerable innocent, Maggie Grace, as his estranged daughter Kim.
Then there are the villains, the evil human traffickers. Unfortunately, the films stereotyped these villains terribly.
They did, and it's jarring. On the other hand, there is the action movie element of beautiful scenery in foreign lands--
Mixed with the thriller element of tight, dark, threatening scenes.
The action hero shows near superhuman fighting skills--
While the thriller lead endures unbelievable torment without giving in.
Of course. It's an action thriller.
