What is a good comedy by the Coen Brothers?
There are plenty but I like Burn After Reading the most.
You like that more than The Big Lebowski?
I do. The Big Lebowski is a classic but burn after reading is smarter in my opinion.
Interesting. I might have to check that out again.
I would for sure. Do you like Brad Pitt?
He is great. I loved him in Fight Club.
Fight Club is great but this character is different.
What is different about him in this movie?
He plays a clumsy character who does stupid things.
