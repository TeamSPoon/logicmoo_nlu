EJ just got picked by the Bills.
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
I can't imagine.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
They got EJ for 6 years.
Wait, Manuel is going to be stuck with the Bills for six years?
That's what they signed him for.
Ej's not evne that bad. Six years with the Bills is more of a punishment.
He is young enough that he can still come out on top.
That's true, but I still think they overpaid for him.
I was thinking that too, but he's all the Bill's got
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
They probably just wanted to get the ticket sales. Buffalo doesn't really support the Bills that way you think they would.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
