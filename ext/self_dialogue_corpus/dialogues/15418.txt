What are some of your favorite Motown songs?
Oh, my gosh I don't know I really like so many of them. Let's see I really like "I Second that Emotion" by the Supremes.
Me too. I love "Get Ready" by The Temptations.
I love the Temptation song "Ball of Confusion". I really like Diana Ross too.
Yes, she had a lot of great songs.
Love Hangover, Someday We'll Be Together, and Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand.
Those were great songs, but let's not forget The Four Tops and their song, "It's The Same Old Song".
I love Motown music. It is music that you want to sing with.
Feel good music as I call it.
That is for sure. It will always put me in a good mood.
The "Marvelettes" had so many songs with Motown.in the sixties.
What songs did they have?
"The Hunter Gets Captured, Don't Mess With Bill, and Please Mr. Postman"
Those are some good songs. I really like "Please Mr. Postman".
Me too. Wait, wait, wait Mr. Postman. Ha ha.
The good old days when sometimes you got a nice letter in the mail, now all I get is bills.
Bills and junk mail. I used to get Christmas Cards. Now days everyone thinks if they post Merry Christmas of Facebook it is good enough.
Manners seem to be a thing of the past.
Yeah, it's a good thing music is forever.
Good music like the one's from Motown.
