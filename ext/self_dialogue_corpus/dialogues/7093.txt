Have you seen the new live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
Not yet. Have you?
Yes, I saw it last weekend with my friends.
How was it?
I loved it! Emma Watson was fantastic as Belle.
She is such a great actress. Who played the Beast?
Dan Stevens. He was really good too.
I will have to make plans to go see it soon.
You really should! I highly recommend it to everyone.
Thanks for the tip. I think I will buy tickets to Beauty and the Beast for this coming weekend.
