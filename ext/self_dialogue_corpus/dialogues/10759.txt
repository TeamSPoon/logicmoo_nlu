What did you think of Fate of the Furious?
I thought it was alright, it was not going to be the same without Paul.
Yea, he was such a major part of the franchise.
It just feels off without him.
The rest of the cast were pretty good though.
Yea, definitely.  Charlize Theron was great.
I did also kind of miss Brewster though.
Yea, it seems strange that they wrote her out of the series.
I wonder if she wanted out or if the writers just felt it needed to be done.
I would guess she did not want to do any more.
