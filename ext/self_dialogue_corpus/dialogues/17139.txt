not too much
you should give them a shot
what bands?
i like vixxx
my ex girlfriend loved vixx

chained up a lot
i like that song a lot actually
it was okay
kpop is kinda manufactured though
yeah, its just like boybands here
its all fake

well, they probably are
they forced themselves to like each other
you kinda have to if you make that big money
gotta make sacrifices
you def do with everything
