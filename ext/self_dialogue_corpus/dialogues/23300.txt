What is a good movie to buy for my Dad for Fathers Day?
Does he like westerns or actions?
Both, I think. Probably westerns more.
Well you could look for some old classics with John Wayne.
I'd like to get him something he hasn't seen.
How about Tombstone, did he ever see that?
I don't know. I'll have to try to hint around.
Just ask him if he ever saw the cowboy movie with Kurt Russell.
Thats a good idea.
I think he would like a movie about Wyatt Earp.
Theres a lot of good actors in that.
Yes. Val Kilmer and Powers Boothe are both good.
You also have Sam Elliott.
He just looks like a cowboy.
He does. A good actor and distinctive voice.
Charlton Heston is also in it.
Well he knows him. Yes that's a good pick for Dad.
I'll try to think of another.
No, I think Tombstone is what I'll go with.
It is from the ninetees but he didn't watch a lot of movies back then.
