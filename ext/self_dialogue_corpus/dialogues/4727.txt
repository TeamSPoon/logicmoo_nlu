Afternoon.
Hi.
What's happening?
Not much, you?
Same.  Are you a fan of baseball?
Yeah sure am.  You?
Yep, like baseball.
Did you ever play?
I played a little bit when I was a kid.  You?
Yeah I played up until high school.
Oh cool, you must have been good.
I was okay, but I grew up in a small town.
Oh I see.
Yeah there wasn't a big talent pool to choose from.
Do you watch a lot of baseball?
Yeah some, I'll catch a few games now and then.
Yeah I'm the say way.
Hard to catch a lot of games, so busy these days.
Bye.
Bye.
