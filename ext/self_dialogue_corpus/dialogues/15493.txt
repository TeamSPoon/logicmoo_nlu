i wasted my money attending that show
why? what happened?
most of the artist got on stage either drunk or too high to remember their lines.
hahaha like who?
not funny mate, meek mill was missing his lines for "gold bar" all through, drake came of worse even fell off stage at a point.
no way.
i am telling you mate.
so that was how you spent your $20 sorry mate.lol
well maybe not all of a waste though,as i honestly enjoyed Kendrick's performance.
oh did Kendrick show up?
yes he did, although he didn't perform my favourite
which is?
"drink"
"drink" would have made the crowd go wow, why didn't he.
i actually can't tell,i would have prefer have him perform all through than having a bunch missing their lines and falling off stage.
hahaha sorry mate.
you don't have to be mate as i did save the best for the last, click on the jpeg link i would send you now.
what about it.
you just go ahead and click mate lol
oh my god you snapped a selfie with Kendrick Lamar no way.
