How would you explain the evolution of music?
What do you mean?
Well, we've gone from banging sticks together to classical music to electronic music.
Yes, I understand now. That's an easy question to answer.
Really? Let me hear it!
Music reflects society.
That's it?
Yes, the music made before the Industrial Revolution -- classical music -- was analog. Since that change, music has become machine-like.
I see! Because our society became filled with the noise of factories, noise became incorported into art and music?
Yes, that's correct. Given this hypothesis, what would you predict to happen in music in the next 10 years?
It will become robotic!
That's correct! As robots start to surround us, the sounds of robots will be incorporated into music.
I think there will be an even greater effect.
What's that?
The robots will make the music!
Wow, that's going to be interesting.
It's already happening! Much modern music is designed by software.
Yet, humans will always make music. It's a really important way to communicate emotion.
I agree. I don't think robots will ever truly understand the power of music.
They may make some music, but it will never sound quite right. Truly beautiful music requires a human touch.
