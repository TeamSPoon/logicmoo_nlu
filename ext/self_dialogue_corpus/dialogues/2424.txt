Who is your favorite NFL quarterback?
Oh you know is Peyton Manning.
Peyton, why him?
He plays football like a CEO of a company.
That's kind of true.
It is. I always imagine him in a suit and tie  when he's playing.
That's weird and funny. Didn't he retire.
Yes after winning his last Superbowl in 2015.
Oh that's right they beat the Panthers.
Yes they did. It was sad, but had to be done.
Do you like his brother.
Yes I like Eli.
What team does he play for now.
He's still the quarterback for the New York Giants.
He's a quarterback too.
Yes man, where you been!
So those Manning's got it going on.
Those Manning boys had the NFL on lock.
Yes I know Peyton made history.
For sure he will be in the books, but so will his brother.
