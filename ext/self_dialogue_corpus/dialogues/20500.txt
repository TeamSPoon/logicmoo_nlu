Hey have you seen the latest Star Wars movie?
No, I have not seen it yet.
Rogue 1 is awesome, it is the next generation of Star Wars people.
Who does it have?
It has a new lead character that defects from the Empire and the daughter of Luke.
What is it about?
Well I don't want to give it all away.
How about the good scenes.
OK, the Empire is shooting several targets all over the galaxy at the same time.
Wow, A Death Star?
No A Death planet.
Cool, what else?
The rebels track down the bad guys and try to stop them before destroying the whole Galaxy of rebel bases.
Is there a lot of people killed?
Oh yeah, also one of our favorite characters is killed by his own son.
Bummer, what else?
The girl fights the Darth guy and it is a hell of a fight.
Do the good guys win?
You will have to see it for yourself, lots of good stuff.
I think I will rent it tonight, thanks.
