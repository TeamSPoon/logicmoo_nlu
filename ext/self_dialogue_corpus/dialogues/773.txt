What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I think the Patriots are going to win it all again.
No way, how can you say that?
Tom Brady
What about him?
Greatest QB ever.
Nah, Joe Montana was better.
Tom has more rings
Yeah, but Joe was undefeated in Super Bowls
I guess that's true, but Tom is more reliable
Do you mean durable?
Yeah, that's what I meant
Well that's because he's playing in the modern era
I don't understand what you mean
He has more help with nutrition and working out, etc.
I don't think that has anything to do with it.
Sure it does. Technology and science have improved since the 80s
Well I still think Brady is the GOAT
I have to disagree with you on that one.
Believe what you want, I know I'm right.
