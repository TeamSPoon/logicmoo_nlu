So, what movie should we go to?
I don't care, as long as it's not from a series.
I think you mean a franchise.
Yes. I hate franchise movies. They're so predictable.
I disagree. They give you a new situation, a new adventure, but you still kind of get to know what to expect.
Yes, you can expect, violence, meaningless dialog, and things blowing up. Also improbable special effects to keep you amused.
The Disney franchises are not like that. Films like Finding Nemo and Toy Story are sweet
Yes, too sweet.
Oh, I bet you loved Disney once.
I did, but I don't now. It seems like a lot of franchises are Disney-simple, even though they're supposed to be for adults.
Everything doesn't have to be deep and complex. Movies are entertainment.
Simple is for kids. Adult franchises can feel like a mass-produced commodity, a product, and that 's not entertaining to me.
I guess it is to me.
I want to experience something strange and new, not the same old stuff.
You might sit through the longest film you ever saw instead though, like Meet Joe Black. You're gambling.
Two hours of elves feels long to me, or two hours of pirates, especially dead pirates. Down with Pirate movies!
What about Bond? He's no elf.
Hmm. Is there a Bond movie playing?
Yes, I think so.
Well, now. Let's go to that.
