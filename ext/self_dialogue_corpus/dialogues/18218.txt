I bought a cd yesterday with so many good older songs on it.
Really, what kind of songs?
It is a mix of soft rock songs and artists.
Who is on it?
Do you remember the song Heaven Isn't Too Far Away?
Yes, I used to listen to that all the time. Who sings it again.
Warrant sings that song.
That is a great old band. What else is on it?
Remember David Essex?
No, what does he sing?
He sings the song Blue Jean Baby Queen.
I remember that song, that was a good one.
I agree, there are also a lot of Bryan Adams songs on there.
I love Bryan Adams, my favorite song is Everything I do.
Yes, that song is on there along with It Cuts Like A Knife.
That is another good one by him.
Is there any white snake on that cd?
Yes their song Still Of The Night is on there.
I love that song!
Would you like to listen to the cd?
