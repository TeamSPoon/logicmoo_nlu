It's so hard to choose the right wedding dress.
Yes it is. A bride wants to look stylish,  but she knows her children will be looking at those pictures in twenty years.
Yes. She wants to look appropriate now, and later too.
At the same time, she doesn't want to wear something bland and boring.
But she doesn't want the aunties to gossip about her outrageous dress, either.
It's a question of balance.
You're right! Don't show too much skin, but don't cover up like a nun, either.
Don't wear too much sparkle, but wear a little something that makes it all pop.
Make your mother happy, but please the groom, too.
Oh, and the bridesmaids. Choose something for them that they can wear again, somewhere, somehow.
Maybe something bright, instead of those dull pastels.
I went to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore black.
I bet that caused talk.
It did, but everybody I heard seemed to  approve. They wore elegant, summery, black dreses.
And I bet the contrast helped the bride stand out, too.
Yes. She looked just gorgeous.
Sounds lovely. I saw some print bridesmaid dresses in a magazine.
Ooh. That sounds a little distracting.
I thought so too. People would be looking at  the bridesmaids insteead of the bride.
No fun for the bride, I guess.
