Was Yoda your favorite character in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes. He had a lot of depth and was quite entertaining.
That scene in the swamp was very memorable.
I loved that film cause I did not know what was gonna happen next.
Yes. Luke's journey was really cool.
What did you think of Han Solo's journey?
I thought it was good that he was being hunted.
I agree. That added a lot to the suspense.
I was sad when he got frozen.
Me too. That scene was very depressing.
