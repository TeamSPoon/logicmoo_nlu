What's the last movie you saw?
I saw "The Mummy" a few days ago.
How did you like it? I heard it got bad reviews.
I knew going in about the reviews, but I enjoyed it.
Tom Cruise's career has gone downhill the last several years. I know people that won't go to a movie because he is in it.
I just like to go to be entertained and don't worry about the other stuff.
It seems as if so far, the summer movie season has been a disappointment.
I agree. Most moviegoers want something fresher and have become picky about paying the high prices.
I am ready to see the new "Despicable Me" movie with the kids.
I know people who will see that even if they don't have kids.
I just hope it has some fresh material in it and not the same types of "gags" as the other ones.
It should be good- the minions crack me up.
What other movies are you looking forward to this year.
Star Wars in December is the next big one for me to see in theaters.
There's nothing before then that catches your attention?
Not off the top of my head. Seems like movies are just running together these days.
Just try not to overthink it- go to be entertained. Too many people now rely on critics and others to tell them about movies.
True. Let's switch topics. Who are some of your favorite actors?
I love The Rock and Wahlberg. What about you?
I like a variety. Kevin Hart, Ferrell, Clooney, and Rogan are some of my favorites.
