Hey, have seen Rogue One?
No, I;'ve had a chance. Is it any good?
Yeah, it's very good, it tells the story of how the Death Star Plans were captured.
Really, that's sound interesting. Any cameo's from the main trilogies or other works?
Jimmy Smits plays Bail Organa, Artoo and C3PO have a quick cameo, and Grand Moff Tarkin plays a sizable role.
Grand Moff Tarkin, how'd they do that.
They used green screen and CGI techniques to superimpose Peter Cushings face onto another actor, and that actor sounded pretty close to Cushings voice as well.
Man, it amazing what they can do with CGI these days.
Yeah, they even used the same technique to have Princess Leia have a quick cameo near the end of the film.
Whoa, now I definitely will make time to see Rogue One.
