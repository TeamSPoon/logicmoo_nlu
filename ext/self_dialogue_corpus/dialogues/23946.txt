You know cracks me up about cartoon commercials these days?
No but I have a feeling you're going to tell me .
I was watching the commercial for the new Despicable Me movie  the other day.
And you did an analysis of how the animation looks?
No I laughed to myself about the music playing in the background.
What was the music?
They had an Eminem song playing
What's so funny about that?
You don't think it's funny to have gangster rap in the background of a kids movie?
I never even thought of that.
I know right,  I wonder how much they had to pay him.
He was probably sitting around refusing the offers and they probably eventually made him such a high offer that he said screw it.
Yeah talk about selling out.
Come on man pay me enough and I'll sing Celine Dion on the next Cable Guy movie.
Wow, Cable Guy that was a random reference.
Yeah I know but I was sitting here trying to think of what a really bad movie was enough first one that came to mind for some reason.
Not a big Jim Carrey fan?
On the contrary I used to love him especially when he was on In Living Color.
I forgot he was on that.
Yeah I still love the old completely wacky Jim Carrey when he did movies like Ace Ventura.
