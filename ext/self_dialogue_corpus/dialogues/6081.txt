Have you seen Frozen? It's my favorite Disney movie.
Of course I've seen it. But I didn't think that it was as good as some older Disney movies.
I know some people think that the story was too simple, but I disagree. It was great to finally see a movie that focuses on a relationship between sisters, and not just romantic relationships.
That's true. I did like that aspect of the movie a lot.
It also sent a powerful message about accepting who we are. It's the only way to fully be free of the things holding you back.
The song "Let It Go" was perfect to convey that message. It was also one of the best Disney songs ever, in my opinion.
Yes I agree. I think a lot of the movie's popularity was thanks to that song.
Yeah it really made the movie very recognizable even for people who don't watch Disney movies much.
Now every little girl wants an Anna and Elsa cake for their birthday.
True. But they are great role models for kids so that's good.
