Do you think fast and furious movies are becoming repetitive?
Well, I certainly do feel that to a certain extent.
I mean I can say for sure that last three movies have almost same story.
I think what you are forgetting is in action movies, story is almost always the same.
Well, I agree to it only partially.
Why only partially?
I mean there has been action movies which had unique and solid story.
I think the first fast and furious was one of it.
Yes, because there were no fast and furious before part one, Obviously.
I think that is the common issue with movie series.
