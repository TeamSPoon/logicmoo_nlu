I going tonight.
You are?
Yeah, plus I have an extra ticket.you want to go?
Oh yeah, Rockies and diamondbacks? Can't miss that.
Both teams are tied for first.
I know, both teams are in a 6 game winning streak.
Somebody has got to lose. Fisher is pitching for the rocks.
Who's pitching for the d back?
Don't know.
Oh.
What time do you want to leave?
Really early,I want to see batting practice.
The d back always put on a show.
They say that the d backs may win this game tonight, due to the hitting they have been producing.
It has been of the hook. Did you see the dodger game last night?
No, what happened?
Kershaw pitched a no hitter.
Really, he hasn't lost a game this year.
I wish I could see him pitch.
They are coming to town next week.
