Were you a big fan of The Matrix
I liked the first one, but the other ones were pretty bad
Yeah, the first one was really new and fresh
Had a lot of cool special effects
Not sure if I ever followed the actual story line
Right, when you strip out all the action and effects, the story line is pretty lame
Something about red and blue pills
Well there's that and how the world isn't what it seems
Yeah, pretty weird
Too sci fi for my taste
