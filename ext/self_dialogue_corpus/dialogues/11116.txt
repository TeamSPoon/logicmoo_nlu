Did you  see Kanye's new line of clothes?
Yes, man it is something else, like very out there.
It is. Did you like any of his collection?
I like a few pieces, he makes a sort of gauzy broken up shirt in cream and it is really attractive , did you?
I liked on jacket he made, denim with some random patches and baggy. Did you see what his wife wore to the Met Gala?
The off the shoulder really plain white gown?
Yes, sort of light cotton, did you like it?
I liked it if I wear to wear it to the beach. Did you think Blake Lively's gown was nice?
I did! It was really pretty, with the form fitting gold and detail. Who did you think was the best dressed that night?
That is hard, I would say Blake Lively.
I would agree, of course. Who was the worst dressed?
The Girl form Girls, with the over-sized red and checkered  kilt dress. Ugh, did you see it?
Lena Dunham? Yes, I thought it was an ugly material, reminded me of last year when everyone wore just crazy outfits.
Like Zayn, with his metallic arm, how was that fashion?
His tuxedo was tailored wonderfully, that piece brings me back to this year, did you see Katy Perry at the met?
Yes, that was so confusing. The red mourning gown and the weird face mask. Looked like a lady Gaga want to be.
I like LAdy Gaga fashion, when she wore the meat suit.
The meat suit was so weird, I liked her clothes at the super bowl though.
I think she looked like sponge-bob, her outfits at least.
She has really changed her fashion style, and I enjoy it more.
