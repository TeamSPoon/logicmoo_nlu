Have you seen the first Fast and Furious movie?
I've seen all of them, but that one is my favorite.
I sue it in my class to teach irony.
How do you do that?
It's dramatic irony because we know something that the characters don't.
Like that Paul Walker is a cop?
Exactly.  Plus it's also situational irony.
When does that happen?
At the end when Paul Walker throws Vin Diesel the keys.  Not exactly what your expecting.
Good point.  Those are probably good examples for kids.
