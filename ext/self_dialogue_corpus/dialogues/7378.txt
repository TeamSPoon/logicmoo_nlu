What did you think of the storyline for the movie WALL-E?
I thought that it was very realistic and sent a good message about environmental conservation.
Do you think that it went over the heads of kids?
No because WALL-E was a very relatable robot that kids really loved and they just happened to learn about protecting the environment along the way.
That's true. The fact that WALL-E goes to rescue EVE, a plant, is very important to the plot.
Yes, and in the movie the existence of EVE shows that life on Earth is still possible.
Yes, I think it shows that humans should never let the Earth fall into disarray to begin with.
In the end, WALL-E has to visit the large ship to rescue EVE, and it shows the future race of humans as extremely lazy, all of them with robot butlers.
Yes, these scenes are funny but I think adults see the ominous warnings about dependence on technology more than kids would.
I agree. That's one aspect of the movie that adults would find more interesting than the kid's would.
