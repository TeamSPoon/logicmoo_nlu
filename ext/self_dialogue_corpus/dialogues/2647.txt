Do you watch much NFL live?
No, typically I watch on my 60 inch 4k TV at home.
Sweet - do you notice that NFL broadcasts typically show an above field view?
Yeah, it's kind of like a video game - like Madden on Playstation.
Exactly.  I noticed it while watching the Atlanta Falcons play.
Are you a Falcons fan - me too!
Yeah, I used to be a season ticket holder when I lived in Atlanta for 10 years.
Great stadium, and great team - the Falcons.
Indeed they are - too bad they lost  Super Bowl LI to the Patriots.
I know - I really thought they were going to win.
Mercedes-Benz Stadium is a great new venue for the Falcons.
Yeah, I was in Atlanta on business, and I got a tour of the facility.
I just wish the Falcons would win a Super Bowl!
Yeah, they really need to work on their rushing yardage.
I think MVP Matt Ryan is a great quarterback.
Yeah, I hope that he stays with the Falcons.
He also got a relatively high Wonderlic score for a Quarterback.
I read that - a score of 32 is great!
Well, if you are ever interested in seeing a game in Atlanta, let me know!
Will do - go Falcons!
