What do you know about the new Imagine Dragons album?
I know I like it!  It sounds great, while still sounding like them.
I really liked the first single from the new album!
Me too.  I was confused at first, thinking it was a song from their last album.
I thought that too!
Have you seen the video they did with Dolph Lundgren?
I have!  It was really neat.
I thought so!  It was neat seeing him in a music video.
Where do you think they got their name?
I don't know.  I never thought about it.
Do you think they will ever put out any ballads?
I wouldn't be surprised if they did.  They are talented, and could pull it off.
I really liked the songs that they did for the Transformers movie.
The last one?  Or did they do one for the current movie?
I don't remember if they did one for the current movie, but I was thinking of the last movie.
Yes, it was a great song! I listened to it a lot.
Me too!  I really wished they had brought Linkin Park back, though.
I know, but I still thought that it went well with the overall soundtrack.
I can't wait to listen to the new album again.
Me either.  Imagine Dragons is one of my favorites!
