Hey Mark did you hear that they will play an NFL game in Toronto again?!
Oh yes???
Yeah you remember the last game?
Yeah that was way back! In 2013 !
It was the Atlanta Falcons vs Buffalo Bills
yeah I know.. I'm such a fan of the Bills
But they are not doing so good any more.
Yeah the Bills need a major overhaul!
I'm glad they are coming to visit Toronto again
Do you think we will ever get an NFL team here?
I'm not sure we been talking about it for such a long time and I feel we really deserve a team
I know! I have been having to drive down to Buffalo to watch the games!
Wow that consumes a lot of gas!
Yeah, I do not think I will do it any more-- we would go shopping and watch the game also
So this game in Toronto is like a God send
Yes!
Lets keep wishing that we can get an NFL team
Yeah I will!
See you at the Bills game in Toronto
Ok See you!
