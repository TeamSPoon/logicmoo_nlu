I can't decide who's the best linebacker in the NFL right now.
The position has some real depth to it.
I could probably name three guys who stand out at the top of my head.
Alright, well who would you put up top?
Probably the sack master himself, Von Miller.
I'd probably slot him at #1 too.  Reigning DPOY.
He's just so quick.  An OT alone can't seem to stop him.
He certainly drives the Denver defense and makes their CB's look better.
After Miller, it's a toss-up.  I can't decide.
Probably Mack, though right?
See, I can't decide between him or Kuechly.
Both are good choices for sure.
I would probably say Mack though.
On what grounds?
Well, Mack is faster, younger, a bit less banged up.
That is a good point.  Kuechly was out much of the year.
I would probably give Luke the edge in covering the TE.
Sure, that's his bread and butter.
But for rushing the QB, Mack looks to be the real deal.
He might challenge Miller for DPOY I think.
