You going to the Yankees game?
I am not sure yet i do not think they are doing to well this season.
I think their last game was good they won.
How much had they won by in the last game?
They narrowly won it was about 4 points it was pretty tense.
I bet it sounds tense. Have they got any new players recently?
They actually have gotten quite a few new players i think they are gonna go far.
I love them so  i hope they go far this season
Yeah last season was so bad it was not that good.
I hope they got a new pitcher the last guy was awful.
I think their batter was worse he could not hit anything.
Definitely it is like he is nearly blind or something.
And do not get me started on the players they had in the outfield.
Exactly they scrambled around like blind mice and it was sad.
I know they traded a good majority of players
Did they now? That could be interesting
It explains why they are doing better this season.
I bet the decision was made when they did awful last season.
The owner probably wanted to get rid of the bad ones.
I bet it was an embarrassment to the team as a life long fan.
