Are you a fan of horror movies?
Generally I am, though, there are some that are a little too vulgar for my taste.
What movie do you think is your favorite horror movie of all time?
That's actually a toss up between Alien and Aliens, both are great.
Wait.  Alien isn't a horror film, that's a thriller.
I completely disagree, Alien is the best type of horror.  One where the horror isn't how much blood is on the screen, but instead the amount of fright and anxiety you feel during intense scenes.
So you don't like bloody, gory horror movies?
No, I enjoy those as well.  I'm just more impressed by the ability to generate horror without resorting to gore.
Well, if you had to pick a gory horror movie as your favorite, which one would it be?
I'm thinking the latest Evil Dead movie would be high on my list.
