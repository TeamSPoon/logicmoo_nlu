Hey Larry, that hat you are wearing looks familiar.
It should. It's yours.
That's where I saw it before. On my head.
Yeah, but it looks better on me though. On me, it looks like a Storm Trouper's helmet
I can see that.
When I wear this hat, I look like an intergalactic space soldier getting ready to do some serioua damage on the rebel forces..
Welll, what do I look like?
You?
Yeah!
You look like a damaged mushroom.
