You wouldnt believe the game. it was crazy.
Extra innings?
Even better. it was tied 6 to 6 in the 8th and the mariners hit a double with a runner on second
oh snap. did boston make a comeback in the 9th?
at the top of the ninth boston goes does 2 outs. then a string of hits and crazy plays.

so boston ends up with two outs and bases loaded. big papi gets to the mound and smash a fastball 400 feet deep.
so that was it then we won?

aw no. tell me he had another chance.
so ortiz gets to a full count, 2 outs. bases loaded. and CRACK he sends it over center field.
