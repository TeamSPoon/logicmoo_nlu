Are you ready for some football this season?
I've been ready since last season ended.
Lol Who are you rooting for this time, your beloved Cowboys?
Of course they still hold the record for the most Super Bowl wins, which is saying a lot about your precious Packer!
Hey even though they have been on a losing streak I have faith in my Packers!
Yes me too, the faith of a mustard seed lol
Okay we will see about that when we beat the Cowboys and knock them out of the running for the Super Bowl.
That can never happen, you guys should focus on your defense instead of other teams.
Our defense will be better then ever this year, we're going to the ship lol!
To get past us you'll have to get through your toughest competition, The Bears lol
We sending them bears back to the woods for good this season and just for all the jokes I will be making a roster.
Bout time now I can finally take some of your money for a change.
We will see about that, I don't like losing and I really don't like losing my money.
Well get used to it because I plan to clean you out, Matter of fact first 3 games will be held at my house.
Cool then i'll host the following 3 and we can just go from there.
Wanna go to the mall to buy more football gear and things.
I'm always down for new Packers gear!
When is the first game this season?
September 7th is the Kickoff Game.
Right I believe it starts at 8:30 pm
