I love music movies, or biopics as people call them.
Yeah I'm glad we sat down to finally watch Jersey Boys, great film.
There's just something about the way underdogs rise from the bottom in a music setting.
It helps that you and I love music as much as we do.
I had no idea Jersey Boys was based on a broadway play.
Whoa what, it is?
Yeah and the main character is played by the same actor who stars in the play.
That's really cool actually.
Totally is, I'd be really interested in seeing the play one day.
After how good this film was I am inclined to agree.
What music film do you want to watch next?
I heard good things about Eddie and the Cruisers.
Oh my god I forgot about that one, I've been meaning to check it out.
Yeah it's got that 80s Bruce Springsteen vibe going on in it, I am really excited.
Do you think it's important to like the music in a movie based on an artist?
I think it helps but a good story is still a good story.
That's true, I just think it helps when you can really get behind the tunes too.
Oh definitely I agree, I just don't think it's neccesary.
With that said I will go see where I can rent Eddie and the Cruisers.
I'll get the popcorn ready.
