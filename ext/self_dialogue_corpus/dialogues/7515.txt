Do you like Harry Potter?
It's okay.
I watched the first four in the theater.
They kept getting darker.
J.K. Rowling is a great writer.
It's a great concept.
It was fun to live vicariously through the characters.
The wizards had no cares in the world.
I'd like to magic some things.
That would be nice.
