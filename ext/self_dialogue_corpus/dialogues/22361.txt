Have you seen the 1970's movie The Warriors?
Yes!  It is one of my favorites!
Mine too, I have watched it so many times I almost know the script by heart!
No kidding?  I've watched it a few times, but not that many.
I have to say, one of my favorite parts is when they go into the Orphans territory.
Oh heck yeah, that part is classic
The leader of the Orphans looks like he's been through the ringer, eh?
He sure does, and its so funny they didn't know about the meeting up in the Bronx.
What a great movie!
It never gets old does it?  Good soundtrack too.
When they are on the beach and the Joe Walsh song comes on it is so fitting.
Yep, In The City, whoever thought of that had the right idea placing it in the show.
The scene on the train is heavy when the prom couples board.
Mercy goes to fix her hair and Swan pushes her arm down as if to say, no, you don't need to fix yourself up for them.
There are a lot of scenes in the movie that are heavier than they seem.
Yes, for sure, like when the guys go with the girls, The Lizzies.
I knew something was up, why would these girls just show up and invite three Warriors back to their place without some kind of motive?
Oh yea, and when that switchblade comes out, it is fight central!
I must say, that movie is one of the greatest I've ever seen
You know, I agree with you, it is an excellent watch.
