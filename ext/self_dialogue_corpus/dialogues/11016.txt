Who do you think will end up in the finals
I say Preds and Pens
I think Senators and Preds
I like the Senators too but the star power is going to be too much for them to handle.
I just think Anderson is out of his mind.
While I do agree for the most part, Fleury is just as able
Being able and being on fire are two different things.
Yeah but this isnt Fleury winning games and giving up 4 goals.
True, but it took them to 7 with the Caps.
The Caps were a good team.
I dont think so, Ovi is a cancer to them.
Thats a seperate issue, Im talking about Pens and Caps.
OK even so, I think that you will see that series built character for them and they got through it.
Crosby is on that team but for how long.
He is injury prone but they can cloak that.
Malkin needs to shoulder the team.
Another Russian you could say is better as second fiddle rather than the main star.
I dont know what to say to that.
You can say hes not an elite player.
But he is, even as a by product of Crosby
