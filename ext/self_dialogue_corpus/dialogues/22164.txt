I just saw Passengers at the movie theaters. Have you seen it?
No I haven't. Was it good?
Oh yea! I loved it!
That's that one with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, right?
Yea, they make a great team. Great actors!
Was anyone else in the movie or just them?
There was that British "Sheen" guy. I forget his first name.
Michael?
Yea, him. And, Lawrence Fishbourne or whatever.
Oh I like him too. Morpheus!
Yea he's a great actor as well.
Don't spoil it for me, but what's it basically about? The trailer is pretty vague.
Chris Pratt's character wakes up too early from cryo-sleep, like almost a century too early.
What, and he's stuck on the spaceship by himself?
Yep, but there's plenty of things for him to do and a realistic robot to talk to.
And Jennifer's character wakes up too early too?
Yes, but her circumstances were different.
How so?
That, I'm not gonna tell you! You just have to go see it!
Oh ok, yea I don't want any spoilers.
