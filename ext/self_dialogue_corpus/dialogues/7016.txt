Did you see the new beauty and the beast?
I have, I loved it. Have you?
I started watching online. I did not like it much and stopped it part way in.
Really what did you not like?
It was almost the same in some ways as the animated but then not. I thought emma watson's voice was weak.
I had heard some critiques of using a non singer such as Emma. But I enjoyed it.
Maybe I will give it another try.. don't know why I disliked it so much.
Did you like the animated version?
Yes, I loved it when I was younger.
Maybe that is partly why you did not care for the real life version. I sometimes find it hard to enjoy remakes of favorite films of mine.
