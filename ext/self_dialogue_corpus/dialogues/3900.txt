do you like thriller movies?
What kind of question is that?
I'll take that as a yes.
Who doesn't like thrillers? I mean Fight Club, how can you not like that?
I've never actually seen that one.
How are you alive right now? You have to watch that movie.
I know, everybody keeps telling me I should.
Only because they have a brain. You're coming to my house and we're watching it.
Is it really that good?
Well I can't tell you or I'll break the first rule of Fight Club.
