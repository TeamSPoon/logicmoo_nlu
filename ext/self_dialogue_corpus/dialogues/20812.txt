Wow what a boring day it is!
I know, there is nothing to do on this stormy day.
I have an idea. Since it is storming out, do you want to watch a scary movie?
Sure, do you have any in mind?
Have you seen all of the Scream movies?
Are those the ones with Neve Campbell
Yes! I think they are awesome.
How many of them are there in all?
There is four in all.
Oh, I just thought there was three. I have not seen the last one.
The last one came out in 2011.
Does it have all the same people in it?
Yeah basically. Other than Campbell there is David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Emma Roberts.
Who is Emma Roberts?
She is Julia Roberts niece.
Oh wow. What character does she play in the film?
She plays Campbell's niece and the masked person is chasing her and her friends.
Is it as good as all the others?
I think it is just as good if not better, but I truly love them all.
Ok put it in, I can't wait to watch it.
