Are you watching the N.B.A playoffs?
i love basketball I have not missed a game.
I grew up watching greats like Magic Johnson and Larry BIrd.
Yes, I miss the good old days of competitive NBA playoff games.
This years playoffs have been in one word, terrible.
I agree, most games have been blowouts and very non competitive.
I have had to turn the channel as a lot of these games are over by half time.
Very disappointing you want playoff games in particular to come down to the final minutes.
I believe both the Warriors and Cavaliers have not lost a game in the playoffs.
Good for them but bad for basketball and its competitiveness.
At Least we can hope for a great championship matchup.
Definitely two great teams on a collision course to play each other.
Great story lines between these two teams that are about to butt heads.
They both have a chip on their shoulders and this should be fun to watch.
I am hoping for a 7 game series and most of all I want to see close and competitive games right to the final buzzer.
Yes I agree please no more blow outs.
So what do you think what is your prediction for this matchup.
The Warriors especially with Kevin Durant I just think they have too much talent.
I disagree I think Lebron James is the best player in the world and will be the diffeence for the Cavaliers.
Should be fun to watch.
