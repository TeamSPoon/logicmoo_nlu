Were you ever a fan of Lil Kim?
I'm trying to place her. What was one of her songs?
"Magic Stick" was a popular one back in 2003.
I remember that one I think! I know that I've seen the music video.
Yea I like some of her songs.
Her real name is actually Kimberly Jones. Kind of average.
Right but I'm sure that wasn't a good stage name.
You know what's sad though?
What is that?
She ended up bleaching her skin to appear white.
Oh my goodness why?
Apparently she's always been insecure about her physical appearance.
I had no idea. She was beautiful before dying her skin.
I know, I agree.
A lot of her fans are angry I bet.
Yes they are. Especially her African American fans.
Right, I can see that.
I imagine because it looks like she was embarrassed to have dark skin.
I get that. How sad.
It really is. I wish my skin was darker.
