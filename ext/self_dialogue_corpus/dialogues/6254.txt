I'm looking forward to Cars 3.
I'm excited for the movie too. This one seems very action packed.
The trailer is so cool. The graphics for it are very impressive.
Every year, Disney's animation team always makes something better and better.
Yeah! And you can't help but think, "What could be better than this?"
Right! Do you think Cars 3 will be the end of Cars?
I think so... Honestly, I thought Cars ended on its second film.
I thought so too. But what about Planes?
I think those are considered as "Spin Off" since it has a different cast?
But they're definately related in the same "universe," you would think?
