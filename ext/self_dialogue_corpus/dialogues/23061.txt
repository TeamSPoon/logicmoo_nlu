So, seen any good films lately?
Well, I just recently saw Mrs Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Kids.
Oh, I've heard about that one... that's the one by Tim Burton, right?
Well, he directed it yet, but it's actually based on a series of books.
Hmm... why does that sound familiar?
Well, the books are all done in black and they've got bizarre, old fashioned pictures in them.
You know, I think I saw one of those at the library once.
You should pick them up, they're pretty good.
Well, what did you think of the movie?
Well, I liked it... it's a LOT different than the books and in some ways that's good and some that's bad, but still.
So, give me a summary, what's it about?
Well, this teenager, his grandfather, who told him a bunch of crazy stories as a kid, dies, and he finds out the story's are all true.
What are the stories about?
I'm getting to that... the stories were about an island he was sent to full of "special" children. Anyway, grandpa is killed in a rather mysterious way, so the boy follows clues and finds this ihouse on an island where "peculiar" children live.
And they're peculiar because they've got special powers and stuff?
Yeah, that's right.  One boy is invisible, another boy has bees living inside him, one girl burn things with her hands, and so on.
Ahh.. kind of like X-Men for kids?
Weeeelll... that's a real bad comparison I'd say.  X-Men isn't the only series revolving around youngsters with odd abilities.
So, what's the catch?
Well, the guys who killed the main boy's grandfather are trying to hunt down the other children.
