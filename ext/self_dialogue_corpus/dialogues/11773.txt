Did you have any thoughts on the Beatles?
I loved them, and was there to meet them on their first trip to the US.  The girls were actually fainting they were so excited.
That must have been something.  What was their music like?
They  played their popular songs and really thrilled the crowd.  I loved hearing them sing a mix of songs.  They were so cool.
They patterned some of their stuff from some of the work by Buddy Holly I think.
Sure thing, he influenced them while they were coming up with some tours Holly did in England.
Well they certainly had a huge influence on the music industry and Rock n' Roll.  So many groups patterned after them and their success.
Their hair styles caught on and soon long hair was popular with younger men and high heeled boots were the craze too.
My sister had a Beatles bobble head set and still has it.  I think it is pretty valuable, like a family heirloom, ha ha.
The Beatles certainly had a huge influence from their run and still are popular today so many years later.
