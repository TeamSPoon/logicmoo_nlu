Do you watch NFL?
Yes, I love the Atlanta Falcons.
Me too. They have been my favorite team for years.
Mine too. I was a fan before it was cool.
Awesome. I am Matt Ryan's biggest fan.
Cool. I am Julio Jones fan.
He is awesome. So, how did you handle the big loss last season?
Oh, it hurt. It hurt bad.
I know. I almost smashed my TV.
Yeah, I wanted to throw mine out the window.
I am good now though.
Me too. We just got to get back this year.
I really hope we do.
Me too. I can't wait for the season to start.
I think I am going to host a few parties to watch. You interested?
Yes, that would be great.
Ok, cool. I will keep you posted on details.
Thanks so so much.
No, problem it will be fun.
It will. Go Falcons.
