Have you seen Dawn of the Dead?
Yeah, that was best best of the Romero films.
In terms of plot and acting I agree all the way.
The way they negotiated that mall.  You got to know the characters.
I also liked the way that the characters were all so strong.  Especially the woman.
At first she wasn't.  But she developed.
Those zombies creeped me out when the tennis ball fell and they were everywhere.
One of the creepiest moments I ever saw what when Rodger came out a zombie.  With that walk.
And he somehow remembered where the food was.
yeah, that's just plane scary.
