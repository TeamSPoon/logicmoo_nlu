What is your favorite force ability throughout the Star Wars series?
I would have to say my favorite is the electricity ability that Senator Palpatine uses.
Mine is the sheer power of moving things that Count Dooku has.
Yeah, its pretty impressive that he was able to move things easier than Yoda.
I can't even believe Annakin managed to kill Count Dooku.
Annakin made it look easy too, I don't think he would have killed him if Senator Palpatine didn't order him to.
Probably, the senator was always trying to play with Annakins conscience.
I'll bet that if Annakin never knew Senator Palpatine, he wouldn't have joined the Sith.
Oh for sure, especially since Senator Palpatine told him Sith powers could save his wife from dying.
Yeah, that's really horrible how they played on his love for Padamane.
