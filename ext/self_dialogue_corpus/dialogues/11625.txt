Hey are you a fan of the Beatles?
I hear a lot about them, but I don't know many of their songs. They're a rock band, right?
Yes, but their music falls across a bunch of different genres. I think it would appeal to almost anyone.
Really? What are your favorite songs that don't get talked about?
There are a lot of them, like Hey, Bulldog, which is a really fun song that even some fans haven't heard
That sounds interesting. Why isn't it more well known?
I think because it's on their Yellow Submarine album, which is more like a soundtrack than a studio album
What other songs do you like?
It's hard to narrow it down, but check out Oh! Darling and Helter Skelter, two of their more heavy sounding songs
Interesting, and here I thought it was all cheesy pop-rock songs. I'll check those out.
