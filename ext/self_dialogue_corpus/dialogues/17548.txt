Do you listen to the Doobie Brothers?
I have heard of them but I can't think of any songs.
They are so good! I was listening to them all this morning.
What are they like a 60's band?
They first came out in the 70's I believe.
I figured they were an oldies group because of the name.
I know, right? No one would think of that name these days.
What are some of their songs that I might know?
Their most popular song is probably Listen To The Music. Have you ever heard of it?
Yes, I hear that on the radio all the time. I just didn't know the name of the group.
How about Minute By Minute? That song is always on the radio.
I'm not sure, what are some lyrics?
"Minute by minute by minute by minute I keep holding on"
Oh yeah! I've heard that on the radio too.
Michael McDonald who used to front the group is doing a solo tour. I would love to see him live!
Really? Is he coming around here?
Yes. He will be at The Paramount in Huntington on July 5th.
We should go! Who is he touring with?
Boz Scaggs.
My dad loves him. Let's get tickets!
