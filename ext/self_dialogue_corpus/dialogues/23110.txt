So, what's your favorite movie?
I love How to Train Your Dragon. Such a touching movie.
I was impressed they went with the decision to make Hiccup lose his leg in the movie.
So was I. It had a great impact when I saw it in theaters.
Isn't a new one supposed to come out soon?
Yeah, How to Train Your Dragon 3 is slated to release in March 2019.
Wow, that's quite a wait. The second one came out in 2014.
It's been delayed a few times, yeah. I really hope the wait is worth it!
Have you seen Despicable Me 3?
No, and I'm not sure if I want to, to be honest.
I loved the first one, but I felt like the second one undermined the theme of the first one, so I agree.
Exactly. It went from "man and adoptive daughters can be a real family" to "every family needs a mom" and was very disappointing.
I'm also just really tired of the minions.
Man, the Minions movie was actually pretty great!
Was it? I was so burnt out by that point that I never bothered to watch it.
It was very cute, not nearly as annoying as I thought. Sandra Bullock as the villain was fabulous.
Wow, I just noticed a Minions 2 is scheduled for a 2020 release.
The first one made $336,029,560 just in the US, so I can see why they'd want to release a second one.
I hope they make a Trolls 2, that movie was amazing. I loved the songs.
Me too! My family and I quote that entire movie at each other all the time.
