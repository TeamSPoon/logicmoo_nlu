Were the Ramones and The Clash big at your school?
Yeah, there were a few kids really in to them. Most of the people I knew were more in to U2, REM, The Alarm.
Yeah, those bands are good too. I was in to them too. I even liked a little B-52s.
I totally forgot about them. Talk about a blast from the past.
Yeah it was either those kind of alternative bands or classic rock bands...I remember there was Eagles resurgence.
Eeew, really? Hair bands were big...think Bon Jovi.
Yuck, I've never been a fan. I can't deal with guys that use more hairspray than I do.
Ha! True. I guess I've always kind of like the alternative groups. I was into Nirvana and Pearl Jam when they made it to east coast.
Yeah, me too. We've grown up with some really great music.
Yeah, I can't stomach some of this new stuff. Guess I'm getting old.
