Who is your favorite Christmas singer?
Well, my husband likes Mariah Carey.
I mean traditional Christmas singer.
Then it's a toss up between Bing Crosby and Bing Crosby.
LOL.  There were other singers besides Bing Crosby.
Not on the eight tracks my parents owned!
What about Nat King Cole?
Oh yeah.  And that guy in the sweaters?
Perry Como?  Yes, he sang some Christmas songs.
I like Mariah.
I like Manheim Steamroller.  And I like choirs singing hymns.
Like the Mormon Tabenacle Choir?
Yes!  I had them on VHS as a kid.
Hey, eight track is more old school than VHS.  What about songs from claymation specials?
Ah, nothing can beat the Heat Meiser and Cold Meiser songs!
I like the Island of Misfit toys.
I liked Burl Ives as the snowman.
And I liked Shirely Booth as Mrs. Santa.
But, I do agree that Bing Crosby was the bomb on Christmas songs.
Especially his version of White Christmas.
