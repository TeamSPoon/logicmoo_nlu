When was the last time you watched the original Star Wars trilogy?
I watched it a few weeks ago with my daughter.
Which was her favorite movie?
She liked Return of the Jedi best.
I bet she thought the Ewoks were cute.
She loved the Ewoks, and the big celebration at the end of the movie.
I never liked Return of the Jedi. My favorite was always A New Hope.
Why did you like that one?
I just liked how it brought me into this brand new universe.
I know what you mean. I loved it when Darth Vader first walks on-screen.
