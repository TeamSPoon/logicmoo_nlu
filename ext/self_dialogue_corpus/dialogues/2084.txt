The NFL season is coming soon, are you excited?
I am very excited to see the start of Pre-season!
One of my favorite players in the NFL is Peyton Manning's brother, do you know him?
Peyton's brother plays for the New York Giants.
Eli Manning has been the Giants quaterback since 2004.
Do you recall his greatest game?
Who could forget Ei's greatest game and one of the greatest super bowls of all time.
Eli lead the Giants against argeuably the greatest comeback ever in Super Bowl in 2008.
During the Final minutes there were multiple lead changes.
The Giants ended up with the final posession of the game down by 4 points for one final drive.
With only seconds to go, they needed a touchdown to win and could not even tie it with a field goal.
The play I recall most was the great catch the wide reciever made, what was his name.
The Giants wide reciever Tyree made an almost impossible catch on fouth down!
Yes, with Eli about to be sacked, he made an incredible throw!
and then Tyree caught it on some defenders helmet one armed for the first down.
They would eventually score a touchdown and win the game.
That was Eli's first and only super bowl win as of today.
What made the game so great was that nobody expected them to have a shot at winning.
Yes, the Giants were a huge underdog to the Patriots.
Yes, Super Bowl XLII will remain one of the greatest games ever played!
