Are you excited for Thanos to finally appear?
I am, and I'm not.  They've been building to this showdown since pretty much the first Iron Man.
Yeah, Spider-Man just stopping a mugger seems mundane after that.
So, where do they go after Infinity War?
Maybe introduce a new super villain, like Kang.
Yeah, that would be cool.  A lot of the actors' contract will probably expired around then.
I wonder what will happen there?  Are they going to get a new Captain America?  A new Iron Man?
I wonder if they'll get a new actor to play "Tony Stark," or they'll get a new character with a new actor.
It's a shame because all the actors they've cast have really done a great job.  Chris Evans, Robert Downey, jr, Samuel L. Jackson.
Did you know they based the Ultimate Nick Fury on Sam Jack, and then he went on to play him in the movies.
