I am looking for a good playlist for a romantic night this weekend
What are you doing?
My Husband and I planning a date at home, with a nice dinner, candles, sofy=t music and wine
Oh that sounds really nice, I suppose I dont need to mention Marvin Gay
No he is already on my list, I want something a bit different
how about baby love from the supremes?
I like that, but its been played a lot
Dont let go..from envogue?
Oh yes, perfect, any more ideas?
power of love, from celine dion
Yes thats good too
I love anything from Sam smith
Oh yes, I agree, I dont know why I hadnt thought of that
His songs always fill me too my toes
"Lay me down" is both beautiful and sad
the story is really sad
Do you like ed Sheeran?
He is the cutest guy, I love him
whats your favorite
thinking out loud
