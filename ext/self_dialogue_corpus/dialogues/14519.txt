Who do you think is the MVP?
Clearly Russ, right?
Yea, I guess, but I don't know. He had to lead there.
So did Harden, didn't he?
Yea, but Harden actually won games.
Yea, so did Russ. Just not enough.
They both are solid candidates, but have you seen Russ?
Yea, he takes it to another level.
He does, but so does Harden. They are great players.
Lets just say Kawhi and call it a day.
That would be fun, but he just isn't quite there yet.
Na, not yet, but he could be soon.
He quickly took over as the leader of the Spurs.
Yea, I'll give him that.
Yea, hes a gamer, but Russ.
I understand. That guy can play.
Don't leave Lebron out either.
We always leave Lebron out. He just keeps doing his thing though.
Look, Russ has to be the guy. Has to be.
We will see soon.
