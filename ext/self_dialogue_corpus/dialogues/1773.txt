Hey, do you want to an NFL game this year.
Not really I would much rather watch the games at home
Why going to games are great
Not if it's cold out I'm always miserable plus I'm a Jets fan so they seem to always lose.
Think the Jets will be any good this year
Not a chance they will be terrible.
Do you think the Patriots are going to win the division.
Yeah unless Brady gets hurt they are going to win the division.  I just hope they don't win the Superbowl
I don't think they are making it to the Super Bowl this year, I like the Raiders
I don't know about that the Raiders are still young and unfortunately the Pats are loaded.
Well Raiders, Packers I'm calling it.
Probably going to be Giants Pats another rematch.
That would be great you think the Giants could do it again.
For my sanity I sure hope so.  Eli beats Brady again would be great.
What about the Dolphins
I don't like the Dolphins I hope they tank
Ha, think Cowboys will dominate again this year
I expect them to take a huge step back this year
I'm so excited for the start of the season.  It's almost here!
Yeah we will see how it goes this year.
