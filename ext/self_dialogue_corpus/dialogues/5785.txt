disney movies aren't just for kids, right?
not at all!
i thought so. they put a lot of hidden adult jokes
yeah, they're family movies. for the whole audience!
you have to keep mom and dad interested, right?
yeah, and the teenage siblings. otherwise the whole family won't go to the movie and you'll lose money
so i don't need to feel weird because zootopia is my new favorite movie?
not at all! it has a great message for all ages
secret of life pets was a huge let down, though
yeah...it really was
