What is your favorite Ben Stiller movie?
That's a good question. It has to be either be Zoolander or Meet the Parents.
Zoolander is one of my all time favorite comedies. Who is your favorite character from that film?
This may sound weird, but the hand model played by David Duchovny.
He was funny. I really liked Owen Wilson's character, Hansel McDonald.
He was great too. What recent movies has Owen Wilson been in?
Aside from Zoolander 2, he just voiced Lightning McQueen in the most recent Cars movie.
Totally forgot that he's in that movie. I think that's because I just associate him with Wedding Crashers.
Another great movie. Do you think that they will ever make a sequal?
A sequel is reportedly in the works. I really enjoyed Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's last movie together, The Internship.
Really? It was just a giant infomercial for Google.
That was sort of annoying, but I thought Vince Vaughn was very funny in the movie.
I don't know. Vince Vaughn has been on a cold streak recently when it comes to movies.
He gets a bad reputation. While the movies don't perform well at the box office, they're generally pretty fun to watch.
I saw Unfinished Business on a plane last year and found it very boring.
I liked that movie. I think that he's been going more in a serious direction recently with films like Hacksaw Ridge.
I forgot that he was in that. That was a great film.
Yeah. Mel Gibson is such a talented director.
Agreed. Bravehart is also one of my favorite movies of all time.
Yeah, but I think that his best work as a director was in Apocalypto.
