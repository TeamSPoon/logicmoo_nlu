Do you like the hulk?
Not really
Thats my least favorite superhero movie
Exacly, how is he a superhero if he cant control himself when he hulks out
I have no idea, dont even know why the avengers recruited him
Exactly, the movie would have been just as good without him
The avengers is still a great movie though, and i like bruce banner himself
Just not when he hulks out
Nope.
I do like his character and tony stark becoming friends
