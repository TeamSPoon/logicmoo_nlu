I heard the new Miley Cyrus song today, it was shocking.
Shocking? In what way?
Well, it was more like her old stuff, I mean her stuff right after Disney but before Bangerz.
So, like The Climb?
Yeah kind of. It wasn't bad.
What's it called.
Malibu. It's kind of soft and romantic but summery.
Nice. I really like her music, even the new stuff everyone hates.
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't always my thing. I actually liked Wrecking Ball despite the weird video.
Yeah, that was a good one.
Malibu is about her relationship with Liam Hemsworth. It's not my favourite song of the summer, but it's pretty good.
Well, that's promising. I'm glad she's still making music.
I also really like the stuff I'm hearing from her younger sister, Noah.
I haven't heard about her.
If you like Miley's stuff, you'll probably like it. I was listening to I'm Stuck earlier, very catchy.
I will have to check that out, I like catchy!
It's good. I've been listening to it more and more.
Do you think Miley is going to come out with more songs?
I bet she will, probably a new album soon.
I hope so.
