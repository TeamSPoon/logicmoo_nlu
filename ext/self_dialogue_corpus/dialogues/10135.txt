Are you a Sylvester Stallone fan?
Oh yeah, I like Rambo alot.
Oh, I haven't seen that one.
He's a Commando who kills everyone in the forest.
It's always fun seeing those types of movies.
Yeah, it's cool how muscular he is.
I don't think the movie would have been as good with a skinny actor.
There were tons of action stars in the 80s who were massive.
Van Damme, Arnold were some of my favorites.
Those are my favorites as well. They don't have many of those actors now.
