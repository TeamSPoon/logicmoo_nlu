Are you into the "Fast and Furious" movies?
Not really. I saw the first one but that's it.
Oh. I love them all. Paul Walker is sure missed.
He was a great actor. Believe it or not, he was good in "She's All That"
That sounds familiar. Who else was in that?
Freddy Prinze Jr., Rachael Lee Cook, Matthew Lillard, etc.
Oh yeah, I remember now. That was good.
I like Freddy Prinze Jr. He's a decent actor.
He was good in "I know what you did last summer"
He was. Jennifer Love-Hewitt was great, too.
They all were. That movie was based on a book you know.
Yeah, the book is great but the movie even better.
Do you like other movies based from books?
Yeah I do. The Harry Potter movies are good.
They are good. The first and second were my favorites.
Emma Watson is gorgeous. She just went on to star in "Beauty and the Beast"
I know, I haven't seen that yet.
Daniel Radcliffe did some theatre acting, did you know that?
Yeah, he had to do a nude scene, too.
Yes, crazy.
