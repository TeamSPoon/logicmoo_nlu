I have Comcast cable tv, and I love their OnDemand where you can watch all kinds of tv shows and movies for free.
What kind of free movies do you like to watch?
I like watching all the old movies on TCM, Turner Classic Movies.
I like TCM because there are a lot of great old movies people wouldn't be able to see anymore without that channel.
My daughter and son-in-law live with me, so I have to watch a LOT of movies they like.
Everybody likes different kinds of movies, so I bet it's things you wouldn't normally watch.
I'm not into vampires and scary stuff. But my daughter LOVES the Twilight movies series. They have all five movies up on OnDemand right now until October.
Uh oh. So you're getting a Twilight overload?
I already have for years because she has the dvds. I can't even count how many times I've watched a Twilight movie, over a hundred I'm sure.
Wow, she really loves Twilight huh?
She watches the dvds, on OnDemand, and on the cable tv channels whenever it's on. Her and my son-in-law sit and quote the lines before the characters even say them.
Oh how funny. They must really enjoy it.
They laugh hysterically when they do it. She will say something like Bella's line, "How long have you been seventeen?" and then my son-in-law will say Edward's line. "A while," and then they will both giggle.
It's kind of cute that they have that much fun with it.
My daughter fell in love with Twilight reading the books so much, that for years she has been talking about how much she wants to move to Washington state where the movie was shot.
Why hasn't she moved?
She can't afford it, thank God. I wouldn't want her to leave since she is my only child, but I don't want to move to Washington.
Why not? I heard it's a pretty state, with nice weather.
It's full of trees, and I have allergies. And I keep telling her all the serial killers go to Washington.
Unfortunately, serial killers seem to live all over the US nowadays. But I can see what you mean about the trees and allergies.
