Hey man, do you like pop music?
No I don't, not really.
Why not?
It feels like a lot of the same kind of thing, you know?
Sometimes I guess. Anything in particular you don't like?
I really don't like how things are very major sounding, it feels recycled.
I guess I can see what you're saying.
That's the biggest thing for me, but there are some really good pop songs that I like.
Can you think of any?
I don't really know the names, but Daft Punk I know did a good pop song lately.
Oh that one, yeah that one is really good.
Yes I like that one a lot, until the radio played it to death anyways.
Yeah they played it for a long time.
That's something else I don't like about pop music, you hear the same stuff over and over again and you memorize every note.
Isn't that fun though?
No I like to be kept on my toes and expect something new. Pop music is predictable.
That's what makes it so good though, you can dance easier to it.
I don't like dancing. Maybe that's why I don't like pop that much.
That could be it, a lot of pop music is written to be danced to.
I'll have to find some good pop songs that I like and let you know which ones I think are better.
