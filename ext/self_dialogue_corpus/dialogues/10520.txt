Hey! How are you doing today?
Im doing well, how about yourself
Doing pretty good.
Nice! you do anything cool lately?
Yea, actually I got free tickets to a movie a couple days ago.
Oh cool, from where?
My favorite radio station was holding a contest, and I called in and won.
Oh sweet what station?
Z90.3 they play like top hits, pop, and a little bit of hip hop
Oh I love pop music, whose your favorite singer?
Hmm, Its probably a toss up between Katy Perry, and Taylor swift, how about yours?
Im more of an Ariana grande fan myself. So what movie did you see?
I saw Logan
Oh sweet, I wanted to see that how was it?
It was really amazing, it took a different twist on what normal marvel movies do, it was a little darker, and really told a story.
Wow thats awesome, wouldnt expect that out of marvel.
Yea, and Hugh Jackman acting was superb as always, he really added life to the movie.
Sweet, so you think its worth movie theater pricing then?
Yea for sure, you should go down and see it next chance you get.
Yea, I probably will, thanks.
