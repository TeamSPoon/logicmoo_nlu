Have you watched much baseball yet this season?
No, I've been busy wrapping up the school year.  I'm looking forward to having some time now.
Can you believe that the Twins are leading the AL Central?
I saw that the other day.  How is that possible?
Last year they were so bad.  Guess that left no where to go but up.
Still, it's surprising.  Wonder how long they can hang on.
Who knows?  Nobody in that division is killing it, so they may be ok throughout the summer.
Who's in second place right now?
The Indians and the Tigers are a game back, while the White Sox and the Royals are under .500.
Crazy how the Royals have stumbled so far.  I think everyone expected them to be better.
Yeah, I guess sometimes it's hard to sustain success.
And injuries haven't helped them out much.
True.  Maybe they will get things turned around by the All-Star break and make a push in the second half.
Yeah, maybe.  But on another note, how about those Astros?
No kidding!  They have been on fire so far.  By far the best team in baseball.
It's the pitching.  They have a pretty good rotation.
Their bats aren't bad either.
It would be cool to see them in the World Series.
A Houston/Milwaukee match-up would be an advertiser's nightmare.
But baseball fans would love it!!
