Why do you think so many horror movies release in August and September?
That's right before Halloween. They want to get people in the mood for being scared.
But August is two months before Halloween. No one wants to see a horror movie then?
It's more of a pallet cleanser. Something to watch after the summer blockbuster season is over.
Still, you would think they'd want to release them closer to Halloween?
Sure, but then every horror film would be released at the same time, and they'd all drown each other out.
I guess so. Maybe people want to be scared no matter the time of the year.
I'm sure. Remember Krampus?
What about it? Was it a horror film?
It was a Christmas, horror, comedy film.
Talk about a genre blending film.
Yeah, but it just goes to show you how people like different things no matter the time of year.
Is horror-comedy really that popular?
Kind of. Zombieland was huge, and that was a horror comedy hybrid.
Are there any others?
There's been a few. Like Ghostbusters, and The Evil Dead series for example.
If that's all, it doesn't sound like it's a very popular genre.
It's not unpopular. Though, true horror films are definitely more common.
All this talk of horror movie makes me want to see one. Anything coming out soon?
Polaroid is coming out in a few months. It's basically a Goosebumps rip-off though.
