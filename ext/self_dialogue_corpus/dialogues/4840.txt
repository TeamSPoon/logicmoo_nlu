Boy the Mets really needed that win last night.
Yes they did. They got a great performance from DeGrom
Yeah he turned in a quality start just when they needed it.
I mean to silence those Angels hitters is pretty impressive.
For sure. To shut them out is a great feat.
Now they just have to try and build from this victory
Yeah one win is not a turn around, so they still have a lot of work to do.
Definitely. But this could be a springboard for them. They still have plenty of time in this season.
True. Reyes helped him out of a jam in the 7th inning.
Yeah he kind of got lucky on that blooper, but the Mets needed some luck
Yeah they were definitely do for some
They did an okay job on Trout
Yeah I think he only had two singles, so he didn't do too much damage
Yeah, they might not be so lucky the rest of the series
It's definitely going to be interested that's for sure
Now the Mets turn to Zack Wheeler to see if they can keep this going
What type of year is he having?
He's doing okay he is 2-2 this year with a 3.76 ERA
Okay. Not bad.
Not bad at all. He has been pitching pretty well lately.
