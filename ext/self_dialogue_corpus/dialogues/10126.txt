What do you think of the Jurassic Park sequels?
Lost World was okay. What did you think of the third?
It's underrated. It's pretty entertaining, I think.
I just don't like that Tea Leoni is in it; I don't like her.
Me neither.
Jurassic World was a lot of fun to watch but doesn't stand up over time.
Really?
Yeah, I own it, and watched it twice, but not in over a year.
Why?
Too unbelievable, bad parenting like crazy.
