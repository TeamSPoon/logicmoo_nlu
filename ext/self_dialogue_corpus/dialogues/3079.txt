Do you like the Pro Bowl?
No, I think it is a joke.
Why do you think that?
I think that it's all for show and irrelevant.
I somewhat agree, although I think those players deserve recognition.
Yes, but an All-NFL team would be better.
I can agree with that.
It just seems that the Pro Bowl game is for revenue, not rewarding success.
I think it's good that the fans are involved, though.
Yes, that is a plus, but it's almost unnecessary.
I wonder if there are other ways to get fans involved like that.
I'm not sure, but maybe scheduling the Pro Bowl at a different date.
Perhaps that would work - obviously the Super Bowl is the prime event.
The Super Bowl is one of the best events in the world.
I agree with you, but generally only Americans play the sport.
Yes, this is true, and likely for good reasons.
Well football is harder to play in areas with few resources.
This is definitely true - not enough resources for pads and the like.
Yes, I agree - which is why soccer is the world sport.
I'm not a huge soccer fan, but I agree.
