Hey, what's your favorite genre of music in rock sub-categories?
That's a tough one. I'd have to say altern-rock or 90's rock.
Both are such awesome genres. I think I like nu-metal as well.
Yeah, I really liked Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park in their good years.
So did I! I have missed bands like that a lot. I can't find any new music that compares to them.
Story of The Year was okay, but still nothing compared to the early 2000's stuff.
Yeah, they're alright. I feel like after the emo era, rock music really changed.
It did, but we still have some good new groups. Have you heard of the American Authors?
No, I haven't. What songs do you recommend?
I definitely recommend their song, "Born to Run". The song is so inspiring.
What is it about?
The song is about basically being born to be free and to live your life the way you want.
I can definitely see how that is inspiring. My favorite inspirational song is, "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman.
That's an old one but a good one at that. It is kind of sad, though.
It sure is, but it really inspires me to do what I love and just go for it.
Yeah, I can see how you would get that out of the song.
I also love the song, "Shake it Off". I know it's more pop than rock, but it's really inspiring since we were on the topic.
Oh, for sure, that is one of the most inspirational songs about being yourself.
I know Taylor Swift and Katy are having a feud lately, which team are you on?
I'm Team Taylor for sure! I love her music!
