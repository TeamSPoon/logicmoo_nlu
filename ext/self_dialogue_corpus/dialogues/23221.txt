Have you ever seen Fly Away Home?
Is that the movie about the donkeys?
No. It's about geese.
I'm not familiar with that one.
A girl's mom dies and she goes to go live with her dad and they raise geese together.
That sounds cheesy.
It kind of was but I still liked it.
Who was the main actor in it?
No idea, no one super noteworthy.
Oh, wait a second, maybe I have seen it. Was that the one with the fake giant goose?
Yes! They use the giant goose to help guide the geese home.
That was such a crappy movie.
You really think so? I liked it.
Well, I really hated it.
Aw, that's too bad. It actually brought tears to my eyes.
No way! It was so predictable.
I guess but I feel like most movies kind of are.
Not to that extent.
Well, I'm sorry you didn't like it.
I'm not.
