Have you seen Brad Pitt's new Netflix movie?
The War Machine?? I have not!
I heard that it was not very good.
Really? I would expect for it to be amazing since it's Brad Pitt.
Yea, I plan to watch it still though.
Right, I don't want to rely on the critics.
What about Snatched?
Is that with Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer?
Yes! It's a weird combination.
I did see it, and I did not like it at all.
Me too, it wasn't funny and the jokes were pretty dry.
I know! It would have been a great Mother's Day movie.
I know this is an old one, but Snowden is really good.
I've seen that! Is that with Joseph Gordon-Levitt?
Yes, he was fantastic!
He played Snowden so well.
I would really like to see Wonder Woman!
Oh yes, that sounds like it will be an action packed movie.
It starts showing tomorrow!
Wonderful, I'll have to look at showtimes.
