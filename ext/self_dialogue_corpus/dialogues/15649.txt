Schonberg's music most certainly has symmetry. He even talks about it.
Explain
So you understand the twelve tone technique. Yes?
Yes, I think so. Use all the note equally which prevents you from being in a key
Yes. Ok. On top of that there 4 postulates you should follow.
Postulates. This isn't math you know.
Well, that's what Schonberg called them.
Maybe Schonberg was a secretly a mathematician wanna be.
i don't know. Anyway, so the postulates are basically rules that apply to the twelve tone technie that makes up the rows, or series,. or those "notes" get it?
i think so. You're talking about those dots and notes that appear on those lines.
Yes. preceisly,. You can see they form a pattern when in series. And not the postulates are them. First the row is a ordering of the notes.
Um... what?
A row is the ordering of the 12 tones. or how they're basically arranged.
Oh I see. Ok go on.
Ok, now the second postulate for the 12 tones is that in a row, there is no repeated note.
Easy enough
And this is a tough one. Third, a row maybe be subjected to interval perseving transformations.
what?
A transformation in music involves things like inversion, retrograde, retrograde inversion, and being the same as the poriginal or prime.
Whoosh.. Mind blown. I have no idea
