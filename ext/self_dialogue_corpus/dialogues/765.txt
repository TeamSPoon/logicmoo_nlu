What do you think of the Buccaneers?
I think they are an okay team.
I like them when Warren Sapp was on the team.
How long ago was that?
That was in the 90's - he was a lot of fun to watch.
I remember those games!
He was always so animated.
They used to be coached by Tony Dungy, right?
Yes, he was a great coach.
Yes, he really was. Did he take them to the super bowl?
No that was Jon Gruden.
That's right!
But is was actually Tony Dungy's team that was put in place.
He was probably mostly responsible for that Super Bowl trip.
I think so.
He was such a good play caller!
I can't believe they ever let Dungy go.
I know - the whole town was in disbelief.
It was a sad time.
They were a fun team to watch under Dungy and Gruden.
