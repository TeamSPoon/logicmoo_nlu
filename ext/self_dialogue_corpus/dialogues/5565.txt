Hard to believe The Pacifier is a Disney film.
That does not surprise me one bit.
Why would you think that?
I mean think about the title.
I guess you could say that.
The Rock didnt do a bad job with it either.
He played a funny role.
It was a bit campy in all fairness.
Yeah I can see where you would say that.
An action movie centered around a babys pacifier is not believable either
