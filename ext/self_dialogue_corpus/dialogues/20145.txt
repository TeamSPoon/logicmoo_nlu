Did you catch Arrival?
I don't recall that one. Who's in it.
Adam Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker
Hmmm, still not ringing any bells.
It deal with aliens coming to earth.
Oh, so like an invasion movie.
No not at all, more like a mystery.
So like War of the Worlds?
No, that was definitely an invasion movie. This one is much more cerebral
How so?
It deals with how to communicate with aliens.
Interesting, so how do we communicate with them.
Well I don't want to give too much away, but Adams plays a linguist that learns how to communicate with the Aliens.
Okay, does she save the world.
Well in some way.
But probably not what I think
Right...exactly.
And Jeremy Renner is the love interest.
Yes, in a way.
Always have to have the love interest.
