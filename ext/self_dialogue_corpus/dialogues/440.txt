I'm ready for football season to start.
Me too.
I'm going to a few of the Dolphins games this year.
I am too. You get tickets already?
Yes, I'm going to see them play the Bucaneers.
When is that game?
It's September 10th?
I I'm going to the game when the play the Jets in October.
The Jets suck. The dolphins will mop the floor with them.
Yeah they will. That's why I chose that game.
You gonna paint your face?
No, that's a bit too far for my taste.
But you gotta support the home team.
I am supporting the home team by paying for a ticket to see their game.
When I go I am going to paint my face and so will all my pals?
Why?
We wanna spell a word?
What word are you trying to spell?
DOLPHINS.
More like Doofus!
