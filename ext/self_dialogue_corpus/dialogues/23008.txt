Did you see beauty and the beast?
Yes I loved it.
They did a great job making it more modern
I thought so too just the subtle changes were big.
Do you think she would have stayed given different circumstances?
I don't think so.
Why?
Fear is a powerful emotion.
That's true.
I thought they made the beast look great.
I thought he looked good too.
He's kind but has to appear scary because well he's scared himself.
He was a little aggressive wasn't he.
Yeah but he had good reason to be.
I'm glad it had a happy ending.
Did you never watch or read the stories before?
Nope.
So it was all a big surprise for you then.
Yes it was.
Wish I could of had that experience.
