Why is Boba Fett so popular?
I actually have no idea.
He barely shows up in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, and when he does, he gets killed.
And not heroically, he dies like a punk.
I think he gets bonked in the back of the head by accident like one of the three stooges and knocked into the Sarlacc pit.
What the hell is the Sarlacc pit in the first place?
It's like the vagina dentata of the desert.
Wow, that makes Fett's death even sader. But people still love him.
They also tried to hype him up with the prequels too, added a dad, made him Polynesian or something. It's just a mess, the whole backstory.
