Have you been to the movies lately>
no the last movie I saw in the theater was Harry Potter
which one
the first on the sorccers stone;
oh wow that was a long time ago
yes but I still remember how good it was
it is a classic'
Daniel Radcliff is so small in that one
yes he is, all of the cast are so young
if you watch the first one then the second all of the kids grew up on camera
they were so cute when they were little
i AGREE
Did you like the 1st Dumbledore or the 2nd the best
the 1st one
so did I it was never the same aftrer his death
he became hippy dumbledore
Yes I noticed that
he looked creepy with the hairband in his beard
wow yes he did, I think his acting was still good though
Yes it was
