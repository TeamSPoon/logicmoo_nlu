What is your favoirtie Disney movie?  Mine is The Lion King.
I like that one too.  I really like Timon and Pumba.
Did you know that they are based on two characters from Hamlet?
Really? Who?
They are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
That's right.  That movie has a connection to Hamlet.
Which Hamlet character do you think is Rafiki?
I'm not sure. I don't think it follows the story that well.
I guess Scar is Claudius.
Yes, and Mufasa is the old king.
