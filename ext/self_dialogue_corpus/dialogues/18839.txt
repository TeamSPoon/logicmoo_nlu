Do you watch music shows like American Idol?
I used to, is that show even on anymore?
I am unsure really.
I think my favorite artist to come from that show was Carrie Underwood.
Yes! She has grown so much!
I remember watching her sing to rock, she was out of her element.
Country is absolutely best for her, she sings it well.
I think my favorite song by her was "Before He Cheats."
That song made a lot of men leary on women!
Well I find it funny, the video was great!
She was so young when she was on that show.
I am glad she won though, her voice is so powerful.
Have you seen her in concert?
No, have you?
Yes, she puts on a great show.
Is her voice just as great live?
Of course, sounds even better than she did on American Idol.
She has learned a lot since then.
I hope she makes music for a long time.
I have not really heard anything new from her lately.
