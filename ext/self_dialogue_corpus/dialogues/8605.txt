What rock band is your favorite?
I've been a big fan of Foo Fighters since forever.
Oh yeah, they are awesome, I like them too.
Yeah and Dave Grohl is awesome in the band.
Yeah, did you know he was the drummer for Nirvana?
Yeah of course! He's also a band member in Queens of the Stone Age.
Ah yeah, their song No One Knows rocks!
Yeah, I'm listening to it now.
I'm listening to Foo Fighter's song Everlong.
Oh man; that's gotta be my favorite track by them.
