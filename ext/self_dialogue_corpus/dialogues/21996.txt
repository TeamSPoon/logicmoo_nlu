What is your favorite animated film?
I really liked Tangled.
Have not seen it.. what is it about?
It is a take on Rapunzel. Mandy Moore is in it.
I do like her. I will have to check it out.
She is going to be in that new scary shark movie.
47 Meters Down. i am looking forward to it.
I live in Florida and will not be seeing it, Ever.
I guess you don't want to be scared forever.
Ya, I have seen jaws of course but refuse to watch open water.
I heard that was really good though.
I take it you have not watched that either?
Correct, But I would, gladly.
I think it is too scary an idea for floridians to confront.
Fair enough. what scary movie would you watch?
Well I recently saw split.
Was that a horrror?
Not a typical one. But I thought it could fall into that category or thriller. Scary enough for me.
I liked that it is somewhat based on real life. Those are always the scariest.
Yes when they can actually occur is the scariest thought.
