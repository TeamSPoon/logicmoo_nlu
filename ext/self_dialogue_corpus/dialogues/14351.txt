Who's the tallest player in the NBA anyway?
Currently playing?
Yes, as of now.
Did you know there have only been 25 players who were listed as being 59 or shorter?
That doesn't answer my question.
No, not yet.
So as of now, who's the shortest player who's on an active roster of an NBA team?
isaiah Thomas with the Celtics is the shortest currently. But he's no way as short as the shortest ever
Who was the shortest player to ever play in the NBA?
That would be Muggsy Bogues
Who did he play for? Was he any good?
This dude was 5'3. He literally looked like a midget or a hobbit next to other players. It was ridiculous. And yes, he was actually pretty good.
Imean even for a normal average person, 5'3 is pretty short.
Even for a girl, it's pretty short.
And imagine this guy's playing in the NBA...
he played for 14 years for 4 different teams
He's gotta have some game, man,
Dude was fast. He looked like a little midget running past all these slow moving giants. Dude was a legend
I wonder if he ever tried to dunk and succeeded...
That reminds me sprite had a commercial about it. But in real life, no. The shortest player to ever dunk on the standard size basket was 5'5 I believe.
