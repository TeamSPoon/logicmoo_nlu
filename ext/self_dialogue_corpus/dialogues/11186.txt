Who is your favorite fashion designer?
I really love Alexander McQueen.
What do you like about McQueen's designs?
I love the imaginative creativity of his designs.
They are very original and organic, aren't they.
Yes. Very lovely, and very well thought out.
I imagine in is difficult for the current head designer, Sarah, to match his design capabilities?
Yes, I a sure. I believe they are using a mix of his older designs that were never made public.
That is a good idea.
Yes. It keeps the essence of his fashion house alive even though he is gone.
It was nice to see the Duchess of Cambridge have his house design her wedding gowns for the Royal Wedding, wasn't it.
Absolutely gorgeous.
It was classic McQueen, but not over the top.
Right. Both of her gowns had a nice touch of delicacy to them.
Yes. A bit less costume, and bit more elegance.
Are you enjoying McQueen's current season?
Yes. The lace and yarn dresses are very nice
I agree. I am enjoying the rustic colored color palette.
Yes. The colors, fabrics, and leather goods have a bit of a western feel.
I agree. Very relaxed, but still very Alexander McQueen.
