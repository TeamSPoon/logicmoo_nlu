What do  you think about pop music?
I generally steer away from it, as it appeals to a bland, undeveloped musical taste.
It's generally geared toward younger people and is designed to sell as much as possible.
Exactly: "designed to sell" is the perferct description.
Are there any pop artists that you think are good though?
There have been some good pop artists, like Carol King, and some rock artists, like David Bowie, that have put out pop songs.
That's true. What about more recent music?
It's hard for me to listen to the music of today, but every once in a while I hear something that isn't bad.
What would you consider decent examples of today's pop music?
I have heard some songs by Adele and Bruno Mars that are tolerable.
