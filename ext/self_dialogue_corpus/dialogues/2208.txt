I can't wait for the NFL season to start.
Me, too! It seems like the months between February and August have nothing else to watch.
What do you think about the St. Louis Rams moving to LA?
It really felt to me like a betrayal to their fans. I think they should have stayed in Missouri.
Who do you think will win the NFC West this year?
For sure it will be the 49ers.
You are crazy. Did you see them last year?
I think they're going to be starting Brian Hoyer this year as qb, and they'll be fantastic.
For sure the Seahawks will win the division.
No way. Since Russell Wilson got married and had a kid, he's slowed way down.
That's not true. He looked really great at the end of the season last year.
Hoyer is going to beat the socks off the Seahawks. Or the feathers!
How are you feeling about the NFC East?
Oh, the Cowboys are finally going to be able to pull through this year.
Are you sure? Once Jerry World was built, it seems to me they're too spoiled.
No way. I think they are going to take the East division this year.
Have you ever been to a game at Jerry's World? It's a madhouse there.
No, I've never had the pleasure. Someday I'd love to make the trip though.
I think Eli Manning will bring the Giants back to a division title.
Prescott will pull through for the Cowboys and beat those Giants into submission.
