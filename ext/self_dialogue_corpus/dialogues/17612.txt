What do you think about The Violent Femmes?
I only know a couple of songs by them.
Which songs?
Blister in the Son and Kiss Off
Oh yeah, those are some of their most popular songs. They have sooo many great songs!
How long have they been together?
Since the 80's
REALLY??? I didn't know that. I thought they got together in the 90's.
Yeah! Blister in the Sun was actually on their first Album which came out in 1983.
That is so crazy. Their music doesn't sound 80's at all.
Yeah...they were waaaay ahead of their time.

They have 9 albums. Their newest one just came out in 2016.
Which one is your favorite?
That's easy. Hallowed Ground.
When did it come out?
1984...it's my fave album of all time. I will never get tired of listening to it.
I've never listened to it.
It's great cause it sounds bluegrassy plus the lead singers voice is amazing.
Hmmm...that sounds cool. I'll have to give it a listen!
