Which of the Beatles is your favorite?
Honestly, George Harrison is my pick. He's one of my favorite guitarists of all time.
Good pick! Personally, I'd have to say Paul McCartney, I love him with Wings too.
So, what do you think about Ringo?
Ringo who? Oh yeah, almost forgot about him....
Hahahaha! Everyone seems to forget about Ringo!
He can't seem to catch a break, now can he? At least he and Paul are still alive though.
Some people think Paul is actually dead, and was replaced. Isn't that funny?
That's almost as absurd as saying Gucci Mane died and was cloned!
Yeah, some people believe the dumbest things!
