Who's your favorite music artist or band?
The Offspring. I liked them when I first heard their song "Come Out and Play."
They're pretty good. I know the song you're talking about and I remember other songs of theirs that got played on the radio.
Yes, they also had "Pretty Fly for a White Guy," and some other songs off of later albums that made the radio.
What was their stuff like before "Come Out and Play," came along?
"Come Out and Play" was off their third album Smash, released in 1994. It's much different from their first album, which came out in 1989.
I've heard that the first album is much more raw and more punk.
Yes, it's fast and hard, the songs have a garage sound. The lyrics are very full of angst and mad at the world, which is something I identified with.
I might have to check that out. Which songs are your favorites?
I think you would like it. Demons is a good song, as is Elders.
Are those the songs that had lyrics you identified with?
Yes, Elders is about how the older generation made promises they haven't kept and has ruined things for young people.
Wow that sounds interesting. Any others you'd recommend?
The best part of that album is three songs on the second side, Thousand Days, Blackball, and I'll Be Waiting.
What do you like about those songs?
They flow together so well and they really pump me up. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to them together.
You sound pretty knowledgeable about them.
Like I said I liked them from the first time I listened to them. Their later albums like Conspiracy of One and Ixnay on the Hombre are so different from their early stuff, but I like them a lot too.
I'm going to have to check them out. Any other of their stuff that you recommend?
Oh yes, the 2003 album Splinter is great. I used to use some of those songs as my alarm in the morning.
