Are you watching the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards series?
Is that the series for the finals?
Yes.  The series is tied 2-2 now.
That's probably a good series.  Who's been playing the best so far?
Well, Isiah Thomas has been having some good games
I like Washington.  Wall is one of my favorite players.
It's been really physical.  Isiah had his teeth knocked out again.
I really would like Washington to win, though.  Celtics have been a dynasty long enough!
That's true, but they're a great franchise.  They deserve to start winning titles again.
Nah... Cleveland will win it all again.
Not if the Warriors have their way!
I tihnk the Warriors are overrated.  They'll cave to the Cavs again.
Well, at least we don't have to worry about Washington playing them.  They won't make it that far this year.
Well, neither will the Celtics!
OK, I'll give you that.  If Durant stays healthy, they may have a chance.
Nah.... I'm telling you.  Draymond Green will get thrown out of a few games again and it'll be the Cavs all over.
Well, I can't argue with that or be mad.  LeBron deserves all the titles he wants.
True.  He's definitely the best player.
Absolutely.  I wouldn't mind Cleveland winning again.
Me neither.
