What is your favorite Drake album?
Nothin was the Same is my personal favorite.
Did you like the sounds he used?
I think there was enough experimentation for the track to flow well.
Yeah I agree and lyrically he was on top of his game.
It was an all around robust sound.
I loved Tuscan Leather.
Is that what started the album off?
Yeah and it got your jusices flowing.
He can spit better than almost 90% of rappers out there.
