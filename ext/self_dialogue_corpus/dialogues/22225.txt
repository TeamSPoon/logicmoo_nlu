Do you like superhero movies?  I was going to go see 'Wonder Woman.'
I'm not really a big fan.
Are there any you like at all?
I loved Iron Man, the first one.  And I saw 'Daredevil' on Netflix, but that's it.
Any reason you don't like them?
I was just never into that genre even as a kid.  And now, I feel like they make too many of these movies.
True, but they're probably here to stay.
You think so?
Well for one, look at the rate they're making these.  And also look at how much source material there is for it.
Yea, but I'm sure people will get tired of them eventually.
I don't know about that, man.
I think there's already a backlash against it.
Well, consider this.  Westerns were popular for like 2 or 3 decades.
I suppose.  I guess there's no escaping it for the time being.
You're stuck with it.  But I say give it another shot, because these movies are starting to become more diverse.
Story wise?
Yup.  More complex plots and different stories to tell.
I still won't go line up to see these things, but let me know if there's ever one that's too good to pass.
Okay, I'll be your filter for these movies.
Sounds good.  Thanks.
