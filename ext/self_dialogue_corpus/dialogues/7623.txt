It's Harry Potter weekend, are you going to watch?
Oh yeah, definitely. I really love Neville.
Neville! Out of everyone at Hogwarts, you like Neville. I bet you are going to tell me you like Luna too, huh?
What is wrong with that? Neville got so brave at the end standing up to Voldemort.
He did, he really grew as a character. My favorite is the Weasley's mom!
Oh yeah! I just loved that way she defended Ginny from Bellatrix.
Yeah, that fight scene was so powerful. I really loved it. I can't wait to watch now.
I know I'm so excited. I don't think I'm leaving my couch.
Harry Potter here I come!
Don't forget those tissues, Dumbledore dying is very sad.
