What are your thoughts on Katy Perry?
She's alright.
Any of her songs favorites of yours?
I love Dark Horse.  What about you?
That one song about fireworks...
You mean "Firework?"
Yeah, that's a great one.
I liked it, but it isn't my favorite.
Hoenstly, it's not really just about the song for me.
What's it about then?
Have you seen the video for it?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
Well I love the message it gives.
How so?
Like it shows the outcasts and stuff just embracing their life in the moment and having fun.
Yeah, that's true.
It really gives a great message to people who have never felt like they were worth anything.
I never thought about it like that.  Good point.
Yeah, I really liked Katy Perry after seeing that.
I completely understand.
