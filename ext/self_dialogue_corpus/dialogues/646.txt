Football is an exciting sport.
I loved playing football when I was little.
Me too.
We played two-hand touch when we were really little and then flag football.
Yeah, us too.  Then we progressed to tackle football.
I'm so glad that I played.
Me too. It's a great sport.
Do you think the pros started out in flag football?
I don't know, but they definitely know how to play rougher than that.
I'm so glad we can still play flag football as adults.
Yes, my body couldn't handle being tackled now and I love the sport
Anything high intensity and rough is so fun to watch.
I can't wait to see the match-up tonight between the Steelers and the Ravens.
Me too.
Do you think the Steelers will win?
Maybe, but the Ravens have a strong defense.
The Steelers are strong on offense, though.
Yeah, I think Brown will get some TD's.
I hope so.  I'd like the Steelers to win.
Not me, I'm for the Ravens.
