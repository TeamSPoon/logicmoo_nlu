Are you a fan of the James Bond movies?
I could take them or leave them.
Me too. There are so many.
I only saw a few.
The only one I remember was Die Another Day.
What year was that one out?
I think it was 2002.
I saw a few but don't even remember their names. Was there one called Casino Royale?
Yes, that was out in 2006.
I saw parts of that movie.
