Are you familiar with the Shrek franchise?
The one that Dreamworks did?
Yes, that's the one.
I've seen several of them.
Which one is your favorite.
I think that the first one is the best, but I never saw Puss in Boots.
What do you like about the first one?
I don't know; it's a solid self-contained story that doesn't take itself too seriously.
I personally thing that Shrek 2 is the best.
Why is that?
The second movie introduces Puss in Boots to the ensemble, which does a good job of shaking up the hero, foil, romantic interest triangle and allows more nuanced character interactions.
I'm not sure I had considered that. Who voices Puss again?
It's Antonio Banderas.
That's right.
The really masterful thing about the Shrek Cinematic Universe is that it co-opts centuries of European fairy tales and folk stories into a cohesive whole and explores the logistical outcomes of such a shared world, while maintaining a lighthearted atmosphere conducive to a series of humorous fantasy jaunts.
It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into the Shrek movies.
Furthermore, it pulls together an all-star cast and gives them opportunities to live up to their voice acting potential.
I noticed that pun you put in with "all star."
Yes, Smash Mouth's 1999 hit was also a perfect choice that really captured the emotional milieu of the film.
I suppose it was.
