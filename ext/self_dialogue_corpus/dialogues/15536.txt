Hey what's the saddest song you've ever heard.
I'd think I'd have to go with "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa
Yeah, thats definitely one of the saddest I've heard.
Yeah, I think that the fact it's dedicated to Paul Walker makes it even sadder for me.
I can see that definitely.
Every time I hear the song I literally see him driving off into the sun set and it gets me every time.
Yeah. I wasn't trying to ruin the mood.
No not at all. What about you? What is the saddest song you've ever heard.
I'd have to say "Someone Like You" by Adele.
Oh yeah? How come?
Whne she sings it you really hear her anguish and what the song means to her.
Interesting.
Yeah, if I'm not mistaken she always crys at the end of the song because it's that painful for her.
Really? I had no idea.
Yeah, that song really means and represents a lot for her.
Thats nuts, but I respect it a lot.
Yeah. Artists like her are really far and between in the industry.
Oh I agree whole heartedly. It's very rare to have artists like that.
I wish we would see more of them.
I don't know it's probably best to have the few we do. It would probably numb us other wise.
