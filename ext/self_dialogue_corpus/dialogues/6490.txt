Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
The one with Emma Watson as Belle?
Yes, that one!
Yes, I thought the singing was great!
Me too. I can't believe they made that guy look like the beast the entire movie.
I know! It was wonderfully cast with Emma Thompson, Kevin Cline, and all those famous people.
Yes, I thought so too! Do you know when it will be on DVD?
Oh, it's already out on DVD!
Oh good, I wonder if Target has it?
I heard they were selling out quickly, so you may want to go soon!
