What's that that you're listening to?
This is Rob Crow's new album. Good stuff, huh?
Yeah, I like it. I thought it was Pinback though?
Rob Crow is the guy who does most of the singing in Pinback, so you weren't far off.
Oh, nice! I can pretty much always enjoy some Pinback.
I think they're super underrated. They don't put out albums that often, but pretty much everything they've released is really good.
So Rob Crow has a some solo stuff too?
Yep. He's actually got like 3-4 solo albums out.
Wow, sounds like he's fairly prolific, between those albums and Pinback.
Yeah, and it's all pretty good stuff. The solo stuff is kind of Pinback-lite, but since Pinback only puts albums out like once every five years, I'll take it.
Haha, true. Here's one for you: have you heard of MacDemarco?
I keep hearing his name. He seems like a goofball.
He is, but it's mostly pretty endearing. His music isn't super goofy.
What's it like?
Mostly it's this chilled out pop/indie music. Very solid melodies.
Cool, I'll check him out.
Start with 'Salad Days'; I think that's his best one.
How many albums does he have?
Four albums and an EP.
OK, so he's actually been around for a while, I guess.
