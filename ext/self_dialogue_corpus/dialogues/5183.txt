There is talk of a new Mulan coming out sometime in 2018.
I loved Mulan when I was growing up. Is it going to be a Mulan 2?
Actaully I heard it was suppose to be a live action film.
So it won't be a cartoon at all. Will it still be a musical?
They said at first it wasn't going to be, but I read later that they changed their minds.
I loved the songs from the first one so hopefully they can capture the same feel.
I wonder if they will bring Mushu back and if so how will they create him in the live action version.
I don't know, but he was such a funny character I hope they bring him back also.
Well when it comes out, I will definatly call you.
We will have to go see this in theater, it's always better there.
