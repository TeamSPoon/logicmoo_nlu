I've been getting back into a lot of the rock from the 90s lately.
90s Rock was the best!
I know, I found a great playlist on Amazon music and I've been listening to that and the 90s alternative Rock channel they have on there.
What bands do they normally play?
I personally listen to mostly 90s alternative rock, like Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stone Telmple Pilots.
Oh ok, so all the alternative rock greats. You just motivated me to take a trip back in time and listen to all my favorite songs again.
Oh ya, what were your favorite songs?
I have so many favorite songs from that time. If I had to name a few I would definitely say Nirvana, Smells like Teen Spirit.
Of course, that song and the opening riffs of it will always be epic. What else?
Popular by Nada Surf was another favorite of mine.
What about The Cure?
Amazing music! I could never forget The Cure. Friday I'm in Love has to be one of the best songs ever.
Is The Cure Gothic Rock?
I've heard the band categorized that way before but I don't think they liked that label.
Ha, ok well I guess I will continue calling them plain old alternative rock then.
You know what other band I just thought of that was great in the 90s?
Which one?
Bush, remember them? Their lead singer was Gavin Rossdale.
Yes, I remember them.  They were on the soundtrack of a movie I really liked in the mid 90s called Fear.
I saw that movie. The song Come Down was on it.
