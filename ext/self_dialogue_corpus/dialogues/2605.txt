Are you ready for some football?
Seriously dude, I am still cleaning up fireworks from the fourth of July.
That means were more than halfway from the end of last season to the beginning of next. I cannot wait.
How far away is the season?
Just a mere two months before we have weekly television broadcasts for seventeen glorious weeks.
Who is your favorite team again?
Surely you jest. The Pittsburgh Steelers of course!  What other teams are there?
Ah, the New England Patriots, the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers, the San Francisco....
I know, I know. I know there are other teams, of course, I am just saying the Steelers are my favorite.
Are they playing any really good teams this year?
They play the Packers in a Sunday night game.
Who else?
Well, the big game is in December. They are at home against none other than Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.
Mark that down as a loss.
What are you talking about?  No way the Steelers lose that game.
No way? The Steelers never beat the Patriots.
That's just not true.  I admit they haven't beaten them lately; but the series is actually tied 15-15.
You mean the Steelers and the Patriots have played thirty times and neither team has a winning record?
That's absolutely correct.  They have each won fifteen out of thirty games.
I never would have thought that; I thought the Patriots beat everybody all the time. Live and learn.
