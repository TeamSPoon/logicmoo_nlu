How are your guitar lessons coming along?
Not great. I can't seem to get my fingers to do what I want them to do.
Keep at it. I know it's tough.
I love music so much. It's discouraging not to be good at it.
I know. At least you're a good singer.
Thanks. That's one thing I feel I can do all right.
You've always been good at it.
You're a much better guitar player.
Maybe I can show you some pointers.
I'd love that. I want to get better.
We can do that after I get out of work. Do you at least have any chords figured out?
A few but my fingers don't reach and move around well.
You have to limber them up.
I'm trying to.
I'll show you some exercises to help you with that.
I do a few I saw online.
The internet is a wealth of guitar lessons and other info so definitely look things up when you want to learn.
I do that.
You can find videos. Do you use those?
I use Youtube and some lessons a friend sent me on video.
