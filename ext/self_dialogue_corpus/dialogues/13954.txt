Do you like Lady Gaga?
I do.
What's your favorite song of hers?
Poker face because everyone should have one.
I like Born This Way cause it's inspirational to LGBT youth.
She is very involved with the LGBT community.
I love her outfits too.
Yeah the Kermit dolls were something but the meat was too much.
Do you think she will still be making music in 10 years?
I wouldn't doubt it.
