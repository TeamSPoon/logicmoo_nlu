Did you watch the Cubs vs Yankees game?
No, I'm not a Cubs or Yankees fan.
What team do you like?
I'm a St. Louis Cardinals fan.
Why are you a Cards fan?
I was a huge Mark McGwire fan during the homerun chase.
Do you think him and Sammy Sosa should be in the hall of fame?
Of course they should.  Everyone in baseball is on steroids.
Who is your favorite all time Cardinal player?
That's easy the Wizard Ozzy Smith.
Man Ozzy Smith was a beast on RBI baseball.
I loved RBI baseball.  Good times.
I use to play as the Oakland A's.
They had McGwire and Conseco didn't they?
Oh yeah and Dennis Eckersly.
Eckersly threw sidearmed.
Eckersly had one sweet moustache for a baseball player.
I also like Rickey Henderson.
Did you know Ricky played until he was like 40?
Yeah, I think he retired with the Yankees.
