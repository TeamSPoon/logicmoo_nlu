Did you ever have to watch Disney movies in elementary school?
Every time the teacher was absent, yeah.
My favorite was always The Lion King.
Really? Personally, I was always partial to Hercules.
That one had a great theme song, but I didn't like the plot.
But the way Hades and Meg interact is so funny!
Okay, I'll give you that one. But The Lion King is timeless.
You're right, even the soundtrack is timeless.
You can't ever go wrong with Elton John.
He should do the next Disney soundtrack!
