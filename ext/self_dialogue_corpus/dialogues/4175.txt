As a fan of thriller, did you like the Child's Play franchise growing up?
Somewhat, yes. I used to really get a kick out of Chucky.
Do you think the direction they went was the right one? With the films becoming more dark comedies?
Yes and no. As time went on, I don’t think seeing a killer doll was all that scary to the masses anymore.
I understand your point. However, I think it still could have worked if they tried. It almost felt like after the third film, it literally became a comedy.
I do not disagree. I think they just felt it would’ve made the movies more amusing.
I can see your point. That being said, the most recent movie was a bit more on the serious side.
I noticed that while I was watching. I think they should go for a good blend of the thriller with some comedy.
There is a new Child’s Play sequel coming out this year, also.
Really? I did not know that!
