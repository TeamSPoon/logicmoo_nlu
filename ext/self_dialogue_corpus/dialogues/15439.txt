Do you know much about Jazz music?
No, not really. It's never appealed very much to me.
I wasn't that fond of it either. But I've been changing my mind.
What's caused you to change your mind?
The catalyst for it was my trip to Oakland. I went to a Jazz club.
Ah, I remember you mentioning that trip.
Yeah, probably the highlight of the trip was going to that club.
Live music in general is pretty cool.
In this case, the person playing was Mose Allison, apparently a really famous Jazz musician.
I've never heard of him.
I hadn't either. Apparently he's been in movies and stuff.
So the music was good?
Yeah, it was amazing! A lot of improvisation - Jazz is famous for that.
I've heard that.
So now I've been listening to Jazz more.
What artists have you been sampling from?
A lot of the old greats. Thelonius Monk, Louie Armstrong, guys like that.
I always feel like I should give that music a shot, but I never do.
That's how I was for a long time. But that Jazz club made me a convert.
Well, it's cool you found some new music!
