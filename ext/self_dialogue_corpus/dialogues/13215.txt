The original trilogy is the only Star Wars canon, hands down!
No way, the new movies are just as canonical as the older stuff.
Are you saying Jar Jar Binks is canon?
He's not the greatest character, no, but he is canon.
"Not the greatest"? He was so annoying!
His people thought that, too.
They were right. I would've killed him off.
But he did have a part to play, and he became an ambassador later.
It didn't stop what happened.
He did what he could.
