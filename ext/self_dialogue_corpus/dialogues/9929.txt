I'm a proud Latinx. Since I'm not black, I always think there is no place for me in rap music.
There are many Latinx rap and hip hop artists.
Are any of them good and well respected in the rap industry?
You must have heard of Fat Joe.
Who is he again? Did he sing any songs I know?
He had a huge song 10 year's ago called "Lean Back"
I remember that song! There was a dance with it, right?
Yes exactly. Just last year he also had a big song called "All the way up"
That was one of my favorite songs of the summer! Kudos to him for being the first great Latinx rapper.
He wasn't the first great Latinx rapper. Another Puerto Rican / New Yorker called Big Pun was a legend before him.
