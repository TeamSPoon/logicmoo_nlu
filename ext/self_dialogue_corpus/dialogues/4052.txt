Have you seen Seven?
Is that the thriller with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman?
Yes, what did you think of it?
I really liked it a lot. I was so dark and creepy.
It was especially John Doe's books.
Did you know all of John Doe's books were real books? They were written for the film.
Wow. I had no idea.
To me, that makes the movie even creepier.
Yeah, that fact that someone had to sit and write all of that out is crazy.
Let's hope they got paid well for it!
