what do you think of fight club?
that movie is amazing.
everyone loves it. its a crazy movie.
in that time, i think the only action film i like better is the matrix
red pill or the blue pill?
i want the truth. i'll be the chosen one.
I think i agree too.
I wanna look like keanu dodging those bullets
and those fighting skills too
The fights were crazy cool
