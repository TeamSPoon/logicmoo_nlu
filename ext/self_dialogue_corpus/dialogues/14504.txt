Did you ever play basketball growing up?
Yes, I was in the kids leagues until 8th grade or so. You?
Yeah, I played until early high school. Why did you stop?
Well, I was forced to do it in the first place. And, bullying.
What happened?
They made us play shirts vs. skins, and the team captain every time said skins for us so I'd have to be shirtless.
So?
So, I'm fat. The point was to humiliate me.
That's awful. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I hard-fouled him a lot. I also just wasn't very good, despite my mom's assertions.
Yeah, parents are dumb and don't see truth a lot.
So why did you quit?
I got to the high school level and had stopped growing. You can't play high school basketball at 5'9"
Ha, true, unless you can dunk for the show. I was 6'1 when I quit and I wasn't tall enough anymore.
I also had a lot of injuries.
What did basketball do to you?
Well, I was the fat kid, remember? Wind sprints destroyed my knees. One time I hurt them bad but my brother convinced my family I was faking it.
How are they now?
They still hurt. And I have rotator cuff issues. You?
No injuries for me, luckily. Sorry about your experiences.
