I liked hip hop back in the day, you know the grandmaster flash era?
O yeah for sure, grandmaster flash was a pioneer, he paved the way for hip hop.
You cannot forget about the sugar hill gang though!
How could I forget man? they were also the bomb, they were the originals.
Remeber that song by sugar hill gang? rappers delight? remember the video?
O yes! the video that had all the bboys and breakdancers? Amazing dancing skills.
I think Back in the day when grandmaster flash and the sugar hill gang were about, they really made breakdancing known to the mainstream!
Yes indeed, they were the gods of mixing, scratching and breaks. The influenced hip hop and breakdancing, laying down the foundations.
Many of the new school hip hop artists still use the same method of producing music as they did back in the day, but put a modern twist on it.
Yes I agree, you can here the influence in modern hip hop, dre, snoop, dmx. You can can hear elements of the never forgeting hip hop artists.
