Do you think that patterns will work well this summer?
No. It's 2017.
They're light.
They're too busy on the eyes.
Then what will work?
That's a good question. Black. White.
You like simple?
Yes I like simple.
Then how about colors like yellow?
A pale yellow with sheer material...?
No.
Alright. No.
How about silver?
Silver could work though likely bronze or gold...?
A short pants leg?
Maybe.
What about summer dresses?
I like flowy material somewhat.
Then what about floral prints on a dark background?
Solid. With a touch of silver. Too much?
