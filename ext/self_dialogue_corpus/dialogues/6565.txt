Did you see the movie Bolt?
Yes, it's one of my favourites!
The storyline is so different, with Bolt thinking he's a super hero.
He gets a reality check though!
I know. I really like Mittens also.
I felt sorry for her since her family left her behind and she had to learn to fend for herself.
The character of Rhino was funny too.
He certainly had a case of hero worship for Bolt.
Did you know that Miley Cyrus and John Travolta sang the theme song?
Yes, I saw the video.
