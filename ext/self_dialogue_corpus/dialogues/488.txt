Did you watch that ESPN: 30 for 30 on the 1985 Chicago Bears?
I caught the tail end of it the other night but didn't get to watch the entire thing.
You need to watch it as soon as possible.
Really? Was that good? I'm a sucker for anything football and love the Bears.
Yes! It was very good. It had a lot of great Walter Payton footage.
Walter Payton is one of my all time favorite NFL players. Rest in piece sweetness.
Mine too, I get pretty emotional even thinking about him and everything he went through.
What kind of cancer did he have again?
It was a rare liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Damn what a horrible way to go. Do you know when Emmitt Smith broke his rushing record?
Emmitt Smith broke the record in 2002, I think he had like 17,162 career rushing yards when he broke it.
That's amazing. I miss old football like that now running backs are becoming pretty obselte.
Same but you have to understand that game is steadily changing and has been for years now.
Do you think that has to do with the different rules that have been applied to the game?
No not really. I would say it has to do more with the players. Players are getting bigger and stronger. Also just the way teams are running their offenses now.
Makes a lot of sense now that I'm really thinking about it. What modern player would you compare Walter Payton to?
This is going to be tough but I think I'm going to have to go with maybe Marshawn Lynch or Darren Sproles.
Mashawn Lynch is a complete monster.
Well his nickname is "Beast Mode". I'm exicited that he came out of retirement.
Same but I think everybody knew he wasnt serious about retiring to begin with.
