Do you like 90s alternative music?
You mean like Nirvana?
Yeah, like Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam... that kind of thing.
Yeah, I really like that kind of stuff but as soon as Nickelback became a thing I stopped listening to rock music.
Oh really?  Are you not a fan of Nickelback?
No, not really.  I think they're terrible.
I hear that a lot about them.
Yeah, I think Nickelback and Coldplay are the most hated in the rock category.
I don't get the Coldplay hate.  I think they're really good.
I enjoy them, too.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment.
Nah, I think people just don't like that the lead singer is an activist.
Yeah, that sounds about right.  People are so picky.
I know, heaven forbid he wants to do something to make a change.
Meanwhile you're sitting on the couch eating cheetohs.
Good on Chris Martin for not letting the haters get him down.
I am glad his music hasn't suffered because of his divorce.
I love when he works with Rihanna.
Yeah, they always make great songs together.
Princess of China is so good.
Yeah, I enjoy that song too.
