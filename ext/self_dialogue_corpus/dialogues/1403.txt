Are you excited about the upcoming football season?
Yeah, I can't wait to see what my Seahawks do this year.  How about You?
Absolutely.  I was crushed last year when the Patriots did their comeback.  I'm really hoping that they lose this year.
Yeah, it is frustrating how much they've been dominating these past years.
Absolutely.  So are you going to be attending any games this year?
Yeah, I live in Arizona, so I'll probably watch them when the play the Cardinals.  How about you?
I might catch a Lions game or so, but they haven't been doing so hot these past years, so kinda depressing.
Yeah, I hear you, I went through nearly 30 years of the Seahawks sucking.
That they did.
It was especially humiliating because I worked for many years on a fishing boat named after the Seahawks, so I'd constantly get razzed.
Heh, well I'll keep that in mind if the Lions keep up their current streak.
So did you have a Superbowl party or go to one last season?
Yeah, there was a nice party at my local pub, me and a bunch of buddies just hung out there.
Nice.  We did the whole big screen TV, home party thing.  Was a lot of fun, put clean up was a pain.
Yeah absolutely.
So any other teams you rooting for or are you strictly a Lions fan?
I'm for the Lions and 'anyone who can beat the Patriots'.
My dad feels the same way, but he is for 'the Seahawks and anyon who can beat the Cowboys'.
Why does he hate the Cowboys?
I'm not sure I think they were crushing the Seahawks back in the day, and so he just built up this animosity.
