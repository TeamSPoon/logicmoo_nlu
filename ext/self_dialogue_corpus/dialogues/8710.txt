Hey what do you think of Bryan Adams?
I'm more indifferent than anything.
Yeah can't say I'm a huge fan, but Summer of 69 is such a nostalgic sort of tune.
I can agree with that, makes up for the overly sappy Everything I do, I do it for you.
Ha yeah that song is incredibly sappy indeed.
Yeah at least Straight From The Heart has a minor edge to it.
Emphasis on minor edge, but agreed.
To be fair even though as I stated I'm largely indifferent, I do here he's good live.
I've heard the same actually, I would go to a show if the cost was right.
Same here, then again I simply enjoy live music.
