I just watched Lion King 1/2 yesterday.
1/2? What are you talking about?
Yeah. I think that's the title?
Was it any good?
Ohh! It was really good.
I didn't know Disney made a second movie.
1 1/2! That's the title.
What was it about?
Lots of backstory regarding Simba, Nala, and Pumbaa. It makes the first Lion King really good.
I don't like watching sequels to good movies, but I'll take your word on it.
