Just watched House of A 1,000 Corpses last night.
That was a great movie.
Yes,those characters in that were just so odd and unlikeable.
Especially the daughter with the blonde hair.
I couldn't stand her character. That annoying laugh.
Did you like Captain Spaulding?
No, he is just as bad.
I agree. They were all freaky.
It really had a terrifying story to it though.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to be stuck in their home.
