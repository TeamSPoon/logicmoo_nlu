So have you seen any good movies lately?
Nothing new, but I finally watched Groundhog Day!
Wow!  You just saw that?!
Yes, and I loved it!
I imagine you would!  It's one of my favorite movies.
Mine too!
What was your favorite part?
Well, Bill Murray was perfect in that role for one thing...
True.  The writing was exceptional as well.
Yes, it's one of the movies where everything works perfectly.
Agreed.  What was your favorite part?
Probably all the interactions with Ned Ryerson!  Bing!
Exactly!  It was hilarious when he punched him.
Yes, that was great.  I also liked how the movie had a message.
Did you know that a lot of religious leaders have tried to adopt it as espousing their message?
No, I hadn't heard that.
Yes, it does have a very powerful message so I can see why.
I do think it has some exceptional messages.
It certainly does.  Such as the importance of serving others.
As well as making each day count!
