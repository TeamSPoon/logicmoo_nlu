what band is good to chill out to?
I would recommend AIR.
Never heard of them before.
They are a french electronic music duo. Have you seen virgin suicides?
The film with kirsten dunst, than yes.
One of my favorite songs ,Playground love was featured in that movie.
I don't really recall it but I will check them out.
They have one all instrumental version and one with lyrics. Both are great!
Cool. any other recommendations?
Well this is more obscure. Iron and wine.
I actually have heard of Iron and wine.
Oh cool. Do you like him?
I do. My favorite song of his is such great heights.
That was a good one. What was that film it was in?
Garden state, but that was actually the original Postal Service version.
I did not know that was not an original Iron and wine song.
Ya iron and wine just did a cover.
Well I guess jezebel is my next favorite or original iron and wine favorite.
I don't think I know that one. I will have to give it a listen.
You should it is really good.
