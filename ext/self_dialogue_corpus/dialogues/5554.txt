Did you watch the anime movie Mulan?
Yes it was a great movie, my friend suggested it and we watched it together.
That movie sure had a great story and wonderful animation.
I loved Mulan for her determination and grit.
I felt bad for her seeing her struggle amongst the males.
But she did save her people.
That's true, her courage was something else.
I heard Mulan is being made into real life production.
Wow, that's great news. When is it releasing and I wonder how good will it be?
It is slated for release  some time around November, 2018
