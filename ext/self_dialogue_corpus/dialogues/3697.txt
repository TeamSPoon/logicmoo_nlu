I think one of my favourite Stephen King book adaptations is Pet Sematery.
Is that why your pet graveyard in the backyard is called that?
That's where I got the inspiration, yep. And I named my grey cat Church just like the cat in the story.
No kidding! Was he grey just like that cat?
He was indeed, though that's as far as the resemblance goes. He never came back more viscious than before.
Hmm, I never read that book. I usually prefer the movie adaptations anyway. Especially in the thriller genre.
Why's that?
Well I'm just not as easily scared when I read something versus when I see it, you know?
Yeah. As great as Stephen King is at giving imagery there are some things in movies you just can't get from books.
Like the creep factor in a person's voice, and the selection of music! I think Pet Sematery, Misery and Children of the Corn are good examples.
