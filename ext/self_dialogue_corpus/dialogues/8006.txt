Have you listened to Halsey's new song?
I have not! Did it just came out?
Where have you been? It has been out for awhile! It's called 'Now or Never.'
Oh sounds like a good song, I'll have to look it up.
What about the One Direction boys? Many of them have their own singles.
I know, they're completely on their own.
I like Harry Styles' new song, 'Sign of the Times,' the lyrics really work for me.
Likewise! It's one of his best yet.
What about Niall Horan? He has some great hits too.
I love his song 'Slow Hands.'  It's so romantic!
