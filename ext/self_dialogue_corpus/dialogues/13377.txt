Star Wars technology is so weird.
Why do you say that?
I mean, like, they have faster-than-light travel, yet all their graphics displays are frame wire, straight out of the '70s type stuff.
That's because Star Wars, the first one, back before it was called A New Hope was made in the '70s.
I know that, but if you look in the later films, even in like Revenge of the Sith or The Force Awakens they keep that look.
I guess that is weird, in a way.
Another strange thing is that they have real, working cloning technology, but instead of growing new limbs anytime someone loses one, they just give them a robot one instead.
Maybe robotic limbs are cheaper to make than growing real tissue?
No, the real reason is because it's not a very serious sci-fi franchise. Doesn't mean it's not weird.
It's more of a space fantasy, yeah.
