I'm looking forward to seeing the New York Giants this season!
Yeah, they have a really good wide receiving corps, don't they?
Odell Beckham's gotta keep focused, if he can I can't see any other team that can match their wide receivers.
Brandon Marshall was a huge pickup.
Yeah, he knew he wasn't going anywhere near the playoffs, so he went to a team that has a good shot.
They'll be good, provided the offensive line can keep Manning protected.
That's the one big Giants weakness. Nobody on that offensive line can protect the quarterback.
It's time to end the Erick Flowers experiment, huh?
Yeah, he's a turnstile. I thought Will Beatty was bad, but sheesh Flowers is a bust.
Beatty got paid and decided that the big paycheck was good enough for him.
Yeah, if the Giants could have upgraded in the draft, I think they may be a Super Bowl contender.
Who did they pick?
They took a tight end in the first round. I didn't like the pick.
Could he at least block?
No, he was more known for being a pass catching tight end in college.
Oh, so no Jake Ballard/Kevin Boss type that can do both?
Nope, sometimes I think Reese just can't evaluate certain kinds of players that well.
With the NFC East like it is right now, the Giants have to be strong, he's gotta be on the hot seat.
I imagine if they miss the playoffs this season, he's gone.
A shame since he did help build some of those championship teams.
