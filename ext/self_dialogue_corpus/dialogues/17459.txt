so i was listening to Pandora yesterday and i really like the Taylor Swift playlist!
im not a huge fan of her.
why? her songs are really relatable!
she just complains in every song.
well dont most song artists?
yeah i guess that is the point of each song! haha!
you should listen to her song Never getting back together.
what it is about?
basically not getting back with her ex every again.
i can relate to that!
exactly! thats why i like her, she is really relatable!
maybe i should give her another chance. what other songs do you like?
Bad Blood is another one of my favorites!
what is that one about?
its about having bad feelings towards your ex after breaking up.
does she only sing about breaking up?
most of the time! its great therapy.
sounds kind of depressing honestly!
well its not for everyone, but you cant hate it until you try it!
ill look more into her music, and maybe change my mind.
