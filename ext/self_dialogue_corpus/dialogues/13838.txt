Do you like the music of Lady Gaga?
I kind of do, but she is a bit on the wild side for my taste.
I agree, the shows and her stage presence, and even publicity stunts do seem a bit wild.  But she has so many great songs!
I never thought much about it.  What songs are you talking about?
Well, she has a lot of big hits, but one of my favorite songs she does is "You and I"
I didn't know she did that song.  It's more of a rock ballad type song.  I really do like it when it comes up on the radio!
She has so many hits, like "Poker Face"  "Bad Romance" and "Born This Way"
Oh wow, that music video for Born This Way is kinda scary and weird.  But the song is good
I think that song, "Born This Way"  is her most powerful song with a message.  Although, most of her songs have a message of some sort.
