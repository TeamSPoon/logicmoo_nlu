What was your favorite moment of performing music in high school?
I was part of the advanced groups, while playing tuba. So I was in a lot.
So, favorite?
I performed in Allentown Symphony Hall.
Sounds trashy.
It kind of is, actually. They don't make ends meet there.
Was it a solo concert?
No, I wasn't THAT good. We performed with the Boston Brass.
Who is we? And who are they?
We were five brass players from my high school: the top tuba, trombone, horn, and two trumpets.
And them? Wait, let me guess.
Okay.
A brass band out of Boston.
Good guess. More specifically, they're a touring brass quintet based originally out of Boston.
I know the Canadian Brass!
They're the best in the world. Boston Brass is one of the top groups.
Why was it so memorable?
It reinforced my love for music as I was preparing to major in it in college.
Did you play well?
Not sure, I was so nervous I barely remember how it sounded.
