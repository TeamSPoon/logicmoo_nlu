I saw Garth Brooks in concert the other day.
Really?  That takes me back.
Yeah, tickets were super affordable.
How was the concert?
Spectacular.  They played all the good songs from long ago.
Was their much newer stuff?
Bits and pieces, but mostly stuff from the 90's.
Did he play The Dance?
Oh yeah.  Everyone goes quiet when that gets played.
It's kind of his song I guess.
He's got a lot of iconic songs, but that may be the biggest.
Yeah, I've always really loved that tune.
Thunder Rolls was really cool.  They made it rain!
You mean literally?
Right, raindrops started falling around the stage.  Quite cool with the lighting.
I would be afraid of getting electrocuted.
I'm sure they had precautions in place.
Of course, that would be a bad ending to the concert.
I'll have to listen to him and get some nostalgia.
You should, great stuff!
