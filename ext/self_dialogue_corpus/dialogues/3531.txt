How many of the Scream movies have you watched?
I think just the first two.
The first one was the best out of all of them.
How many were there all together?
I think four.
I don't like when they keep making them. They should stop at two.
Yes, how much could you do with a scary man in a scream mask?
I agree.
The first Scream does have the twist of who it actually is though.
Yeah, the first time you watch it.
