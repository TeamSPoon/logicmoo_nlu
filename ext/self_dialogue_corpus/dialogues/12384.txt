I read an interesting fact about Liam Neeson today.
Go on, I'm listening.
Apparently, he's pretty tall, like 76 inches or so I think.
Okay, where's this going?
Apparently, he was so tall they had to redo the sets for him?
Really?  Did they not make them big enough?
I guess the door frames were too small for him so they had to raise them up.
That seems like a pretty big mixup between the designers and casting.
It apparently cost them $150,000 to make them bigger.
That's a lot of cash spent on simple timber!
