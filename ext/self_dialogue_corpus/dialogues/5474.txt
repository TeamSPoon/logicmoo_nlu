Robin Williams is one of my all time favorite actors.
He was a big part of my childhood but I think I remember him best as Genie from Aladdin.
Yes Genie was the best! You know Al really never did have a friend like him.
I see what you did there. Very clever.
Jasmine and Aladdin honestly were very lucky to have someone like Genie in their lives.
I'd second that and add Abu to the list.
Yeah Abu had a good heart, but what about Magic Carpet?
Man, if I could just have a flying magic carpet that would make me so happy!
If I could just have Genie that would make ME so happy!
Would you try to break the rules about wishing for more wishes of would you turn into a power hungry Jafar??
