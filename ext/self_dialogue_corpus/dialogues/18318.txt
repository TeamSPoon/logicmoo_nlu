So what have you been listening to lately?
The last week or so I've been revisiting some of the stuff I listened to in high school.
Like what?
I was a blues fan, so obviously Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Okay I see, what's your favorite song?
You can't discount Crossfire, everybody knows that one.
Yeah but I also really like Texas Flood.
It's on my playlist for sure.
What about Buddy Guy?
Oh yeah, his greatest hits album is incredible.
I think it's called Buddy's Baddest, is that the one?
Yep that's it, it has songs like She's a Superstar and Feels Like Rain.
Those are two of my favorite Buddy Guy songs, without a doubt.
Those songs are what turned me on to blues music.
I'm with you, but Led Zeppelin did the same thing for me.
Absolutely, so many of their songs were heavily influenced by blues music.
And now there's a guy named Gary Clark Jr. who takes that heavy blues riff style and expands on it.
Should I start with any particular album?
Blak and Blu is my favorite, I love it from start to finish.
Finding new music to listen to is the best!
