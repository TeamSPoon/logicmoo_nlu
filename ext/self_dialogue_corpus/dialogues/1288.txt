So, it is just about a month until the preseason starts.
True. Do you like the preseason?
I mean, I like that there is football on television again, but it is pretty different than the regular season.
I feel the same way.
I am excited for it though.
When does the actual season start?
I think it kicks off on September 7th.
Who plays in that game?
I think it is the Chiefs versus the Patriots.
Who will you be going for in that game?
I will for sure be pulling for the Chiefs.
Same here.
I mean, they are not even "my team". I just really do not like the Patriots.
Why is that?
I think they are kind of cocky. I have nothing personal against them really, they just win too much.
I can see that. I want to see some diversity in who goes to the big game.
I would love to see some very unlikely teams.
Wouldn't it be great if it were someone like the Browns versus the Titans?
That would be something!
Or even better, the Browns versus the Bengals. It's an Ohio showdown!
