Have you ever seen the movie Smokin Aces?
No, tell me about it.
Buddy "Aces" Israel is a mobbed up Las Vegas magician, who screwed up and it trying to turn state's evidence to save his skin.
Oh, I don't think the mob would like that.
No, they don't, as the is seems the top boss of the Syndicate, Primo Sparazza,  has hired a killer known only as the Swede, to bring him " Israel's heart"
Ouch, sound bad for Buddy.
Yeah, and to make matters worse, one Primo Sparazza's underbosses puts the word out on the contract, and other assassin's join the fray.
Really, who do we have?
First, we have Lazlo Soot, a master of disguise and impersonation.
Okay, you else.
The, we have the Tremor brothers, a trio of psychotic neo-Nazi speed freaks with a taste for excessive scorched earth tactics.
Scorched earth tactics?
Think over the top firepower, explosions, and one using a chainsaw as a melee weapon.
Ouch!. Anymore hitman that stand out
Pasquale Acosta, know as the Plague, a torturer and mercenary that once chewed off his own fingertips to avoid indentification.
Okay, so a cabal of freaks and psychos looking for a payday come after Buddy?
Yeah, plus bounty hunter hired by Buddy's bail bondsman for skipping town and FBi agents looking to protect Buddy so he can testify.
Sounds, like a pretty crazy film.
It is, plus there are several plot twists that you won't see coming.
Okay, sounds like a something I'd like to take a look at.
