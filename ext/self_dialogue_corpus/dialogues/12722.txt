I saw Revenge of the Sith last night.
Didn't that one have a bunch of Lucas family members playing bit parts?
Jeff, Amanda, and Katie are in the movie.
Was Hayden Christensen his dreamy self?
He did another good job as Anakin.
What was the saddest scene?
The second saddest was when Anakin kills a bunch of kid Jedis.
Right, bad.
The saddest was Padme's funeral.
Goodbye,  Natalie.
