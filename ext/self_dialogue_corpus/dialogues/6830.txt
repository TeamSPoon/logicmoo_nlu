My mom just bought me the Little Mermaid on DVD.
Did they release it finally on DVD?
Yes, last week.
Oh my, I will have to go buy it for my kids and I soon.
You should, it is a classic.
I agree.  How much was it?
I think she paid $14.99 for it.
Wow that is cheap for a disney movie.
Yes, it is a limited release dvd so you better hurry.
I will grab my copy this weekend!
