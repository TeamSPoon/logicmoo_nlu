What do you think of all the superhero movies these days?
I like them a lot.
Hit and miss for me.
What do you mean?
Well, I really like the Marvel stuff, but DC seems a little weak.
I know what you mean.
Yeah, like Batman vs. Superman.
I know, right!?
I was keeping a Batman bodycount through the entire thing.
I didn't see hi kill anyone....
Not directly. But the people he "branded" for instance.
What do you mean?
He would brand criminals and when they went to jail they'd be killed.
Oh!
Not only that, there was this huge chase scene.
Yeah, I remeber....
I counted everyone that would have been colateral damage in Batman's wake.
I hadn't thought of that.
DC really got some work to do.
I guess if they want to compete with Marvel....
