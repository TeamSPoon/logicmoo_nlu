Are you going to go see that new Transformers movie?
The one with Mark Walberg?
Yea that one.
I might, probably not though.
Why not?
Well, I'm not a huge Michael Bay fan in general.
What makes you say that?
His movies are all the same formula, insert giant explosions, cash out.
Example?
Independence Day.
Well that's just one if his many movies, they can't all be like that.
What about Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The rock, Bad boys...
Ok I get it.
Yes, Michael Bay does nothing but big budget movies with giant explosions.
Well I like explosions.
There is nothing wrong with that but once you've seen one Michael Bay movie you've seen them all.
Wow you really don't like Michael Bay.
Nope, his movies are almost always bad.
I'll take you off my Michael Bay fanclub list then.
Please do.
