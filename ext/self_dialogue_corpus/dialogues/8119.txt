So, who's your favorite pop artist these days?
I'm not big on the artists now, but I do like Katy Perry.
Ewww... she's annoying.  I don't care for her.
I think she's a good singer.  Have you heard her hit the high notes in Firework?
I like Taylor Swift much better.  Are they still feuding?
I think so.  Although I think Katy is ready to squash that.
Yeah, probably because she wants to do some songs with her.
I doubt it.  Katy just released a new song called Swish Swish.
Well, I'm sure she'd want to collaborate with Taylor.
You keep on thinking that.  Taylor hasn't had a new song in a long time.
