I love the song Army of Me by Bjork.
Oh my gosh, me too!
I first heard it when I watched Sucker Punch.
That's when I first heard it, too.
I can't believe it came out so long ago.
Me neither. Some songs just never get old.
I know. I feel the same way about Depeche Mode's song Policy of Truth.
Oh, I love their song Personal Jesus.
Have you ever heard the cover by Marilyn Manson?
No, but I have heard the one by Johnny Cash.
Wow. I didn't know he covered that song.
Oh yeah. It's great.
I'll have to listen to it when I get a chance.
I'll have to listen to the Marilyn Manson cover sometime, too.
Do you like Marilyn Manson?
Yeah. I like some of his songs.
I mostly like his cover songs.
What other songs did he cover?
The main one that comes to mind is Tainted Love by Soft Cell.
That was such a great eighties song.
