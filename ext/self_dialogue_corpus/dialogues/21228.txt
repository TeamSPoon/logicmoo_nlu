What about the 70's animated Tolkien film?
That one was good, I feel like it got the music better than the Jackson films did.
Yeah totally. Except when frodo's little buddy sang at the end, that one fit in quite nicely.
Agreed. The spider was so much more badass int he animated version though. It can't be done as well with CGI or puppets would have been better.
If only Jim Henson and Frank Oz had done There and Back Again,
The music and visuals would be so perfect. Well at least the animated version got the goblins right. The LOTR films were ok, but I always imagined goblins as being 'froggier'
True, and 15 birds is a creepy and innapropriate for children song I could have done without at such a young age.
Catchy though.
Very much so. The matrix, now there is a film which took folks on a ride
Yes, that one got people thinking about essentially the 'brain in a jar' thought exercise
As did Blade Runner
Exactly, like what is reality? If a computer can dream, is it not concious(sp)?
Or Short Circuit 1 and 2 for that matter.
Johnny 5 Alive!!!!
That bridge he jumps off of is in Astoria Oregon
No kidding
Ninja Turtles 3 and the Ring 2 were also filmed there. Great atmosphere I guess
Those all felt unique
Oh, and Kindergarten Cop. the School in that film is in Astoria. Verry surrea to see a ficional setting in real life.
I know, I met Paul Reubens at a young age and it was hard to dissasociate the actor from the character he played.
