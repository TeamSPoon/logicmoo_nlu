Who do you think is the best QB Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers?
Tom Brady all the way because he won more Superbowl championships.
No I think Aaron Rodgers is the best because he is a great QB.
But Tom Brady was at  #12 and he is Patriotic.
Aaron Rodgers was also #12 on the chart as well.
Tom Brady has better mechanics that Aaron Rodgers.
Yes I can give credit when its due. Tom Brady has won more superbowls.
Brady also have more passing guards of completion than Rodgers.
But Brady is a cheat he deflated the balls so the Patriots can win the game.
But the suspension was thrown out.
Besides Aaron Rodgers only needs 3 more TD to become # 11.
Brady has thrown more touchdowns to more players than anyone short of Vinny Testaverde.
Rodger is the most well-rounded quarterback in the history of the game. Brady lacks of mobility.
Brady has maintained the same performance level throughout his career with a multitude of different players at skill positions
Rodgers teams are 0-35 when trailing against teams in the fourth quarter by more than one point that have a winning record.
Aside from the volume stats, Brady outperformed Rodgers in most every important quarterback stat last season
Brady probably gets the edge here but, Rodgers’ game is more based on his talents and ability.
Taking into account that Brady played the first portion of his career in an era with more physicality on the defensive side.
Rodgers throws better, more mobile, bigger arm, more accurate, more touchdowns, fewer interceptions…and does it with a worse team
When Brady’s teams give up more than 21 points, he has a career record of 66-50… by far better than any quarterback in history.
