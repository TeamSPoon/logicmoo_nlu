What song are you listening to?
It's Vertigo by U2
Oh that's right. I like how upbeat that song is.
I like how it seems simple at first but then has a deeper meaning.
Oh ya I think U2 does that in some of there other songs.
Hmm.. like With or Without You?
Ya I think that might be one. It's full of emotion and really original too.
What about One. That's always been one of my favorites.
That song is fantastic is is so moving, and inspiring.
I love the one where they sing with someone else.
Oh ya I think it's Mary.
Where the Streets have No Name is another one I really like.
The music blends so well in that song. I love the lyrics too.
I also really enjoyed I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
I think this song is about always searching for something more, that even when you think you have found what you want there is still more.
Ya that's a great way to look at that song.
I think one people don't talk about as much that I like is City of Blinidng Light.
I think this song is really beautiful.
I like the lyrics in this one too.
Yes they are very thought provoking.
