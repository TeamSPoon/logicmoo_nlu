Did you see the Yankees game last night?
Yes I did. What a tough way to end a game!
Yeah. I don't think they should have sent Ellsbury home.
I think you have to send him there. I think he has a better chance of scoring than Holliday getting another hit.
I guess so. The 7th inning was frustrating when the Yankees had first and third with no outs.
Agreed. I can't believe they struck out 3 times in a row.
RIght? Oh well, Yankees are still only a half game out.
That's true, but we need to at least come out of this series with two wins.
I think the Yankees will be fine. Hopefully the Orioles cool down.
Their offense isn't that explosive and I don't think their pitching is that great,
It's going to be a close race all season. Hopefully the Red Sox don't catch fire.
I know. They didn't start off as great as everyone was saying.
Anyways, how do you feel about Aaron Judge?
He's a solid player, but he started off so good that his expectations became unrealistic.
Last night his at-bats were pretty bad and he struck out in a key at-bat.
When he was hitting home runs every game, I made sure I never missed an at-bat.
Did you see the picture of him next to Torreyes and Betances?
Yes. Aaron Judge is huge. No wonder he hits so hard.
Are you watching the game tonight?
Of course. I'll be tuning in at 7:05. Go Yankees!
