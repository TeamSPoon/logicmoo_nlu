Do you think that Marshawn Lynch will have a good year?
I think so, he had a year to rest.
I think that it is nice that he gets to play for his hometown team.
Yea, especially considering that this is their last year in Oakland.
Yea, it is a real shame that they are moving.
I would be pretty mad if i lived in Oakland.
Do you think that the Patriots will repeat as champions?
I do not know, but I would not be surprised.
Me either, they have been so good for so long.
Yea, it is getting kind of ridiculous at this point.
I am just sick of seeing them win.
Me too, it is getting boring.
Do you think that browns will be better this year?
I hope so, those fans deserve at least one good year once in a while.
Right? As well as Buffalo Bills fans.
Yea, that is one tortured fan base.
I do not understand how you can be that bad year after year.
It confounds reason.
I just hope they make the playoffs.
It would be nice for their fans.
