You know The Beatles are one of my favorite bands, right?
Of course, you have like all their albums!
Yes! I was just listening to the Beatles Anthology.
Okay, what is that exactly? Is it like a collection of The Beatles works?
Yeah,  a documentary and whole history and collection of their work with unreleased songs and stuff like that.
Wow, that's really cool. Are there songs you hadn't heard before on it?
Yeah, some of John Lennon's songs he was working on before he got killed.
Wow, that's really cool. What are they called?
Well, one is called "Free as a Bird." It's a really good song, but kind of sad too.
Yeah, John Lennon died way too young. He was a great songwriter.
