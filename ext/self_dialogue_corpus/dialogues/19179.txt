Do you remember back when music was good?
I don't think so, that was too long ago.
Yea I know. I used to listen to really cool bands like Reel Big Fish.
Oh man, I remember listening to them. DId you ever listen to Ash?
Yep, Kung Fu was one of my favorite songs.
Mine too!
What about The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, remember them?
Yea they had that song from the movie clueless.
Yep! That was them, they played it during a party in that movie.
Yea, Rap was great back then too.
It sure was, I used to listen to Nas a lot.
Yea, remember when LL Cool J and Nas had beef with eachother?
Yea and they ended up making diss tracks.
Yea, man things sure have changed. Now we have people like Drake acting like they are tough.
Yea, at least eminem is still pretty good.
Yea but people like eminem and snoop dogg hardly ever make music anymore. They made their money already.
Yea that's true. I really don't know who to listen to these days.
It doesn't matter who, they all sound the same.
So true, pretty soon, robots will just take their place.
It kind of feels like that's already happened.
