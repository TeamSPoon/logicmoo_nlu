I saw a great movie yesterday.
Really? What movie?
The Devil Wears Prada. I loved it!
With Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway?
Yes! It's based on a book written by Lauren Weisberger. Did you know that?
I did! It's a fantastic movie.
Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestley was ruthless!! She was one tough cookie!
Yes, she was. I think she had to be to make sure the Runway magazine performed as it should have.
I was surprised that Andy was even hired in the beginning. She didn't fit the mold of being the "New Emily"
That's why Miranda chose her. She was different than the other girls, she wanted to see what she could do.
What did you think when Andy took the trip to Paris instead of Emily?
She shouldn't have done it, but Emily wasn't always so nice to her so and Miranda might've fired her otherwise.
That's true. I like that she realized she was becoming someone else and decided to leave the job in the end.
She did the right thing. Just a shame her relationship with Nate didn't work out.
I agree, they made a cute couple.
I felt bad for Nigel when Miranda appointed Jaqueline to his position instead of him.
That was messed up. She did it to save herself, but that was wrong.
It really was. Meryl Streep is a great actress!
Did you know that for the scene when she cried about her divorce it was her idea to do it without make-up?
No way! Really?
