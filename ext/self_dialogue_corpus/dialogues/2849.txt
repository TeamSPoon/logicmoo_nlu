Remember when Tyler Lockett got his leg crushed during that touchdown catch last season?
Oh god, yes. You could feel it thru the TV set.
His leg got munched and he was like a foot from the goal line.
Wilson got abused too trying to make that TD.
Yes, it was sad thet it was only a 3 pointer after all that abuse.
Oh yeah, and from Arizona to boot.
I think that was the turn around for Arizona.
You think?
Yeah. They when from "Meh" to "Hey, these guys are getting good!"
Thinking about it i think you are right.
Arizona's stats are strong for this season.
We'll see.
Is Marcus Mariotta's ankle healed yet?
Probably, i'll have to look it up.
Go check, i'll wait.
Ok, says he healed and will be playing.
Right on, i like him.
I think i would have liked him more if Tampa had picked him up.
You are still better about that?
Not so much now as Winston is playing better.
