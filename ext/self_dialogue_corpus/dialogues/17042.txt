Techno music is awesome.
Aren't you a little old for EDM?
Most definitely, but strangely enough I took a liking to it a few years back. It was the rage in the 90s when I lived in Germany.
But at 32 you were too old for it then haha.
Yes, I did not go clubbing in Munich, but it was always playing somewhere, from Oktoberfest to the grocery store.
Ah yes, the earlier years. Eiffel 65 I'm Blue. Loved it. Still do.
And anything by Anna Lee.
Two Times! Great song.
I got back into it in 2007. Had a friend I met on YouTube who turned me on to a Dutch online radio station.
What kind of electronic music do you like best?
I really got into Chill Out music at the time and I still love it.
I haven't heard much of it really, what's it like?
It's, as named, pretty mellow. Lots of babbling in French, sometimes insidiously or not so insidiously sexual.
Hahaha babbling in French, really?
Ha ha maybe it was because I was listening to European radio. I also love Zero 7, with Sia, and other stuff here and there, don't catch all the names.
I love Zero 7! Didn't realize that was "Chill". Love Fine Social Scene!
Me too! And Destiny. Chill always makes me feel floaty. Not sure why young folks need ecstasy - the music is really intoxicating by itself.
Agree. Did you ever see the Love Parade in Berlin?
I never went, but I watched it on TV most years I was there. What a kick!
That would be a crazy scene in person, but I saw a few videos of it and it looked like good fun.
