Okay, what did you think of the Lily/Sirius thing?
You mean the epic love story? I loved it.
It wasn't creepy to you?
No, why would it be?
He pined after this girl for years. Treated her son like crap, then dies.

True, he hated James so much.
So, people love Snape and give him all sorts of credit, but I always found him creepy.
So did James!
