Do you know when Arcade Fire's new album comes out?
Ah, I forgot about that, no I don't.
I hope its good. The last one wasn't as good as their earlier ones in my opinion.
Yeah, I wasn't into it as much either.
Its called Everything Now.
Ah. I'm gonna look up when it comes out.
I'm looking forward to the release.
It comes out July 28th supposedly.
Nice.
Yeah, I'm gonna  get it the same day.
Me too.
Have you been to any of their concerts?
No, have you?
Yeah, once. It was a great show.
Sweet. I want to go to one this next tour.
You totally should, you'll love it.
Maybe we can go together.
Yeah totally. I'll look up tour dates.
Okay, check prices too.
Okay.
