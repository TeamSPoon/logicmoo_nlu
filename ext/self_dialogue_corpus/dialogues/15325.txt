What kind of jazz music do you like?
Everything but Dixieland.
Why don't you like Dixieland?
Because you can't dance to it.  I like Jazz vocals.
I think Carmen McRae is underrated.
Yes.  Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald are two of my favorites.
I really love Sarah Vaughn and Billy Ecksteine's duets.
Speaking of duets, what do you think about Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald's duets?
They are the duets all duets should be judged by.
Ha ha.  I think they're great but not as great at Ecksteine and Vaughn.
Agree to disagree. Thoughts on Dinah Washington?
Hall of very good.  Thoughts on Billie Holiday?
In a class by herself but more of a legend than a singer.
How so?
I think her personal life over whelms her singing.
I agree with you there.  What about Dorothy Dandrige?
I wish they had let her sing in Carmen Jones!
I agree!  She was a very good singer.
A lovely voice and a great actress.
Her performance in Porgy and Bess was great.
