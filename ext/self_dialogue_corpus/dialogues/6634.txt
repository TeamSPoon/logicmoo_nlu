The story of Sleeping Beauty is wonderful. Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip make quite the duo.
They do make quite the handsome couple.
Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
I really like Cinderella. Prince Charming is striking, as well.
Why do you like Cinderella?
I like that she works hard and does not complain. She is pure and gets the prince in the end.
More like the prince gets her, looking for the foot that fit the slipper.
It could be viewed that way. I love her dress in the ball scene where she loses that slipper.
It helps when you have a Fairy Godmother to dress for for a ball.
I wish I had a Fairy Godmother and a Prince Charming in my life.
