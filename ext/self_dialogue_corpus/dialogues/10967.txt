Did you see the score of the Rangers vs. Blackhawks game this weekend?
Yeah, it was a real blowout.  The Rangers need a new goalie.
Did you hear the rumor that the Penguins are going to trade Malkin?
No, what's that about?  Surely they won't, he's too good for the team.
Did you watch the Ranger play last night?
Yeah, it was good.  Close scores, it went down to the wire.
Did you see the fight between Crosby and Kane?
Yeah it was stupid.  Crosby deserved the penalty box to chill for a while.
Did you hear about Ovechkin breaking his 500th score.
I know, he's really, really good.  He's one of few that has.
Did you see that slap shot of Jamie Benn in the closing seconds?
No, I got interrupted with a phone call and missed it.
When is the next Cunucks game?
I think they play this Saturday but I'm not sure.
I think this will be the year the Panthers make it to the Stanley cup.
I don't know about that, it will be an uphill battle with all their injuries.
I can't believe you even watch the Edmonton Oilers.  They're terrible!
Oh, c'mon, they aren't that bad.  They are much better than last year.
I would like the see the Blues and Rangers play.
I know, it will be battle of the goalies.  Both have a terrible defense.
