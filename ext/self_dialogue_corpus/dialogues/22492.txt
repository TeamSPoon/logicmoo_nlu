Have you seen Alien 3?
Yes, and I never quite understood the universal hatred for it.
Me neither. I think it is full of good ideas and it's an interesting take on the series.
And David Fincher's visual style is amazing.
Yeah, I remember first seeing it and knowing I wanted to see more from Fincher.
So why do you think it's so universally despised?
I think it's becasue it's so different from Aliens.
Yeah, people wanted more shoot 'em action like in Cameron's version.
And Alien 3 is very deliberately paced, which of ocurse if frowned upon in Hollywood.
But that's why I like it. Have you seen the Assembled Cut?
I actually just watched it last week. I thought that cut greatly improved the film.
I was surprised by how different the opening was.
I agree, it did a much better job of setting the stage with stark visuals.
I also preferred the alien gestating in the ox rather than the dog.
It was cooler, that's for sure. I also always thought the acting was so good.
Yeah, there's a great mix of underacting and overacting that works becasue of the setting.
Did you know Sigourney Weaver only agreed to do the movie if there were no guns?
That's interesting. It definitley made them go a different way from the second one.
I think it made the writers think more about the world so they could make it work.
And as a result they created a great sci-fi film that doesn't get its due.
