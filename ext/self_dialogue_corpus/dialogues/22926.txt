Hi
Hello
Man did you know the guy who played aragorn was a last minute
I did not know that
To think we almost had a movie without him
I know right
It would not be as good
Yeah
He was perfect for the part
He made the part
Yep
Without his acting he would be lesser
The movie might have suffered as a whole
Easily
Because it was the actors that made it good
Pretty much
Yeah they are the main reason for its success
I know i would not have liked it without them
Yeah
Glad you agree
