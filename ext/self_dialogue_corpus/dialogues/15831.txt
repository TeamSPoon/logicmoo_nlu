Hey, who in your opinion is the most under rated artist in music?
I'd say Maria Brink is a under rated artist.
Who is that I've never heard of her.
Shes the lead singer of In This Moment.
Oh she's part of a band.
Oh yeah and a real good on in my opinion.
What genre of music are they a part of?
They do metal core.
Doesn't that have a ton of screaming in it?
Yes actually, and she does do a fair amount of it but her voice is amazing when she isn't screaming.
Can you recommend a song by her band that doesn't have too much screaming and really highlights her voice?
Absolutely. I'd listen to "Her Kiss". It starts off great but I do warn you at the end she is screaming a little.
Thats fine as long as it's not a mix of it throughout the entire song.
Not at all, I think that song really shows her strengths as a vocalist.
Almost sounds like you have a crush on her.
Well If I could date her I would, but I really do like her voice.
Who would you compare her voice to?
Man thats hard. If anything I'd say maybe Amy Lee from Evanescence but better.
Better than Amy Lee?
Yes, absolutely.
