You'll never guess what movie I just saw?
I bet I can... Was it Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
It was! How did you know?
Everyone is seeing that right now!
It was awesome, man. You gotta check it out.
I want to. You know I'm into Zoe Saldana! Not to mention, Chris Pratt is hysterical.
I think it's just as good as the first, if not better.
Now that's a bold claim!
I know, I know. But trust me, you gotta check it out.
Alright. I'll see when it's playing.
