Do you like the band Journey?
Eh they're okay I guess.
You don't like Journey?
I just don't really listen to them much.
You should! I think you'd like them.
I'm just over the Don't Stop Believing song.
Yeah it does get overplayed a lot.
Does the band still play together?
I think so, I'm not really sure.
That'd be cool if they did.
Yeah I always like older bands that still play.
It's crazy being with the same group of people for 20+ years.
Yeah I agree. You should hear some other stuff though.
What songs do you like?
Personally I love Stone in Love.
I'm not sure if I've heard that.
They play it on the raido a lot.
Hm I'll have to look it up.
I think you could get into it.
Sweet maybe I will.
