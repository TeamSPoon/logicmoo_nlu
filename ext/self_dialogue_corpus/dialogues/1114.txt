Do you follow the NFL?
I love it.
Where do you usually watch the games?
I go to my local bar.
That's cool.  What's your team?
I am a Panther's fan.  You?
I love the Redskins.
How do you feel about their team name?  Are you in favor of changing it.
I don't know.  There is a lot of nostalgia, but I also think it is insensitive.
I used to be a redskins fan until the Panthers came to Charlotte.
Are you pleased with Cam Newton?
I think he is a great quarterback.
Yeah, but he had a rough year.
The year before was awesome.
That's true.
They made it all the way to the superbowl.
You must have been disappointed.
Yeah, but not as much as being a Redskins fan.
I hear you.
I'm just joking.
