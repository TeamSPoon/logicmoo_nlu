Hey, NFL Training Camp starts in a few weeks.
I know right how great is that?
It's awesome as everything else is very boring this season.
I know what you mean, NFL and football is where it is at!
So how do you think the Lions will do this year?
They have a chance only if Stafford stays healthy.
Exactly! He is the key virtually to everything.
He needs to step it up and take this team to the next level.
Yes he does. He has talent around him.
Very true, but as Lions fans we are always skeptical.
I know that but since Quinn took over we have improved the roster.
Very true, as he is doing what many GM's never have here.
Millen was a disaster, so nice to finally have a guy in place who seems to know what he is doing.
He really does thus far.
Well if Stafford and the offense pick it up this year, I think the defense should be better with off season acquistions.
Defense is better, we are faster, and hopefully make the playoffs.
Playoffs? We better get there and win a game....It's only been 20 years
Isn't that crazy how long its been?
Yep, but hopefully we turn it around. Go Lions!
Forward down the Field LOL.
