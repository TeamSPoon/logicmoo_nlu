How many football teams are in the NFL?
I think there are 32.
Is that more than when we were kids?
Yes, they added some teams since then.
What teams were added?
They now have the Ravens, Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers.
Do they still have the Cleveland Browns?
Yes, they didn't have a team for 8 years, but then came back again.
Who is your favorite expansion team?
I like the Jaguars.  Their colors are cool.
That was cool when they came out.  I got all their garb.
Me too.  I love that color blue.
What other merchandise do you like to purchase?
Believe it or night, I like the sneakers with logos.
Do you like big or little logos.
I go big!
I don't like it too big.  What is they lose that year?
No problem, I'm true to my team.
I'm like a cat, fickle and finicky.  I don't always stand by my team.
I'm like a watch dog, sticking to my team.
