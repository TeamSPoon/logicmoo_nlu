Who would you like to see win a Super Bowl?
It would be nice if the Bengals or Panthers would win.
That's interesting - I would not have pegged your for a fan of either team!
Well, I always root for the underdog - I like both teams.  I live in North Carolina now and I grew up in Cinncinati, Ohio.
What would be your favorite Super Bowl matchup?
I think the Panthers versus the Patriots would make a great game again.
Yeah, you're right, good pairing of quarterbacks.  That would be a cool rematch to watch.
Have you ever been to a Super Bowl?
Yeah, my company got some tickets to Super Bowl XXXVIII, hence my interest in Pats vs. Panthers.
Where did you have seats at Super Bowl XXXVIII?
We were right on the 50 yard line - I only wish the Panthers had won!
Maybe they will at some point - Cam Newton could do it!
Do you have season tickets to Panthers games?
I don't, but I occasionally purchase tickets from a friend of mine if he isn't going - I usually go to around four games a year.
That's awesome - great stadium too.
Indeed it is - I really enjoy games there - the hot dogs too!
Do you have a subscription and ever watch NFL gamepass?
Absolutely - that way I can pick and choose what to watch on game days - very versatile.
I might think about getting that - I enjoy the NFL enough that it might be worth it.
Yeah, I think NFL gamepass is definitely worth it - almost as good as being there!
