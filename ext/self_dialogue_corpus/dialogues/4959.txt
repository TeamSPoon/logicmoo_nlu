What time are our tickets for the Dodger game?
1pm at Chaves Ravine!
Awesome!  Who do you think was the best Dodger manager of all time?
Oh! No question, Lasorda.
I agree.  Shall we take our seats in the stadium?
Sure.  Wow!  I always forget how big the field looks from the cheap seats.
(After the game has stated) Wow!  A 91mph pitch?  That's crazy!  He's going to pitch a no hitter.
Na!  His arm gives out near the sixth inning. Here comes Gwynn.  He always gets a piece of the ball.
STRIKE!  You were saying?
Just wait.  He'll get a piece of it and it'll get him on base if not get the Dodgers a run.
(Ball is hit)  Oh, that's going over the fence!
YES!!  That's 2 RBIs and a Home Run!
How far do you think he hit the ball?
It looks like it went over the right field fence, about ten feet in from the foul pole.
That was a thing of beauty.  Who's on deck?
Sosa.  If they keep playing like this, the Phillies might as well go home.
Do you think he can leg out a triple?
I don't know.  He's a hitter, not a runner.
OH! I gotta' give it o Philadelpia - that was a great catch by the center fielder.
Man! I bet his hand stings after catching that one.
