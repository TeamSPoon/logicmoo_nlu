Well I went and saw Friday the 13th.
What did you think?
You told me it has Freddy Kruger in it.
It does, doesn't it?
No, Friday the 13th is Jason.
Ah, my bad, I get those confused.
Nightmare on Elm street is Freddy Kruger.
Well, what did you think of the movie anyway?
It was pretty good. Jason killed everybody.
Jason is a bad dude.
