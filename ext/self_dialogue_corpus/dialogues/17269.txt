Beach Boys, yes or no?
Yes, very much yes
Really? I don't know man, sometimes I go back and forth.
Are you kidding me? They redefined an era of music
How so?
They created the cool surfer band in the early 60s. People loved them.
What were some of their hits back then?
Surfer Girl, Surfin' USA, Little Deuce Coup to name a few.
Oh yeah, I remember those songs.
Yes, it was the Brian Wilson era.
And then things didn't really work out after that, right?
Yeah, they had problems with leadership.
Right, and then eventually Dennis Wilson died and then Carl.
Didn't Dennis have some connection to Charles Manson?
I don't recall that one.
Anyway, kind of a tragic end.
Yeah, it tends to happen that way with a lot of bands.
I wonder why?
Well fame and money changes people
Yes, that's true.
