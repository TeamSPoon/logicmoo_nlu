Do you know what the total box office earnings for all nine of the Star Wars movies has been?
Oh my gosh, it must be a fortune...
OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS. $6,342,000,000.
Wow. And is that just the box office and not all the toys and other products added in there?
Exactly- digital sales, dvd sales and rentals, and VHS sales equalled 5, almost 6 billiion dollars.
Oh my, if only the government had started the Star Wars franchise, they would have been able to pay off all the debt.
Then there's toys, published titles, games, licensing, tv, and merchandise- another 23 almost 24 billion.
That is some insane amounts of money.
You're right though, just think if the government had thought up the Star Wars franchise- the country wouldn't have all this debt.
Maybe not- if they were like my girlfriend, they would spend it as fast as they made it.
