Have you heard the new Sza album?
CTRL? Yes!
It's so good. I can't stop listening to Drew Barrymore.
I'm loving Love Galore! Drew Barrymore is good, makes me feel like summer.
It really does. I just love the feeling of this album.
I know, her vocals are so smooth and rhythmic I just love it.
Did you hear the one with Kendrick Lamar? I love him.
I'm not a huge fan, but I really enjoyed Doves in the Wind. They work well together.
I've been listening to the album like every morning.
Yeah, when I'm getting ready it's just the right mix of chill morning music but powerful vocals.
I was surprised because I didn't love her first album, Z.
I think the label wasn't sure what to do with her yet. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as CTRL.
I agree. But the album cover was beautiful.
It was, but so is this one. Her with all the old computers.
That's true.
I don't know. I'm afraid I'm going to get sick of it because I'm playing it so much.
Just alternate with some older Beyonce and some Jewel.
Jewel? Really?
Trust me. It's like french fries and ice cream.
I'll have to try that!
