Hey, what is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Baltimore Ravens.
Oh, that's unfortunate. Im a Steelers fan.
Ouch, guess we are rivals huh?
Yeah, I dont like the Ravens, but I respect them
I agree. I dislike the Steelers but the rivalry is great.
Who do you think will get the better of the series this year?
I have to say the Ravens, since Im a fan, but I think both teams will be pretty good this year.
Yep. Plus the teams always play tight games regardless of how good they are.
Thats for sure! There definitely arent many blowouts when they play each other.
They are always rough, hard hitting games too.
I love that. The teams play so hard against each other.
Yeah, it seems like they are mirror images of each other. They both play a very similar style.
That's what I love about the AFC North. The games are close and the style is really fun to watch.
Except for when the Browns are playing.
Looks like we agree about one thing! The Browns are a joke.
Yes they are. Even though I dont like them, I want to see them get better so there's more competition in the division.
For sure. I want the AFC North to be the best division in football.
Agreed. As much as I hate to say it, Id rather a team from the division won the Super Bowl even if I hated that team.
Yeah, me too. I dont see the Browns doing that soon though!
