What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?
Mine would have to be Toy Story. Maybe even all 3 of them.
I honestly would have to say mine is also Toy Story.
Yeah, there are a lot of great Disney movies, but Toy Story just really hits home and makes you feel like a kid again.
Speaking of being a kid again, do you remember watching Mickey Mouse when you were younger?
Yes, I loved that show, I even watched it when it was in black and white.
Haha, back in the day I watched Dumbo, the movie about the little elephant.
Really? I loved that movie, I watched that and The Jungle Book over and over!
Do you remember the song from the Jungle Book?
Yes, haha. Bear necessities those simple bear necessities.
