We should get together and hang out for a little while.
That sound like fun, what would you like to do?
We could just hang out with one another and listen to some music.
Great, it has been so long since we have done anything with each other!
Tell me about it! Do you still love Nickelback like you used to?
I sure do! I know every song from them by heart.
I thought so, I remember in high school you were their biggest fan ever!
I still am! I even have a bunch of their T-Shirts, and even photographed pictures from them.
Do you got a lot of their stuff on your walls still?
Yea, I have added a bunch of their posters and pictures since you have last seen my room.
Cool! I can not wait to check it out later on.
Did I tell you that I went to one of their concerts recently?
No, you did not tell me that. How was it?
It was absolutely awesome! I had such a great time.
I am glad you got to go, which songs did they perform?
They did a lot of my favorites actually. Including one of their older songs, How You Remind Me.
Wow, I have not heard that song in forever!
They also sung Photograph and Far Away.
Far Away was always my favorite song from them.
I Know; I thought about you when they started to perform it!
