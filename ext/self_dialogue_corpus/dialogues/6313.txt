Disney recently acquired Star Wars. Do you think Star Wars movies are now Disney movies?
It's hard to say. I would have to say yes.
I disagree. I think Disney has its own thing and adding Star Wars just doesn't make sense.
I can see where you are coming from. But Disney has really made these movies into their own.
I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen any of the Disney made Star Wars films.
Are you serious? You have to see them - they are so rich in storyline.
Do they feel like the old Star Wars movies?
Yes, in many ways they do. With a Disney touch.
I feel like it cheapens both franchises.
Ok, you have convinced me!
