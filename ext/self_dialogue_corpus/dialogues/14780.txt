Was Happy Gilmore the best comedy of the 90s?
I think you might be right.
Wow thats great that we agree.
Yeah it had so much great dialogue.
What would you say was the best scene.
I loved when Chubbs fell out the window.
That was hilarious.
I also loved when Shooter got scared in the bar.
He acted pretty well in that movie.
And the script worked perfect for him.
