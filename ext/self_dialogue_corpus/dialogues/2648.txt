Hey, do you like the NFL?
Yeah, I love it. Why?
I'm putting together a watching party for week one, you wanna come?
Yeah that'd be great
Who do you think is gonna win?
Probably the Patriots, they always win
You never know, the Chiefs have given them trouble in the past
Yeah, but last time the Chiefs beat the Patriots the Patriots went all the way
I know, but I think the Chiefs defense is really solid
Yeah, but the Patriots picked up Brandin Cooks
I know, he has unreal speed
Him and Brady together could be dangerous
As good as Brady and Moss?
Nobody will ever be as good as Brady and Moss
Not even Montana and Rice?
They were good, but a different type of good. Brady and Moss was just so explosive
Cooks is explosive too
Yeah, but I don't think anybody will match Moss's athleticism
How tall was he?
6'4", not to mention the 4.25 40 time
