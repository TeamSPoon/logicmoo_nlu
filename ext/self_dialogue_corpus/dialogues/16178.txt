What's your favorite kind of music.
Good old rock and roll.
Me too.
I can't stand the garbage out now.
It's not even music really.
I know,all techno stuff.
Nobody writes good music anymore.
It's all dance stuff. No good lyrics.
I hear you there.
Some old timers still come out with some new music.
I liked paul McCartneys last one New.
Yes,that was pretty good.
He still rocks too.
Yes he does.
I love the song Early Days off that album.
Real good. Story about him and John growing up.
That's a cool song.
Telling a story like Paul does so well.
He is a storyteller.
And a real good one too.
