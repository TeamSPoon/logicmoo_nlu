Do you remember who won the Superbowl last year?
The Patriots.
Are you sure it wasn't the Seahawks?
I'm absolutely sure.
I thought the Seahawks won?
No, they were in the Superbowl though but lost.
Not sure how I have that mixed up.
Easy to do it's been a long time.
Yeah it's been some months.
Who do you think will win this year?
I think it's going to be a repeat.
You think the Patriots will win again?
I think so, you just can't beat them right now.
You're biased though.
A little sure but their statistics speak for themselves.
Fair enough.
Who do you think will win?
The Colts.
Now who is being biased.
I can only hope.
