It's hard to believe that Disney movies now include Star Wars!
Yeah, my husband wasn't thrilled when news of that first broke.
I was a bit nervous about it too, but I think they have done a great job!
Me too! I loved what they did with A Force Awakens!
I did too! Rey and Finn had such an awesome rapport!
They really did! Ah, that movie was sweet, funny, exciting... it had everything that the original Star Wars: A New Hope was.
I cried when I saw it! I didn't expect to be so moved but, I was!
Me too... everything my husband said he felt about the original Star Wars was sort of how I felt about The Force Awakens.
Right?! It felt good to have an awesome character like Rey and I adored seeing that Princess Leia had become a general of all things!
Yes!! The movie really highlighted the multiple facets of women without being preachy. I loved that movie!
