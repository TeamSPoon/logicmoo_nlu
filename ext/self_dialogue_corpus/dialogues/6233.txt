The kids and I finally got around to seeing Moana this weekend.
Oh yeah, what did you think?
It was OK. I was hoping for more. Especially with the Rock in it. Maybe it's just because my boys weren't that into it.
Maybe they will like Cars 3 more.
Oh, yeah. We are excited to see that one. Planes was a disappointment though.
I don't actually think we saw that one.
I heard they are making an Incredibles 2.
Me too! But I've been hearing that for a while now.
Yeah, I wonder why they haven't yet.
Me too, it was such a good one!
