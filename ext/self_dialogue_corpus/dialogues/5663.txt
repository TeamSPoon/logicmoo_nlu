Did you like the Toy Story movies?
Yeah, I actually didn't mind them.
Does your kid ever watch them?
No, all she ever wants to watch is Frozen.
Oh, I bet you'd rather her watch Toy Story.
Yeah, just overall more fun.  And nostalgic with the toys.
Yeah, I'm sure.  Did you see all three of the Toy Story movies?
I've seen them all.  I've probably seen the last one more than the others.
I guess that means you like the last one the best.
Maybe a little.
