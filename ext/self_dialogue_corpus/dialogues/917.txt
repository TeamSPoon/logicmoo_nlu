Can you believe Dak Prescott supposedly doesn't provide real autographs?
Where did you hear that I think that's absurd?
It was said on ESPN, Bleacherreport, and NFL.com so I would believe it.
Well if ESPN told you to jump off a bridge would you believe it?
No that's beside the point.
So if he isn't using his real autograph then what is he using instead?
ESPN said that he's using a machine to do his autographs.
Well how did they find out this is true?
Well the grading workers were able to tell that his autograph did not look authentic.
What???  I find that crazy.
I'm wondering how this is going to effect Dak Prescotts image?
I don't know if it will actually make him look any different.
Yet Dak is a great quarterback and everyone makes mistakes.
Yeah maybe he was busy and just didn't have the time to sign all the autographs.
Yeah working under Jerry Jones probably would be a great challenge.
Yeah Jerry Jones probably keeps his workers pretty busy.
I'm wondering how the card companies are going to fix this problem with Prescott?
Alot of people who bought the card received autograph cards from Dak Prescott because they got redemptions in the pack of cards.
I know if I received an autograph that wasn't real I wouldn't be happy
Yeah that is pretty messed up.
