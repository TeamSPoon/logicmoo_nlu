Have you ever heard of Nirvana?
Yes, I've heard of them.
Have you heard Nevermind?
Yeah, that's a great album. I'm not sure if I like that or In Utero better.
Have you seen Live! Tonight! Sold out!?
The VHS?
Yes, the VHS.
No, I don't believe I have.
Kurt pushes a cameraman with his guitar back for standing too close to him.
That sounds like Kurt.
It's a shame he isn't around anymore.
I know, Krist said he could be a cynical bastard. I would like to hear what he thinks of the music today.
Yes, I would like to hear that as well.
Dave found success with the Foo Fighters.
Yes he did, I think his first album was Revolver.
I think so too, with the gun?
Yes, that one.
He also preformed as Late! before Nirvana broke up.
I wish they would have gone more underground for their Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
Yes, I would have liked to heard Tad there.
