Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was a crazy movie
I know, when they were lost in the lawn that was scary
I thought they would never get bigger again
same here, he was always making things
well the Dad was an inventor, that is what they do!
that is true , remember that cookie they found and ate pieces of?
wasn't there a part when they also ate the icing or filing
I think so, I bet that was good!
Maybe if we were smaller food would last longer
that is an interesting thought, being smaller so we have more food and eat less but it seems like more !
