Are you fan of the Beatles?
Well, I don't hate them
They were all the rage back in the 60's
I wonder how they would fare now
I don't know
I bet if they modernized with the times, they would still be super stars
I wonder if their fates would have ended the same if they were performers now
Probably, history has a way of repeating itself
At least we have them memorialized for all time
I'll have to look up their music and see for myself
