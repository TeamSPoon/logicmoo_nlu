what do you like most about lady gaga?
well, it's a very interesting question, first I respect lady gaga
yea?
you know it's tough to stand out from the over-crowded music industry, she made it out on her own, I think that's a powerful message
indeed, she's a tough girl, I admire artists that's trying to spread out good music around the world
yea, aside from the spirit part. I do think her music is very unique, maybe that's what made her famous in the first place
I feel her music lies between being too artistic and being too ruthless like rap music
that's the magic part of it, isn't it.
haha, indeed, I gotta go check out her new music videos on Youtube
for sure, her music videos have always been entertaining.
