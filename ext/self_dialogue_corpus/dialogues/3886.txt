Have you seen that Bruce Willis movie, the thriller?
Which one?
The Sixth Sense.
That one was such a surprise!
The ending, was just wow.
It had me wondering the whole movie, never saw it coming.
I like M. Knight Shmalyan's thrillers.
The way he weaves the story into so much suspense, always gets me.
I loved the one called the Village.
That one had a surprise ending too.
