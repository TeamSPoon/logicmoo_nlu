Have you seen any new thriller movies lately?
I have! I saw 47 Meters Down.
What did you think?
It was very interesting.  But I will say that it didn't make me jump off my seat.
Typical shark movie?
Just a little bit! Mandy Moore did great but the story line was just a little off.
What makes you say that?
For once, who would want to go to shark-infested waters when you're on vacation? I could be sipping on martinis on the beach all day.
I'm on your boat all the way.
I don't know, I just didn't really like it.
