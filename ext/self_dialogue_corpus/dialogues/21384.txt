Do you still think Ironman will continue in his current inception?
I think Downey will still play him
But for how long?
I dont think he has a contract for those movies anymore.
They could have someone take over.
In the comics they do.
But the movies dont follow the comics always.
In what sense?
Chronologically its tough because there are so many comics.
Most movies are just based on one comic?
Yes they have to be.
I cant believe they stretch it out that far.
ITs not hard when they add their own elements in.
So they dont stay true to it?
They take liberties for the benfit of the viewer?
Yes thats how they make the movies interesting.
Wow you learn something everyday. So you think Ironman dies?
No I think he just retires.
And helps Spiderman?
That I do not think happens.
