What happened to Vanilla Ice?
He just fell off the map.
His lyrics were pretty flat.
He didn't have alot of rhythm.
I didn't like Ice, Ice Baby but he did have one other song that I liked.
I don't know what that could have been.
Play That Funky Music was the name of the song.
I do remember that song from back in the 90's.
He was last on Dancing With the Stars in 2016.
How far can someone fall. Wow!
