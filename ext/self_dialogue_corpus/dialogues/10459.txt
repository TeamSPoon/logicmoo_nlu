Hey! Long time, no see...
Yes, it's great to catch up with you again.
What have you been doing with all your time lately?
I have been watching a good bit of music videos on Youtube.
Really?  I didn't know they had free music videos.
Yes, they are completely free to watch and listen to.
I will have to try that.  I just love watching old music videos.
Me too.  It brings me back to my teenage years.
Old music videos from the 1980's make me laugh.
They are interesting to watch because I like to look at how they used to dress.
I like to watch that and remember how we used to do our hair.
It can be so much fun to remember those older times.
Not only with music, but its fun to remember the older movies too.
I agree.  The special effects in the older movies make me laugh.
I remember when we thought the special effects in those movies were top-notch.
So much has changed.
Back then, we would have never dreamed of the technology we have today when it comes to movies.
It really is fun to compare old and new movies.
It was great talking to you.
Same here.  Have a great day.
