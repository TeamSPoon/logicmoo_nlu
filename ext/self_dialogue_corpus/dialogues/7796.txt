Who is your favorite actor in the Harry Potter movies?
I love Emma Watson.
Yeah, she seems like such a cool person.
And she places Hermoine so perfectly, even if it's different from the books.
I have to say I love Ralph Fiennes.
He's so good as Voldemort. And a lot of people didn't realize it was him!
Yeah, the CGI or whatever they used to change his face was really well done.
Same for the goblins.
What do you mean?
Griphook was played by Warwick Davis, so they definitely had to use something to change how his nose and ears looked.
