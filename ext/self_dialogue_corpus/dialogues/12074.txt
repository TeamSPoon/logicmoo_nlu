It's so sad that Carrie Fisher died.
I know.  And so soon after her mom died.
Did you ever try the Princess Leia hairstyle?
I'm a dude.  My hair isn't long enough.
Once I went to hear the symphony orchestra and the male cellist dressed as Princess Leia.
Really?  How did he look.
He went all out.  The full jabba the hut scene bikini, ear muffs and braids.
Oh my.  Was he good on the cello?
Yeah, it was awesome.  The conductor dressed as Darth Vader and used a light saber as a baton.
Man, I wish I could have seen that!
