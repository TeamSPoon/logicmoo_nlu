Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
No I hated it
Why
I don't like the new characters at all
The original characters were in it too though
No enough. The new characters are just a play for the diversity vote
So it was not worth the wait?
No I was really disappointed.
That's a shame
Yeah I'll keep re watching the originals.
