Do you know what the first cartoon Disney movie ever was?
Let's see. Was it Bambi?
Close. It was actually Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, right. That's based on some sort of fairy tale, isn't it?
Yes. It was a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm.
Can you name all of the dwarfs?
Let's see. Dopey, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Doc and Bashful.
Nice. That movie is such a classic.
Even people who have never seen it probably know about the seven dwarfs or the song "Heigh-ho".
Yes. That one, and "Whistle While You Work".
