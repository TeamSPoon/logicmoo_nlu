Who is your favorite supermodel?
Bruna Tenorio is my favorite.
I've never heard of Bruna Tenorio. What is she like?
She's a gorgeous exotic waifish Brazilian model with a long neck.
Kate Moss was my favorite waif model. Adriana Lima is my favorite Brazilian model.
I like Adriana too. Bruna is just not that famous.
What about American models? Which American ones do you like?
For the 1970s models, I like Janice Dickenson. She was so exotic.
Janice was gorgeous. Marisa Berenson was my favorite from that decade though.
Wait, I change my favorite. I forgot about Iman.
Oh yes, Iman was stunning like a queen.
Yes, she's my favorite 1970s model. Wait though, you wanted me to name Americans.
It's okay. You can name Somalian models.
Talking about African models, I love Liya Kebede for a modern-day model.
Where in Africa is Liya from?
She's from Ethiopia. I think she did Revlon ads.
I wonder if Iman did Revlon ads. I did see her back in the 90s promoting her make-up line at the mall.
Yes, I remember that make-up line. It was a line geared to minority skin tones.
Yes, I guess Iman's line was like MAC.
I heard MAC make-up caters more to diverse racial and ethnic skin tones compared to other make-up lines.
