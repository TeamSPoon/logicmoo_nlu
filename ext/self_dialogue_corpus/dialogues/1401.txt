Do you think the NFL should favor expansion?
Absolutely not.
I'm leaning that way, but not as strongly. Why?
NFL teams are a massive burden on the cities.
How?
They use taxpayer money to build the stadiums, but the taxpayers have no say in how the team is run.
You think it would be better if the city could vote out staff?
That's an insane amount of power and I'd love to have it. Fire coaches after bad seasons.
I like expansion but am cautious.
Why?
Over-saturation. We don't need a ton of teams, and there are already enough
Plus, that would then make team quality go down overall.
Maybe. The Texans went from nothing to pretty good after just a few years.
But they're the only ones in the past 20 years or so for that to happen to.
I'd be fine with them moving to a big city in the Midwest.
There's a slight problem with that.
What's that?
In the Midwest, the cities aren't actually that big, and fans would have to travel great distances to get there.
They're devoted!
Yeah, but now you have people driving 200 miles after five beers.
