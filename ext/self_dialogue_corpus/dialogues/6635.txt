Did you see the Disney movie Cinderella?
Of course hasn't everyone?
I love that movie!  I wish I had a fairy godmother!
Me too.  Cinderella is so beautiful!
Yes and I love that she is kind to everyone.
She loves animals too!
Yes she does and they love her just as much!  They even made her a dress!
Oh yeah, I forgot that part.  Aren't those little mice the cutest things?
Yes, they are.  That is a fun movie to watch.
I think so too.  Maybe someday I will meet my prince charming!
