Have you seen the new Fast movie?
No. Is it any good?
I really like it. It has a lot of action.
Did they replace Paul Walker?
No they just acted like he quit racing.
So his brother isn't in the movie?
No and no flashbacks of him either.
So is Dom the main character now?
Pretty much, and Letty has a bigger role.
That's good. I like her and she never really got much screen time.
She has a lot in this movie, and she's good at the part.
So is she still with Dom?
Yes, but there are some twists to that too?
What about the girl who played Mia?
She's not in the movie either.
Did they write her out with Walker?
Kind of. The don't really mention her at all.
Kind of weird since Dom is all about family.
Yeah that's what I thought but it plays out okay.
Now I have to go see it.
