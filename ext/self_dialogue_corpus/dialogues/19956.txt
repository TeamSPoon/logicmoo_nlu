Do you like Nick Cave?
Absolutely. He is one of my all time favorite artists?
Mine too.
How did you discover him?
When I was in high school I used to listen to a very low wattage college radio station that played The Birthday Party which was his first band.
Oh yeah. I love The Birthday Party.
They blew my little teenage mind. I have been following him ever since. It's been amazing to watch his progression as an artist and song-writer.
Definitely. He has a lot of material. I have been a fan for years but he still has material I have yet to hear.
Me too. I saw him live in Detroit a couple years ago.
How was it?
It was absolutely electric. He really communicates with his audience. I was in a fairly large auditorium but it felt very intimate.
He's getting older. Did he seem worn out?
Absolutely not. I was surprised by his energy and physicality. It was very exciting. My version of seeing Elvis or The Beatles!
What's your favorite album?
Hard to pick one. Probably Henry's Dream or Let Love In.
I like the Boatman's Call.
Have you heard Grinderman?
No. What's that?
It's a side project. Another Nick Cave led band. They are great!
Wow. Does he ever sleep? He certainly is prolific.
