paramores new album is so good
i love fake happy
that song is so real
everyone puts a smile on their faces and says they are fine
its weird if you actually say youre doing bad when people ask how you are
that song is so unique and the intro is awesome
its kinda heartbreaking
but also so melodic and upbeat
the guitars and instruments work so well with it
they are on top of their game
i love the vocals
hayley is an amazing vocalist
one of the best of our times
she really is.
she is so talented too.
i wonder if she will actually ever do a solo thing
maybe if paramore is done for
she's always been down for paramore
paramore is her love
mine too
