Did you like watching Austin Powers?
Yeah, the movie was so ridiculous.
I know the costumes and humor was out there.
They wore such colorful clothes.
I liked when he went back in time.
Yeah, I always wondered how it would be back then.
Did you know Mike Myers was also Dr. Evil?
No, I actually didn't know that.
He didn't play Mini-Me though.
Oh wow, I was about to say...
