Dude, how are your Broncos going to do this season?
I think Lynch is ready to step up, man.
Is he even the starter, officially?
No, but he's been looking good in camp.
Gotcha. That defense is still gonna be sick, I'm sure.
No doubt. Von Miller is all you need.
Super Bowl MVP, man. His performance was sick!
One of the best I've ever seen. That strip sack to end the game... wow.
That was amazing. What do you think of Siemean?
I think he's a good back-up QB.
What makes you think that Lynch is better than him?
I don't know. Just something about the way his mechanics are.
Just a gut feeling? I bet Matt Ryan had a gut feeling in last year's Super Bowl too.
Boy, was that an embarrassment. I still think the Packers would have beat both of them.
I guess we'll never know, considering Rodgers is always being beat in the playoffs.
He needs a better defense. It's just like with Brees.
Yeah, Brees' talent going to waste for the last half a decade has been criminal.
Yeah, ever since their Super Bowl win, it's been downhill.
True. But I'll catch you next month at a bar for the first preseason game.
Sounds good, man. Broncos going for that second ring in three years!
