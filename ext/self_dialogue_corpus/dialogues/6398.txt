Have you seen the Disney's movie The Princess Diaries?
The Princess Diaries?? the one released back in 2001?
Yes thats the one I am talking about. It was such an interesting movie.
Yes i remember that movie, it was about a teen girl who unexpectedly happen to be princess of a small European State.
Right, she was really shy and clumsy girl, then she discovers she is a princess, that was really a twist of faith!
Anne Hathaway acted really awesome as Mia Thermopolis. She was making me laugh quite a good!
Thermopolis!! even that name is funny right. Sounds like its a name of an instrument in a chemistry lab!
Actually her name is Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldi, Mia Thermopolis is her short name.
Yeah but longer is much better for a princess, longer name sounds more royal.
That is true but a name that longer is not quite handy if someone is addressing her, thats why they call her Mia.
