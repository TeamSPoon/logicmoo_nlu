Which part of the Star Wars movies left you in complete disbelief?
Oh man, it was something that happened in The Force Awakens.
What happened in the movie that left you in disbelief?
It was when the Imperial Fleet fired up their weapon.
Oh man, that scene gave me goosebumps.
I got them too!
It was sad when they did closeups of the people on the planets getting destroyed.
It was! I can't even imagine what those people felt.
It sucks that they weren't able to do anything to stop it.
The Imperial Fleet are very ruthless and merciless!
