I've always wondered why the Dursley's were always so terrible to Harry, any idea?
Well, they never wanted to take him in so there's that.
Yeah, but still, even if you don't want to do it, you don't need to treat him that way.
Well, it always seemed like Dumbledore kind of forced them to keep him.
Yeah, I know.
So, it makes some sense, they are forced to keep someone that represents magic in their house, of course they'll hate him.
So, Harry deserves to be miserable the entire time?
He doesn't deserve it, but where else could he go and be safe
I'm sure a million places, like the Weasleys?
Yeah, he could, but remember the protective spell requires him to go back to the Dursley's house once a summer.
