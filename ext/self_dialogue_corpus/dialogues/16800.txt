Have you heard the new Red Hot Chili Pepper album?
No, i haven't heard it.
You should definitely get it.
What is it called?
It's called The Getaway.
So you really like it?
Oh, yeah it really good.
Oh cool, they haven't had a new album in quite a while right?
Yeah it's been quite a few years.
I was hoping they would, i am a big fan.
Me too, although i wasn't crazy about the last album compared to some of the prior ones.
Me either, but trust me you will like the new one.
Cool, is it on ITunes?
Yeah, its on itunes thats where i got it.
How about Amazon Prime music?
Yeah i think its on there as well.
Thats great, i can listen to it first, then if i like it i will buy it from Itunes.
That's a great idea, i never thought of that!
Oh yeah i do it all the time, if the album is on there of course!
Right?  Well I hope you like it, i know you will though!
