Jimmy Eat World is probably one of my favorite bands from long ago.
You consider early millennium long ago?
Well, I am in my 30's.
They've had a few recent songs.
I haven't checked out any new stuff lately.
You should.  Sure and Certain was on the radio recently and it's pretty tight.
Huh.  I'll have to go look for it on Youtube.
Check out The End is Beautiful too.
Okay, sounds like a plan.
Glad I could help.
