What's your favorite thrash metal album?
My all time favorite would have to be Rust in Peace.
Ah Megadeth at their peak, Friedman and Mustaine rock harmonies.
Friedman is such a great guitarist.
Oh absolutely, his stuff with Jason Becker was epic.
Such a shame what happened to Jason, he was a prodigy honestly
Agreed Cacophony was great and he and Friedman made magic.
Friedman is still going strong in Japan.
Yeah I've heard his solo stuff, mind blowing!
Absolutely a guitar god in my mind.
