Did you notice the Penguins pulled their goalie in the 2nd period
Yeah, that was surprising
I thought so
He was playing well
It was the defensemen that were costing pittsburg goals
absolutely
I just don't think the Penguins have a chance against the Caps
well, too early too tell
i don't think so, penguins will lose in 5 games
well, yes if they keep playing like last night
they aren't good enough
i think they can match up with the caps offensively line for line
but what about defense
i know, they are weaker than the caps
let's hope penguins goalie can play extradonaiy
that's what it will take
im still hopefull
the caps can't play that well every game
i agree
going out to watch game 3
