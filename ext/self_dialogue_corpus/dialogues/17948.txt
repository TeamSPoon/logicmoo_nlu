Have you heard the new Bjork record?
I haven't yet! Is it good?
Yeah, it's really interesting, but it is Bjork.
I saw her newest music video and it's pretty crazy.
What did you think of the song?
To be honest, I felt like the artistic aspect video was the main selling point. I really didn't like the song.
What about it didn't you like?
It was very hard to listen to. The music didn't really work with itself.
Ah yes, I can see that, though that is pretty typical of Bjork's music.
True. What else have you been listening to lately?
I've actually been getting back into Symphonic metal for some reason.
Oh no way! I used to listen to a lot of symphonic metal: Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation...
I've been listening to so much Within Temptation lately!
Awesome! The Dutch seem to have some pretty good symphonic metal bands. What have you been listening to?
I've been feeling a bit nostalgic lately, and I've been listening to The Heart of Everything.
Oh wow, that came out, what, around 2007?
Yeah! My favorite song off that record is Our Solemn Hour. How about you?
Oh I love that one, but I think The Howling might be my favorite.
All of the songs really are so good, and the record puts me in such a good mood.
I agree. Sharon den Adel's voice is beautiful.
