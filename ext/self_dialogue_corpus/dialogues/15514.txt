Do you ever listen to classical music.
Every once in a while I get in the mood.
My car radio was broke and the only staion I could get was Classical.
Must have been the local PBS channel?
I like Mozart, and Brahms, and of course Beethoven.
Those are the greats for sure.
I also like Debussy.
I don't think I know him.
He was Russian.
Oh, Rimsky Korsakov is the only russian composer I know.
My dad was into Classical music, but I ignored it.
My uncle has a huge collection of classical music on record.
You know where I learned the most classical music was from Cartoons.
That's right,  all of those old cartoons like Bugs Bunny used classical.
Yes, also movies like Star Wars.
It's funny that Classical is such a big part of our culture and we don't recognize it.
It really is,  classical music is everywhere.
Even in commercials.
It's probably been 5 years since I attended a live performance of classical music.
Well, I've never attended a classical concert.
