Hey there! I just saw the best movie! Have you seen Inside Out?
I saw it when it first came out! You're only seeing it now?
I'm a little late to the movie game. But wasn't it adorable?
And so heartfelt. How many times have we been confused about our emotions?
All the time. I loved how the movie portrayed each emotion as a character.
And our brains as like a theme park! The memory orbs were really cool, too.
I heard the filmmakers consulted with psychologists to get down some of the science.
Like memories and REM sleep? I think I actually learned some science during the movie!
Who was your favorite character?
I thought Phyllis Smith did a beautiful job with Sadness.
Her voice was made for this role! Her whole role on The Office was basically the same thing.
Hah, yeah. They cast the voices so well! I especially loved Amy Poehler as Joy.
When do you not love Amy Poehler?
You got me. Always. Leslie Knope 2020!
What did you think about how they wrote Riley?
Adults tend not to take kids seriously, and here, everything she felt was very real.
So true! Childhood is so confusing, and adults belittle kids all the time.
This movie says that it's okay to feel everything we do, no matter our age.
In the end, Sadness was just as important as Joy--same as all the characters.
I think I'm a more realized person after Inside Out. Do I have to go to therapy this week?
