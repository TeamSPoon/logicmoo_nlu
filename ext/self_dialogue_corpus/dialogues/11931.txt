Do you know who Geoff Emmerick is?
No.
He was the Beatles' engineer.
Really? He must be talented.
He is. He helped them make a lot of the experimental sounds.
I thought George Martin was the producer.
He was, and he made a lot of contributions, but the engineer did a lot too.
I never heard of him.
Most people haven't.
It's shame, if he was really the sixth Beatle.
