I just saw Episode VII for the third time.  I like it more each time I watch it.
I see.  And what do you like so much about it?
I like how the movie pays a lot of homage to the original Star Wars from 1977, A New Hope.
Indeed it does.  I like that you get to see what finally happens to Luke, Han and Leia after so many years.  I always wondered.
There is also a good mix of old and new characters that keeps the story exciting.
Yes.  Is there anyone you hope to see in the next two Star Wars films, Episodes VIII and IX?
If somehow Boba Fett could show up in some scenes, I would be forever grateful.
I agree with you there.  And what do you think, at the end of the day, makes Star Wars so special?
Well, behind all the glitz and glamor and flashy CGI and marketing, there is still something profound.  There is a deep sense of human nature, what we consider heroic, and what we consider our weaknesses weaved into the films.  Luke is such a classical hero.
I think you're right.  I think that's why the movies have such an effect on all age groups and across different cultures and backgrounds.
