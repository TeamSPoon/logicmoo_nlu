I love the Rolling Stones!
Who is your favorite member of the band?
I'd have to say that my favorite is Mick Jagger.
He is great. But I think Keith Richards is my favorite member.
Both are incredible. That band has had such a long career!
It is amazing that they are still playing together.
They still sound good too. I saw them recently and they were excellent.
Did Mick dance around the stage?
He strutted around the whole stage just like he did when he was younger. It was amazing!
I'll have to try and see them next time they come to town!
