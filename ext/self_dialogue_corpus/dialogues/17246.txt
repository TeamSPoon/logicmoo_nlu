Do you want to go riding around with me for a little while?
Sure, did you ever get your new CD player installed?
I sure did! I want you to come and test it out with me!
Do you want me to bring any of my CD's?
That would be good, what all do you have?
I have a couple of Carrie Underwood albums. You like her, right?
I love her! Which of her songs are on the albums that you have?
I got a lot of her older songs like, Jesus Take The Wheel, and Before He Cheats.
Were those off of her album Some Hearts?
Yes, that was the one that she released in 2005. They were both big hits off of it.
What other albums of hers do you have?
I have Storyteller, that is the one that she released in 2015.
Which songs would I know that are on that album?
Have you heard Something In The Water or Dirty Laundry?
I am not sure about either of those; but I will give them a try!
Great, do you want me to bring any more CD's?
Do you have any type of Beyonce music?
Yea, I have her self titled album Beyonce, from 2013.
Does that have Drunk In love on it?
Yes! I will bring that one as well!
