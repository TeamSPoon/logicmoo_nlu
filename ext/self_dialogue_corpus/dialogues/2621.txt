How do you think the Eagles will do against the rest of the NFC East this year?
Its hard to say- I think so much of last year was spent fixing the Chip Kelly disaster
Yea, I'm still not completely sure about Doug Pederson
I mean, he managed the team way better than Chip, but after so many years of dominance with Andy Reid, he has large shoes to fill
I'm excited the performance of Carson Wentz in his rookie year
Me too- he set the record for most completed passes in a rookie season- I can't wait until he has more experience under his belt
The organization also went out and got some offensive help which is really exciting.
Yea, remember when we had such all-star receives like Owens and Desean Jackson
Its such a help for any quarterback, but especially a young one- I'm glad they are spending money
Yea Jeffrey was like the number one free agent and the Eagles picked him up!
Between him and Torrey Smith we should have some great WR targets for Wentz
They also got Blount to help with our run game
Yea, that will be exciting to have a big, tough running back
Sproles is good, but he is small so you can't use him in every situation.
Plus all these offensive weapons are veterans- which will help Wentz
I think these decisions bode well for the next couple of years as far as building a winning sustainable team
I just hope our defense gets better this year too
Yes, we need to work on that. We used to have such an imposing secondary- its what we were known for.
Ah yes, sheldon brown, brian dawkins, troy vincent, trent cole....reggie white!
Yea they made defense fun to watch!
