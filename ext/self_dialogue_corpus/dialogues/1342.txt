Alright my man, let's talk about the NFC North.
Alright, but first we need to acknowledge a mistake we made. When we talked about the NFC South,  we left off Tampa Bay and included the Rams!!!
Oh man ! What a mistake! Ivery get to revise my picks!  Winston is good enoughere to get them in the playoffs this year!
Agrees!  Revised standings for the South NO, TB in a wildcard, ATL then CAR in last.
Okay, on to the North. We already know the Bears aint going to do nothing,
Yeah 3-13 if they are lucky.
GB is the standard bearer there. Aaron Rodgers can not be stopped.
I know that's right! GB will be the number one seed for the NFC.
So we got #1and #4 figured out.
So where do we put Detroit and Minnesota?
I don't know man. Who is going to start at QB for the Vikings?
That's tough! Bridgewater or Bradford? Two qbs equals no qbs.
And AP gone to New Orleans!  I can't see them co.peting this year.
I dont know you might be right.
Detroit is still a threat as long as they have Matthew Stafford.
Yep. I dont care who they play. I'm always happy to watch them on Thanksgiving Day
Its a tradition for sure.
So I'm going GB, DET, MIN, and CHI way back
Way back indeed! Cutler gone and they don't know if Glennon or Trubisky  will start.
It doesn't matter! They are still the Bears!! Hahaha.
