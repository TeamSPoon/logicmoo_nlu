Have you ever seen The Matrix?
Yes I have seen all of them and I loved them.
I really liked the first two, but the last one didn't make sense to me.
Yeah it was kind of weird how they ended the series.
I really loved how they displayed the virus of the program as 'agents'.
I like how in the second movie they show the agents all forming into one more powerful agent.
I think the first matrix is probably Keanu Reeves best movie ever.
I totally agree with you. He is a really cool actor for that role.
Its amazing how much time and effort they put into making the first matrix movie.
Yeah, it ended up with some really good fight scenes and bullet dodging.
