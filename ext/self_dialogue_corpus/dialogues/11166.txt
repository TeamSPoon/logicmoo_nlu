Have you seen this new Instagram store that sells fashionable clothes for cheap?
Maybe.  Do you know what the account is called?
I think it might be called @Fashionforless.
That sounds interesting.  Let me go check their account.
You should!
Oh, its a private account.  Are you already following them?
Yes, i am.  Let me show you the clothes they sell.
Great!  Thanks!  Have you bought anything from them?
Yes, I have!  It is this dress right here.  I got it for less than $30, planning on wearing it to an upcoming wedding.
Oh my!  That looks really nice!  And that price is pretty good!  How is the quality?
It is fairly decent quality.  Definitely looks and feels like a dress in the hundred something dollar range.
How does it fit you?
It fits me exactly to a tee.
How did you figure out your size?
There are measurements right here on each post.  So I jut measured myself for comparison.
Sounds easy enough!
It is.
Have you bought anything else from them?
I just ordered this pair of distressed jeans but it hasnt come yet.
Ohhhhh.  Tell me how it fits when you get it.
