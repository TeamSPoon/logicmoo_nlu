Whats your favorite action movie?
I think Rambo is.
That's a classic.
Sure is. Rambo really does some damage.
I don't blame him. They should've just left him alone.
He told them he was just passing through.
Well those simple minds in that little town sure learned.
Sylvester Stallone is great in action films.
Yeah, those muscles really come in handy.
He is just good in every movie.
