What did you think of the game Saturday night?
The Penguins and Senators game?
Yeah, it was a great game.
Who won?
Senators, in ovetime.
Ahh men, I wanted the Penguins to win.
Crosby is still hurt, he should be back to full strength soon.
They have to win the next game.
It would be nice for the cup to go back to Canada.
No, they have had it enough.
It would be like the cup moving home.
But if the cup is in Canada then it is not in Pittsburgh
Who do you want them to win if the Penguins aren't in it
I probably wouldn't watch
Then you didn't you see the game tonight?
I had to work, couldn't get it off
It was a good game, hope you had it recorded
If they lost then I will skip it
Hope they win the next game
Same
