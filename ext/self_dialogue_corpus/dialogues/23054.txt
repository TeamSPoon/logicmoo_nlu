Have you seen the movie Point Break?
With Keanu Reeves? Yea of course, I watch all his movies.
Really? Me too, he's my favorite actor.
I mean, Patrick Swayze was great too, but Reeves is the best.
Yea Dirty Dancing is one of my favorites also, Swayze definietly is great.
Dirty Dancing is great, but it's no Matrix.
Yea the matrix series was amazing. What other Keanu movies do you like?
Definitely speed, speed was one of my favorite movies growing up.
Oh man I loved speed. That scene where he shoots the hostage was so good.
Yea me and my brother used to run around acting that scene out.
Replacements was really good too.
Yea, that's one not many people talk about.
Oh we can't forget Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures.
Oh wow, how did I forget those. Yea those are absolute classics.
I mean, it takes a great actor to make such a stupid movie premise so good.
Yea. They don't make stupid movies like that anymore.
Yea, I guess kids are too smart to like stuff like that these days.
Well, that's a shame, because those movies are 100% fun.
Yea. Man, Keanu has so much Range.
I know, from The Matrix to The Lakehouse, he can do it all.
