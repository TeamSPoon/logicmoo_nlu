Hey guy! Only 30+ days til preseason!
I know I can't wait man! Pittsburgh is going to win it all this year.
Say what!?! I don't even know that they are going to win their division!
Come on! You can't be serious, If you don't think we are going to win the division, who is going to?
It could be Cincy or Baltimore.
Well we agree that it won't be Cleveland!
For sure. They've got Brock Osweiler as QB. He'll do the same for them as he did for Houston, absolutely nothing!
They are hopeless! Worst team in the league.
Baltimore is always a wild card for me. They were only one game from the division title last year, and the core is returning, so They are contenders.
Yeah, I'll give you that, but Cincy is finished if you ask me.
Why do you say that, Dalton got hurt last year right? Or was that the year before last?
It doesn't even ,matter. They have no leadership.
Well. I guess I can see your point. They have no respect for their coach.
I used to really like Marvin Lewis, but he just can't get it done.
You're right. This has to be his last year .
But , you never know. If Dalton can stay healthy, they can go 11-5 and take Pitts. place as top dog.
I don't think so! But whatever man!
But I will confess that if , and thats a big if, all your Steelers can stay healthy an not suspended, they should stay on top.
Low blow man! Anyway, what's your final call?
I see Pitts at 12-4 , Baltimore 10-6, Cincinnati 8-8 and Cleveland 1-15.
