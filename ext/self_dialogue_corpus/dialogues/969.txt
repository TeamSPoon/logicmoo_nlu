I think the Cowboys have a good shot to win the NFC championship.
What about the Greenbay Packers?
They should be pretty good if they can stay healthy.
The Panthers should be tough as well.
Cam Newton is always good.
Do you think that the Patriots can get back to the Superbowl?
Yes, they are always the team to beat in the AFC.

He never seems to get old.
Brady just keeps getting better and better with age!
Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the history of the NFL.
How do you like the Redskins chances this year?
The NFC East is going to be tough.
The Cowboys should be the favorite to win the NFC east.
Dak Prescot is a great young quarterback.
The Giants and Eagles are much better than they were last year.
The Eagles have a really good young quarterback too.
