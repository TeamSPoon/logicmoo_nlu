In Star Wars Episode one, Return of the Sith, is Padme the queen or is Amadala?
They are the same, kind of.
How is that? One day its one then its the next.
Padme is the name she goes by, when her title is shown it is amadala.
But there are two of them in the movie.
No, on is her maid. Her maid posses as her.
Oh, so when she died it was not the queen but the maid?
Yes, she did this for protection and also to have more freedom to explore.
So, there is only one and she acted like she was the hand maid.
That sums it up. Padme was both Padme and the queen-princess-senator.
