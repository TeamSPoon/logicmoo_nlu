Hey do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?
Of course, she's always on the radio.
What's your favorite song by her?
Just Dance.  I know it's an oldie, but it's my favorite.
Yeah, that was a really great song.  Have you ever heard her track Judas?
No I haven't.
It's a lesser known song but it's great.  You should definitely check it out.
Okay, I'll do that.  Is it anything like Just Dance?
No, not really.  It's a newer song and her music has evolved a bit so it's different, but if you like Lady Gaga I'm sure you'll like this song.
Okay, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
