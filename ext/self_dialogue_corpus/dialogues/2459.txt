Who do you think is the greatest running back in NFL history?
Good question so many hard choices.
Many backs to think about.
How about Jim Brown?
I'm not old enough to remember him?
How about OJ simpson?
I was a kid when he played, all I know of him is the criminal cases!
How about Barry Sanders?
I think he was great a shame he retired early.
He had some moves.  He would have had the rushing record had he played longer.
He was the greatest at least in terms of being able to make people miss.
What about Walter Payton?
I really didn't see him play much either, he was older when I remember seeing him play.
What about Emmit Smith?
He was a good running back, and he had a great line in front of him. He has the all time record but played a long time.
He was the best in the 1990s.
What about Marshall Faulk?
He was great, but maybe not the greatest.
The list is so long I cannot decide.
We still have not talked about Marcus Allen, Adrian Peterson,Jerome Bettis, Eric Dickerson.  I'm going with Barry Sanders.
