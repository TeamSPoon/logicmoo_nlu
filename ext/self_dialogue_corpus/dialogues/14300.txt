How about the NBA lottery results the other night.
Yeah Boston, Lakers and Sixers wents 1, 2, & 3.
I had no doubt that the Celtics and Lakers would be 1 & 2.
Oh, did you think it would be fixed.
Well, it's hard to ignore that.
I guess, but they did have a good chance to be at the top.
Sucks for the Sixers because they would have gotten the Lakers pick if it was lower than #3.
True, but the Sixers did move up to #3.  And they get the Lakers pick next year.
Yeah, I guess but I think this draft will be a lot better.
It is a nice deep draft.
I'm guessing Fultz goes #1 to Celts, especially with Isaiah Thomas' injury this postseason.
Oh I have no doubt.  Will be a force for the Celts.
Then I guess the Lakers take Lonzo Ball, but I could see them passing.
Man, I wouldn't want to deal with the circus that is his dad.
Yep, the kid can ball but what a nightmare.
I'm not even sure how good he will be in the NBA.
Oh I think he will be pretty good.  He can distribute well.
But he's slow, long but slow.  I think he has trouble defending point gaurds.
Yeah, could be, you might be right.
Wouldn't surprise me to see the Lakers take Josh Jackson instead.
