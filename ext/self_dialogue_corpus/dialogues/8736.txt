Do you like the band Soundgarden?
I love them! I sure hate that Chris Cornell died.
Yeah that was tragic. He was the lead singer of Audioslave also.
Yes I love their song "Like A Stone." That's my favorite from them.
They really helped put grunge on the map in the 90s.
I still iisten to grunge. I even turned my kids onto it.
Really? I wish I could get my kids to appreciate old school rock.
All you have to do is show them what's great about it and they'll slowly tune in.
That sounds like a good idea. The video for Black Hole Sun was awesome.
Right I remember thinking at the time how no one had done anything like that before.
