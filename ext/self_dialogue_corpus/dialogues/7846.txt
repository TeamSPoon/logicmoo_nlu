Have you seen the Harry Potter series?
Yes I have, why?
I just finished watching it, who was your favorite character?
Probably Hermoine, I can relate to her.
Why is that?
Well she's a girl first of all and she doesn't back down or let anyone step on her toes.
That's true you never did take anything from anyone.
She's tough and that's why I like her.
Yes she is.
She's also gorgeous she's the triple threat.
