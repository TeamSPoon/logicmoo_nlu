I'm looking for a good movie to watch this weekend. Do you have any suggestions?
What type of movie are you looking for? Drama, comedy, family, suspense?
I'm thinking something funny, maybe a romantic comedy something older would be good.
I love older movies. What older actors do you like?
I love Audery Hepburn, Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire.
Have you heard of the movie Funny Face?
No what's Funny Face?
Funny Face is a 1957 movie staring Audry Hepburn and Fred Astaire.  It's about a unlikely girl becoming a famous model
That sounds good actually do you own it so I could borrow it?
Yes of course I'll loan you Funny Face and My Fair Lady.
Whose in My Fair Lady?
It is another older movie staring Audrey Hepburn. It was nominated for Oscars and is often referred to as the original Pretty Woman.
That sounds good are these movies in black and white or color?
Both movies are in color.
Ok so I'll take My Fair Lady and Funny Face. Do you have one more?
Would you like another old one?
Yes I think the theme is older classic romantic movies.
Oh I know exactly what you should watch!  Sabrina also starring Audrey Hepburn.
I have heard of that one and have always wanted to watch it. I guess it's a Audrey movie marathon.
Ok I'll bring Funny Face, My Fair Lady and Sabrina over later tonight and drop off.
