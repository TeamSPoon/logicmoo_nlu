I saw Cinderella and felt so good about the story.
Oh! I know the very old prose and tale is now so much live.
I have been thinking and finding magic in life like that.
I too believe it happens.
Could it happen to us, what happened to Cinderella and the Prince?
It may I feel but I know little about the magic.
Cinderella found her prince, and they were happy.
Yeah, every good work has a happy ending.
It really takes a lot of effort to reach happiness.
I am sure I believe.
