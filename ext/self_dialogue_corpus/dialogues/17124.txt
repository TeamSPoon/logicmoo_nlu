Which five note do you play?
That depends on the pentatonic scale. There are versions
Start with the most common.
Well, it's not so much how common, because blues is common, which makes it minor pentatonic the most common.
So then that's the answer.
is that an happy answer?
I don't care.
No it's not an happy answer, because that only addresses the commonality of the scale as opposed to minute nuances of the scales.
Nuance, another BIG word for you.
Ok.... aanyway. So minor pentatonic scale uses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the natrual minor scale. So for A minor that's A, C, D, E, G and back to A.
What happens if I start with c?
Then you will be playing the major pentatonic scale.
What?
if you start with C, you get C, D, E, G, A and back to C. which is the major pentatonic scale.
Is that the only difference?
yep.
What happens if I start with G?
Now, if you want to know that we have to talk about the nature of the scales more.
Fine, go ahead.
Pentatonic scales can be classified into two categories -- hemitonic, or anhemitonic.
