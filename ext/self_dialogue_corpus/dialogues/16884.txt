You know who I haven't listened to in a long time?
Your mother? No, really...who?
Ha. No, the Indigo Girls. I used to love their songs!
Oh I listened to them a ton in the 90s!
Me too. I had a tape of their self-titled album which I probably played a thousand times.
Is that the one with Blood and Fire on it?
Yes! I loved that song, so raw and powerful.
Absolutely, and both women have killer voices.
Right? I think my favorite part about them though is how different their voices are.
True. They wrote good songs for both singers too.
Yeah, though I think everyone liked one singer or the other better.
Not me. I liked them both!
Me too. I think my favorite thing about them is the harmonies.
Oh yeah when they sang together it was awesome.
I used to sit and try and sing along with one and then the other.
Me too! I think I learned how to sing harmony from listening to that band.
They didn't always pick the easy harmony either. I heard Galileo come on the radio the other day and when I listened to the harmonies they were really cool.
I remember that song. "How long till my soul gets it right..." Great song.
It is, and like I said, they don't pick the harmonies that are the most obvious all the time.
Maybe, but once you've listened to them do it those are the harmonies you hear.
