Do you like Clint Eastwood movies?
Yes, my favorite is "Unforgiven".
I like that one, but who could resist the classic "The Outlaw Josey Wales"?
Clint Eastwood had a long career. "Unforgiven" was filmed in 1992 while "The Outlaw Josey Wales" was filmed in 1976
Have you watched any classic John Wayne movies?
Yes, I watched "The Quiet Man" last week.
I think one of his most famous films is"The Searchers".
I agree, but he had so many. He was a legend in Hollywood.
What roles did Charlton Heston play in his career?
He had many acting roles, but I think his most famous was in "Ben Hur".
Since I like the current "Planet of the Apes" movies, I think Charlton Heston's best role was in the 1968 original version of "Planet of the Apes".
I would have to agree, but that is one film that I have not cared to see.
Do you not like science fiction movies?
I do, but I like a more dystopian genre like "the Hunger Games".
That movie was good and it came out close to "Divergent" I think.
It did and I saw the next movie in the series, "Insurgent".
Do you plan to see "Allegiant"?
No, I did not like the book plot in that one.
I loved all the movies in the "Matrix" series, but I think the first one was the best.
Keanu Reeves was cast perfectly for that role.
