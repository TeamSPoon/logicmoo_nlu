What did you think about Life?
I was expecting a bit more honestly.
It was okay.  I thought the ending was creative.
You mean how the alien actually lands on Earth?
In water, right.  The pods were in fact going the opposite way in space.
Kind of a downer, but I guess that was the point.
I kind of saw it coming though.
Really? Not me.
This just seems like the type of movie where you should expect a twist and lo and behold, there is one.
I was thinking they would all die instead, but get what you mean.
