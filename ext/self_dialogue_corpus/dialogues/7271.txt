Did you like the remake of Disney's The Jungle Book?
You mean the new live action version?
Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about.
I didn't like it as much as the original.
Why didn't you like it?
The music wasn't nearly as good as in the first one.
Yeah I mean, maybe you're right. There was like only two songs afterall.
Right. Also the giant monkey freaked me out in the newer version! So Scary!
Hahaha. That's funny because I thought the same thing.
Yeah his temple was really scary.
