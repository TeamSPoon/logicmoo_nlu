Have you seen the old Airplane movies from the 70s?
I grew up on those movies! I love all the cute little puns.
Those were great movies and a little risque for their time.
I agree totally. Have you seen Bridesmaids?
That was hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is so funny it's ridiculous.
I loved her in The Boss. She really played that part well.
That's true. She took a little heat for her weight at the beginning but I think people see that her talent outweighs all that.
Absolutely true. I loved her in Ghostbusters.
Leslie Jones was really funny in that too. She's another one who's been criticized for her looks.
That's a shame. They're both really great talented actresses and extremely funny.
