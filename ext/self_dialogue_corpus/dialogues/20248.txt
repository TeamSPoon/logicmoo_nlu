Do you remember Robocop?
The remake or the original.
I was thinking of the original ones.
I do remember them.  Those weren't too bad really.
It's funny how they viewed the future in the 80's.
Yeah, the cars are definitely not too futuristic looking.
I think they were old-school Ford sedans if I remember correctly.
I think you're right.
The movies were kind of gory, weren't they?
In parts.  He shoots a lot of people in them.
Aside from that, it showed people getting hit by cars, torn apart.
Yeah, pretty gruesome stuff.
Some of the effects are pretty dated now.
Especially the robots.  Very herky-jerky.
Well, that was considered great at the time, but special effects have come a long way.
Whatever happened to the main actor?
Peter Weller?  Couldn't tell you.
I couldn't name another single movie he was ever in.
Maybe he made enough from the originals to retire.
Perhaps so.  I wish I had that much dough!
