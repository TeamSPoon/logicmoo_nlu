Do you have a favorite team?
Yup, mine is the Packers.
Oh, you are a cheese head! Mine is the Cardinals.
They are not bad, you in AZ?
Used to be, now in Nashville.
Titan's done okay last season.
Yup, hopefully the QB will stay healthy. He's still young though.
What about Card's QB?
Yeah, I am a bit concerned. Palmer is getting old and we will need a new QB...and Wide receiver, too.
Fitzgerald is still playing right?
I think this may be his last season. We do have a great Running back.
Oh, yeah. What's his name?
David Johnson.
He's new?
Kinda, he is young and really good.
That's good.
How do you think Packers will do this season?
I think they will do good.
I don't care as long as Steelers and Patriots don't win.
I second that!
