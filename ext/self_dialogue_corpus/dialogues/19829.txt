Hey, the new Arcade Fire video is up!
Really?  I'll check it out.
I've been looking forward to new stuff from them.
Me too.  It's been ages.
I have to admit, this new song is not as catchy as the others, but it's still pretty good.
I'm sure it's good.  Remember the show we saw a few years back?
Yeah, thanks for taking me along.  I'd never really listened to them until then.
I'm glad you liked them.  I've been a fan for a long time, just hadn't gotten around to the new stuff yet.
Yeah, they were great.  I'd only heard a few songs from them before but the show was amazing.
They're pretty theatrical.  Every concert I've been to has amazing multimedia.
And how about the opening act?
The DJ?
Yeah, Dan Deacon.  Remember when he had people come up and dance with him?
We should have gone down there!
Yeah, all the way from the third balcony, ha!
They used to change their opening act every month or so.  And had different genres too.
I can see why.  They're pretty eclectic.
Yep, they're good at everything.
Oh yeah.  So check out the new one.  It's no Reflektor, but it's catchy.
Nothing beats Reflektor!
