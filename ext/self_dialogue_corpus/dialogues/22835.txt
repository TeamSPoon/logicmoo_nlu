What have you heard about the movie, "Wonder Woman?"
I heard that it had a great opening week-end with a box office of over $100 million.
It is generating a lot of buzz.
No doubt about it, I read that women are crying at the joy of seeing a strong woman lead.
I saw that.  Her facial expression is just business-like and determined, not angry and twisted.
A competent woman just taking care of business.
I also saw that this is quite a boost for the Action Comics movie franchise.
Yes, the Marvel characters have done better in recent history.
The other Action characters have been to dark.
I hate the way Batman has been depicted in every movie about him.
Yes. You would think that a rich man would have some joy in his life.
Did you read about Gal Gadot's salary.
No. What is it
She is getting $300,000 for the role.
Well, she will make it up in the sequel's
Maybe, but she is committed to two more at the same salary.
Goodness!  That is not much!
I know.  But the producers will have made her into a star.
Well, I hope she gets rich in later roles.
I am sure that if she stays healthy, she will get well paid eventually.
