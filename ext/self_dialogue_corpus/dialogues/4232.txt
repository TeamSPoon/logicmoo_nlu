I finally got around to seeing Inception yesterday.
Oh yeah?  What did you think?
It was kind of confusing, but very cool to watch.
All Christopher Nolan films are pretty awesome.
So I don't really get the end.  What happened?
It's up to you to interpret it.  Maybe he's in a dream, maybe he's not.
I think he never woke up.  That's why the top didn't stop spinning.
But at the end, it nearly fell over.
Yeah, but it cut out so you'll never know.
Right.  I guess that was the point.
