How do you feel about Lil Wayne?
I don't know how I feel as I don't know know who they are so tell me about them.
Well he is an American rapper from Louisianan, New Orleans specifically. He was a teenager when he released his first record in 1997.
Wow, that is impressive. Very much a child prodigy.
His lime light was from his initial record release in 1997 to the early 2000s when he released various hits.
One of my favorite rap groups is Nas.
They are surely a classic, that defined the genre for a while. He is from Brooklyn and is very much a staple for east coast rap.
Well how about Kenye West?
I like that his style is so defined and how he can bust a rhyme.
That is the biggest part in being a fantastic rapper. He also won a Grammy which is very impressive.
How do you feel about Immortal Technique?
I really like them, hop political his lyrics are is amazing. Also he really knows how to call people out on stuff.
Totally, I really love his song Beef and Broccoli, it is just so brutal to everyone.
His real name is Felipe Andres Coronel and he was born in 1978 and is from Peru.
How interesting, always have I liked his music and never did I know that.
What do you think is his best album?
I would have to say The 3rd World is my favorite Immortal Technique album.
That is a great one, it is just so brutal and vivid but also has an important message.
What is your favorite song on that album?
Open Your Eyes is just so fantastic how it evolves and becomes so intense really how it questions so much of our nations ideals.
