Did you hear about the new fashion for men?
No, do tell
You won't believe it!
Try me.
It's a romper for men.
A romper, like a one-piece?
Yes, like a onesie, but shorter.
Are they wearing it here?
Maybe not yet, but wait for summer.
Who it selling them?
I'm not sure
Have you seen it in person yet?
Not yet, just seen it on TV.
Hopefully I won't see it anywhere else.
I bet you really want one.
Not hardly, this fad will pass quickly.
Don't be so sure, this one has legs.
Legs, I get it.
I might get one.
I hope not.
