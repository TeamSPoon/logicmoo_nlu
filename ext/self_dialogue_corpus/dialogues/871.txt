I'm so sick of the Broncos fans around here.
What makes you despise them?
Perhaps it's the fact that they are just everywhere around these parts.
Probably because you don't have another football team in this market.
They are the closest team, but it's so much more than that.
Okay, well what do you hate in particular?
For one, their colors.
What's wrong with blue and orange?
I see it everywhere.  I can't go anywhere in the winter without seeing Broncos coats!
Seems like a silly reason to hate the team.
What drives me even crazier is their fanbase.
They're no different from everyone else.
Oh, but they are, much more annoying.
In what ways exactly?
For one, all they talk about was their Super Bowl victory.
It was a good win for Manning.
But see, they don't talk about getting spanked by the Seahawks.
And why would they?  That was a horrible Super Bowl to watch.
But they make up a billion excuses why they lost the game and don't just own it.
At least they've made a Super Bowl recently, that's gotta stand for something.
