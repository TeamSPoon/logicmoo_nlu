If I had to pick my most favorite song of all time I think that would be a hard decision.
I don't know I think I know what mine would be.
What song is your most favorite? Any genre.
I would have to say "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston.
Oh wow! Yes that was a great one.
It was! A true classic that almost everyone knows.
Let me think, I like many different grenres of music.
Do you like any R&B music?
Yes I do like some.
Me too, I loved 112 back in the day.
Oh I know which song is my favorite! "Don't Change" by Musiq Soulchild.
I don't know if I know that song, what was it about?
About a man who is so in love with his wife, he doesn't want her to change a thing.
That's so sweet. I love songs like that.
I really do too.
They make me feel romantic and mushy.
Yes I put that music on when I'm in the right mood.
When did that song come out do you remember?
I think it came out in 2002.
Oh okay, around the time I started high school.
