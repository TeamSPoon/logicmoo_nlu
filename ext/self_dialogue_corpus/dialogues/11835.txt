So who do you prefer?  The Beatles or the Stones?
Definitely the Beatles!  I grew up watching them!
When was the first time you saw them?
It was February, 1964 when they were on the Ed Sullivan Show and sang, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".
From then on, you were hooked, right?
Absolutely.  I have been following them for decades. Every song and every controversy!
Which controversy bothered you the most?
I think when Yoko Ono was blamed for breaking up the band. What do you think? Was that her responsibility?
I think by that time, the band members were ready to go out on their own anyway.
You're probably right.  No doubt there music will live forever with such classics as "Yesterday" and "Let It Be".
