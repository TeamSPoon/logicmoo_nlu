What's your favorite film with an alien in? And you can't say Alien.
Probably Arrival.
Is that the one with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner?
Yes, and Forest Whitaker too. Have you seen it?
Not yet...what do you like about it?
It's quite a slow moving film, some suspense but definitely not an action movie. Emotionally charged too.
What's it actually about?
Some aliens arrive and try to communicate with us, but no-one can understand them, so a specialist translator is brought in. That's Amy Adams's character.
How does she work out what the aliens are saying?
Well, she starts off by getting them to write things.
So they have hands and can hold things? Why are aliens always humanistic?
That's where you're wrong. They don't really have hands and they kind of spray the ink like an octopus to form sentences.
What does the writing look like?
It's not really formed of letters as such, I won't spoil the film but they write in circles that look a bit like coffee mug stains on a table, but each bit of imperfection in the circle has meaning.
And Amy Adams works it all out?
Slowly but surely, yes.
And do the aliens come in peace?
That'd be telling. You should watch it and find out.
OK. Tell me one more fact about the film.
The writing structure created for the film actually "works" linguistically. With enough effort anyone could learn it and form sentences and write conversations.
