Did you ever see Rambo?
Which one?
The second one.
Is that the one where he goes to Vietnam to rescue POWs?
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, I remember seeing that as a kid. I thought it was so cool
Yeah, it was pretty intense. That's where Stallone got all ripped.
Yeah, probably started taking some steroids.
He was also pretty ripped in Rocky.
Well starting in Rocky III is when he became really ripped.
Yeah and then there was Rambo III a few years later.
Oh right and didn't they do another Rambo fairly recently?
Yeah, it wasn't that good. Stallone looked really old in it.
Yeah, you can't keep up the story line for that long.
No you can't. I did like the second and first Rambo movies though.
I just remember that was a large body count in the second one.
Oh yeah, he must've killed over a 100 people in that movie.
Oh dear. Almost a bit far fetch.
Well he is Rambo.
Yes and no one messes with John Rambo.
