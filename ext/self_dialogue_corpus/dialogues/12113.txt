Do you ever wonder if anyone from the Star Wars universe ever made it to our galaxy?
Not really, that was a long time ago.
Good point. Do you think they could ever do a cross over between Star Trek and Star Wars?
No, they occupy totally different timelines.
Oh good point. Do you think we will see Jar Jar Binks in another movie?
There's no way, that was the worst character of all time.
What is your favorite star wars character?
My favorite is Admiral Akbar, he's got a lot of subtle depth.
That's interesting, my favorite character is Lando Calrissian.
But that guy is a total double crosser, why?
