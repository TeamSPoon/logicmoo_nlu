Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I love the Beatles. What about you?
I like their older songs. I like yesterday and Hey Jude.
I like more of their later songs. Revolution and you say it's your birthday are two of my favorites.
Oh, I don't like those as much.
That was when they started getting into more rock sounding music.
Yea. I just prefer the slower songs.
Alot of people like their earlier music.
Do you listen to them often?
Yes, I do!
