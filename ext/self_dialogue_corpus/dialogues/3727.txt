Hey, have ever wacthed the movie The Crazies?
No, isn't that a horror movie?
Horror/thriller movie, to be exact.
Okay, what's the plot?
Ogden Marsh, a small town in Lowa, starts seeing odd, violent behavior from some of it's residents?
Okay, so do we know what's happening, or does it remain a mystery?
Yes, as it turns out a Army plane carrying a bioweapon called Trixie crashed in the nearby swamp and contaminated the water supply.
Okay, what does Trixie do, in regards to "odd, violent behavior"?
After a 48 hour incubation period, the infected become cruel, calculated, and deranged killers who often work together to kill the uninfected.
Okay, sounds like a good scary movie, I might give it a look.
