I went to the game two weeks ago and the stadium was packed to the hilt
Who was playing?
The home team you know, the Patriots against the Steelers
Did you get a good parking space
Actually since we knew it would be crowded there, we took the bus
Good idea
You know the Patriots won though
Naturally, they are a pretty good team
Well I have seen the Patriots lose a few times
I was not wasn't saying they have never lost
Yeah because they lost last year
To whom ?
To the Bills  then the Seahawks
Yeah but that record was pretty impressive last year
Two losses
What could be better than that?
I don't know I guess you have a point. As I was saying the tickets sold out and the stadium was really packed
Did you all get good seats though?
Yes, though they were way up in the stands
Cool. Glad you all got through that okay
