You say that NFL football is your favorite sport to watch.
On television.
Not in person?
It's o.k. in person, but basketball would be my favorite to go to.
Why's that; isn't football exciting in person?
Yes, but there are too many delays--huddle times mostly.
The no huddle offense has changed that.
Not really--the quarterback mainly stands there looking over the defense and calling signals and it's not much faster, unless they are in hurry up mode.
And television?
Instant replay; now instead of sitting there watching nothing, you get to see the play again.
And an expert commentator explaining what happened.
And John Madden getting excited over a lineman's block.
You know, Madden retired.
I know; I miss him.
Yes, instant replay has changed the game and made you appreciate the subtleties.
I do have a problem with it.
What's that.
When I go to a game, I don't watch carefully, expecting to see it better on replay.
Well, there is jumbotron.
Well, that's not the same as a television replay at home, and I even find myself waiting for replay at other events
