What is your favorite horror movie of all time?
Thats a hard question. Whats yours?
I'd have to say, The Shining .
You mean the original with Jack Nicholson?
Definitely. He's the only one who could play Jack.
I know the remake was good, but not the same.
Even the way the kid said Redrum was creepy.
I agree.
So you never told me your favorite.
Well I'd have to think, but that one is way up there.
