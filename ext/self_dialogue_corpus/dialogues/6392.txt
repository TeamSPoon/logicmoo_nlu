Have you seen Beauty and the Beast yet?
No, but I heard it was almost the same as the first one!
It really was, except with live action characters!!
How neat! Id love to see how the girl from Harry Potter did as Belle!
She was outstanding! The man they cast as the beast did really well too!
I always loved him! Guess I'm into the strong, silent type!
Im pretty sure my favorite part of Disney movies are usually the end. I love seeing a romance blossom!
Me too! It always gives me the warm and fuzzies!
So, I guess this means you're renting Beauty and The Beast tonight?
You guessed right!
