Do you think the fast and Furious franchise is actually done?
Well, they did call the last one the fate of the eight.
I suppose so, but the franchises just seem to keep making movies even after they stop being good.
This last one was still pretty good.
It was okay, I missed Paul walker.
They did an okay job of explaining why he wasn't around.
I thought they still could have used some old footage or something as a memorial to his character.
Vin Diesel and the Rock were still pretty awesome.
There's no way that the Rock would lose a fist fight to the guy from Crank.
That's a good point, his arms are the same size as the other guy's waist!
