Hey, do you want to come watch The Hangover?
That sounds like a good idea. I love those movies.
So do I. I can't believe they managed to make all of them so funny!
I know, I thought they would jump the shark with the third one, but they held strong.
Ed Helms kills me in those movies, he's such a great actor.
I really like how his character progresses throughout all three movies.
Yeah, he's like a whole new person by the end.
I loved him in We're the Millers, he was a maniac in that movie.
That movie was all around awesome. That cast was a complete slam dunk.
You're totally right on that!
