How do you feel about the 49er's season this year?
Not great.  How do you feel about the Raider's season this year.
I actually feel pretty good.
Who's you favorite NFL player right now?
I'm always a fan of Sebastian Janokowsky.  Who's your favorite player right now?
I think Aaron Rodgers.
Yeah, he's a class act.
So at what point do you think they just start playing touch football in the NFL?
Why because of all the concussion and injury concern?
Yeah.  It is legit scary and sad to see famous football players with head trauma and death from suicide, but I guess it's an inherent risk to the game.
I think the larger is more the cumulative effects from having full contact practices and games from the age of 4 on.
I wonder who's going to be the halftime performer this year.
Has Taylor Swift ever done it.
No.  It's only a matter of time before Taylor Swift does it.
Who was your favorite halftime performer?
Probably Timberlake.  How bout you? Gaga?
I actually think Katy Perry and Left Shark was my favorite.
Kendrick Lamar would be perfect, but he would never be invited.
I don't think he has enough of a hit base or a wide enough audience or recognition
That's true.  They should just get the Killers.
