How are you doing today?
I am fine, just cleaning house and listening to some music.
What are you listening to?
I have been in a country mood so I got Blake Shelton going.
I love his music, he always seems to put out good songs.
I am listening to Honey Bee right now.
That is a good one. Have you ever heard You'll Think Of Me?
Yes, but that is not by Blake Shelton.
Really? I thought for sure it was!
No, that one was released by Keith Urban.
Oh ok, well it is a really good song anyways.
I agree! Actually, Keith Urban is one of my favorite artists.'
I know I really love that song Stupid Boy.
Me to! I sang that one at a karaoke event one time.
Come to think of it he may be my favorite country singer.
Yea he is really talented! He seems like a great guy as well.
Do you know of any more good songs from him?
Have you ever heard Its Raining On Sundays?
No, I will have to listen to that one today.
Great! One interesting thing about Keith Urban is the fact that he is married to Nicole Kidman.
