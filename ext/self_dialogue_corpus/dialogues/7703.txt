Your birthday is coming up, what do you want?
I would love to have all the Harry Potter movies!
Are they any good?
You have never seen the Harry Potter series? For real?
No, I thought they were just kid books and movies.
Oh no, not at all! We need to watch them together.
How about I get the first one and we can watch it this week?
That would be great! I'm so excited to share with someone who is watching for the first time.
I'll give it a chance. So what is the name of the first movie anyway?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
