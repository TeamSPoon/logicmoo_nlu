Hey you ready for football season
Sure cant wait.
Do you know what teams have the most Superbowl wins?
I am pretty sure the Pittsburgh Steelers have 6 Superbowl wins.
Then whos after them?
The Patriots and the Cowboys each have 5 Superbowl wins.
So no team has won more then six.
No  and 13 franchises have not even won a Superbowl.
Really i had no clue i thought they had all one at least one.
No and your husbands favorite team the Saints have only won one Superbowl.
Well that is because Dree Brees is their Quarter back.
I agree he is not as good as he used to be.
So theres a few teams that if they win one more Superbowl they will tie with the Steelers.
Now i understand better.
We need to get tickets so we can take our hubbys to the game.
Thats a great idea for his birthday present.
Lets look up and see if the NFL schdule is up yet.
Great idea.
I assume he would like to stay down south since he hates the cold
Yes that means no at home games for the Steelers.
