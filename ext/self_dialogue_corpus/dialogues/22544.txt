Hey, I rented Hacksaw Ridge. Want to watch?
Isn't that about the soldier who doesn't want to actually fight?
Yeah, it's based on the story of a real guy during WWII.
What was his deal? Why wouldn't he fight?
He was a pacifist and didn't believe in it.
Who plays the guy?
Andrew Garfield.
That name sounds familiar. What's he been in again?
Probably he's best known for playing Spiderman. But he's been in a lot of other stuff too.
Oh yeah, I remember seeing those trailers. I only saw the actual movies with Tobey MaGuire though.
Same, actually.
Anyway, Hacksaw Ridge was nominated for a lot of awards, right?
Uh huh. It was nominated for best actor, director, and picture at the Oscars.
Oh wait, wasn't this Mel Gibson's movie?
Yes, he directed it.
Ugh. Now I'm not sure I want to watch.
I have that reaction too, but a movie is so much more than a director.
That's true.
I mean, if it was a book or something I wouldn't touch it. But I think movies are different because they're collaborative.
Okay, you've convinced me.
