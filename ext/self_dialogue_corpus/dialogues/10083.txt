Have you ever seen the movie Snatch?
That sounds like an interesting movie. What is it about?
It is a Guy Ritchie movie about a bunch of criminals.
That sounds fun. Why should I check it out.
It gives you a good look into the criminal underground in the United Kingdom.
Cool. I think I might check it out. Is anyone I know in this?
Have you heard of Brad Pitt?
Yes. He was so good in Inglorious Bastards.
He plays a boxer in this.
Wow. I am definitely watching this now!
