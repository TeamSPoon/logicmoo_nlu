Are you a fan of Pop Punk?
Not really, but I haven't listened much.
I think you would like it!
Oh yeah?
Yeah! Who have you listened to?
Mostly old stuff like blink 182.
Try listening to Relient k or My chemical romance!
Are they new?
Not really, but they are both bases of the genre!
Oh okay, I'll check them out!
Awesome! Try the Album MMHMM by relient k first.
Okay! any other recommendations?
Five score and seven years is a good one too!
What about from My Chemical Romance?
Pretty much any of the older albums are good!
Great!
You might also try All time low! They're another well known band.
Any album by them?
Yeah, anything will be good!
Cool!
