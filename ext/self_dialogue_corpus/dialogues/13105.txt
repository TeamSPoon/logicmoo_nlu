If it happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away......so where are they now?
I guess they have all passed away or something. Maybe a black hole got them.
Why didn't they visit Earth? They could travel light speed.
You have to travel much faster than light speed to get to a different galaxy within a lifetime.
Yoda probably lived long enough to make it to Earth.
Probably, but he had more important issues to deal with.
Yeah, the Senate and Emperor were a real pain in the butt weren't they?
Yes, I don't blame him for taking it easy when he retired. Why he stayed on Dagobah beats me though.
He and OB1 were basically the only jedi left. I guarantee his face was at the top of the Imperial most wanted posters.
I bet he could have kicked Boba Fett's butt back in the day. A bounty hunter ain't getting his hands on Yoda.
