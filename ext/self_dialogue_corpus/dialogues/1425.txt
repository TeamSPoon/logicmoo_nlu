Hey there!  How 'bout them Cowboys?
What about them?  Their 4 defensive players arrested so far this year?
LOL.  It is the offseason.
True.  However, they will miss games due to team or league rules.
Yeah.  They will be early season games though.
Probably, but remember Dallas has collapsed the past few years late in the season.
Yeah, other than last year, they usually end up playing for the division in the last game of the year.
On NBC's Sunday Night Football.
They lost those games.
They didn't make the playoffs.
Win the division and you're in.
Lose and you go home.
This didn't happen last year though.
No, but Aaron Rodgers picked apart their defense.
Yeah, he had one of the greatest seasons of all time though.
He did, but keep in mind that Green Bay lost their receiver and running back.
They had a guy with a number in the 80s playing running back.
Yeah, that is crazy.
Hopefully Dak Prescott will be better.
He might be, but then again, defense may learn how to play him better too.
