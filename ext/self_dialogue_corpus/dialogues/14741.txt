So, I watched "21 Jump Street" last night.
The new one? With Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill?
The very same. I thought it was hysterical.
It was really good, I love Jonah Hill, he cracks me up.
Me too! He was hilarious in Grandma's Boys!
Oh yeah, I remember that! My favorite Jonah movie though was "Get Him To The Greek."
I really liked that too. My favorite scene is when they take the "Jeffrey" and he goes totally crazy.
Yes! And P Diddy starts chasing him and Russel Brand through the hotel.
I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.
I really wish P Diddy would do more comedy acting, he's really good too!
