I love comedy movies, what do you think of them?
I don't like them because they all seem the same nowadays.
I do think comedy movies used to better.
Yeah, now they all make the same jokes.
I really did like" Deadpool" it was very funny.
Those comedy movies are good I just don't like movies like" Neighbors".
Kill me but I actually like movies like that.
Maybe I would like them if they weren't all R-Rated
That's what makes them funny!
Makes them stupid if you ask me.
