Did you see that they're doing a live-action remake of The Lion King?
Wow! I wonder how they're going to manage that?
Well, they did The Jungle Book with CGI, so I guess they'll use the same techniques.
My kids really love that movie, although the part where Simba's dad dies is pretty sad.
I know! Never mind my kids, that had me crying in the theater.
Still, I think that's part of the movie's enduring appeal.
Yeah, I think it helps kids deal with the idea that death is part of the circle of life.
It's also a hilarious movie, though. I hope the remake keeps the humor!
And the romance between Simba and Nala. It's so sweet!
I'm looking forward to seeing this one when it comes out.
