Do you like Gwen Stefani?
Oh yeah definitely I loved her in No Doubt when they first came out.
She has such a great voice. Don't Speak is a fantastic song.
Everyone like that no matter whether they liked rock or not.
Yeah it's very relatable. She did a song with Eve didn't she?
Yeah I think it was called Let Me Blow Your Mind.
That was it. Girls that front rock bands are awesome.
Yeah there aren't many though. I think she and Stevie Nicks are some of the main ones.
I like Joan Jett from The Runaways.
Yes I saw the movie they made about them. They had a wild life.
They sure did. Pat Benatar is my favorite female rocker of all time.
Oh Love is a Battlefield is a rock classic. How about that dance number in the video?
I can still do that dance. We will be Invincible is another one of her great ones.
I also like Heart, the two women duet from the 80s
I actually saw them in concert a few years ago at the rodeo in San Antonio, Tx
Oh really? I bet that was pretty awesome.
It was. They sang Alone and These Dreams, those are the only two songs I cared to hear.
That would have been nice if Bonnie Tyler was there too.
Oh that would have set it off. Total Eclipse of the Heart.
I sing my heart out whenever that song comes on the radio.
