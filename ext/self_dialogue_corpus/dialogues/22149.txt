Have you been to the theater lately
Not since the secret life of pets
Was it good?
I liked it, and so did the kods, my husband fell asleep
I guess not all men love those things
Nope, he liked it, just not enough action to keep him awake.
Have you seen moana?
No but I really want to
Same here, I need to get it, and trolls I really want to see it
Trolls is good, my kids watch it all the time
I need to go get it and watch it then
Yes you would love it.
My mom made a gnome gsrden, it reminds me of gnomes and Juliette
That was a cute movie, why's that
The gnomes have blue and red hats and that's the first thing I thought of
It was so cute how they recreated Romeo and Juliette like that
It was, such a cute movie
They should make another movie like that
Yea maybe cinderella?
Yes
