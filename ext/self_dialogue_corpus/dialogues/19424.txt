What is your favorite type of music?
I like lots of different music. If I have to choose, I would probably say jazz.
That's interesting. What kind of jazz?
I really like the old vocal jazz like Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday.
Oh, I love Billie Holiday. She had such a soulful voice.
She is one of my favorite jazz artists. I love listening to bluesy jazz when I am feeling down.
What do you think of modern artists who sing the classic jazz songs?
I think Michael Buble does a decent job. His version of Come Fly With Me is really great.
I don't think I have heard him sing that.
Well it's the title track on his first live album. You should check it out sometime.
I love live jazz albums. They sound so much better than the studio versions.
I know. I would love to see him live in concert one day.
Jazz concerts are really fun. I think it is better to hear jazz in person.
I think the band and the vocalists get to improvise and have more fun in front of an audience. It's a more fun experience.
I have heard the original version of Come Fly With Me on a live album and it was spectacular.
Oh that's because Frank Sinatra was spectacular. He was great at interacting with the audience.
I think Come Fly With Me was one of his signature songs. It's hard to compare his version to anyone else's.
Yes, but in jazz, people sing other people's songs all the time. Everyone adds their own little touches to it.
That's true. It think it depends on your personal preference.
Yeah, scatting and improvisations can also make a difference.
