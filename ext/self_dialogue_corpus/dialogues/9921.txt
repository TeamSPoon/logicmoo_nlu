Don't you miss Definitive Jux?
Yeah, I definitely do. They put out some great music.
It's crazy to think that they were putting out their stuff at the same time as all the bling rappers.
I know. That was a very odd period in hip-hop.
What's your favorite Def Jux release?
I would probably go with The Cold Vein by Cannibal Ox.
Oh man, that's a classic album. The production is crazy.
Yeah, for sure. What's your favorite?
I like El-P's Fantastic Damage. The production on that is even crazier.
Isn't it wild how big he's gotten? Who would have imagined that?
