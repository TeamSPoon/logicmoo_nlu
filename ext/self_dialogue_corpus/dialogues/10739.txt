Who's your favorite character in the Fast & Furious?
Dom is my favorite. How about you?
Brian is my favorite. He has such pretty blue eyes.
Dom is strong and muscular, the type of bad boy I like in a man.
Are you sad that the actor of Brian died in a tragic accident?
Yes, it was very tragic. At least it wasn't my precious Dom.
Did you like how they computer generated the scene with Brian in it?
It was awesome and looked so real. It had me in tears.
Same. He was like my husband. At least they ended the series well.
They actually have a new one that just came out. It's called the Fate of the Furious.
