What do you think is the most romantic Disney film of all time?
The Lady and the Tramp.
Wow, really?
Yes, that dinner scene is extremely romantic.
I never looked at spaghetti the same way after that.
Lady was such a beautiful character!
Yeah, I wanted a dog like her after I saw that movie.
The Scottish terrier was really funny.
Oh yeah, Jock?
Yeah, he was great.
