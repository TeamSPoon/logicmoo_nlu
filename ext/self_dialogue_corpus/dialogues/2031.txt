I heard you're into football. Who's your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
Oh yeah, they're pretty popular and also pretty hated.
I know, it seems like with football fans there is no in-between on them.
I've just recently become a fan and I don't have a favorite team yet, but I really love the game.
It's great because of the athletic ability and speed of the players.
I'll probably decide on a favorite team before the season begins. Do you have any tips for that?
Well, I think you should make your own choice. Think about the teams you're drawn to and the qualities you like in a team.
I have a friend who is a big Raider fan and we watched a lot of their games last year.
They're very popular because they have a great history of success and right now they're an up and coming team.
They have some players I really like to watch like Khalil Mack, Amari Cooper and Derek Carr.
They re very good players. Carr should come back strong from his injury.
I'm really thinking about adopting them. My wife is from Tampa and I have also gravitated toward the Buccaneers because of that.
That's another up and coming team with good young players like Jameis Winston and Mike Evans.
They narrowly missed the playoffs last year and I think they have a good chance this year.
They do because they've added some good veterans and some good talent in the draft.
But then there's one other team I like, which is the Indianapolis Colts.
They're kind of floundering the last couple of years. They have some talent but are deficient in lots of areas.
What I really like about them is their uniforms. I've always loved horses, so I like the horseshoe on the helmet.
That's fine too, people have lots of different reasons for choosing a team. They are interesting to watch.
