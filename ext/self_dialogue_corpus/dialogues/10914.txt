So I heard that the Fast & Furious series is going all the way up to ten?
Wait, ten what?
Ten films. They announced around the sixth one that they were going all the way to ten.
Oh, really? That's interesting.
Yeah, I'm just curious to see where they;ll take the story.
I'd like to think that they'll retire all of the characters.
As in the same way they did with Brian's character?
Yeah. Just write them into normal lives.
I can't help but think they're going to kill somebody off.
That's a bit morbid.
