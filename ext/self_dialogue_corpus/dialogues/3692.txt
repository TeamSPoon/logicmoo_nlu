Are you a fan of the genre thriller movies?
I watch them occasionally. What about you?
I really enjoy them. Split was my favorite recent one.
Oh, I didn't see that one. Who stars in that?
The main character is James McAvoy. He plays a guy with split personalities.
Oh, ok. I have seen M Night Shaymalan movies in the past that I enjoyed.
You should check it out then. It has some less well known actresses in it who do a fantastic job.
Ok, I will watch it sometime. Are there any other thrillers you would recommend?
It's not a new one, but since it's on Netflix I'll mention it. Shutter Island was good if you haven't seen it.
Oh, is that the one with Leonardo DiCaprio?
