Arrrgh, I need a metric for predicting these games!!!
There is none. We go back to the human events and its randomness. if it's played by the computers using bad random number generators, then it can be predicted
How is that?
Marsaglia published a paper saying the random numbers fall mainly in the planes in the 60s.
Oh, so if we ARE to uise a poor random number to play football, then you can.. Ok I see it.
Yep. Besides, we don't want to be able to predict football. It's a game. We need that element of surprise, the human victory over the expectation.
Ah the drama of football
Indeed.Without that, there is no rooting for the underdog, and football without the underdog's triumph is just not the same
Unless, we can predict the underdog's triumph.
No.
Yes.
I wonder if Minnesota got any new running backs.
Why? Do they need an RB?
They're the dead last in terms of rushing yards. They averaged 75 yards/game rushing.
That's like half of Cowboys which is 149
Yep. Oh. They picked up Dalvin Cook.
Cook is a beast!
He had over 1700 rushing yards as a senior
Vikings made a good choice.
Yep, maybe they'll get more rushing yards now.
