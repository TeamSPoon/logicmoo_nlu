It seems as if the last NFL season just flew by. Don't you think?
I absolutely agree. But it quite enjoyable.
Are you looking forward to this year's season?
Most definitely. I love all things football!
Same here. Will you be following this year's draft?
I follow here and there using my NFL app like most people do.
Same here. Although, I am not a huge follower of the draft.
I don't go crazy over it. I just look at my app and see who went were.
Would you consider enough a huge NFL fan?
I love football, as a sport in general. I used to play and my dream was to one day become a NFL player.
Sorry to hear that did not work out for you but there is still a chance.
Never say never. I train real hard at the gym but I think that ship has sailed.
What time would you want to play for?
Being from CO, I would love to play for the Broncos, of course.
That is actually one of my favorite teams.
No kidding? They have a very impressive defense.
They sure do, although, it seemed like this past season their offense was lacking a bit.
I noticed that, too.
That being said, that does not change the fact that they were the 2016 SuperBowl champs!
Sure doesn't! That was a great night.
