Did you like Lady Gaga's duets album?
I thought it was interesting that she was able to get such a wide variety of artists.
It was interesting that Tony Bennet sang with her.
Are they both from New Jersey?
I'm not sure.  I know that Lady Gaga's real name is Stephanie or something like that.
That's funny.  She doesn't look like a Stephanie.
I agree.  I wonder what prompted her to take on that name.
A lot of artists adopt alter egos and personas.
Yes, I could see doing that for one's music career.
Nobody wants someone named Stephanie singing to them.
