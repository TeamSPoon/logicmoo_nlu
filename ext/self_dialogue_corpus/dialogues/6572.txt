Can you recommend me a cartoon that would be interesting for an adult as well?
Yes, I just saw Inside Out recently and I loved it!
What makes Inside Out so great?
It depicts how emotions work inside our heads and I think it is quite psychological.
What kind of emotions is it about?
Its main characters are Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness and Disgust and they all live in a girl's brain.
Does the movie have good ratings?
Yes, I think its IMDB user rating is 8.2 which is very high.
And will my 7-year-old son also get the movie?
Yes, my daughter who is 6 laughed a lot during the movie.
