Do you like thrillers?  Scary movies?
Yes, I do.  I love a good scare!
Well, have I got a suggestion for you.  I saw a really good one called "The Boy" starring one of the actresses on "The Walking Dead", Lauren Cohan.
Oh yeah? What's it about?
A young American woman goes to England to work as a nanny on an old, isolated mansion estate.
What's so good about it?
The child she's supposed to take care of is actually a doll!  The boy was in a fire and the parents treat the doll like their lost son.
Really?  That doesn't sound all that scary-just strange and sad.
Well, the parents go on holiday and leave the nanny with their "little boy".  Some very creepy and frightening things start happening that made me about jump out of my skin and I don't scare easy!!
Thanks for the recommendation, it sounds good.  I'll look for it and watch it as soon as I can.
