What do you think about the transformers series
Honestly? I love it.
Yeah I loved the first one, but not sure about the rest.
Why do you like the first one only.
Because it was more original and the  actors did really great.
Which actors performance did you like the most
Mainly Shia Labeof
Oh are you a fan of his.
Not really these days, but I used to be.
What movie of his do you like
well it's embarrassing to say but...
Tell me! Is it an old movie
Yeah...Remember the movie Holes?
Yeah, I used to love that movie!
It was so well done, its actually one of my all time favorites
Me too. Remember the scene on the mountain
Yeah that's my favorite seen. I remember seeing that movie in theaters in 2003
Me too I have so many memories surrounding that movie
Do you think it's as good as transformers though?
Not in a million years
