Hey, can I have my Alkaline Trio cd back?
Oh yeah, totally I'm sorry.
No big deal. I just don't want to forget it,
I heard they are going to be touring again. Do you want to go see them?
Of course I want to! I've listened to them since I was 12,
Me too. What's your favorite album?
I really like Godamnit.
That's their second album,right?
Yes, what's your favorite?
Probably, Good Mourning.I used to listen to that on repeat all the time.
