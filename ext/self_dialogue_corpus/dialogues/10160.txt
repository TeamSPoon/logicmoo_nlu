I've always thought Terminator was one of the best action movies ever.
Oh, yeah.  It's right up there.
Linda Hamilton is amazing in the sequel, though.
She made a big impression on me growing up.
I wonder how long she has to work out to look so buff.
I'm sure she had to train relentlessly for months.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is so awesome always.
Yeah, I'd watch any action film with him in it.
Hey, have you ever seen Commando?  That's an underrated film of his.
I saw it long ago.  Yeah, I remember thinking it was pretty entertaining.
