What do you think about the Oakland Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
I think it sucks, and that type of move is a huge reason why I'm largely turned off to the sport.
Why do you say that?
I think the NFL really thumbs its nose at its fan base when it uproots a team from a devoted community like that.
But the San Francisco 49ers are also in the Bay Area, no?
Yes, but fans typically pick a favorite - Cubs vs. White Sox, Yankees vs. Mets, and 49ers vs. Raiders.
But don't you think Las Vegas is a big enough market to support a team?
I don't think so, because Las Vegas' population at any given time is made up largely of tourists.
Well, wouldn't tourists come out to watch a football game?
Not really, because they are not loyal followers of the home team.
Have you heard whether the Raiders will substantially change their uniform following the move?
I haven't heard, but I would expect so.
I wonder what stadium they will play in.
My guess it will be a new stadium built with taxpayer dollars.
Wow, that sounds like a total racket.
It certainly does.
It is almost as if any city willing to tax their residents to pay for a stadium can poach an NFL team.
Yes it does, and just goes to demonstrate that the NFL is really a corporate business, not fun and sport.
This isn't the first time the Raiders has moved is it?
I don't think so, but I don't recall all of the history off the top of my head.
