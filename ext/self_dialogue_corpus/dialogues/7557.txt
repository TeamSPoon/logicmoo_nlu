Have you finished the Harry Potter series yet?
I haven't yet.
Which one are you on?
I believe I'm at The Goblet of Fire.
That's where it starts getting really good in my opinion. You're going to love it.
I do love it so far. I wish I'd gotten into it earlier.
Better late than never!
I love all the magic. I also love that they've created their own sport.
You mean Quidditch?
Yes, I thought that was so creative and amazing.
