Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yes I am. We had a lot of Beatles music in our wedding.
Oh nice! Which songs?
"In my life", "something"...
That sounds lovely.
The Beatles music is very special to us as a couple.
Is there any reason?
Yes We didn't have much when we first met and we spent a lot of time listening to the few cds we had.
And I guess one of those was the Beatles?
Yes exactly. Abby Road was a favorite of ours.
