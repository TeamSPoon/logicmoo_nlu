I saw the new Transformers movie last night.
I heard it was a box office dud this weekend.
It didn't do as well as they had hoped.
Probably because they're simply not very good movies.
That outstanding, it was a pretty bad flick.
I'm shocked.  Not really of course.
Your sarcasm is noted.
What was the worst part of it.
For this one, like most of them, is the action.
Usually people like the action the best in these movies.
But it's so repetitive.  Metal crashing, loud sounds.
Buildings getting wrecked, unnecessary explosions.
Michael Bay 101.
Well, that's what the man is known for.
It doesn't help that the human characters don't have much to them.
They've never really been known as thought provoking.
They just serve as a background so the real stars can take flight in the robots themselves.
That aside, how were the visual effects?
Quite good.  They always are in these movies.
That's why they're so expensive to make!
