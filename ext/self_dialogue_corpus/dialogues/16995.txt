Do you like southern rock?
Sometimes, got someone on your mind?
I do, I have been listening to CCR lately and figured you might like them.
I don't know if I have heard of them.
It is a band lead by John Fogerty.  You may have heard of him when he went solo.
I might have.
He does a lot of good stuff.
What does CCR even stand for?
Creedence Clearwater Revival. It is an older southern rock band I enjoy.
They have many songs?
Quite a few. I tend to like their stuff like Susie Q and Green River.
So they have a pretty big library of songs?
Oh yes, very large. They made a lot of songs before Fogerty went solo.
Any good songs you'd say I definitely should listen to?
I like Lookin Out My Back Door a lot. It is a pretty crazy and catchy song.
Crazy you say?
Yeah, he is singing about flying spoons and dinosaurs dancing on on his lawn. It is goofy and I love it.
That sounds interesting.
But beyond that... Stuff like Bad Moon Rising, Who'll Stop the Rain, Down on the Corner are all classics.
Thanks, I will look into them later.
