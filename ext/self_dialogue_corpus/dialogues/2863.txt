The NFL is getting close to kicking off another season!
I know, I am really excited about that!
I figured you would be. Which teams will you be following this year?
You know me, I follow the entire league!
A couple friends of mine from work were discussing the NFL the other day.
Really? What were they discussing about it?
They were having a debate about who the best cornerback of all time was.
I wish I could have been part of that discussion.
I thought about you when I heard them talking about it!
Who were they saying the best cornerbacks of all time were?
One of them said Darrell Green was the best he had ever seen.
I remember Green, he was fantastic as a corner.
The other one was sure that Champ Bailey was the best ever.
Bailey was great as well, I even followed him in college when he played for Georgia.
So who do you think it was? Bailey or Green?
Neither! Those two friends of yours must have been forgetting about someone who was really the best corner of all time.
They both seemed pretty sure of themselves. Who do you think they were forgetting?
The best corner of all time was hands down Deion Sanders!
I remember watching him myself! Did he have some type of nick name?
Yea, his nickname was Prime Time! He was the best to ever do it!
