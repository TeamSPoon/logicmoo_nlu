Do you listen to Lady Gaga
I listen to her stuff here and there, mostly just on the radio
Oh so you aren't a fan
I wouldn't classify myself as a fan, but I think she's alright
Whats your favorite song of hers
I love Born this Way, i think it had a good message
I agree! It was a fun music video as well! I saw her perform it live
Wow that must have been fun!
Yeah she's a very energetic performer
I've heard great things about her concerts
