Have you ever listened to Opera music?
Not purposely. Only by accident.
My father loves opera.
How can anyone love opera?
I don't know myself. It is like fingers on a chalkboard.
I can imitate the singers and sound just as good by holding a high note and putting my arms out.
Well I wouldn't go that far. Ha ha!
I wonder how people nowadays get interested in it.
Yeah, I know. At least with my father there wasn't much music around.
Yeah, my grandparents think what I listen to is terrible.
There is one piece of opera music strangely enough that I actually do like.
What is it?
The marriage of Figaro.
Oh is that where they sing Figaro, Figaro, Fiiii gaaa rooooww!
Yes. You do do a great job.
I told you. Not too hard.
I heard that one quite often as a kid because my father played it in the house.
Well if it is something you constantly heard I can understand if you like it.
Yeah, it really isn't too bad. Maybe you can listen to it sometime.
Umm, I don't think so.
