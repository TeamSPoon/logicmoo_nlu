Hey man, did you hear about NFL deflategate?
No, what is that? I don't remember hearing anything like that. What is it again?
Remember the New England Patriot's Tom Brady? It was the 2014-2015 season.
No way? Really? How did I miss that? What happened?
Well, it was mainly in the play-offs. The Patriots were busted slightly deflating their footballs.
No way! How did that help them?
Well, it's easier to throw and catch when the ball is just slightly softer and Tom Brady liked his footballs like that.
Yeah, but wouldn't that help both teams? They both use the same ball.
Yeah, kind of, but it really worked to the Patriots and Brady's advantage.
Wow, what happened when they got busted?
It was pretty major dude. Brady got suspended for 4 games in the next season and team got fined 1 mil. The team also lost 2 of their top draft picks.
Really, but wasn't that the season they came back and won the Superbowl ....again?
Yeah, they beat the Falcons. After all that they were still the best team to win the Superbowl.
Wow, how did the Falcons make it to the Superbowl? They suck.
Yeah, they were considered the best team overall but they couldn't pull it together to beat New England in the Superbowl.
Wow, I wonder if the Falcons will be able to come back and be as good?
Probably not.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah, but I bet we the Patriots and Brady again!
Yeah, that dude is super human!
