Were you ever a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series?
Was I? Most definitely, since I was 6 years old and saw part 1 for the first time.
That's the best one in my opinion, all the others were not so good.
You're right, that was the best one but I liked part 3 also.
That was The Dream Warriors right? The one with the kids in the mental hospital?
Yes that's a classic to me. That's the last of the series that actually had some scares in it.
I agree with that. Did you see Freddy's Dead? Part 6 I believe.
Yes when the woman found out she was Freddy's daughter? That was a fun movie, not scary but entertaining.
Yes I loved the cartoonishness of it, and that we got to see Robert Englund out of makeup.
That rebooted version of Nightmare on Elm Street was terrible. They should have left it alone.
