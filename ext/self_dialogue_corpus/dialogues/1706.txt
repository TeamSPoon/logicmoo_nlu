I cannot wait to see how the Cowboys do next year.
Yes that was amazing last year.
Yes they played one of their rivals, Green Bay.
Yes that was a close one.
It was so close, those losses hurt the most.
Are the Cowboys your favorite team.
Yes they still are.
Wow you should be happy they made the playoffs, that is an accomplishment.
Yes that is something positive.
They fought hard.
It was a devastating loss.
It always is.
I think they will make the necessary adjustments and come back stronger next year.
Yes I agree.
Their offensive line is amazing.
Yes they are super solid.
They can build a team around their O-Line.
Yes I agree.
It will be exciting to see what the skill positions can do with the increased time the O-Line gives them to make plays next year.
Yes it will be exciting.
