I really like meta-songs.
Meta songs? You mean songs about songs?
Something like that. Or songs about being a recording artist or whatever.
Like Nickelback's "Rockstar"?
I guess, maybe. Though, that's more a song about people aspiring to be a rock star than what it is to live that life.
Are there really a lot of examples of what you're talking about?
Of course, for example, let's take Reel Big Fish. You're gonna get some back story here.
Alright, I'm listening.
They road in on that late '90s ska wave, and had a big hit with "Sell Out", which itself was a meta-song about, of course, selling out.
Alright, okay, so what next?
That was it. After that one hit, then never hit it big again, and have had middling success ever since.
That seems to happen to a lot of bands.Like with Chumbawamba and their song "Tubthumping" which happened around the same time.
Right, the story isn't over. See, years later they released another song called "One Hit Wonderful".
Oh boy, I see where this is going.
Naturally, the song is about being a one hit wonder, and the audiences no longer caring about you when the limelight ends.
I can see how that would be a bit meta. Probably very true to life for a lot of people in the industry.
The song even uses a sample of "Sell Out" in it, at the beginning and end as someone is flipping through radio stations.
That's kind funny, like a bookend type thing. Like, they sold out, and then after everyone forgot, it was all for nothing.
It wasn't for nothing, they've released a lot of songs since then. Though, if they made a song like that again it would be ironic since besides lead singer Aaron Barrett none of the original band members remain.
I guess you're right, as long as there are people enjoying their music it wasn't for nothing. I hope they feel that way.
