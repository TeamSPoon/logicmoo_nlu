So who is your favorite character from Star Wars?
Hands down I have got to say it's Luke Skywalker.
No way! Han Solo is the best.
But Luke is a Jedi, he can use the force and a light saber.  That is so much cooler.
Yeah but Han Solo has a the fastest ship in the galaxy and hangs out with a Wookie.
Luke Skywalker is the first Jedi to come around in a generation.  He can move objects with his mind.
Han Solo has that bad boy thing going for him.  Luke Skywalker is too squeaky clean for me.
He's a hero!  He dedicates his life to taking down the Empire.  Han Solo tries to cut and run every chance he gets.
Han didn't have to take on the Empire like he did in Return of the Jedi, he had his own ship, he could have just left.
That's true, but no one could have done what Luke did.  No one could have taken on the Emperor and gotten Darth Vadar to turn away from the dark side.
