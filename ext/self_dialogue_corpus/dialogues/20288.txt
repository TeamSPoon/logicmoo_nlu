Have you seen the newest Star Wars yet?
No, I haven't seen any of those movies.
You're joking, right? Everyone has.
I have not. Never been interested in them.
How? They are iconic.
I'm not sure. I remember trying to watch the one with the red and black face bad guy, and got bored right away.
Oh, Darth Maul. You need to start from the beginning to appreciate the series.
Its too complicated. They're not titled in chronological order.
Thats because they aren't released that way!
Well, I don't get it and its too much of a hassle.
Ok, we're going to watch one together.
If we do, lets pick a new one because I don't like movies with bad acting or effects.
Ok, we'll pick the newest one.
That's The Force Awakens or something, right?
Yes, and a newer one comes out at the end of the year.
I see. If I like the force, lets go see that one.
Its not a matter of if, you will 100% like it.
We'll see.
You won't understand much if you don't see the older ones.
That's fine with me
