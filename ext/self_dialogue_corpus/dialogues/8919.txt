What your favorite rock group man?
I'm going to go with a band I grew up with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Nice. Yeah they are a pretty solid band. I like Flea's bass style.
Yeah, and Anthony's vocals are pretty dynamic. He can rap and sing.
Yeah. Ever since the first album, which was more like punk rock, he has shown his ability for words.
Well he definitely had some stuff to write songs about when it came to drugs and relationships.
What do you mean?
Well look at the song Under the Bridge. If you listen what do you think that describes?
Okay. I got you. Where are they from?
I think they are from Seattle around the time of grunge.
