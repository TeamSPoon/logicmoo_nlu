If you could only listen to one beatles song which one would you pick?
That is tough. I would go with strawberry fields forever.
why that one?
It was one of the first psychedelic rock genre . I really adore them for those songs. I also really enjoy hearing it.
It was a lennon written one , right?
It was but seems credited to lennon-mccartney. But was about john's memories of playing in the fields.
That is interesting. I had no clue.
What about you ? which would you pick?
Help! .. because I would need help if I only could pick one of their great tunes.
Ha, that is funny.  I am certainly glad we have so many songs from them and glad we are not limited to one.
