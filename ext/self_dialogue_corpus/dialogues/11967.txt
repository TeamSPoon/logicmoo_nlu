I hated Episode 1!!
Ware you nuts?  The huge battle on Naboo with he Trade Federation was amazing!
But Jar Jar ruined the movie.
But Queen Padm√© Amidala saved it, for sure!
Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn was pretty cool too.
If you are into dudes, I guess so.  Bet you liked Anakin Skywalker, too.
He is the bot that becomes Darth Vader, how can you not?
I'm not fan of the Dark Side, so I am on team Luke.
That means you get Yoda, too.  That is a good play.
But also Jar Jar.  So maybe Droids and TIE Fighters are the right path
