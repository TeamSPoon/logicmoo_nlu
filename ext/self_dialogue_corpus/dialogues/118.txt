Have you ever seen The Crow?
No.  Is that the movie with Brandon Lee.
Yes, you didn't see it though?
No, but everyone knows about it.
Yeah, it kind of became famous for the wrong reasons.
Do you believe the Lee family was cursed?
Not really.  It was just bad luck.
It's crazy that Brandon and Bruce Lee both died in their prime.
Yeah, but that shouldn't have overshadowed their talents.
You are right about that.
