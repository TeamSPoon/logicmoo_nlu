Have you seen a movie of Nicolas Cage lately?
You know what, I have? I saw him in Snowden, though he was not the main character.
Oh really what´s the movie about?
It´s about the real character Edward Snowden and his life.
Okay, thank you. Which one then do you recommend where Nicolas Cage is a main character?
I really liked the movie Family Man, it´s from the year 2000 but it has a really good message.
Really, what is it about?
it´s about this person who´s been given the chance to see what would had happen if he had chosen to have a family instead of a mayor career?
Wow it really sounds interesting. I don´t know what I would do. I really liked him in his movies of National Treasure.
I know, it feel like you are in a conspiracy theory and everything has it´s meanings.
By the way, did you see Nicholas Cage in the movie Knowing?
No I didn´t, what is it about?
He discovers a major catastrophe that´s going to hit earth and it´s his mission to find out what´s going on.
No wonder, I haven't seen it, it´s not my type. Since I´m not going to see it, you might as well tell me what else happens.
Well I really liked it at the start, kinda like a doomsday, that the earth will one day come to an end, but In reality it was about aliens who wanted to destroy the earth and only same a few kids.
Wow that sounds very dramatic. Did Nicolas Cage saved himself?
No, he didn´t. That´s the part I didn´t like, all his work on the movie and he dies, only his kids get saved and to like who knows where with some aliens.
For what it sounds, it sounds kinda off. Who else is the movie?
Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne, Lara Robinson, etc.
Oh I really don´t know them, but now because you made the movie sound so awful I´m curios to see it, hehe. I´ll let you know what I think.
