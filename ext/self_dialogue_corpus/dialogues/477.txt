What's the latest news on Ryan Tannehill?
I haven't heard anything.
You know he injured his knee in December?
Yes, but I don't think he had surgery.
Did he need surgery?
No, they did some rehab so he should be ready in the fall.
I saw the game where he was injured.
I missed it.
He was hit by Pace from the Jets.
That's no good.
Pace was uncovered he hit, Tannehill pretty hard.
It had to be, he was out for the rest of the season.
He's strong. The Dolphins training camp starts soon and I'm sure he'll be there.
I'm certain.
If not they got Matt Moore.
For another year.
Is his contract up?
This is the last year on it.
I'm sure he'll re-sign.
Sure he will.
