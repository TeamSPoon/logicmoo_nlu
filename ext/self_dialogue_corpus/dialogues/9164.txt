I want to get started on gothic rock music but I do not know where to start.
Siouxsie and the Banshees is a classic!
Oh, I know a song by them. Kiss Them for Me.
Yeah, that is a popular one. You should also try Spellbound.
Okay, I will. What is another good band?
On the rock side of gothic music, you need to know The Cure.
I have some songs by them, too.
Good! Robert Smith and Siouxsie Sioux are gothic icons.
I love their personal styles.
It would be cool if they did a collaboration.
