Lilo and Stitch is such an underrated movie.
Absolutely.  I love that little alien.
It was great to see an original movie, especially one located in Hawaii.
The music was great in that one.  Kind of paved the path for Moana.
The little girl was a bit of a brat though.
So was the older sister though.
Stitch was the true hero of this movie.  Reminds me of a rabid dog.
I guess that's one way to describe him.
I'm just glad they didn't blow up the Earth.
That would be a very un-Disney like ending.
