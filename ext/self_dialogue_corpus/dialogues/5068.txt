Who is the best manager in the game today?
Tough question considering the dynamics of the game.
So would you say Francona?
Yeah it could be him, he had success with Boston and Cleveland.
But did nothing in Philadelphia.
Different time, organization did not care about winning.
OK I could debate that seperately but do you give some credit to Maddon?
It would be between Francona and Maddon.
What about Maddon do you like?
He had success in Tampa and Chicago.
Tampa was harder to win
I agree with that but he didnt have a thin roster either
They were good even after they started turning guys over.
Havent heard from that  franchise since he left.
Yeah so I would say that it probably gets handed to Maddon.
He knew where and how to push the Cubs buttons.
He was brought in at the right time and made a huge difference
I would say hes a players coach.
Yeah so I think Maddon is definitely the best player in the game.
I would agree but Francona is not far behind.
