Have you seen Clue?
I don't think I've heard of that isn't it a board game?
It's based on the board game. It's a really interesting older movie.
Would I know anyone in it?
Well Tim Curry obviously. But it also has that guy..what's his name?
Who?
Oh he played the gay guy in Roseanne.
Oh you mean Martin Mull
Yeah him. It's really interesting and it has multiple endings.
Oh wow I haven't seen a movie with multiple endings.
It goes along with how the board games has different out comes.
Is it a funny movie?
It has a dry sense of humor. Kind of like british humor.
I'll have to check it out.
Yeah. Lot's of twists and turns and good actors.
Is Tim Curry a major person in it?
Yeah. It's really nice. If you liked rocky horror I think you'll like this.
Rocky horror is one of my favorites.
Then you'll have to watch this.
