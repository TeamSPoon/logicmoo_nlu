Do you like musicals?
Not at all, I find them boring honestly.
Why is that?
I do not like the storytellng aspect of it.
As in how they act and sing at the same time?
Yes, it bores me.
Do you like Operas?
Not at all, that is not my type of music whatsoever.
Have you been to an opera?
No, and will probably never go to one either.
You aren't willing to just try one opera?
No because most is in a foreign language and I can't understand the storyline.
How about Broadway, would you ever see shows on Broadway?
Most likely not, it is not my style.
You do not know what you are missing out on!
That is ok, to each their own.
What do you prefer then?
I prefer concerts or good old regular music I can understand and relate to.
That is understandable, opera and broadway is not for everyone.
I do not judge others that enjoy those type of things though.
