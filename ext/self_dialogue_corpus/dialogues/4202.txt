Have you seen a movie called the Zodiac before?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller.  Did you like it?
I did!  It is about a serial killer called Zodiac who stalks its San Francisco residents.
That is not a new one right?
No, in fact the movie originally aired in 2007, but I watched it recently on television. It is amazing.
Sounds interesting.  Who are the leading actors in it?
Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Robert Downey Jr. play in the movie.
Wow, that is an all star cast!
Yes, they do a great job showing how through the years, they try to find the Zodiac killer.
I will have to check it out soon.
