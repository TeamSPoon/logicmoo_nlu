How many Pirattes of The Caribbean movies are there?
I think there were five.
That many, wow. Was Johnny Depp in all of them?
I think so. I didn't see all of them though.
I saw tow of them. I guess they were the first two.
I think I watched maybe three.
Is the newest one in theatres?
It came out this year but I think it might be out already.
What was the new movie called?
I believe it was called Dead Men Tell No Tales.
Yeah, I do remember hearing ads for that.
Jack Sparrow is a terrific pirate.
He is. Johnny Depp is so cool as a pirate.
Keira Knightley was in the last one too.
She's good too. Were they ever a couple in the movies?
I don't eblieve they were but really didn't see them all or remember much.
You are as bad as me.
So many movies watched and to watch. Can't keep track.
I have a hard time too.
Maybe we should watch the new movie someday.
