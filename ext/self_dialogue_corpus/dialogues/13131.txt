So, who are Rey's parents?
If it's a character we've already met, there are only so many options.
Yeah, so who do you think it is?
Well, we know she's not Han's or Leia's daughter. I think they would have known.
She could be Luke's.
Yeah, I suppose she could be. But again, wouldn't Leia know if Luke had gone off and had a kid?
Maybe Luke didn't even know.
That seems very Un-Star Wars like.
Granted. So who's Rey daddy?
Based solely on her English Accent, Ben Kenobi.
