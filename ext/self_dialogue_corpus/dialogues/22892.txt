Have you seen the new train spotting film?
You mean Train Spotting?
Yeah that's it, the one with Ewan Mccgregor in it.
No I haven't seen it yet, have you?
No but I was thinking about going to see it this weekend.
Good idea, maaybe I could come with you?
Sounds great, I really loved the original train spotting movie!
Yeah, it's a real classic movie, I've watched it so many times.
I hope this one is as good as the last one.
Is Danny Boyle directing it?
I think so, his films are normally quite good so I have high expectations.
Danny Boyle is good, did you watch Slumdog Millionaire?
I did see that but I didn't think it was as good as some of his other movies.
Why do you think that?
It just seemed too commercial and pandering to simple interests.
You mean making a movie for the money rather than the art?
Exactly, I like it when directors follow their conviction and have a true creative idea.
I know what you mean, movies can be diluted sometimes in the interest of profits.
Anyway, I will meet you at the cinema on Saturday at twelve ok?
Great, see you then!
