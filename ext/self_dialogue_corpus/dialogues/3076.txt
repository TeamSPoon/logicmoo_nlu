Do you want to go to any of the Rams home games this year with me?
I would love to go to a Rams game.
Great, which game do you prefer to go to?
Definitely a game against the Seahawks.
Oh, that should be good, but it will probably be a blowout win for the Seahawks.
Yes, they are a much better team than the Rams are right now.
I think a game versus the 49ers would be close though.
Yes, but I want to at least see a potential Superbowl team play.
I understand, so Rams versus Seahawks it is.
Yes, we just need to make sure we are both available that day.
Yeah, we could also go tailgate and invite some others.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
It will be, the last time we tailgated before a game it was amazing.
I wish I went that time, but I had to work.
No worries, this time we'll have you around.
By the way are you planning to go to multiple games this season?
Maybe, I want to go to the game against the Cardinals too.
Right, that could be a good game.
Yes, but mainly because my wife is a Cardinals fan.
Oh, well it's cool she's interested in going to a game as well, my wife doesn't like going to games that much.
