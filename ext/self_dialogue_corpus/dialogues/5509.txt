Freaky Friday was such a a cool movie
it was, I would never want to switch with my mom
I know, can you imagine being a teenager again as an adult
no, I cannot, that spell they cast was crazy
it really was and I think it made them both think
sometimes we forget what it is like to be a certain age
we really do, especially as we get older
I think sometimes it would be good to make a teenager swicth with an adult
It would so that they know what we go through and how easy they have it
I would never be a teen again but it is still better than being an adult !
