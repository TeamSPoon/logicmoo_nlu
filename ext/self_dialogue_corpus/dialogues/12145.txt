What did you think of the new Disney star wars?
It was OK I guess, but not as good as the hype.
Really I thought it was awesome, what didn't you like?
Well it was basically a retelling of the first movie.
I don't think it was a reboot, there were new characters.
Maybe not a reboot per se, but a re-marketing to a new generation of fans.
There was a bit of marketing overload for it I guess.
And the older characters just seemed shoehorned into the story.
The effects were still awesome though.
Yeah and Rey was a good character, hopefully the next one is better.
