I heard Moana is a good movie
Yeah I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it
youtube had a song sung by Dwayne Johnson and got my attention
I have the blu ray disc you want it?
Wow I was about to buy one
I have almost all the disney movie collections,they are fun to watch even repeatedly
yeah especially the one with more songs
Ha Ha! who does not love disney songs
eagerly waiting for pirates of the Caribbean 5 blu ray release
Do not forget to lend me when you get it
