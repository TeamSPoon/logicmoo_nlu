There are a lot of crappy deaths in Star Wars.
Totally, some unimaginably awful.
What's the one that bugs you the most?
EASY. Aayla Secura, my love, being distracted by a freakin' bird and then shot about 100 times in the back.
Yeah, that seemed overkill.
Yours?
Padm√©. Died of a broken heart. What a load of waffles.
That's possible, you know.
Yeah, but it was lamely done. Plus, the robots are awful doctors.
Yeah, didn't they have anesthetics? Couldn't Obi-Wan use the force to calm her?
