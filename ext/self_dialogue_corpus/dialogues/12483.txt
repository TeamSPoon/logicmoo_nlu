I just heard that george lucas's inspiration for darth vader came to him out of nowhere.
What do you mean?
The name for the character just came to him, out of thin air.
I find that surprising because it has so much meaning.
Now I ask what do you mean by meaning?
Well Darth is a way of saying of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's Dark Father.
That is crazy accurate for the role!
Yes, it seems like a lot of research and thought would have gone into that name.
Well apparently not at all!
That makes me love star wars franchise even more! The force is strong!
