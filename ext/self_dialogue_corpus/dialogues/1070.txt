So how long do you think Brady will play for?
I don't know.  What do you think?
He says he wants to play until 45.
Yeah.  I don't think he will be able to.
I don't know.  He is 40 now.
Five years is a long time.
He had an incredible season at age 39.
He missed 4 games though.
It wasn't due to injury though.
Yeah, but it is still less hits to his body.
He eats well and get to bed early every night.
The decline happens fast though.  Look at Peyton Manning.
Yeah, but he had neck surgery.
True, but it could happen to Brady.
I don't think he has been hurt since he broke his leg over a decade ago.
Yeah, but if he does get hurt the body doesn't heal itself as good and fast at that age.
Yeah.  He is usually able to get the ball out quick so he doesn't get hit a lot.
I don't think New England will keep him for 5 years.  He might get traded.
He might with their good backup there.
Yeah, New England doesn't want to pay big money for a guy to sit on the bench so one of them will have to go.
