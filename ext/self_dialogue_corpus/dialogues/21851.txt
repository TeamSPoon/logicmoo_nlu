Do you remember Hoodwinked?
That kids movie from forever ago?
Yes, that is the one.
It came out around the same time as Skrek if I remember. I don't remember a ton about the film itself though.
I was just thinking about how it was a surprise hit the year it came out, which was 2005, actually.
How well did it do?
It made over a hundred and ten million dollars.
Well, that definitely isn't bad.
It's actually especially good when you know the budget. The film was made with less than eight million dollars.
I can't even comprehend that! Talk about a big success.
So successful it got a sequel. After six long years.
What. Why would they wait so long to make a sequel?
I don't know, but I guess it had issues with the production or something. It was supposed to come out in 2010 originally.
Let me guess, another big hit?
The opposite in fact.
It bombed?
It barely made back half its budget of thirty million dollars. The reviews were savage as well.
Even if the movie was bad, I bet it would've been successful if it didn't come out so much later than the first.
We'll never know for sure. The first one actually is a good movie, though.
Maybe I'll rewatch it if I ever see it on Netflix then.
