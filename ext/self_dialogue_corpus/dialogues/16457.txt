Do composers write love songs because their hearts are full, or are their hearts full because they stir themselves up with music?
I don't know. Music does go straight to the emotions.
I agree. But maybe you'd have to be rather cold and detached to write an affecting love song?
What do you mean? Musicians compose because their hearts are full of song.
No, they compose to fill our hearts with song. That takes judgment, which comes from cool detachment.
So when a musician writes about his true love's light brown hair, he's thinking about tempo and counterpoint and such?
Of course he is. Music has to have form, or it's just noise.
But it has to be inspired, or it's just flat.
Flat. Now you're making sharp remarks.
Funny, but really...not. The difference between trite popular music and the stuff that lasts is inspiration.
Or perhaps it's skill, talent, and application.
That too, maybe. But they have to feel it, or they're just pushing notes around.
So you thnk the more intensely a composer or songwriter feels, the better his work. Or hers.
Yes I do. While you think she just has to know her business, and then work at it industriously. Or he.
Picture that composer, alone with his score, writing and rewriting, hearing it all in the silence. That person can't be high on love.
But have you ever heard a group, late at night in some bar, playing to each other, comunicating like they're psychic?
Yeah, and when I've felt that, I've been tired, and sleepy, and susceptible.
Now you're just being contrary. You've felt it.
But what I've felt isn't necessarily real. Music, you know, is mathematical. It's thought.
Music, even if you don't know, is emotion.
