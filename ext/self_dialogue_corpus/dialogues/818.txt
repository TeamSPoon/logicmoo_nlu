Are you ready for some football?!! The NFL season is just 6 weeks away.
Seems like we just started baseball season and now football is coming again?
Don't you like anything about football at all?
I like winning bets on games.
How can you bet? You know nothing of the NFL teams.
You don't need to know anything about the NFL when betting.
Yes you do!
No you don't. It's all a guessing game. I used to win my mom's office pool a lot and I went up against hard core Vikings and Packers fans doing so.
How did they handle losing to a high school kid?
They were put out at first but when they found out i never watched football and knew nothing of the game they really got mad.
I supposed I can see why.
I told them they only fool themselves if they think you can study a bet - its a freaking guess.
How did you do it?
I had a few different methods. Once I chose between the uniform colors I liked the better for each game. Once I would bet on whatever team had a cute quarterback.
I see, a real scientific methodology.
Nope, just a guessing game. And may I point out I won more than anyone so when you get snide I know you don't like hearing that you have no control.
I study the numbers of past games and look at the player stats, etc.
And yet I win by choosing the uniform colors I like better. You don't like being SHOWN that you're so-called method is as much BS as my uniform color method. You have no control, period.
OK, if you win this year you buy dinner.
Deal.
