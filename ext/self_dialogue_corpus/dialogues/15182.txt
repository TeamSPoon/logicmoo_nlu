I went to the James Taylor/Carole King concert last night.
How was it? I couldn't make it.
Oh, it was really great. I've seen James Taylor a few times before this, but never Carole King.
I've never seen her either. What did you think?
I enjoyed her a lot more than I expected. She did some of her hits and some old Goffin and King songs.
Cool. I think I would enjoy that.
The chemistry between them was great.
I guess that makes sense. They are old friends.
Yes, they are. You know how James Taylor always seems so warm and accessible in his concerts?
Yes.
Well, she is the same way. It felt like an evening spent chatting with the two of them and 10,000 fans.
What songs did he do?
He did some that you would expect like Walking Man, Carolina in my Mind and Fire and Rain.
What else?
He did Sweet Baby James and he told a story about writing that song for his baby nephew. I was glad to hear that, because I always thought it was odd to write that about himself.
I always thought that, too. Did he do any more obscure songs?
He did. He did that Millworker song tha tI really love.
I love that, too. Did he do Steamroller?
Yes, he did. I have really never liked that song for some reason.
Really? I love it.
