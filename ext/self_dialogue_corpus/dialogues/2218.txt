Which team do you think will have the worst record in NFL this season?
I think the Cleveland Browns could have the worst record.
What team do you think will have the best record?
I think the New England Patriots will do well and make it to the Super Bowl.
Do you think that Tom Brady will lead the New England Patriots?
Yes, I think he will have a great season.
What other quarterback do you think could potentially make it to the Super Bowl.
My favorite would be Russell Wilson.
I think he will have the drive and the motivation to help the Seattle Seahawks to make it to the Super Bowl.
I agree that he will be motivated. Yet, I think the Pittsburgh Steelers could be more motivated to win.
Although they lost, they worked really hard last year.
I think that Ben Roethlisberger will lead the team to its victory.
I think that losing can help a team come back and win. Yet, I still have hope for the team with the worst record.
Do you mean the Cleveland Browns?
I think DeShone Kizer will be a quarterback that will overcome challenges each time they are on the field.
I think the team needs to work offensively and defensively to score touchdowns.
I'm looking forward to seeing them work offensively to score touchdowns this season.
Do you think that the 49ers have a chance without Colin Kaepernick?
I think a team can still work to win without its star quarterback.
I'm not sure they can. I'm excited for the season to begin because there is so much anticipation regarding what lies ahead with each team.
