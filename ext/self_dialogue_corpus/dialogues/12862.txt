So what do you think of the legacy of Princess Leia as a sci-fi movie character?
Well, I think we tend to forget how novel she was in the first film from 1977.
Yes, the idea that she is a princess they need to rescue, but she also knows how to fight the bad guys!
Of course. A very strong female character and not someone who sits around helpless for the whole movie.
No, not at all. And as someone who gets to watch her home planet destroyed, you feel her pain.
Yes, and understand what drives her to fight to stop the Empire.
She loses so much in that first movie, and it's really dark when you see it from her perspective.
Don't forget, Darth Vader tortures her, too.
Oh, that's right. And men always talk about how great she looks in that gold bikini in Return of the Jedi, but...
She chokes Jabba the Hutt to death! Definitely a strong heroine.
