Were you ever a big Michael Jackson fan?
Never a big fan, but there is a lot of his music that I like.
Which time period was your favorite?
I liked some of his stuff from the Jackson 5, but also the 80s stuff.
You didn't really like any of the stuff from the 90s?
Not so much.  I mean Black and White is okay.
Yeah, I see what you are saying.
Most of the nineties stuff just isn't as, I don't know, good.
Maybe it just doesn't have the same spirit.
Yeah, it's just not as fun.
What is your favorite song by the Jackson 5?
I always like ABC for some reason.
What about the 80s?
That's hard.  Billie Jean, maybe?
It is a hard one.  I don't even know.
His videos were awesome too.
Yeah, I always loved the Thriller one.
Everyone watched the Thriller one a million times!
We had to learn how to do the dance!
I know!
