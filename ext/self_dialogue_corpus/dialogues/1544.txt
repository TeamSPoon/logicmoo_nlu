I can't wait for the NFL season to start!
Me either! This is going to be an amazing season.
Yeah it's hard to tell who is going to the playoffs. It's a passing game, with a look of talent at quarterback this year.
Don't forget about the receivers.
I haven't forgotten but receivers mean nothing without someone to get them the ball.
Same goes for the other way around.
Ok, so who are the top 3 receivers that realistically can help carry their teams to the post season?
Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham Jr., and Julio Jones. In that order.
There is no way OBJ is better than Julio Jones, and what about Dez Bryant?
Dez is good, but he has nothing on the other 3 and even if he did, he isn't carrying Dallas to the playoffs
Ok so what about OBJ and Julio Jones.
Well I'm a Giants fan so I have to give it to my boy
We agree that Antonio Brown is the best receiver in the league though?
Definitely, his numbers don't lie. He's got over a thousand yards in the last four seasons and coupled with the Steelers defense, they will definitely see the playoffs.
No credit going to old man Big Ben.
He's only 35!
Yeah but every year he get's older the ball is going fly a little shorter and less hard.
Might be true, but he threw for almost four thousand yards last year so the age isn't showing.
Steelers in patriots in the big game?
Nope. It's going to be a rematch of last year.
