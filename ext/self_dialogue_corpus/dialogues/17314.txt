Do you ever listen to Metallica?
Not too much but I've definitely heard of them.
Yeah, they are one of my favorite metal bands.  Their music is great!
Are they still around?  I thought they were kinda old.
Well they came out in 1981 so they have been around awhile.  But believe it or not they just released a new album in 2016.
Really, what was it called?
Hardwired...To Self Destruct.  It's crazy to think they've been making music for thirty six years.
Yeah that is a long time.  So what songs do you like best?
I listen to their original stuff from their Metallica album or And Justice for All the most probably.
That's the older stuff, right?
Yeah.  You've probably heard the song One or Sad But True.
I know I've heard Sad But True.  Everyone's heard that song.
Yeah that was one of their most famous.  But even in 2003 their album hit the Billboard number one spot.
That's crazy a band can continue being so popular for so long.
Yeah, it's because they have a devoted fan base.  They've been really controversial over time though.
Yeah I've heard about a lot of that.  I think it's the thrash metal image.
Yeah, it can be offensive to some people.  I think their music is spectacular though regardless of their image.
Who's the lead singer?
Hetfield and Ulrich are the founding members.
Oh, I've definitely heard of Ulrich.
