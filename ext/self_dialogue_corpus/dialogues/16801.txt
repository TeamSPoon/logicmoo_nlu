What groups did you listen to growing up?
Rusted Root, Crash Test Dummies, Lisa Loeb...
Those are all terrible. I haven't heard of any of them.
Of course you haven't, thanks fort the judgement. You know their music.
So name some songs by them.
Rusted Root has "Send me on my way" which is from a lot of movies, most well-known as being in Matilda.
Ooooh yeah! They performed at my school a few years ago.
How were they? They're getting old.
They were great for me, but got booed a lot.
Why did they get booed? They play to hippies who are high the whole time.
They hated that they couldn't form a mosh pit.
A bunch of college bros went to a Rusted Root concert and freaked out? Ha!
Yeah, they weren't too smart. What about Lisa Loeb?
Her big song was "Stay" which is still on the radio every once in a while. Crash Test Dummies had "Mmm mmm mmm mmm"
That was such a weird song!
Yeah, it's kind of silly, like a folk song. No real plot, just silliness.
His voice was crazy.
Yeah, did you know they got rejected by a lot of labels because they felt his voice was too low for pop radio?
Well, at least they did well.
Yeah, they have a LOT of music, but had a couple years where they change their sound and were hated.
