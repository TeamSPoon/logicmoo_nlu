Hey, do you like horror movies?
I do! That's my favorite genre.
Me too! What's your favorite horror movie?
Probably John Carpenter's Halloween.
Oooh, I like that one too. Are you excited for the remake next year?
They're remaking it again?
Yes, it's a complete reboot.
I hope it's better than the 2007 remake.
Tell me about it.
Who's the director this time?
David Gordon Green, I believe.
At least it isn't Rob Zombie again.
Yeah, he's a good director but his version of Halloween was so weird.
We did not need a backstory on Michael Myers.
I agree, it's actually much scarier when we don't know his backstory.
Exactly! I also didn't care for what they did to the Loomis character.
Me either. He's not supposed to be so unlikable.
I know! The 2007 version was barely the same character.
Hopefully the new version will be a much better reboot.
Well, it can't be worse.
