Do you like finding nemo
It was cute, my kids loved it
Same here, what about finding dory?
Ive only seen pieces of it, i want to see the whole thing.
It was really good.
It looked good from what I saw
It took a long time to come out.
It did, but it was worth it.
Yes it was
Thanks for talking to me.
