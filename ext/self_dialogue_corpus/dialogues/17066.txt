They have seriously got to stop turning movies into musicals.
What do you mean?
I dealt with Legally Blonde but they made a musical version of 9 to 5?
They did. Have you listened to it yet?
No. I don't think I'm going to. I don't like Dolly Parton.
Ok but you're going to just write the show off without giving it a chance?
Have you heard the music?
I have and it's really good.
What do you like about it?
Well a lot of it is really fun and upbeat, including the opening number which is a rework of her 9 to 5 song.
I didn't hate that song I guess.
See? And a lot of the music is like that! There's an office song called Around here which is just like being at work.
I'm not sure I want a song to remind me of being at work.
It's great though, funny but true. The singer on the cast album is Allison Janney which helps make it funny.
Wasn't she on The West Wing?
She was, and awesome there too! She sings this one in that same kind of dry understated way as she acted in that series.
Ha. I might really like that.
And there's another character who has a great song called Get Out and Stay out which is so powerful and strong!
So it's not a bunch of Dolly songs?
Well she wrote them but give it a chance. It doesn't sound like you're expecting.
