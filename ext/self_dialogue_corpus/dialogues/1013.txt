Who do you think had the best draft in the NFL?
I personally think the San Francisco 49ers had one of the best drafts.
I can see your point.  The trade they made with the Chicago Bears was amazing for them.
Yeah, that trade definitely helped their overall draft.  I was surprised to see Reuben Foster fall so far in the first round.
Agreed, wasn't he projected as a high first round pick?
Yeah, all the experts during the pre-draft process projected him to be a top 10 pick.
Do you know why he fell so far?
From reading various articles which speculated on his fall, it sounded like teams may have been concerned about his shoulder injury.
I see.  Well I personally really liked the LA Chargers draft, I'm really excited to see all their rookies play next year.
Yeah, I was a bit surprised by their pick of Mike Williams.
I really liked them picking up a couple of offensive linemen as well, I think that's really going to help them in the future and protect Phillip Rivers.
Yeah, hopefully that helps Rivers stay healthy and on his feet.  Who do you think is going to win the Superbowl this year?
I have to take the Patriots on that one.
Patriots for sure...they somehow won the Superbowl last year AND got better players in the offseason.
That was shocking!  I could not believe the Patriots somehow got Brandin Cooks AND kept Malcolm Butler.
That offense is going to be scary as long as Tom Brady remains healthy.
I hope so, but at some point age is going to catch up with Tom Brady.
How old is he now?
I think he's about 40, which is amazing.  I'm 40 and barely want to exercise.
Hopefully for Patriots fans, he's got a couple more years in him.
