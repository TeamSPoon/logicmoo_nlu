My all time favorite flick has got to be Die Hard.
Such a classic.
Bruec Willis in his prime...
I know! He was the man back then.
He just does too much now.
Yeah, he really needs to pick his projects a little more carefully.
I keep see new movies of his on Netflix that I've never even heard of.
I think some of his stuff is missing the theaters.
And rightfully so!
He has been doing some qestionable stuff.
