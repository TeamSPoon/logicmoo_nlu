Did any of the Beatles have kids that followed in their footsteps?
I think John Lennon had a son.
What was his name?
Well, he had two sons, and I don't know if they are both musicians.
What are their names then?
Julian and Sean.
I never heard of them.
I know one of them looks a lot like John.
Does he sound like him?
I don't remember.  I saw him on TV once though.
