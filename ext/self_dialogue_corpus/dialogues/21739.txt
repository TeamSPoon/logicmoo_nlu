Did you see the new King Kong film?
Another version of that story?
Yep, Kong Skull Island.
I thought the one with Adrien Brody was out not that long ago.
Not too long, but I guess long enough to remake another one.
I liked Jack Black in that movie.
As a almost serious person?
He never plays serious stuff.
I think Nacho Libre was the closest thing to serious.
And that was far from serious, did you like it?
It was a good kids movies.
Reminded me of Napolean Dynmaite.
It was not as good as that one.
Napolean Dynamite was a sleep hit.
Yeah, no one thought that it would do well but it did.
I loved the ending.
When the brother married his girlfriend?
Yes, but there is an after credit scene too.
What happens?
The newly married couple rides off into the sunset on a tiny horse, it was a fitting end.
