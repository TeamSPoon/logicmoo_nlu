Who's your favorite Disney princess?
It's either Merida from Brave or Ariel from the Little Mermaid.
Yes, I agree about The Little Mermaid. That is such a classic movie.
I agree. It's so timeless, kids today still watch it.
Yes, Jodi Benson was the perfect voice as Ariel.
I know, she really made the music in that movie so beautiful.
The rest of the music from that movie is some of my favorite of all time.
I agree. "Kiss the girl" and "Under the Sea" is some of the best composed music ever.
I agree. I feel like the lack of music in Brave really sets it apart from The Little Mermaid.
I agree you with completely.
