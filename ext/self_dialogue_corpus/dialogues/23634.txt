Do you enjoy the Avatar movie?
I think it was unique.
It was written in 1994!
Wow thats surprising considering the technology wasnt available then.
Thats why Cameron failed to film it.
He was waiting for the technology?
Yes he had the mind to know it would come
Thats some foresight!
I think it worked out pretty well for him
Yeah theres some things I did not like.
Like what?
I am just not a fan of the blue characters
It did seem a bit silly.
But also that was the allure as well.
I think they did a good job with it overall
To me its tough to see actors in the blue outfits though
I think it was more CGI.
That as well.
Well I loved the acting
I dont think it was bad, but the story was more interesting than anything
