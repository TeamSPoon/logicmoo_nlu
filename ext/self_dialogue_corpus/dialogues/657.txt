It's tough being a 49ers fan these days.
I don't even know who the quarterback is.
At least it aint Colin.
Yea, he was a cancer.
I quit going to games because of him.
Because of the protest?
Yea! My brother died fighting for that flag.
He shoulda picked a better time.
I agree.
I quit going to games cause we suck.
Yea, the days of glory are long gone.
You mean the Elvis Grbac years?
You are funny, I'm talking about Young and Montana.
Montana is the greatest of all time.
You think he's better than Brady?
I know he is, and young was right up there too.
I didn't hurt to be throwing to Rice.
They had some other good receivers too.
I love how Rice would use the referee as a pick.
Seems like that should have been illegal.
