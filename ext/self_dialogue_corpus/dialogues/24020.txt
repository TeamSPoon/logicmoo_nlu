Have you noticed they are finally making more movies with diversity?
I think there always has been , they are just more prevelant now.
I liked the new Star Wars is really diverse.
I like that the lead is a female.
The main star, Daisy Riddle.
She is really powerful in her acting.
I think she fits the part so well.
Do you think she is some how a Skywalker?
Well, they showed her meeting Luke.
I wonder if that will be her dad.
That would make the interaction she had with Kyle Ren rather awkward.
Maybe he is adopted some how.
But then why would he have the force ?
I don't know there are a lot of questions about that film I didn't understand.
My biggest issue was with how in the world he got a hold of his grandad's helmet.
The melted Darth Vader one?
Yes! Like did Luke save it?
That would be the only way.
I am also concerned with why c3po has a red arm.
We can only hope they will explain both in the next installment.
