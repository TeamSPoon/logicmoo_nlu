Frozen was such a good movie, it became really popular
I liked Olaf the most, he was so cute
He was cute, I liked the cute little song he sang
I liked Elsa also, she was fun
I liked the part where they sang the song "Do you want to build a snowman?"
That part was good, I also liked it
It was sad that their parents both died though
I know and it was sad when Elsea's hair was cute
I know then she lost her power
I am glad things worked out for them I am looking forward to the next Frozen movie
