I think you're overlooking Bambi.
That movie scared the crap out of me.
How? Because his mom was shot?
Yeah, that was really traumatic to watch as a kid.
I suppose. Although he did end up meeting his father, which makes some sense.
Sort of the natural progression of things right?
Yeah. Although I still don't know what to make of the frisky bunny friend.
Thumper? Yeah, again that was pretty mature content.
I suppose they figured kids wouldn't pick up on it.
Oh, but we totally did.
