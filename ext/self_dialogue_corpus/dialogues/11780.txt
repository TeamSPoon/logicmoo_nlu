Which is your favorite album by the Beatles?
I like a lot of them.     Maybe that new one, Seargent Pepper.
That is a very cool album.    Maybe check out the one before it.
What is the name of the album?
It is called Revolver, and has an all black and white cover.
That is quite different to Seargent Pepper.     Why would I like it?
That records are similar.     Lots of horns and classical and Indian instruments.
OK.    I like stuff that does not all sound the same.    Songs?
Well, you might have heard of Eleanor Rigby or Tomorrow Never Knows.
Yes, I know those.     That last one was the one on that Mad Men episode.
