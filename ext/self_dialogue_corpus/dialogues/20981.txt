Have you seen that movie with Beyonce in it?
Which one?
The one where she is married and her husband is being stalked by a co worker.
Oh. You mean Obsessed.
Yeah. Have you seen it?
Girl, I saw that movie when it  first hit the theaters.
What did you think of it? Did you like it?
I thought it was good. You don't see too many serious movies with black people as leads in them.
True. You're right about that. We are normally cast in comedy movies.
Either that or we are killed off in the first half hour of the movie.
Exactly.
But back to Obsessed. You must just saw on it on cable?
Yeah. I didn't bother going to movie theaters when it came out nor did I buy it on DVD.
What did you think of it? You didn't like it did you?
I mean the movie was okay but Beyonce is not a good actress in my opinion.
I feel you on that.
Then her character is too jealous and almost too controlling in that movie.
You noticed that too? When she told her husband to get rid of the female temp, I was like who do you think you are?
I'm telling you. She acted like that man signed everybody's checks in that office.
True plus that is how she landed him. And you know what they about what goes around comes around.
