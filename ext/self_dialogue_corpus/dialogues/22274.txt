Leigh is really amazing in the movie.
Why do you say that?
She plays one of the main characters. She is an outlaw who has a bounty for $10000 in the movie.
Was that a lot of money?
I don't really know. The guy who was looking out for her seemed to think it was, and he was really suspicious of everyone, so it probably was.
Why was she worth so much money?
You don't plan on seeing the movie? If I told you, it would spoil things.
I think if I had planned on seeing it, I would have by now. It's been out for two weeks.
All right, so she was part of this gang- she was the gang leader's sister, and apparently everyone in the gang had this huge bounty on their heads.
Okay, but what did she do in particular which made her worth $10000?
The guy who is holding her, John said she was some sort of a killer. It sounded like she killed a lot of people.
Okay, so what made her great in the movie?
Anyway, if you watch her throughout the movie, you see she is the perfect catalyst and antagonist for everything that is going on. She goads the protagonists, makes them question one another, and makes the whole event into a great whodunit?
It sounds like she got away.
Well, I really do not want to spoil it for you- wait until it comes out on video and watch it.
Okay, maybe I will. I really like Samuel L. Jackson. Was he any good in it?
I think he was, and I think he got to play the role he wanted to play in Django, in this movie. You know how originally he thought he was going to be the star of Django?
I did not know that.
Yeah, well he was not a badass in this movie- he was a different kind of cool. He was perceptive, dogged, and cunning. I can't remember the last time I saw him in a role like this.
Maybe I will see the movie. It does sound pretty good.
