What did Kim Kardashinan wear yesterday?
How am I supposed to know, I don't know fashion.
Yes you do, I know you secretly watch that show.
Okay, okay, it's true, she wore that little black catour dress that has the really low cut.
I be she looked like a slut. I mean she is a slut right? Her style really says so.
Ha, yea, she is a bit like that. I bet she doesn't put out though, I mean have you heard that she wears designer nose rings.
Really is that for some kind of S&M sort of fantasy?
I bet it is. I mean it is made to order, supposedly, but the point is when people dress like that they ask for a certain audience.
And I guess we are both in that audience because I mean we both like to see skin.
Well who doesn't like skin. She is hot and why not use clothing to express that.
A valid point. Clothing is as much of an expression of who you are as your facebook page.
I don't know if that is true in my case. Maybe if all my posts are old and not hip.
Are you wearing tights?
Yes, I like to wear them under my pants.
That must get uncomfortable. How do you do it?
Well you know what they say suffer for fashion. And it is my own style, why not?
Well maybe cuz it can't feel very good to have your junk up in those.
It actually breaths quite well considering it  wasn't meant to be used as a male accessory
Do you ever read the instructions? It could be hazardous to your health.
Well I never read anything about that. All I know is it looks great.
