Have you seen all the Little Mermaid movies?
No? I thought there was only one.
Nope, I definetely have seen the direct sequel
Oh, well whats it called?
I can't remember, but in the movie Ariel has a daughter with black hair.
Of course, she would look like Prince Eric.
Yeah, exactly, and they have drama like mothers and daughters do.
That doesn't suprise me, sounds interesting though.
Yeah, I actually like the music in it.
Well I'll have to check it out.
