What's your favorite Disney movie?
Probably 'Aladdin', although it's really tough to choose. You?
I love 'Aladdin' but I'd probably pick 'Fantasia'.
Is that the really older one?
Yeah, it's from the 40s or 50s. No dialog, just animation.
I think I've seen clips from it and it's amazing.
It is, and it's really cool to see early Disney animation and see how it progressed.
Disney really found its own style early on, didn't it?
For sure, and that's part of the reason Disney is so successful.
Everyone grew up with Disney. It's like a family tradition.
