Do you think the Chicago bears will ever rise again.
You,would hope a,team,with their history will turn it around.
It would be good for the league.
I think so too.
I believe they open up with the falcons.
Well that's not the way to start a season.
Then they have Tampa,Pittsburgh and Green Bay.
Wow,they could start 0-4.
There is a,good chance of that yes.
How do they get such a tough schedule after going 3-13?
This is the NFL we're talking about.
I know,sometimes I can't figure them out.
I like John fox as a head coach though.
I like him too.
At least jay cutler is gone.
Right,he was a head case.
He had a rocket arm but was very erratic.
That's putting it mildly.
Mike Glennon should be an upgrade.
He should be at $16 million guaranteed.
