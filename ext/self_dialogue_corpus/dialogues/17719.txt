Hey, what are you doing?
I am trying to find a good Christian song.
Why are you looking for that kind of song?
I am going to sing a song at church in a few weeks and I would like to find something new.
Oh that sounds cool. What artists are you looking at right now?
Right now I am searching Mercy Me and Chris Tomlin songs.
Well you certainly can't go wrong with I Can Only Imagine from Mercy Me. That one is always good.
Yes I love that one. I am also looking at their song called How Great Is Your Love.
I don't think I have heard that one before. What songs are you looking at for Chris Tomlin?
Whom Shall I Fear and Indescribable are at the top of the list right now.
Oh, you know if you want to go with one of his songs you should consider his version of Amazing Grace.
Oh yes I forgot about that one. That is the best song ever!
You know there is also this new girl Lauren Diagle who has some really great Christian songs out right now.
I don't think I have ever heard of her. What are some of her songs?
How Can It Be, Come Alive, I Am Yours, and also one of her best is Trust In You.
I think I have heard the Trust In You song before but I just didn't know who sang it.
It is really great. I bet you could do it really well.
I will definitely have to put that song on the list.
Well you can't go wrong with any of your choices.
Thanks. I think I am leaning towards either Trust In You or Amazing Grace.
