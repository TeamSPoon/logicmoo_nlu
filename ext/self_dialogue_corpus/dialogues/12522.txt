Do you have any movie insights or unknown star wars trivia?
Well A little bit, I know some of the backstory of the original scripts.
Like what? Please do share.
Well George's script was originally way too long so he cut the  final two acts and gave the first act of the screenplay as a whole story for star wars.
I did not know that.
Ya, the other two acts got made into The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
Wow that would have been way too much story line for one film.
Yes, agreed,I am glad they split it up. They would have had to cut out so much content.
I think everything happens for a reason, so happy it worked out the way it did.
Yes for sure a" force"  behind everything!
