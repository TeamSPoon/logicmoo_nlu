Are you familiar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
Sure, they're that 90s band, right?
They have been making music for longer than just the 90s, but they were definitely most popular then.
I've heard some of their music. Why do you ask?
It's a band I really used to like when I was younger. But it's been a while since I've listened to them.
Wondering if the music still holds up?
Yeah, a little bit of that.
I remember from the songs I heard, they seemed high energy and fun.
Definitely, that's one of their big strengths as musicans.
It seemed a bit silly at times.
For sure. They made a lot of jokes and said goofy, absurd stuff in their songs.
I can see why you'd be a bit apprehensive, though. Because that kind of thing can become a bad thing very easily.
Exactly. What 15 year old me found funny and cool, 35 year old me might find goofy and lame.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Yep, I'm going to dig out some of my old Chili Peppers CDs and give them a whirl.
I'll be interested to hear if the music still holds up for you.
I kind of think it will, if for no other reason than the fact that it will bring back happy memories.
Sure, that's a part of it. Music kind of works the same way for me.
Just hoping that I don't cringe too much and think 'what on Earth did I see in this?'
Haha, good luck!
