My favorite Disney Pixar movie by far has to be the Toy Story series.
Yes, these movies always seem to make me cry.
I cried during the end of Toy Story 3, Andy is all grown up.
When Andy gave Woody to the girl it was like a full circle experience.
Do you think Andy will get the toys back for his own kids?
It would be nice to see Andy get married and have the toys be in his kids lives.
Disney might be making that the next movie.
Yes but what if Andy has a daugher?
I think Andy's daughter would also play with the toys.
Maybe Woody and Bo-Peep would have a renunion.
