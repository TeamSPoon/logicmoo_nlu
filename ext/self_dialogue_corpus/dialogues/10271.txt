Hardcore Henry was such an invigorating action movie!
Was that the movie that was shot first person point of view with stuntmen and GoPro cameras?
That's the film. It stars Sharlto Copley and Haley Bennett. Basically we get to be in the shoes of the main character Henry as he's frantically running, jumping, and fighting his way to figure out who he is.
I love Sharlto Copley especially since his performance in District 9, and Haley Bennett was fantastic in The Girl On The Train.
Sharlto's character plays the helper for the main character as he's always giving directions and helpful advice. Haley plays his wife and the doctor that puts him together.
I haven't seen the movie yet but is the main character suppose to be a cyborg of some sort?
Yes, Henry is basically a former soldier that now has been implanted with cybernetic parts for enhanced battle and warfare. It's such a rush of a movie, the action, the music, the pace is non stop.
I've been meaning to catch it but I can't find it anywhere. I'm curious to see how they pull off the stunts as well as watching the action sequences. I hope I don't get motion sickness.
To be honest, I was a bit nauseous at the start when the action was so fast paced but as it when on I got more used to it. They pace the movie well but they do give you short breaks to catch your breath.
That all sounds good. I'll have to look harder to find Hardcore Henry to finally watch to see what I've been missing out on.
