I do not like rap nowadays.
You are not a fan of the contemporary stuff at all?
No. I don't think it is very good
I hear you. The sound seems too artificial
Back in the day, it had a really organic sound
Yes and the rhymes were better
I think the raps made more sense too.
Yeah. Today they are pretty much all the same
At least we still have the oldies
They're always gonna be here
