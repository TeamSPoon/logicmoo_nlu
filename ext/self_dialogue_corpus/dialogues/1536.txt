Who is the best team in the NFL?
The New England Patriots won the last Superbowl, so I think it's fair to say they are the best team.
Are they really the best team though, or did they just have a good run this season?
Well isn't the point of the Superbowl to see who is the best team for each season?
Yes, but then that doesn't answer my question. I asked you who you think the best team in general is.
I would still have to say the Patriots.
Do you think they will win again next season?
Maybe, maybe not. They definitely have a chance though!
All teams have a chance.
Which team do you think is best, in general?
I think it's between a top few. For example, the Seahawks, Broncos, Steelers and even your favorite, the Patriots.
What are you basing this on?
I'm basing it on who makes it to the Superbowl finals, consistently.
I thought you said the winner of the Superbowl doesn't dictate who's best.
The current winner does, but I do think it makes sense to look at who has been doing well over the past few years.
Yes, I do agree that those teams have been consistent.
Consistency is key.
Seahawks have only won once though.
Yes, but they've made it to the finals twice in the past 5 years. That's more than many teams have been doing, trust me.
I agree with you on that one
