When does training camp start for the NFL?
In two weeks, I think.
Cool. I can't wait for the start of the season.
Who are you pulling for this year?
I am liking the Panthers.
Carolina? Did they have a good draft?
I think they did okay, but they had some key players hurt last year, which cost them.
Yeah, they went from the Super Bowl to the toilet bowl last year.
Come on, it wasn't there fault. Like I said, they had some injuries to key people.
I guess we will see.
Who are you picking this year.
The Patriots to repeat.
That's not very original, everyone is picking New England.
My pick doesn't have to be "original"...maybe "everyone" knows what they are talking about?
Okay, fair enough. Let see if they stay healthy all year.
Yeah, but every team has that concern.
Did the Patriots pick up anyone good in the draft.
Tough to say. They lost some key picks due to "Deflategate"
Oh yeah. I remember now.
I guess we will see if their picks lower in the draft order pan out.
