So what do you think about LA getting two teams this year?
I think its a really bad move for the NFL. I don't see how LA will support one team let alone two.
Yes but they are the second biggest market in the country.
True, but its just not a football town. LA is a lot like San Diego and San Diego never supports football.
I feel bad for St Louis and Oakland. They seemed like decent football towns.
Yes. I think that is the second time both of these cities lost their teams.
A lot of times there is more than meets the eye when teams move.
Yes. I don't think St Louis was bringing a lot of fans in.
No, they really weren't. However, the Rams have been a bad team for a long time.
I wonder if the NFL will finally concede that these two cities cannot support football.
A lot of it has to do with having an organization that is committed to winning. The fans will follow.
This is true. But I don't think the city should suffer because of bad ownership.
In surprised they elected to put both teams in LA. There were so many options.
I know. Law Vegas has been asking for a team for a long time.
I don't know if Vegas would support a team though. Nobody is from Lad Vegas.
That's true. But there would be a good following for the visiting team.
At least those in Oakland have another team right across the bay.
Right. That might be why it was tough to maintain a second team.
I wonder if there are just too many teams.
That could be. There are only so many markets that can support the NFL.
