Do you remember the name of the stepsisters in the movie Cinderella?
Not sure, I think Drusilda and Esmerelda.
They sure were ugly.
And mean too.
The stepmother was cruel.
I am glad Cinderella got to go to the ball.
Me too. And lost her shoe.
Yea, without that the prince would not have found her.
That is true. And then the got married.
And lived happily ever after.
