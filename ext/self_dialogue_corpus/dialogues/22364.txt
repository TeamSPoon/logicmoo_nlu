Do you think will smith is good in the movies he is in?
I like some of his movies
What movies of his do you like?
I think he was good in I am legend.
I like some of his comedy movies to be honest.
I think he is good in all the roles he plays in it is just you know
What do you mean?
The writing is not always good
Well the writing is not his fault
Well yeah he cannot help bad writing
Which is not something he should be faulted for.
No way i actually prefer his more serious movies to his comedic works.
I like both easy i love his non serious work too
I mean it comes off as a little cheesy.
Well cheesy is good though
I guess it can be
He even pulled off Dead shot pretty well even if the movie was bad
Do not get me started on how bad that movie is
I mean the actors did well just the plot was bad
That is easily the worst part of it.
