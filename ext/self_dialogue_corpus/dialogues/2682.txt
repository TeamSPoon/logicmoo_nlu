I just ordered some football tickets for next season.
for the detroit Lions?
Yes, they are our home team after all.
I don't know, they sure aren't the Denver Broncos!
I know the superbowl was great last year.
You know, I only watch it for the commercials.
Oh c'mon you know you think Matthew Stafford is hot.
Yes, he is and he is a team leader.
I really get sick of people bashing the lions.
Well they have been in last place alot.
Yes, but they are getting better.
I know, they were so much better last season.
Yes, they were, you know I had seats that were fantastic right on the 50 yard line last year.
I know, thats the game where they played the packers.
I know, that game was off the hook, you should've gone, you may have even liked it.
Um, you took Matt remember?
I know but what game do you want to go to this year?
Can I check the schedule and let you know?
Sure, just let me know.
Ok, I'll call you later this week/
