Have you listened to any new rap these days
Actually i am a fan of the old stuff
Really? How old?
Mostly stuff from the 80s, thats when rap was legendary
Who is your favorite artist
Personally I love NWA
Really, why them?
That group is filled with so many great rappers, and was basically the start of it all
Who is your favorite out of NWA
Eazy E is the best
