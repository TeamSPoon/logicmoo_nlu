Have you ever hit a home run?
Nope. I'd love that, though.
I did once.
Was it awesome?
People were screaming all over the place. It was pretty amazing.
I can imagine. When was it?
When I was in high school.
When you played for the Vipers?
Yes, that's right. Remember Julie and Ellen taking you to the games with them?
I do but I never saw you hit a homer. Trevor did, though.
It was one of the days they didn't go. I think you were all at the lake.
Sorry I missed that. I love how jazzed the crowd gets.
It's an intoxicating feeling for sure.
I always wanted to experience that for myself but I'm not any good. I didn't even make the team.
I remember that too.
Oh, well, we can't all be good at sports.
I'm actually thining of trying out for this new team Luther made up.
I'll come watch if you do.
The tryouts are next Saturday at one.
OK, we can ride together if you want.
