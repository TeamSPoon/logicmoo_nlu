I want to watch something with a lot of action.
That sounds like fun to me.
I don't have anything good, what about you?
Have you ever seen the movie Speed?
Is that the one with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves?
Yes, they are both great in it.
I think there is a sequel to that one as well, right?
Yes, but it is not nearly as good in my opinion.
What other action movies do you have?
I also have Con Air with Nicolas Cage.
I love that movie, but I have seen it so many times!
What about Natural Born Killers?
I started it one time but I could not get into it.
I recently purchased RED and RED two. Ever seen those?
Not sure, who plays in those movies?
They have a lot of famous people in them including Bruce Willis.
Are there a lot of action scenes?
Absolutely! I think you will enjoy both films.
Sounds great, I am ready to watch!
I hope you enjoy them like I think you will.
