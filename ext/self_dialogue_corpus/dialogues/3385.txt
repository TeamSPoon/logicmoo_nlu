I think one of the best horror movies of the '80s is Fright Night.
It's great.  I liked the humor in it.
It did have a sense of humor about the whole genre.
I like the actor that play Jerry Dandridge.
Yes, that's Chris Sarandon.  He's pretty great.
I liked the bits where he flirted with Charlie's mother.
Yeah, that was amusing.  He's a sexy guy.
I liked the scene where he breaks into Charlie's room and threatens him.
That was classic.  That would scare me to death if someone like that moved in next door.
It's really not given the credit it's due.
