What is a good super hero movie to watch?
I just watched  Captain America: Civil War. I thought it was really good.
I keep meaning to see that, I've seen all of the other Avengers movies.
Did you watch Captain America?
Yes, I did. I really liked it.
Its awesome seeing all these comic book characters come to life.
I know what you mean. I feel like an excited kid all over again.
Watching Robert Downey Jr.as Tony Stark is great. He's exactly how I pictured him to be.
I agree. I don't think anyone could do a better job than him.
Me too.
