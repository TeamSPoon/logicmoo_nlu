Have you listened to the new Kendrick Lamar album?
Yea, I thought it was decent.
Decent? It was literary genius.
Really? What track was your favorite?
I liked Humble.
Really? I feel like they've already played it out.
OOO can't play it too much!  It's relevant to his lifestyle?
How so ? All those rapper are the same, nobody is humble anymore?
Not true. Did you hear he bought his sister a corolla for graduation?
A corolla!  He really is humble.
