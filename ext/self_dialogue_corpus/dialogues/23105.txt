Have you seen the latest transformers movie?
The last knight? no I haven't seen it.
It was a really good movie I really enjoyed it.
Does it compare with the other transformers movies?
I actually thought it was better than the previous one. I only have one complaint.
What's your complaint?
I thought that it was way too long. It lasted a solid three hours.
Oh wow that's a really long movie.
Other than that, I thought the graphics were amazing.
Did you watch it in 3D?
Yes I did! It was so much cooler but it gave me a bit of a headache.
3D movies always tend to do that to a person.
It's the price you pay for an awesome movie.
I think I might go and check out the movie this weekend.
I think you totally should, all of the actors were great.
I bet !
The cars become more detailed and more realistic each time.
I'm always so jealous of the cars in the transformers movies.
When I got out of the theater I thought all the cars were going to transform.
I've felt that way before too.
