Dude, I wish Arnold was still making action movies. Nobody had lines like him.
Yeah, but wasn't he in one recently?
I don't know, maybe they did some remake. Weren't they going to remake T2?
How could they remake that? "I cannot self-terminate."
That is the best line! That molten metal dude was pretty cool too.
That was the terminator sent to kill Arnold! They had some great effects for the time.
Yeah, I remember that scene when the metal blobs join together and turn into the bad cop.
That cop had an evil look to him. I wonder what the real cops thought.
I bet all cops like Arnold.
They should make a film where he is now a police chief who gets down and dirty on the front lines.
