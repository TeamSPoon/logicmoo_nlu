Did you see the Voice last night?
Yeah, there was a girl I thought was really good.
You mean the one with really red hair? I though she was awesome!
That's the one, Cassie someone...she is from Nashville.
Yeah, I can see that...with her perfect country voice.
I wonder if she has an album out?
Probably, but I know she was singing at Honky tonk. I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube,
True. I'll look into that.
Anyway, all the Voice stuff will be online and on iTune...
I really love that show, so many great talents.
I though the older guy was good, too...he was singing Blues type of song...
One with the wicket guitar skills?
Yeah, his guitar was crazy.
I'm sure he'll make it to the final.
And the Cassie girl, I hope.
I'm not a huge fan of country music, but she was so good. Gave me goosebumps.
Same here, usually country is not my thing, but I've gotta admit. She was really good.
Sometimes music goes beyond genre.
Talent is talent...
Agreed. Country, rock, blues...whatever...
