Can you name every one of the dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
Of course I can. Doc, Dopey, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Grumpy!
Hey you have a really good memory. I always forget at least one of them.
Well it's one of my favorite Disney movies. "Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"
Did you just quote the Evil Queen?
You know I did! I was so scared of her when I was little.
Especially when she was disguised as the old lady.
Yeah Snow White was a very nice person because I'm not sure I would have helped her.
Well if she ever learned not to talk to strangers then it wouldn't have been a problem.
I'm not sure she had the best parental guidance since she was living with 7 kind dwarfs out in a cabin after her stepmother tried to have her killed.
