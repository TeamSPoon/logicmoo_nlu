Did you watch the BET awards the other night?
I did not, did you?
No, but I read some stories about it the next day.
I heard Leslie Jones was an amazing host.
Yeah, she told a lot of awesome jokes.
I think at one point she brought up Khalid and DJ Khaled and had them talk about their names.
Ha! No way.
Yeah! And then she told Khalid to find her when her was 21.
Haha that's amazing.
The only other award show I watched was the Grammy's
Yeah I watched those too. Mostly because i was bored.
I can't believe Beyonce didn't win for Lemonade.
I mean, did you really expect her to?
Kind of. I mean, the whole album and it's premise was phenomenal .Adele is great, but that was a work of art.
Yeah. But unfortunately, our society is not good at recognizing the achievements of women of color.
Very fair.
Her performance was amazing though.
For sure. i could never do that now, let alone if I were pregnant with twins.
And having all those mothers on stage with her -- it was a political statement as much as ap erformance.
For sure.
