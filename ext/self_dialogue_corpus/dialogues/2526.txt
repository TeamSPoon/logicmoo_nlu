What does the Jets schedule look like?
Pretty tough, I think, and their division is difficult.
Do they have any prime time games this season?
Yes, every team must have one.      They play Buffalo in November on a Thursday
Will the Jets running game hold up?
It absolutely must, since the passing game is in such doubt.
Who will be the leaders carrying the ball?
First is Matt Forte at running back.
How did he do last season.
A touch over 800 yards, so not great.
OK, who else?
They also have Bilal Powell. with 700 yards last season.
Less than 2000 yards between the top two running backs is tough.
Agreed, definitely not Pro Bowl numbers
What about the staff?
Well, the Jets have a new offensive coordinator.
Will that help?
John Morton is going to want to increase the tempo.
With no quarterback and a limited running game, can that work?
The magic eight ball would definitely be evasive about the status!
