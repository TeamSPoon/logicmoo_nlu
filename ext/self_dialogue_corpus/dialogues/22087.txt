John Travolta always seems to do very interesting films.
Yea he has quite a few of good movies to watch.
I always enjoy watching him when he plays a funny role.
Yea the Look Who's Talking franchise for example fitted him perfectly.
They sure did, I do not think anyone else could have made that role work the way he did.
I actually think he is awesome as a bad guy though.
Has he ever even played a bad guy before?
He sure has; and he does so convincingly!
I did not know that he had any roles like that.
The Punisher was a great movie and he was the villain in that one.
I have heard of that one but never actually seen it before.
You should watch it it! There is a sequel to it as well but he is not in it.
I will watch the original for sure, I want to check Travolta out as the bad guy!
It is definitly worth the watch, and it might give you a different perspective on how really talented Travolta is.
My mom used to have a major crush on him back in the day!
I thin a lot of girls did. Especially when Saturday Night Fever and Greece came out.
I loved watching both of those films. They made him a household name for sure.
They sure did; ground breaking roles for him without a doubt.
I feel he is perhaps one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood.
There is no denying that. He can pretty much play any role he chooses.
