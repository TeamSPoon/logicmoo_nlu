What is your favorite band?
My favorite band is Bauhaus.
I haven't heard of them.  What type of music do they play?
They're goth rock.  I think of them as straddling the punk-post punk line.
What songs have they done that I might have heard?
They covered 'Ziggy Stardust', and that gets a lot of play.
I might have heard that.  What else.
They're also known for the song 'Bela Lugosi's Dead'.
How else might I know of them?
You might know them from associated acts, and work members have done since.
What are some of those?
Well, Peter Murphy went on to have a fairly successful solo career.
Can you think of any bands that 'spun out of' or are associated with Bauhaus?
The two most popular are probably Tones on Tail and Love and Rockets.  Daniel Ash also had some solo success.
You mentioned Peter Murphy, who else was in the band?
Members included Peter Murphy, Daniel Ash, Kevin Haskins, and David J.
That's interesting thanks for sharing this information with me.
No problem.  I think their record label was Beggars Banquet.
I'll keep that in mind.
You can always sample them on iTunes or a streaming service.
