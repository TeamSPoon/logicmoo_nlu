Are you a fan of horror movies?
No, I'm a bit of a wimp. Maybe I have an overactive imagination.
It always surprises me how many are coming out in theaters. It seems like there are a few new ones every month.
I always associate these movies with Halloween and specific circumstances, but it's really an all year thing.
I've only seen a few in theaters, but you're right, I don't think they were around Halloween.
Have you seen The Grudge? I saw that one in the theater and couldn't ride an elevator alone for a few weeks after.
That was a scary one. It was more something jumping out at you and surprising you than just being a scary concept.
The Sixth Sense got me too. That was more a scary concept than the shocks every few minutes.
And of course the great twist at the end.
A very good movie, but still made me want to sleep with the light on for a few days.
