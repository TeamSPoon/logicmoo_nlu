Howabout that Lebron!
I know right!
He has been in the league 14 years!
That is a long time.
How many rings does he have?
I think he has three.
Can you believe that Golden State blew a 3-1 lead?
No!
That was all Lebron.
Yes it was.
He willed his team to win.
For real...he was not to be denied.
He did really well in Miami.
Yes he did.
He got to Championchips there.
Yes..and then the one last year in Cleveland.
People were made when he first left Cleveland.
I would be also!
I will tell you though..to come back and win it all has to be one of the best "hometown sports stories" ever!
He is not done yet!
