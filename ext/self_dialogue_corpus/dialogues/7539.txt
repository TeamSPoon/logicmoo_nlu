We bought the kids Harry Potter for Christmas. The entire DVD collection was only 50.00 on Amazon!
Are you serious? Did they watch them yet?
We have only watched a few so far. They keep wanting to rewatch the first one.
That's awesome! I love that one!
Me too! WHich one is your favorite.
It's so difficult to choose! I'd have to go with number 4 "Goblet of Fire".
Good choice: poor Cedric Diggory!
When his dad runs in crying and screaming "my boy" I cry every single time.
I always cry whe Dobby dies. Stupid Bellatrix.
Yes, I agree! However, she does makes a great villain.
