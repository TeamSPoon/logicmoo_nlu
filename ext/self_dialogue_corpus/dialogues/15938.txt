Do you listen to music at the gym at all?
Sometimes, but I have a hard time finding music I like that motivates me!
Me too! I'm actually looking for suggestions.
Now that you mention it, I take a Zumba class and really like the music there.
Yeah good point! I actually think reggaeton is pretty motivating.
Do you ever listen to it when running?
I haven't. I just want to make me dance but I kind of want to next time I go for a run.
Sometimes when I go to a club I'll recognize a song or two from Zumba.
That's awesome! Do you bust out in Zumba dance moves in a club?
Sometimes!
I used to listen to a lot of EDM when I run, but since the EDM station went off the air I don't know any songs.
Yeah I miss the Evolution radio station!
Have you listened to that station at all recently?
No, why? What's on it?
It's another country station!
Ugh, seriously?
Yeah, I know. We don't even live in the south!
I know, I don't even have a single friend that listens to country music!
Me neither, but some of the country singers are pretty cute!
Yeah, but we can't see their cute faces through the radio! Haha
