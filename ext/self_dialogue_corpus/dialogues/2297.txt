Do you like Greenbay Packers?
Not really since Fabre retired.
I miss him.
He was the heart and soul of that team.
Rodgers is good though.
Yeah but he's missing that passion.
Only Fabre could bring that to every play.
Didn't he play with a concussion?
Multiple times.
That's insane.
He got one, went out of the game came back in threw a touchdown and then went back off the field.
He was dedicated.
I wish I could see him play one more time.
That would be nice.
Do you think Rodgers will ever be as good as him?
Maybe with enough time.
Yeah, maybe.
He's already better than we could have hoped for but not Brett Fabre.
He is a solid quarterback.
He will only get better too.
