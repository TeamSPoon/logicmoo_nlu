Did you see last night's baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees?
Yeah, I cannot believe that Brad Brach blew another save.
The Yankees have owned him this season.
True, but did you see the homerun by Aaron Judge in the 14th inning to win it?
Ha, by then I was fast asleep.
I was exhausted but it was totally worth staying up for, he hit it in the black seats at the stadium.
Seriously?  Isn't he just the second one to do that?
Certainly is, Alex Rodriguez did it 5 years ago.
That Judge kid looks to be an amazing young talent.
Yeah, I like the young core that the Yankees have with Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius.
I really wasn't sure why the Yankees let Brian McCann go to Houston, but now I see why watching Sanchez.
Yeah, the 20 homeruns he hit last year are definitely no fluke.
I agree and Judge is already at 15 in his rookie season and we are only in May.
Wow, 15 already! I did not realize it was that many.
Yeah, and when he hits one it is long gone over the fence.
I know, his longest was around 460 feet this year.
Was that the longest homerun in the Major Leagues this year?
No, it was close but someone hit a ball farther in Miami.
Mike Stanton?
But of course :-)
