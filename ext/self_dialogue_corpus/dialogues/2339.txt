Well, first of all I am still mad they are the New York Jets but play in New Jersey.
Where do the New York Jets play?
They play in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey.
Why dont they build and play in a stadium in New York ?
There really is no place near New York City that would be a good location.  The NY Yankees and Mets already have two large stadiums in the Bronx and Queens.
Are they the only team playing in MetLife Stadium?
No, in fact they share that stadium with the New York Giants
How is it possible for two NFL teams to share the same stadium ?
Each NFL team only has a certain number of home games. The Jets and Giants coordinate the schedules to avoid a home game conflict.
