Do you know Taylor Swift's first number one song?
I actually don't know!
I'll give you a hint if you want to try and guess.
Okay, I'll give it a try.
She opened for Rascal Flatts' Me and My Gang Tour.
Oh my, I have no idea!
She composed it for a talent show during her freshmen year in high school.
Was it about a boyfriend she had who she didn't have a song with?
Yes, but what is the name of the song?
Isn't it called "Our Song"?
You got it!
I like that song but haven't heard it for a while.
I haven't heard for a long time too!
Now I want to hear some Taylor Swift!
I do too.
Do you have any of her music?
Of course I do!
Well, turn it on and lets start dancing.
I can't dance but I'll definitely find a Taylor Swift CD to listen too!
Great! The Our Song single if you have it!
