I came to the realization that our group of friends are likeSnow White's seven dwarves.
Well there are seven of us, do you mean like personality-wise too?
Oh definitely.
Well which one am I?
Oh you're definitely the Sneezy one in our group.
Haha that's pretty accurate I do have crazy allergies.
Exactly, I almost had you down as Dopey.
That would have made me Grumpy.
Nope, I put myself down as grumpy. Your boyfriend I put as Dopey.
That makes sense.
