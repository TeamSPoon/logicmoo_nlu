The X-wind fighters in STAR WARS are cool.
It was cool when Luke would be in one.
And R2-D2 would be in the back.
And the wings could close or make an X.
And each part of the wing had a gun on it.
They had 4 engines also.
It was cool when they would chase the Tie Fighters.
It was like back in the day when airplanes would chase each other.
And they would wear high altitude flight outfits.
I bet the go quick.
