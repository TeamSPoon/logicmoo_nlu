What's the Beatles' drummer name again?
Ringo.
Ah, that's right. I thought that maybe there was a different drummer before him.
There was - but I can't remember his name!
Ah well - what songs do you like by the Beatles?
"Love Me Do" has a catchy tune and I find myself singing it a lot.
That one is a lot of fun. I like "When I'm Sixty Four".
It's pretty whimsical and fun.
Although it drives my spouse up the wall!
"Hey Jude" does the same for me, especially the end of the song.
