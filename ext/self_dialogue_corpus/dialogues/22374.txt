Have you ever seen Rocky?
No, is it good?
OMG - it is awesome!
What is it about?
It's about a boxer that is down on his luck but he is chosen to fight against a champion boxer for championship title.
Who's in it?
Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire and a bunch of other great actors.
I'd love to see it with you.
Yes, it is such an emotional movie.
How so?
The lead character is just such a likeable character and he is kind of abused and taken advantage of by people.
Is that Sylvester Stallone's character?
Yes, he really does a great job in this movie.
I think he is a great actor!
I think he might have won an Oscar for that role.
I'll have to look that up.
If he didn't then he should have!
Is that the movie with Apollo Creed?
Yes, that was played by Carl Weathers.
He is a great actor too.
