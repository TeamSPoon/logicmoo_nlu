What is your favorite Disney movie?
Easy! 'Aladdin'. I love the story, and the music.
Robin Williams is the voice of the genie, isn't he?
Yes! I can't imagine anyone else voicing that character.
Me neither. His voice is so expressive, he did such an amazing job.
And the genie is just a great character. So funny.
You're right, the music in 'Aladdin' is great, too. So catchy.
And all the characters have a song or two each, which is always cool.
What your favorite song from the movie?
'Prince Ali' because Robin Williams does all those hilarious voices in one song. I love it.
