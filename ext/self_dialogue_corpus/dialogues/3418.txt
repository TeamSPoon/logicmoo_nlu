Do you like horror movies?
Sometimes, if they are realistic.
I have a great one for you, Devil.
What is that about.
It is entirely filmed in a stopped elevator.
Wow that sounds creepy.
Yes it is so lifelike for most of it.
Ok I like that.
Yes it is super intense with great acting.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
