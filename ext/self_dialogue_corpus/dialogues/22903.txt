Do you like the Batman movies?
Which one?
The recent ones directed by Christopher Nolan.
Yes, they are amazing!
The Dark Knight Rises was the best.
Of course.  I think so too.
It had the perfect villain.
The Joker was crazy!
Heath Ledger gave a legendary performance.
Too bad he died.
Yes, it was a shame.
Do you think he is the best Joker ever?
Probably. Jared Leto was good too though.
He was decent but a lot of his scenes were cut.
His character was thin as a result.
what about Nicholson?
He was too cartoony.
Yeah, it was unrealistic.
Ledgers Joker was perfect.
He represents true chaos.
