What is your favorite disney movie?
Well, If I had to choose I would probably choose Aladdin.
Aladdin? I love that movie too! What was your favorite scene?
My favorite scene was when Aladdin sets the Genie free.
That was one of my favorite scenes too! It was so heartfelt.
I agree, I cried when the Genie decided to stay with Aladdin.
Do you think they will ever make a remake?
Possibly, but its going to be hard to find somebody to replace Robin Williams.
maybe a young comedian would be a good genie.
maybe, but he has to have a good voice too.
