What's your favorite Disney movie?
I have always been partial to Aladdin.
That's a great classic Disney movie.
It has some of the best songs, too.
Did you see that the voice actors did a version of A whole new world 20 years later?
I did see that, it sounded exactly the same.
I always liked Jasmine. She was a strong character before that was popular.
She does seem ahead of other Disney princesses of her time.
She still used her body to try to distract Jafar.
That was creepy, but also necessary.
