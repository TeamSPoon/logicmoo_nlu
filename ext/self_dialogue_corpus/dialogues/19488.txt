what do you think of lil yachty
i'm not into mumble rap
he's not really mumbling
but he's like the posterchild of the movement
yeah, it kinda sucks
why do people even like it
its catchy i guess
but it has no lyrical substance
it really doesnt
its boring
you cant expect everyone to be a mos def though
i guess eveeryone has their lane
and they go in their own lane
basically bad rap vs bad rap
nah. that is so subjective
well, important rap vs pointless rap
maybe so
i hate the music
i like a couple of songs
i do not
