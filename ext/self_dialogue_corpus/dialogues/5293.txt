alice in wonderland is a classic movie, so full of wonder
I always wondered what that little cake tasted like
the one that said "eat me" I know, I wish I could find a magic cake
The queen of hearts wanted to shop everyone's head off
I know, I am glad Alice was able to escape and get back home
The man who wrote this suffered from bad migraines
I heard that, people say this was a dream he had after he took opiates for a headache
that makes sense because of the cat who was shown smoking and changing colors
this movie has such a bog following, I am sure many kids have imagined falling into a rabbit hole
I know, it would be fun to disappear into a different world sometime.
