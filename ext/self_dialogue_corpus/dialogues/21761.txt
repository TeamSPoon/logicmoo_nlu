Batman v Superman is such a strange film.
Strange, good or bad?
Good, mostly. In my opinion, anyway.
What makes you say that?
It's just such an absurd idea. A movie about Batman deciding that Superman must die.
Jeez, that does sound weird.
Not only that, but it's full of subtext and symbolism. I even read they snuck a time-travel plot in that only lasts about 2 minutes.
And that makes it a good movie?
It makes it ambitious. It works on a lot of levels, even if it doesn't work for everyone.
It obviously didn't work for everyone. It bombed at the box office.
I mean, not really. It did make almost 900 million dollars.
These days, if a movie doesn't make a billion it's a failure. Besides, critics hated it.
Critics saw the theatrical cut which was butchered. 30 whole minutes of important scenes were cut from it!
Whoa, that's a lot! Why would they cut so much?
Warner Bros. wanted the run time shorter so they could sell more tickets.
That seems kind of short-sighted in hindsight.
It was. I mean, the movie would still probably be divisive, but at least people would understand it if they had seen the full thing.
Yeah, but a 3-hour long film? Most people would probably think that's too long.
Heck, like I said, if nothing else, it's an ambitious film. Even if it is flawed.
Flawed, but ambitious, huh? Well, at least it's not boring.
