What do you think about Taylor Swift?
I don't know I haven't listened to a lot of her music because I use Spotify.
She actually just made her music available on Spotify!
Oh really! I will have to listen.
In my opinion, 22 is her best album.
I know a few of the songs on Red.
I love that one too! All Too Well is my favorite song.
What other artists do you like?
I really like a few of Skylar Grays songs.
Who is she?
She is a singer/songwriter from Wisconsin.
She sounds familiar. What are some of her main songs?
She sings Cannonball and Invisible.
Oh actually I do know Cannonball, that has the X Ambassadors in it right?
Yes that's the one!
I went to their concert last year they are so talented.
I first heard out about them when I heard Renegades on the radio.
Yes I love that song! I also really like Unsteady.
I enjoy their rock sound and that they a typical "pop" band.
Yeah they are a bit more alternative. Similar to a new band I just found called Arizona.
