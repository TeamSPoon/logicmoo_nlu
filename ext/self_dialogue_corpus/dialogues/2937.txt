How do you think the Patriots will do this year?
I think they'll do great. They added some great offensive players.
Oh really, who did they add to the team?
Well, Brandon Cooks is one of their new guys. He's a wide receiver.
I've heard of him. He's a really smart player.
He definitely is, they also added a great running back. He led the entire NFL in yards per carry last year.
If Gronkowski stays healthy I think they'll win it all again.
Ya, but do you think Gronk will actually stay healthy?
I don't know, I really hope he does but he never seems to.
If the Patriots actually had him the entire season they would probably win every game.
I agree.
I bet one of the hardest games this year will be the Steelers.
I agree, the Steelers have a great offensive.
Yes, their offensive game is right on level with the Patriots.
Well, I hope Brady stays healthy.
Me too, I'm going to be kinda sad when he retires.
Me too, it's the end of an era.
For sure, he really is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
Well, maybe he can stick it out another few years.
Let's hope so.
