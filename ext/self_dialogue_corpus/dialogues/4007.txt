Hey have you seen anything about that new movie "47 Meters Down"?
You mean the one about the sharks?
Yeah it seems pretty scary.
I don't know if I would go see it, I don't like open water.
I agree the setting is really scary
I guess that's what makes a good thriller though right?
You're right. Would you be brave enough to go see it with me?
I think I can get the courage up to go with you.
WHat do you thin kwill be the scariest part?
Oh the sharks lurking in the darkness for sure. They could be anywhere!
