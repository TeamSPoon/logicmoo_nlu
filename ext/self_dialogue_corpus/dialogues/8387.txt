What do you think of Bruno Mars?
I think he is a very talented singer.
Do you know what his real name is?
I don't! Tell me!
Peter Gene Hernandez is his real name.
Bruno Mars is a much better stage name. I understand why he chose it.
I love his newest song "That's What I Like"
Me too! The retro sound he uses is really cool.
His production team is very impressive. They have a vast musical knowledge.
It definitely shows in the new tracks I have heard!
