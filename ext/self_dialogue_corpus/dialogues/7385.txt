What is the best Disney movie you have ever seen?
Flubber, with Robin Williams, hands down.
That's funny. I didn't really think of that as a popular Disney movie.
No? It's one of the best ones ever made because it inspired me to become a scientist!
Really? Flubber made you want to be a scientist?
Yep. Even when I was a kid I tried to replicate making that bouncy green goo.
I'd bet your parents got mad at you for all the messes you made.
Haha, yep. They sure did.
Did you ever succeed in making something that could bounce balls high into the air like in the movie?
Nope. Unfortunately my parents took away my materials!
