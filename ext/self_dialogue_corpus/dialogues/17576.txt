Do you know of any good rock bands nowadays?
I think I heard about this new rock band called Firebreathers.
OK I'm going to Google them.
Look up Fire Marshall Brian.....he's the lead singer!
Wow, they're a cool band!
Yeah, they've been out since Spring.
Looks like they're playing here in August.
We should catch their show!
Are they considered metal?
I'd say they're heavy rock with a touch of metal.
That's rad.  I hope thier show will be worth it.
As long as they play songs like "Hither" and "Zombie Punch," I'm all in!
Zombie Punch? What's that song about?
It's about his favorite drink.
And Hither?
Basically about how he wants his current girlfriend to come hither and stay with him.
I'm going to listen to their whole album before the concert show.
You should.
Looks like they have a VEVO channel.
Also, research thier first album called Novice.
