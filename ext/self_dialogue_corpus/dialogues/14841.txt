Dude did you see Super Troopers?
Is that the movie about the cops in New Hampshire
Yeah, its something like that - what did you think?
That Ramathorn guy was awesome, I loved his moustache
Did you see the scene where they cover the fat guy in powdered sugar?
Oh yeah, the one guy who got arrested by the other police guys?
Yeah that guy - I am really excited I heard they were making a sequel.
Really? Do you think the whole cast is coming back?
I heard they were, so it should be really good.
I hope so, some of the other movies these guys did were not so great.
