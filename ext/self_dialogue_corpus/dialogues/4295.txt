i saw The Silence of the Lambs on demand last night.
That's a classic.  I loved Jodie Foster with brown hair.
And the Virginia accent!
Anthony Hopkins was superb in that movie.
Oh yes.  I loved how he got free.
Ted Levine was cool as Buffalo Bill.
I loved the pit.
My favorite was the lights out scene.
Right, with Jodie breathing hard.
The sequels/prequels were not even close.
