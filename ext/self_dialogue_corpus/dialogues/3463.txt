Do you like horror movies?
Yeah I do
What is your favorite one?
I dont really have a favorite
I loved Texas Chainsaw Massacre
That was awesome but not the updated ones
Yeah I think the Jessica Biel version wasnt that bad
It wasnt bad it was terrible
Now now, those actors did a great job
Yeah of making sure no  one would remember it.
