You know who was an ultimate classic and gone too soon?
Who are you talking about?
Tupac Shukar.
Of course I remember him! I hate that he died so young.
I really do too. He wrote such amazing lyrics.
I loved his song "Dear Mama."
Yes that was one of the great ones for sure.
I liked how he addressed the struggles that women went through as mothers.
I do too. You can tell he loved his mama.
You really can. He had so many great songs.
I loved the one "Changes".
Yes! I almost feel like it was before it's time in a sense.
I know what you mean. He was wise beyond his years.
Another great one was "Keep Ya Head Up".
That was also a great inspiration to keep going.
I agree. He spoke to everyone with his music.
I think it's so sad that his murder case was never solved.
I completely agree. You would think they could have done that by now.
I know. I don't get it at all.
His music will love on though, that's for sure.
