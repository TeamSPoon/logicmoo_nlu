Have you heard about Rogue One?
Yes I saw it when it debuted.
I believe its coming to Netflix.
The movie?
They are writing it to become a series.
See thats way too much
Once Lucas ceded control you knew this would happen.
But would people tune into that?
Absolutely, its money in the bank.
I just dont know if you can connect Rogue One with the regular film series in such a manner.
