It's a classic Tarantino film. Everyone dies- you would really like it.
Hah, spoilers much?
It's a Tarantino film. You already know that everyone does, and there is lots of blood.
All right, point sort of taken. You could have at least let me pretend. Wait, even Jackson.
Especially Jackson.
Aw, that's not cool. Was it a fun movie?
Yes, but the music was not as memorable or enrapturing as the soundtrack they used for Django.
What was wrong with the music?
Well, you remember how Djano's music was not necessarily from the time period of even when spaghetti westerns were being made?
Yes, but they still felt thematically right.
Right, but that was not the case in this movie. Sometimes, you might get sucked out of the flow of things because a song comes up which feels like it doesn't belong.
Tarantino really has his tastes in music, and I don't think he cares whether you like it or not.
Right? He hears some new song and it feels like he just wants to include it into a movie.
Give me an example of a bad song you heard in this movie.
Well, I can't remember the song- like I said, they were not as good as Django. However, I remember when it happened.
Was it inappropriate music while people were trying to use an outhouse?
Actually, it sort of was.
No it wasn't- you're just about to make something up now.
No, I am serious. There was a scene in which someone ran into an outhouse to hide, and the person who was chasing after him walked out into the snow to the tune of some music that sounded like it belonged to a Brady Bunch soundtrack.
Wow, was Tarantino trying to be ironic or something?
