Do you think jk rolling did a great job with the story line
She was very creative
Draco at the end became a good person don't you agree
I do agree. He realized his father was a bad guy
I heard in the last movie Dumbledore was actually sleeping during his death scene
Wow really that is too funny
I wonder how they came up with the spell names
Me too. They sound crazy.
I wish they would come out with a Harry potter series
Me too. The Harry potter franchise made a killing
