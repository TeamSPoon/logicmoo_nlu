I'm a big Kate Bush fan, do you like her.
I used to listen to her. Sure I love her.
You used to listen to her?
When she first came out. Eventually she dropped out of mainstream sight you know.
But I think she was still working in music.
Maybe off and on, I don't really know.
Which of her albums do you like?
The Dreaming, Hounds of Love, then much later, Aerial.
I really like Hounds of Love.
Side 1 is totally out of this world. Not one misstep.
Agreed. Its, completely dreamy ha ha.
Did you see the music videos for the album.
Definitely. That's what sold them to me.
Mmm hmm.  Kind of otherworldly and out there.
No kidding. You can see them on Youtube now.
I'll do that. They're interesting to watch.
I guess she was musically talented as a child.
She might if played instruments with her family as I recall.
Certainly didn't hurt her in her career.
Yeah I have a lot of admiration for her style.
