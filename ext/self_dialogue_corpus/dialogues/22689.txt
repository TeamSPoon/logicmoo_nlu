Do you know when the new Spider Man Movie comes out?
You mean Spider Man: Homecoming?
Yep, that one.
July 7, I think. Are you going to watch it?
Yeah, I heard really good things about it. Are you?
I don't know. They've made so many Spiderman movies already.
That's because he's such a popular superhero.
Who plays Peter Parker this time?
Tom Holland, I think.
Tobey Maguire will always be Spider Man to me.
I'm gonna give the new guy a chance.
What other movies are you gonna watch this summer?
I've been waiting for the War for the Planet of the Apes.
Yeah, that movie looks sick! When does it come out?
July 13. American Made looks pretty good too.
Definitely. Anything with Tom Cruise is good.
He might be nuts but the man can make some good movies.
But that one doesn't come out till September.
I know. It would have made a good summer movie.
Well, it's something to look forward to at least.
