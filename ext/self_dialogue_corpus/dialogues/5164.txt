What do you think about the Cinderella Disney movies?
Cinderella is a Disney classic but there are so many versions out there.
Are all the versions made by Disney?
I believe most are made by Disney and others by major companies.
What is your best version of the Disney Cinderella?
I think all of them are good and can't pick a favorite.
They all have a stepmom and two step sisters.  What happened to the father?
I think the father passes away early in all the films.
What about the stepmom in Cinderella?  Did she ever get remarried?
No, I thing the stepmom stayed single and just harassed Cinderella.
