Have you ever listened to Brand New?
Oh yeah they were the kings of pop punk rock
Do you know where they are from
I believe long island in New York
Yeah I think you might be right with that one
What happened to them
They just keep saying they are making music but never do
I loved Deja Entendu.
I loved Your Favorite Weapon
They started off with 2 great albums
Then they started to move away from the pop punk sound
I think they matured and this was the newer sound
I still dont like the progression they made as a band
It was fair and I understood the point of what they were doing
I liked how much I could sing along to most of their tracks.
They definitely made a sound that was hard to replicate
I just wish they took their fans more seriously
Yeah they do treat us like dirt
What is your favorite song by them?
I would say Soco Amaretto Lime
