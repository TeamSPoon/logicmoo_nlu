Do you like Tim McGraw?
Yeah, he's one of the best ever country artist.
Yeah he is.  His duets with Faith Hill are amazing.
Yeah, especially "like we never loved at all"
I know, even though it's a break up song they just match.
Live like you were dying was an awesome song too.
Yes it was.  How about How Bad do you want it?
That was awesome.  I listen to that before I race.
It's a good motivation song.
Sure is.  What about Don't Take the Girl?
A little sappy for me.  I kind of liked a heart don't forget.
Yeah, and that wasn't sappy?  But it was happy and catchy.
Yeah, almost like you could see yourself living that song.
One Tim McGraw song overlooked.  The Ride.
I know right?  I almost never hear that.
It was awesome too.  Only way you ever hear it is on a CD or ipod.
Yeah, another under rated one was he covered Tiny Dancer.
Really?  I bet that was really good.
It was.  Not as good as Elton but still really good.
I'd like to hear that.  I should check out spotify.
