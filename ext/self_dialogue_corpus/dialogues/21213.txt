Did you see the trailer for the new Spider Man?
Yeah, Homecoming?
Yup.
Looks awsome!
I know!
I really like that they got Michael Keaton as the villian.
Yeah, what his character again.
The Vulture.
Yeah, that's right.
His career has really come full circle.
How do you mean?
You know, he played Batman, and now he's the bad guy.
That kinda funny.
Did you see that one where he's a washed up superhero acter gone play producer.
No. Which one is that.
Birdman.
I heard it was weird.
It was. But still interesting.
Maybe I'll check it out.
You might like it.
