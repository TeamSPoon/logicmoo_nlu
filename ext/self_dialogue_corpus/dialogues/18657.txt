What is your favorite band of all time?
I'm not sure, but it would definitely be a classic rock band.
I remember that you would always have the radio tuned to the classic rock station in Chicago.
Yeah, I guess my overall favorite would be Pink Floyd.
Did you ever get to see them in concert?
I saw them when Roger Waters played with them for that one concert in London.
Dude, that's a like a bucket-list kind of deal.
Yeah, I was over there for university and happened to fall into it.
Was it expensive?
Yeah, like almost an entire month's rent check, but it was worth it.
Remember how they would always play Pink Floyd at the laser light show at the planetarium?
Yeah, but it was always from The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon.
So, those are like their best albums!
Yeah, but the rest of their catalogue is under-appreciated.
How so?
I think Animals would easily match up to those two.
It's tonally kinda trippy and definitely sets up the Wall, which was released like a year or two later.
Yeah, Pigs on the Wing is definitely on the trippier end of the spectrum.
I actually still have the vinyl.
I don't think I ever did, I didn't into them until CDs existed.
