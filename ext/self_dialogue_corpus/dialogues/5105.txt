What do you think about the Dodgers this year?
I assume they'll be good. They have such a big payroll.
Yeah, but they're trying to spend less now.
It doesn't seem like it.
Well, a lot of their payroll is for players no longer with the team.
They do have some good young talent, right?
They have good young players at several positions.
Like who?
Corey Seager is a really good shortstop in his second year.
Who else?
Cody Bellinger is a power hitter that just came up.
How's he doing?
He's already hit a bunch of home runs in his first two weeks since being called up.
Where does he play?
He can play first base and left or right field.
Any young pitchers?
Yeah, Julio Urias is only 20 and he's really good.
Yeah, I heard about him.
They signed him when he was 16 so he already has a lot of experience in the system.
Ok, so the Dodgers will be good again, but can they win it all?
