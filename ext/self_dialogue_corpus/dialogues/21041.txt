Seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I saw 'Get Out'.
Oh, I heard a lot about that! Jordan Peele, right?
Yeah, he wrote and directed it.
Is it good?
I loved it. It's kind of weird but really original.
Is it scary?
Not scary so much as jumpy.
Oh cool, I like jumpy horror movies.
Yeah, and I saw it at the theater so everyone jumped at once.
That's awesome. I'm excited to watch Dunkirk.
Me too! Did Christopher Nolan direct it?
Yes, same guy who did Interstellar.
And The Dark Knight.
Yep! I love all of his films pretty much.
Have you seen Memento?
No, I know it's Christopher Nolan though.
That's my favorite of his.
I've heard it's kind of confusing?
Not if you pay attention - it's a complex storyline though.
