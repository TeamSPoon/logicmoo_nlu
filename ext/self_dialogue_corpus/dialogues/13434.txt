Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
I've seen the first 3.
The original 3 or the first 3 in the series.
What are you talking about?
The first 3 are actually number 4, 5, and 6 in the series.
What are 1, 2, and 3?
Those are the ones that were released in the 2000s.
Wait so the order of Star Wars goes 4,5,6,1,2, and 3?
Yeah according to George Lucas.
Thank god, Disney bought Star Wars.
