Have you seen a movie on Netflix called The Curve?
I do not believe so, who is in it?
Julianne Hough and only a few other people.
Why so little actors?
Well, it is based out in the country and a woman wrecks her car and there is a crazy man trying to kill her.
Wrecks her car? So is it a survival type of movie?
Yes somewhat, she does some crazy stuff to survive though.
I may have heard of it, isn't that the lady who is a dancer normally?
Yes, but she is not a bad actress actually . I really liked the movie.
Do you know if it is still on Netflix now?
It has to be, I just watched it again not too long ago.
For not having many people in it, does the movie keep your attention?
Oh absolutely, there are some great parts in it that make you saw WOW.
I like those type of movies that are based in the middle of nowhere.
Me too, it makes you think about what you would do in those situations as well.
I would like to star in movies like that, but I am not a actor.
I think those movies can teach you something if that were to ever happen in real life.
Oh I would imagine so, does this actress take some crazy steps to survive?
Let's just say she tries to cut off one of her own limbs.
Oh wow, you have my attention now. I am going to have to find it!
