Don't know about you, but I loved the new Killswitch Engage album.
Incarnate? Hey, same here!
What did you like most about it?
I really enjoyed the vocals. Jesse Leach is a great singer.
True. His screams are awesome, and his cleans are just beautiful.
I feel like this was shown perfectly on Embrace the Journey.
That song definitely had the strongest lyrics on the album. I cried at the end of it.
Not to mention Adam D's vocals. He's so underrated.
Agreed. Both as a vocalist and a guitar player.
And a songwriter. He's basically kept the band sounding as good as they have the whole time that they've been around.
I'm a big fan of the stuff he wrote for As Daylight Dies.
I don't care what anyone says, but that's Killswitch's best album, period.
I agree. Every time I listen to it, I can't help but remember how amazing Howard Jones was as a vocalist.
He was awesome. Jesse is great without a doubt, but Howard was just on a whole other level.
It's such a shame that he had to leave. His voice would have been great on the last two albums.
You know that he's still making music, right?
No way! With who?
His band is called Devil You Know. They sound very different from Killswitch, but they still sound great.
I'm about to look them up right now.
I have a feeling that you'll like them.
