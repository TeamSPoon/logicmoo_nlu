Have you heard of the Foo Fighters?
I think so! That's Dave Grohl's band, right?
You're correct. He is the lead singer.
I've heard a few songs. But I don't know many.
What have you heard by them?
I think I have only heard the songs called Hero & Learn To Fly
Those are early songs. They are good songs, but the band has released much more music.
Good to know. I'll have to look up some of the more recent tracks.
Best of You is a great song too. Make sure to check that one out.
Awesome, thank you. I'll listen to it today.
