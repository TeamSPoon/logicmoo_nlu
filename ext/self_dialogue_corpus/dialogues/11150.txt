Have you been to any good fashion shows recently?
I have. I was lucky enough to attend Louis Vuitton's show in Japan.
You mean the Louis Vuitton show in the Japanese mountains?
Yes. It was amazing.
Did you see anyone famous there?
I saw Michelle Williams. She looked absolutely fabulous.
What do you think of Louis Vuitton's latest stuff?
Very interesting. I'm not sure I would buy any of it myself.
Why not? I thought you loved Louis Vuitton.
The hemlines are getting shorter and shorter. That's not my style at all.
I've noticed you've been wearing more Gucci these days.
I know. I bought my Gucci handbag in London last year.
Beautiful handbag. How much did that cost you?
Literally thousands. But the bag will keep its value.
Would you ever sell it?
If I was to get a new one, perhaps.
But then don't you just love building a collection of bags?
Yes, although I don't have room for them all.
Can I borrow your new Gucci handbag sometime?
Of course, just let me know when you need it.
