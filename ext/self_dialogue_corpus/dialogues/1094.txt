I like the Philadelphia Eagles , don't you?
Sure do, I went to a couple of their games last year.
Where at?
Philly.
What do you ;think of Jordan Hicks?
He is a really good player.
I think so too.
Have you ever gone to any of their games??
Yes, several but many many years ago.
I bet the tickets were a lot cheaper then.
I guess but seemed like a lot even back then.
I love NFL football but ticket prices are insane.
Yea but you can actually see the game better from your couch.
You can but the excietment of going to the game is great!!
And the tailgating.
Definitely.
Have you ever seen the Cowboys play?
Only once against the Eagles
Who won?
The Cowboys.
