Which was your favorite Harry Potter film?
My favorite was the original, Sorceror's Stone.
I liked that for the most part it kept to the story line.
Sure it helped that it was the shortest book so that made it easier.
Yes, they didn't need to cut out too many parts.
That was one thing that bugged me about some of the other films, especially Deathly Hollows.
That film while it was long, did miss a lot of what was in the book.
That is one thing I cannot stand. I can't believe sometimes that authors would go along with scripts sometimes.
Yes you would think that Rowling would have objected to some changes.
Maybe yes and maybe no. She sure got enough money for it though.
