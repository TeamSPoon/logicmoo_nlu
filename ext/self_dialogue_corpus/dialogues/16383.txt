What do you think of Paulo Nutini?
Who is that?
He is the guy that sang the "New Shoes" song.
Oh, I heard that. Never knew who sung it.
He does not really have a lot of hits in the states, but his stuff is really good.
What kind of other stuff does he sing?
He sort of mixes pop, with folk, and blues, and singer songwriter.
So a really good mix of sounds.
Yes. His voice is haunting. Really, unbelievably beautiful .
I liked it in the shoes song. What is his best song?
Coming up Easy. It is deep, but has a great beat.
I think I heard that one, is that the one that in the video there is a Rabbit?
That's the one! It is really pretty. Know any other sort of not well known people that are good?
There is a guy called Xavier Rudd, from Australia.
What does he sing?
He has a lot, but he does a cover, of "No Woman, No cry".
There are alot of covers of that one.
There are. But his is the only one I know that has a didgeridoo.
In the Bob Marley song?
Yes, and he plays all his own music. It is something to see.
