What's your least favorite genre of movies? I know you love them, but you have to hate some, too.
I hate more than I like, you know that.
Yeah, you're a glass-half-empty kind of guy.
No, I'm a "drink what's in the glass and say 'that was stupid'" kind of guy.
So, your least favorite, or least favorites?
I can't stand biopics.
Why? I like some. The Aviator with Leonardo DiCaprio was great.
Because to be a biopic, it has to be based on a person.
Yeah, and?
"Based on" means they can change pretty much whatever they want. There's not a single biopic where the living person who it's about said "Yeah, that's right."
Why do you think they change it so much?
Well, they pay the family for the rights. Then, because all human stories are boring, they make stuff up to make it more entertaining.
Aren't there any you like?
Catch Me If You Can was pretty entertaining.
Yeah, Tom and Leo have great chemistry together.
Yours?
My favorite is Gandhi.
No, least favorite genre.
Haha, oops. Umm, probably Christian-based.
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. There's never any substance.
