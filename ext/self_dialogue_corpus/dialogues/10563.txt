So, I found this new genre of music..
New genre? what do you mean?
It's called vaporwave, It's like an internet subculture.
Internet subculture?
Yeah, like a trend that started on the internet.
So what kind of music is this?
It's kind of like oversampled 80's music, slowed down, with lots of sound effects and samples from movies and TV shows, but there's lots of subgenres that pull from many sources.
It sounds kind of interesting, but also weird.
it is weird, but it grew on me quickly, plus a lot of the samples are already catchy or popular songs from 20-40 years ago.
I guess I should check it out, sounds like it could be nostalgic in a weird way.
You definitely should, and nostalgia is one of the underlying themes of the music. Aesthetic memes and culture is all a visual element as well.
So it's like a musical meme?
Kind of, its such a multifaceted thing that it's not contained within a box.
Can you recommend some aesthetics or vaporwaves?
The first go to for everyone is the multiple performing names of this one girl. Blank banshee, macintosh plus, and vektroid.
Is there anything closer to mainstream?
I would suggest Pepsi Saint or Skylar Spence who are the same person.
Are there any free ways or easy ways to hear this?
I strongly suggest youtube over a music subscription as a lot of content contains copyrighted material and has not been signed or professionally produced.
well, thanks a lot for the impromptu music suggestions, shoot me a text later bro!
