hey, have you seen the list of imdb's top 100 movies?
oh yes, I have. Why? what about it?
nothing, it's just that I find certain movies in it to be surprising.
why? what do you find so surprising?
I mean there are certain movies which I personally found to be horrible are on that list!
I think that list represents which movies majority of people liked it, not which movie you liked.
Are you sure that that list is based on which movie majority of people liked? I thought that list is based on critics ratings.
well, but maybe they are combination of both.
yes, It makes sense that they would combine both majority and critics ratings.
By the way, which movie on that you list you found to be surprising?
I don't remember specific name but there has been many movies on that list that I personally found to be horrible.
well, can you name at least one of them?
okay, let me remember. by the way have you seen shawshank redemption?
of course! it's on rank 1 on that list.
you will be surprised to hear that I haven't watched it yet.
what? seriously? you haven't watched shawshank redemption? are you serious?
yes, I haven't watched it yet. Somehow I don't feel like watching it.
dude, what is wrong with you? that is one of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime!
okay, I will trust your suggestion and watch it, despite my feelings about that movie.
yes, you won't regret it, watch it today only!
