My boyfriend loves the NFL!
Just about everyone I know loves to watch football. Do you like it?
Yes, I like it more now that my boyfriend has explained the game to me.
What team does he like?
He likes the Dallas Cowboys best.
Is that your favorite team too?
Yes, for now it is because that is the team I have watched the most but I may choose another team at a later date.
I don't really watch football much because I don't have live television.
My boyfriend says that games on television are better than live games because they show the replay in slow motion.
I understand that but wouldn't a live game be really exciting?
I suppose so but it's so expensive I don't think I'd ever really go.
You could get tickets to a Cowboys game for your boyfriend for Christmas. He'd love that!
That's a good idea. He has all kinds of Cowboys memorabilia.
Like what?
A steering wheel cover and floor mats for his truck, shirts, and even a seat from the old stadium that his Dad bought him for his Birthday.
What in the world does he do with that?
Honestly it is just sitting in his closet collecting dust.
What a silly waste of money!
No, it means a lot to him that his Dad thought to buy him something he would like. They aren't close but he wishes they were.
Well I guess that is nice then, but I wouldn't want that old thing in my house!
