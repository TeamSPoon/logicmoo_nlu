What kind of movies do you like?
Almost anything but real gory horror movies!
Ugh, I can't stand gory movies either! My favorite would be romantic chick flicks.
Yep, mine too.
I also like any movie with Johnny Depp in it!
The first movie I ever saw with Johnny Depp in it, was "What's Eating Gilbert Grape".
Oh yes, I remember that movie, I've watched it about 20 times!
I liked him in "Cry Baby" and "Platoon".
Those were good. Do you like and certain Holiday movies?
"It's a Wonderful Life", is my all-time favorite.
Epic Classic, I agree. I like "Jingle All the Way", with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That was cute. For Halloween, I like "Hocus Pocus".
I loved "The Nightmare Before Christmas".
Jack Skellington rocks! I have several Jack Skellington statues and knick-knacks!
I liked the actual "Halloween" movie, but only the first one that came out.
Nope, don't care for that one, it fits into my gory category!
That's about the only horror movie where I watched the whole thing. What's your favorite comedy movie?
I liked "Meet the Parents".
That was funny. I liked "Borat!" It was so stupid that it was actually funny!
Never saw that movie, I have heard of it though.
