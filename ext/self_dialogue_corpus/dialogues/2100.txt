The AFC has a great Division this year
I agree. I like Marcus Peters and the Chiefs to do well.
I think Marshawn Lynch is going to carry the Oakland Raiders
The Seahawks certainly haven't been as good without Lynch
As much as I don't like Lynch I agree.
Why don't you like him?
He just seems too cocky
I mean. Aren't most NFL players?
True. I guess that's how you get to the NFL
I think Sean McVay is going to be an asset to the rams this year
I think so too.
I think the Panthers need to come up with a plan to help Cam Newton out more too
Yeah. He's talented but he needs work
He needs a team that can mentor him
His accuracy isn't that great
They should take some pressure off him with different strategies
I agree
We'll see how they do this year
Ron Rivera can make it happen I think
He is a great coach
