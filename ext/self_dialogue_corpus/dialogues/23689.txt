What did you think about Wonder Woman? Did you enjoy it?
It was okay. Certainly better than Batman v Superman.
Yeah, I agree, but it didn't live up to my expectations at all.
It's a DC movie. Your expectations were too high.
The storytelling was good and the acting was great, but I didn't care much for how they handled Ares.
How come?
I don't know. He wasn't a very interesting villain or much of an actually threat.
I think I see what you mean.
In the movie Ares is just a glorified arms dealer rather than a credible threat to the world.
How about the way she handled him though? She went all Super Saiyan.
Since when can she melt projectiles and summon beams of electrical death at will? No, I'm sorry. That was poorly executed.
Well, I thought it was cool.
It would have been better if Zeus struck her with a lightning bolt giving her Godly powers for a short time.
That sounds tight.
Then she could have went fist-to-fist against Ares and beat him into submission.
Now that sounds cool. Too bad they didn't go that route. It was still a good flick, though.
I guess so. I'm just being picky.
I think you've been spoiled by all those Marvel movies.
Then I probably shouldn't watch the next Avengers movie before Justice league.
I wouldn't go that far.
