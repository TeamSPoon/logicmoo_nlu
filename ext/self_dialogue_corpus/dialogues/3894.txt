What is your favorite thriller movie?
I would say Inception.
That's one of my favorites too!
What do you like about inception?
I like how it teases that there are several layers to reality.
Do you like its pacing?
Oh, yeah, it's very fast-paced. Feels like you're on the seat of your pants the whole time!
Do you like the time magnification aspect?
Yes, the fact that seconds take days in one dream makes it really fascinating.
It's a really cool take on dreams.
