I think the Browns are going to turn it around this year!
Really? You think so?
The  did really well in the draft.
Did they get some good picks?
Yes, the really strengthened their defense.
They for sure needed that!
They still need a quarterback though.
I agree, that has been their weakness.
They got a quarterback in the draft but he is not a premier player.
Well, maybe they could train him to be.
They probably wont win their division this year.
You never know!
It's been over a decade since they were in the playoffs.
Has it been that long?
Yes, but I feel like good things are on the horizon.
Maybe we should try and get some season tickets this year.
I think that would be a great idea!
I can't remember the last time I was at a game.
Tickets are not very affordable, but maybe we could see a few games.
Yes, season tickets might be out of our league.
