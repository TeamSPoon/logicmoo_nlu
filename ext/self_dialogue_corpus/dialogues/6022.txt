What is your favorite Disney movie?  Mine is The Lion King.
The Lion King is pretty good, but Mulan is by far the best.  It has the strongest protagonist.
No way, she's barely even a princess.
Exactly why I like Mulan so much.  Most girls watching aren't princesses.
Yeah, but Disney movies are often about escapism and fantasy for children.  Does Mulan provide that over, say, Cinderella?
How many female soldiers do you know that overcome prejudice to save the emperor of China?
Well, fair point, but Mulan's story still seems more grounded in reality.
It is!  And that's what is amazing about it.  It is so much more human than a story like The Lion King.
Now that might be going too far, The Lion King is largely the story of Hamlet, retold with talking animals.
Well, minus the talking ghosts.  Unless we count the Whoopi Goldberg's Hyena, since she was in Ghost!
