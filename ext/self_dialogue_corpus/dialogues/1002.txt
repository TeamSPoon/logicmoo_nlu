Aren't you a Packers fan?
Sure am!  Aren't you?
Of course not.  I despise them.
And why's that?
Because everyone I know seemingly is a Packers fan.
Sounds like my kind of people.
I'm just sick of people wearing green and yellow to work all the time.
We're an invested group of fans.
And don't get me started on those stupid cheeseheads.
You are not dissing the cheeseheads.
Oh, but I am dissing them.
It's the most original concept in the league!
You call wearing fake cheese on your head original?
Absolutely!  It's certainly recognizable.
If you never want to get a date ever again, you wear one.
You'd be surprised how many cute girls sport those things.
They are obviously crazy.  Probably just want to marry Aaron Rodgers.
Can't blame them, he is a successful guy.
I'm pretty sure he's married already.
If not, I might introduce my sister to him.  I could use some more money and season tickets in my life!
