What are some good new country songs you have heard?
I really like the new Kenny Chesney song. I forget what it is called.
Is it The Fighter?
No that is Keith Urban's duet with Carrie Underwood.
Oh, do you mean All the Pretty Girls?
Yes, that is the one. Have you heard it?
Yeah, it is pretty good. What album is it on?
I think it is on his Cosmic Hallelujah album.
Oh that's right. What other songs are on that album?
Setting the World on Fire is the only other song I know of on Cosmic Hallelujah.
Hemingway's Whiskey is my favorite Kenny Chesney album.
Oh, what songs are on that?
You and Tequila with Grace Potter and The Boys of Fall are the most well-known, I think.
Oh I think I have heard Boys of Fall. Is it the football song?
Yep! It's great. Have you listened to Brad Paisley's new album?
Not really. Have you?
A little bit. "Today" is a nice song.
I haven't heard that one. I've heard the song with Demi Lovato.
Oh, Without a Fight?
That is the one! I just heard it the other day.
