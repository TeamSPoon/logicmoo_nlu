Yo, remember when Johnny Gill joined New Edition?
Yeah. Why you ask?
I didn't know that they brought him in the group to be the new Ralph.
I know right. And Ralph asked him was he there to be the new Bobby Brown.
I'm listening to Can You Stand The Rain right now.
Johnny killed it on that track.
So did Ralph. Those two actually sound good together.
I love the video.
I like the new one that they got out.
Who?
New Edition. That one This One's For Me and You.
Oh yeah. That thing is the truth.
Have you seen the video?
Naw.
They all done growed up and all four of them got their ladies in the video with them. They chilling hard.
All growed up huh? You too funny.
I'm hoping to catch them on tour somewhere this summer.
I know right. They need to go ahead and make another album.
If it's tight like that N E Heartbreak album, they'll do numbers.
They gone do numbers anyway, just off of their name.
