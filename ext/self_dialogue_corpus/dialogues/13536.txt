What is your favorite, non jedi/sith character?
Hmm, I would have to say boba fett. He was a real badass.
Yeah, he was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy.
So, whats your favorite then?
Mine would be R2D2. I love how all he can do is make noises. I think he is just funny.
Haha, interesting. He plays a big role in helping jedi very much.
Yeah he really does, and I feel like a lot of it goes unappreciated.
He was definitely the best droid in the entire series, that's for sure.
Yeah, I liked him a lot more than C-3PO because C-3PO talked way too much.
Haha, he did, and to make it worse he was always insulting R2D2 and making him look bad.
