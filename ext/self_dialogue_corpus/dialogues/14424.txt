I tell you the Wizards really disappointed me this year.
Why do you say that?
I just feel like they didn't live up to their potential all of the way
I hear you, but I just feel like they went as far as their talent could take them.
I disagree. To me they had a better team than the Celtics.
I don't know how you could say that when the Celtics had the better record
Yeah they did, but when you look at this roster, I felt they were more equipped for the postseason.
I don't know about that. The Wizards always seem to underachieve
Yeah they do, but that's my point. The talent is there for this team to be better.
Maybe this is just who they are. I mean John Wall and Bradley Beal are a great backcourt, but something is missing.
You mean as it relates to their chemistry?
Yeah. Like this whole team and organization just seem to be lacking something.
I think that something maybe heart.
You are probably right. They just can't seem to get out of their own way sometimes.
I know watching this team can be frustrating at times
You keep expecting more, but again this is who they are.
I think if they can add a few pieces they can be a legitimate title contender.
Again I disagree. I don't know if John Wall is the leader that gets you there.
I love Wall! I just think he needs a couple more guys that fit into their system.
I think he is fool's gold. I'm going to say that Wall never wins a championship.
