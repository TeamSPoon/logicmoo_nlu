OK, favorite Smashing Pumpkins album.
Oh definitely Siamese Dream. How about you?
Well, it always comes with a caveat, but Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
Really? That second disc though...
Yeah, well, that's the caveat. Taking it from the first side only, it's a fantastic, epic alternative album that sums up the 90s.
I somehow know what you mean though. It felt like the albums Gish and Siamese Dream built toward that.
There's so many great songs and it's arranged so well as an album. Then the second disc...
...falls apart. I know. But it did have 1979.
Yeah, and it's one of the best songs on the album, buried on the second side.
I will say that's a song that I really think sums up my teen years in the 90s.
See, I'm talking you into it!
Well, no, I still say Siamese Dream is the best. Mellon Collie definitely has its strengths. But an album must be taken as a whole.
OK, I see you're point. But I stand by my decision.
Sure. But isn't it odd? Billy Corgan was such a perfectionist - how he didn't perfect this album is so surprised.
I heard he teed off on Jimmy Chamberlain and James Iha.
Oh, all the time. He was a nightmare to work with, it sounds like.
And Corgan has been pretty much insufferable since then.
Yeah, he's mad that he didn't win a Grammy. He never will now. His stuff sucks.
I guess he was a man for his time.
And what a time it was.
