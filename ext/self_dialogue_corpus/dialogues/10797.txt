Did you watch The Fate of the Furious?
Yea I did. I was really hoping there would be more racing.
Yea me too, they had some cool cars though.
Yea but they didn't focus on the cars at all.
True, but I still really enjoyed the plot
Really? The plot was terrible! There were so many holes in it.
Yea but the movie is supposed to be silly and over the top. You're being too critical.
Maybe you're right. It did have some cool fight scenes.
Yea, I would have loved to see The Rock and Jason Stathum finish that prison fight though.
Yea, me too! They stopped it too early.
