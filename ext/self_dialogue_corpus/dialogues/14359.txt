Do you see what the Warriors are doing?
Yea, they haven't lost in the playoffs.
Are they even gonna lose? This is amazing.
I doubt it. Look who they have.
Yea, but the Spurs are a team and they still can't come close.
Steph, Klay, Durant, and Draymond. Need I say more?
True, true, but nobody can win a game!
Yea, well those guys are games. You wanna go against them?
I sure dont, but Lebron does.
Yea, Lebron wont lose in 4 to them.
I agree too much pride. Can you take them down though.
Not by himself no.
It would take a great series by Kyrie.
More than that.
You're right. Guys off that bench would have to really show up.
Yea, they would have to do even more than show up and chip in.
I agree. They would have to be stars.
Yea. I dont know if they can do that.
Neither do I, but we will find out.
Yes we will. yes we will
