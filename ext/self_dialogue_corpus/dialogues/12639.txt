Do you like Return of the Jedi?
Yes
Did you know the title before it was called that?
No. What was it?
Revenge of the Jedi
Really?
Yes. They changed it a little bit before it was released.
That is a cool title.
I heard Han Solo was supposed to get killed in the third one too.
Wow. I wonder why they changed it.
