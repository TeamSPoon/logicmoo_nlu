Hey there, wanna catch the next Lakers game?
Yeah! When is it? I haven't been to a game in forever!
It's this Friday night against the Jazz.  I know how much you hate them.
Oh my gosh I'd love to go, but I have a football game that night, and won't be free until 10pm.
That sucks, I don't think you've been to Staples Center yet huh?
No! I've been dying to go now. The last Laker game I went to was at the Forum.
Damn that was a long time ago.  Are you serious that you haven't been to Staples Center yet?
No, that's why I'm so mad I can't go to the game.
That sucks, it's an amazing arena, with bars all over the place.
How is the parking and the prices of the concessions?
Parking is ok, but a bit expensive. They have lots of great concessions, but of course they're way overpriced.
Well, another reason why I'd rather enjoy the Laker game at home.  Cheap beer and no lines to the restroom.
Yeah, you're right.  So have you been able to follow the Lakers at all?
Well, I don't watch the games on TV like I used to, and I heard that Jeannie Buss is now the only owner.
Yeah, I know, who would've thought that she would be able to push out her brothers?
I know.  At least she'll keep Phil close by right?
Yeah her and Magic should be able to bring greatness back to LA
I certainly hope so, it's been too long since we had the Championship.
Yeah well if they make it you better go with me to the playoffs!
Well, if you have tickets then I'll be there with all my Laker gear!
