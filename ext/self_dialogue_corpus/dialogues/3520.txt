Have you ever seen The Exorcist?
You bet I have. Scared me so bad I had nightmares for weeks.
Did you watch it as a child or more recently?
Oh I saw it as a child, so I appreciate the horror of it now.
Yeah kids who see it for the first time today think it's cheesy.
Oh they have no idea the seriousness of the subject matter.
I agree. When Reagan turned her head all the way around... that was it for me.
That's one of the scariest scenes along with when she was levitating.
I felt so bad for the old priest Marin. He walked into that house knowing he was about to give his life.
I've seen the uncensored version with the spider walk down the stairs. That was absolutely terrifying.
