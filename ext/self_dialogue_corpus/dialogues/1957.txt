We only have two month left iuntil the season starts!!!
I can't wait. Pre-season is almost here too!!!
Do you want to go to a pre-season game?
No, the stars player never get that much time.
What do you think about the NY Giants?
I think Odell and Marshall are going to help Eli get big numbers.
Do you think they will make the play off?
Hell yell they going all the way.
they have a lot of issues in the past but they are getting better.
I think the giants have to deal with Dallas as the biggest threat in the NFC East
Yeah they got a good team, but I think they got lucky last year.
Dak was a beast
He was unknown so no one knew how to defend him
So you think this year he isn't going to be as good?
Oh yeah, not that teams got a good look at him, the defenses are going to stop him a lot more
what was the washingtion
Washington doesn't have a steady QB. Every year there is an issue
Yeah cousin is good but not a leader
That why he has gotten a long term contract
maybe he will after this year
