That's ok. in music transformation is just changing a given set of notes by a rule. A set rule
An example of which is an inverssion? which is what?
let's say you have made a set of note forming a harmony, let's say c, c#, g#.
Yes.
if I were to invert that, I woudl take the first c in c, c#, g# triad and make it an octave higher if I wanted an octave inversion.
Wait,. so there are more than on kind of inversions?
There are. but note this is atonal music now and the postulate is that the interval; preserving tranformation are allowed.
I am so confused
You can change the pitch of a note in the harmony, which is the inversion, but it still perserves the interval.
ok, go on. What's retrograde?
That's just playing the notes backwards.
Easy enough. And I guess a retrograde inversion is just an inversion done on notes being played backwards.
Yes.
Ok now what?
So you got the postulate 3?
I think so. Intervals in a row can be operatd on by interval preserving transformations. Yes I got that
Now the postulate 4 says, the row in the postualtes 3, may begin with any note on the chromatic scale, ie., it can be transposed into any of the 12 notes.
Whoosh again.
In pother words, let's say you have a row, and now you want to start a new row, then you can transform it and then start the new row with any note you would like
As long as no single note is repeated.
