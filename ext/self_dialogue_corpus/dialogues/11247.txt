Did you see the fashion at the 2017 MTV Movie Awards? What did you think?
I did! I thought Zendaya and Hailee Steinfield looked beautiful.
They were both named best dressed!
I didn't know that. That's awesome. I didn't like Noah Cyrus' outfit. Too baggy and too black.
I agree. She looked like she was in her pajamas. Didn't seem appropriate.
Katherine Langford from "13 Reasons Why" looked beautiful in the red dress she was wearing.
She did. I thought the entire cast of "13 reasons why" looked great. Almost like they blended well together.
Did you see Kendall Jenner's outfit? What did you think?
I did. I thought it was a mess. I didn't like the strings that were all over her legs. Looked cheap to me.
Agreed. She's so beautiful, she could've worn something more tasteful.
Rebel Wilson looked great at the MTV Movie Awards. She looks like she's lost weight, too.
I thought she looked like she lost weight, too. I didn't care for her dress though. It was cut weird around her arm.
I hated Emma Watson's outfit. I thought she looked like a gladiator. It was weird to me.
Yes, the sequins were way too much. I didn't get that look at all.
Amber Rose looked hot in the red dress. That color looked awesome on her.
She did look good, but her chest is too big. It looked like it was popping out of the dress.
Farrah Abraham from "Teen Mom" looked like a disaster. She is a trainwreck.
I completely agree! She looked like she was ready to pop out of a bottle and grant wishes. Yuck.
Zac Efron looked very handsome. His outfit reminded me of a 50s type style.
I didn't think I would like all the white on him, but you're right, it did look nice!
