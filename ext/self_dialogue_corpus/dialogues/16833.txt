Hey, are you interested in seeing Pearl Jam when they tour?
I would be interested, I have always wanted to seee them.
Yea, I really liked their early stuff but lately not as much.
I hear ya, some of the first albums were the best.
Yea, I loved Yellow Leadbetter and Betterman.
Jeremy was the song that I used to always jam to.
No kidding, I loved Jeremy too.
Yea, and I think that was the last music video they ever did.
I think they got a lot of negative publicity from it.
Yea, with the shooting and stuff, they just didn't want to do videos after that.
I know, but can you really blame them?
No, that wasn't their intention but sometimes stuff like that happens.
Agreed, well if I look online it looks like they are coming here in September.
Oh my god, that would be so awesome, how much are tickets?
Well they range from $50-$100 depending on how good of seats we want.
Well I am willing to splerge on some good ones since I have never seen them.
Ok, should we see if anyone else wants to go?
I can call and ask Mark, he used to love them too.
Ok, call Mark and find out and then I will order them.
Sounds great, thanks for the great idea.
