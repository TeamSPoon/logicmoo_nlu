Who was your favorite character in The Force Awakens?
General Hux!
Wait, who's that?
He's the red-haired general who's in charge of the Nights of Ren. He runs the Starkiller Base.
Oh, the shouty one who acts like a dictator.
Yeah, he gets pretty angry, but he has a really interesting backstory.
Oh, okay! Honestly, I was really excited to see Finn!
Finn is so fantastic! Honestly, he will make the whole series so much more emotional.
How come?
Since we can love a character who used to be a Stormtrooper, we can see that every Stormtrooper has the potential to be a person that we care about. So it's hard to see them get shot down, even if they have to be.
