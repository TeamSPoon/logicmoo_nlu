Did you see Moana, yet?
I did! It's a great movie.
I agree. I thought the animation was phenomenal.
You're right. The animation was really well done.
The music was great, too.
Did you know Lin Manuel Miranda wrote the music?
I didn't know that, but it makes sense.
Also, did you know most of the cast is of Polynesian descent?
Yeah, like Dwayne Johnson.
I'm glad Disney embraced that.
