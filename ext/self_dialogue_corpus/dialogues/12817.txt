In a fight between all of the Jedi and Sith, who do you think would win?
Like, Sith or Jedi, or an individual person?
Individual person.
Hmm. Well. Maybe Yoda? I don't think we ever really saw him lose a fight.
See, my money's on the Emperor.
The Emperor? Really?
Yeah. He only lost because of a surprise attack.
But only Vader was capable of making an attack like that.
You may have something there.
I still think it's Yoda all the way.
