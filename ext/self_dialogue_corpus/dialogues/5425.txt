have you seen the movie Hook with Robin Williams?
Yes, I did not care for it. I would like  to know peter pan as the kid who never grew up
same here, I did not like how useless they made him as an adult
I thought it was neat that the grandmother was Wendy though
I know, it was sad to see how she had grown up and gotten old
I always wondered if I would have stayed in Neverland so I could stay young
do you think we may think more about that as ADULTS?
YES, PROBABLY because we would like to be young again
this movie did show a human side to captain hook though which was nice in some ways
it was , I liked the part where the boys imagined all of that food, I wish I could do that !
