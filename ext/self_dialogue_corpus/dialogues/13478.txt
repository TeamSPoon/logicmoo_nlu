What was your favorite Darth Vader moment?
I would say at the end of Rogue One when he decimated all those rebels.
Yes, that was an end to the rebel scum haha.
Also basically the whole movie of Empire Strikes back.
Agreed, the way he fought Luke, and choked out all the admirals that failed him.
I also liked when he first became Vader, and killed all the Padiwans at the temple.
Yeah, it was harsh but marked a moment where truly Anikan Skywalker was dead and Darth Vader had begun.
It was also impressive the way he was able to read Luke's mind in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, dark side to perfection.
I guess we both know the true power of the dark side.
