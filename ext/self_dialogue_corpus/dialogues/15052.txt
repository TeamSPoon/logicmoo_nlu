Hey, do you like comedy movies?
Of course!
Have you ever seen Spaceballs?
No, why?
Well it's an old movie but one of my favorite comedies.  It's a Mel Brooks movie.
Oh, I love Mel Brooks.  History of the World Part I was hilarious.
Yeah, he definitely makes great movies.  But Rick Moranis in Spaceballs was hysterical.
Well, if it's by Mel Brooks, it has to be good!
It's worth it, I promise!
I'll check it out.
