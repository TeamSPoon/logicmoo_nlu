I heard a cool ending for the Return of the Jedi that was never used.
What ending was that?
I guess George Lucas toyed with the idea of having Luke go to the dark side.
Really?  Interesting.
Yeah.  Darth Vader would die and Luke would put on his helmet.
That would have been straight nasty!
He would then say 'Now I am Vader' and assume the position.
That would have been an easy cliffhanger to move forward.
They scrapped it at the end as they wanted a happier ending.
Darn.  I love that kind of stuff!
