What are thoughts on ironman?
I think the movies have been great. I love robert downey jr. in this role as stark.
But do you see him as a true superhero?
yes of course, don't you? He is part machine pretty much, powers, moral ,compass.
I suppose that is all true. Fair enough I accept him as a full superhero status.
I liked that he started out a regular guy like many characters and transformed.
Is a billionaire ever a regular guy? I don't think so.
You know what I mean a regular human, not like superman but more like a peter parker.
I did like in the first iron man  movie seeing Tony stark grow as an individual and become less selfish and awful.
I think that is an important message in a lot of superhero films, there is good inside your heart.
