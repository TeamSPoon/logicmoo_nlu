Hey, do you remember Toy Story?
I love that movie! My favorite character is Woody! "Buzz, you're just a toy!"
I laughed so hard during the scene where all the toys confront Sid.
Yeah, that was pretty funny. Kinda spooks me out thinking about my own toys though.
Did you see Toy Story 3?
Yeah! I loved how it was based around Andy going to college, I could relate.
The Toy Story movies sure have followed us throughout our lives.
Lotso-Huggin bear was pretty conniving, but his story was sad. I could see why he was so cold-hearted.
Yeah, and the scene at the end of the movie where the toys get rescued by their fellow toys was incredibly heartwarming.
The whole Toy Story series was pretty much perfect.
