The movie the Rescuers was so scary in some parts !
I know, they needed to find the diamond but it was risky
That movie did scare me as a kid and it was sad
it was a sad movie, Disney ca be very serious sometimes
yes, a lot of talk about Orphans or people that had been cursed or kidnapped
I was so worried about the litte girl in this movie
That lady was so evil though, trying to take the diamond
In the end it all worked out for them though
That is true, it has been so many years since I have seen that movie
I know, I think I was 8 years old when I first saw it on VHS
