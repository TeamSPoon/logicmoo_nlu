I wish Disney would make more movies like The Prince Of Persia.
I loved that movie too, but there was a ton of controversy surrounding it.
I don't remember any of it.  I just remember that it stayed pretty true to the video game that it was based off of.
I never played the video game but it sounds pretty fun.
What was so controversial about the movie?
I think it was the casting of the characters..
I thought Jake Ghellenhal was amazing.
I think the problem was that he was not persian and the movie took place in Persia.
I guess I can understand that.  But I still loved it.
I love any type of movie that is a period piece, even if it isn't historically accurate.
I love any movie that has a romance, especially one where they couple starts out hating eachother.
That does make for a more romantic ending.  Although this movie ended a little different.
I also love a good time travel movie.  This one had a little bit of that going on.
It also had Ben Kingsley in it and he is great in everything he does.
Did you know that it is in the Guiness Book of World Records.
What did it set a record for?
It was the most expensive movie made based off of a video game.
It was nominated for several other awards too.
I think I heard that it was nominated for stunts.
It was nominated but didn't.  I think Gemma was nominated for a few things too.
