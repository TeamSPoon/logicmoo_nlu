I can't stop listening to the song "Die Young" by Sylvan Esso! Have you heard it?
I actually have! I was a very big fan of Mountain Man, Amelia Meath's original bluegrass project.
She has such a different sound with Sylvan Esso.
But somehow it still works.
As electronica.
Nick Sanborn's solo-stuff as Made of Oak is interesting, but...
They're best when they're together.
My thoughts exactly.
Did you catch Sylvan Esso on Jimmy Fallon?
When was that again?
End of last year, I think. December?
Ah yes! They did their song, "Radio," right?
Yes, they did! They got a lot of exposure through that performance.
And they are on this tour this summer, right?
Yep! I actually am going to see them in Washington D.C. this weekend!
We should go together! Want a concert buddy?
Sure! I would love to go. They'll also be in Brooklyn in July.
Why not see them twice?
Sounds good to me!
I'll get tickets.
