Have you ever seen star wars?
The new ones, you mean?
No, I mean the real star wars, the ones from back in the day.
Oh, so like Return of the Jedi and stuff?
Yea, those ones, have you seen them?
No, they look really cheesy.
Of course, they are cheesy, they are 30 years old.
Well, that's why I haven't seen them.
You're missing out, the characters were much cooler back then.
If you say so.
