You like the NFL right?
I watch it every year.
Whose your favorite player?
My favorite player has been retired awhile.
Who is it?
Ray Lewis.
He was such a good Middle Linebacker.
The all time best.
That's questionable but he was very good.
He was feared and carried that team in skill and spirit.
He was a beacon of light for the Ravens defense.
Who do you like?
Someone who is also retired.
Who would that be?
Brian Urlacher.
Didn't he play Middle Linebacker for the bears the same time era Ray Lewis played?
That's correct.
That's a man who was the reason the bears defense was any good at all.
He truly carried that team at that point.
He was a good player.
