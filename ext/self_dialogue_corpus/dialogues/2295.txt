What do you think the NFL needs to change?
I think they really need to work on their television production.
What do you mean?
They need to get rid of the 1000 commercials in a game.
It does make the games too long.
It's a commercial break after everything now.
What would you change from a rules perspective about the NFL?
I don't really know.  The rules of the game aren't bad right now.
Do you think they should call roughing the passer less?
I think you should be able to hit the quarterback without getting a penalty everytime.
Seems like if you touch Tom Brady that's a penalty.
I agree but if you kill someone like Jay Cutler isn't no penalty.
Well the NFL has protect their golden boy Brady.
I get protecting the quarterback but it really affects the game unfairly.
I wish the rules were like in the 70s.
Oh you mean where you could basically kill someone?
It was a mans game back then.
Yeah but there were a lot more injuries.
Hey it's football not ballet.
I think the NFL has done a pretty good job of adjusting the rules.
