Do you recommend a good actress to watch in a movie?
Of course, there are many, but personally I like Meryl Streep very much.
Really? Which movies has she been in?
Ricki and the Flash, Into the Woods, It´s Complicated, Julie & Julia, Doubt, Mamma Mia!, The Devil Wears Prada, The Hours, The House of Spirits, Sophie´s Choice.
Wow, she does have a lot. What do you think about Julie & Julia?
I really liked it. It´s about the life of Julia Child and how a modern girl tried to do every recipe in Julia´s book for 1 year and blogged about it.
Wow that´s nice, was it inspired in a novel?
No, it´s inspired in real life events.
Who else was in the movie?
Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci, Chris Messina, Jany Lynch, etc.
Oh wow! It has a good crew. I´ll put in on my cue. What about the movie It´s Complicated?
Oh definitely a must see! It has great actors like Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, John Krasinski.
Oh wow!, what is it about?
Basically Meryl Steep is divorced of Alec Baldwin (in the movie) and he has a younger wife and they start having an affair, but she does´t feel bad because it´s her ex-husband.
Oh, the story sounds like it get very tricky.
It does! In the movie she says she feels like now she is the other woman, and it features the dilemma of dating your ex.
Definitely good material. Which other would you reccomend?
If you like musicals you must watch Mamma Mia!
Really? She sings and everything?. I do like musicals!
Good! Because you will love it! It has a great story, romantic, joyful, the scenery is beautiful and the songs are great!
