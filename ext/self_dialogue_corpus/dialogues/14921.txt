Do you enjoy romantic comedies?
Yes, I do, especially ones with Steve Carell.
I like him a lot, have you seen Dan in Real Life?  That's one of my favorites.
Yes, that's a good one.  I like The 40 Year Old Virgin.
That's a good one too.  What about Crazy Stupid Love?
I saw that one but it wasn't one of my favorites.
Yeah, I agree.  What other Steve Carell comedies do you like?
He was pretty good in Anchorman.
That's a classic, I love that one.
Yeah, me too.  He's such a funny guy.
