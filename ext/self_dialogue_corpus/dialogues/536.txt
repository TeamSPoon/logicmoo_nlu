Still the winningest team in superbowl history is the steelers.
And with Big Ben under center, they still have more chances to add to their total.
Yep. Big ben was the youngest QB ever to win the superbowl
Yes, but he's 35 now.
That's plenty young enough to at least a couple of more superbowls.
Maybe.
it would be so awesome to see. if Steelers go to superbowl two more time, they're aty even ten appearances.
Patriots need just one more.
Yes, but Steelers have higher percentage wins. 8 total, and 6 wins out of that 8
Cowboys are at 8 also, but only won 5
There are 3 teams who went to the superbowl 8 times.
Yep. Broncos being the third one. Only won 3 out of those 8 though.
These percentages are meaningless. Ravens won all their superbowls, but they've only went twice.
it's funny how there are still teams that never even went to the superbowl, like ever.
Haha, yes. Browns, Lions, Teans, and Jaguars.
How do these team stay in business?
It's a local loyalties from the fans.
My teasm, my city type of thing?
Yes, of course. So what if they always lose, it's your team nonetheless
That's the thing about loyal fans, They never let you down.
