I just watched some of the old Star Wars films, ever seen them?
You know I have, which was your favorite?
I thought the first one, well A new Hope was best.
That one really showed a lot of heart, a coming of age.
I like the way Luke went from this more or less farm boy, to something much more.
Something powerful, a real force, actually the force.
I liked the way the showed his family too, his aunt and uncle.
Until they were killed by the bad guys.
Yes, but it was a good glimpse into how he was raised and what he went on to be.
Such a change for a kid from a sand planet.
