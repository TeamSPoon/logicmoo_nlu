How are the Rolling Stones still around?
I think that they all did enough drugs to surpass death.
Thats not humanly possible.
I was speaking in obvious exaggerative tones.
I think they were an alright band.
Most people love them.
I am just not a huge fan of their style.
Mick Jagger has gotten annoying.
And Keith Richards too.
He sorts of just hangs out anymore.
At what point do they retire
I think they kinda already are
Have they made any new music?
I dont think so
Its crazy to see them still alive though.
They are no Ramones
Thats a band that has had so many morphs
Yeah I dont know what or who is original.
Some musicians dont know when to hang it up
It really is a shame
