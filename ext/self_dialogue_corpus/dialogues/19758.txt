What's some of the strangest music you've heard?
A lot of alternative stuff is really strange.
Oh, really? Like what?
Well, alternative covers a lot of different kinds of music.
I've noticed.
Failure does a lot of good alternative stuff.
Failure, that's an odd name.
Yeah I'm not sure why they're called that.
What do they sound like?
Kind of like regular alternative stuff.
That's not very specific.
Well, I mean they have rock guitar stuff and ambient sounds.
Oh, I see what you meant.
Yeah like regular alternative music, like pink floyd?
I guess they could be counted as alternative.
Sure, why not?
There's just not a lot of stuff that sounds the same in the alternative genre, you know?
I guess that's true. Then again, it depends on who you listen to.
That's true, I'm sure everyone has their own list of alternative music bands.
Yeah, Failure is definitely one of the better ones for me anyways.
