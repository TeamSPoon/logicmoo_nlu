What do you think about Nicki Minaj?
I'm not really a fan, but she is talented.
Do you think she is a good role model?
Definately not!  I mean, listen to her music.
She is a great artist though, and could show girls they could be want they want.
She has said herself in interviews that she should not be a role model.
Oh, really?
Yeah.  I respect her for at least acknowledging that.
She doesn't even want to be a role model?
It doesn't seem like it.
