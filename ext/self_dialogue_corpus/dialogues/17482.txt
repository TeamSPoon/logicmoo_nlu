Aretha Franklin was supposed to sing at a concert this weekemd, and she had to cancel.
What happened?
The concert hall said she was unable to travel due to doctor's orders.
She is getting pretty old, she's what, in her mid seventies?
75. And she has had a lot of health problems over the last several years.
Maybe it's time for her to retire and take it easy.
I think so. My mom is turning 77 next month, and I'm always telling her she needs to slow down and not do so much. But she says she wants to keep active while she can.
I'm sure it's the same for Aretha. She probably really enjoys singing and wants to keep doing it before she becomes homebound.
The concert hall is hedging its bets on Aretha to keep going.
What do you mean?
The concert was The Toronto Jazz Festival at the Sony Centre For The Performing Arts. They have her scheduled to perform next June at the Jazz festival again.
Well, there's nothing wrong with hoping.
They're asking the ticketholders if they want to hope too- they said ticketholders can get a refund or use their tickets for next year's concert.
Um, I think I'd get a refund.
If I was just going to see Aretha, I would too. But if someone is a jazz fan that goes every year and doesn't care as much who is there, then I guess I could see holding onto the ticket.
Well, I guess it's one way to hedge your bets in case she does appear if you have good seats or something.
The article said she's been performing for 56 years straight. So I'm sure if she could, she probably would. But she has had a lot of health problems the last several years.
Yeah, everybody has to retire sooner or later.
She's had such a long, successful career, she shouldn't have any regrets about retiring and taking it easy.
I know, a lot of musicians would love to have just half the time and success she's had.
