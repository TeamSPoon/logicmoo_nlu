What's your favorite MLB team?
I'm a big fan of the Yankees.
Oh man, I don't really like them.
Why not? What team do you like?
I'm a Giants fan for sure. Does that makes us rivals?
I guess, but I don't want to be enemies just because of our teams.
Who is your favorite player?
I really like Derek Jeter back in the day.
Oh, well I mean like in general. In the MLB today.
Oh, I like Madison Bumgarner
Oh no way, he's on the Giants!
Oh he is? I guess I kind of like your team then!
Have you ever been to the Giants stadium?
Nope, have you been the the Yankee stadium?
Actually, I have. You should come visit San Francisco to see them play!
It seem pretty far. When would I go?
Maybe on opening day?
Okay, I'll try to make it there.
I'll save you a seat, we can see if we get good seats together!
Okay, I hope we can sit behind home plate!
