Hey! Have you ever seen any movies with Blake Lively in them?
I think so. She was in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies right?
Yeah! She played the soccer player.
Right! What other movies is she in?
She is in Elvis and Annabelle. Have you ever seen that?
No. What is that about?
It is about a pageant queen who has an eating disorder and dies. But she comes back to life in the morgue and hides from her life.
Wow. That sounds good. Does Blake Lively play the pageant queen?
Yeah. She does. It is a film festival movie. Not many people have heard of it.
Oh that is really cool. It sounds like a really good movie.
It is a good one. You should rent it sometime.
Is she in anything else I should watch?
Have you ever heard of the movie The Age of Adaline?
No I haven't. What is that one about?
It is a fairly new movie, from 2015. It is about a woman who stops aging while she is in her 20's.
Wow. How did that happen to her?
She got in a car accident and something happened to her to make her stop aging.
Wow that movie sounds really good. Who else is in it?
Harrison Ford is in the movie.
Wow what a great cast!
