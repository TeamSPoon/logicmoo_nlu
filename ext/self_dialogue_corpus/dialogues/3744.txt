I just finished watching a really good thriller by Hitchcock!
Oh, what was it, and who were the actors?
It's called "Rear Window", and it stars Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr! I was literally "spellbound" by this one!
Oh, stop with the Hitchcock puns! Should I watch it? I do so love Jimmy Stewart.
Yes, the plot is pretty thick on this one. Jimmy Stewart is a retired photographer who has broken his leg, and is stuck in his apartment.
What? It all takes place in one location?
Yes, but he can see out of his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex. He thinks he sees the guy across the way killing and disposing of his invalid wife!
So how do Grace Kelly come into this? I mean sure, she's beautiful to look at...
She helps Jimmy Stewart's character outwit Raymond Burr's villian by sneaking into his apartment and spying on him. It's really suspenseful when she get trapped in Burr's apartment and he come home to find her there!
Well, anything that has Princess Grace in it is something I'd be glad to take a look at. And Hitchcock, well, say no more!
