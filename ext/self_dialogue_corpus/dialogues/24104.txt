Hey, have you seen the movie Crash?
Oh yeah, that is a great movie!  I think it won some awards, didn't it?
Yes, it won three Oscars.  It came out in 2004.
Wow, that's impressive!  It was really deep.
I know.  It had some great lessons to it for sure.
Which were your favorite characters?
Oh, that's a tough call.  I really disliked Sandra Bullock's character.
Yeah, she was not very likable.  But there were some redeeming parts towards the end.
Yes, true.  But overall I didn't like her.
Yeah, and I definitely the cop.
Which one?
The one played by Matt Dillon.  He and his dad were both horrible.
Yeah, but it was also redeeming when he rescued the lady from the car didn't you think?
Yeah, that's true.  There were definitely a lot of valuable lessons in that movie.
I know.  That was one of the best parts of it.
It depicted people as so human, don't you think?
Yeah, you really saw the good and the bad of people in that movie.
I know.  I think that's what made it so likable and great.
Yeah, probably so.  I could watch it again and learn something new every time.
Yeah, me too.  I actually own a copy of it.
