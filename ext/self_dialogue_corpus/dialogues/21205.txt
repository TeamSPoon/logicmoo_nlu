What do you think is Ellen Page's best performance?
Oh, easy. Hard Candy.
Really? Out of all the movies she's been in, that's your choice?
Yeah, even though she was young at the time, she gave an amazing performance.
Alright. Personally I think her best role was in Super.
That's a good choice, and a great movie.
It really is. It's so messed up, but I love it.
It really turns the superhero genre on its head.
Yeah, like, other movies have deconstructed super heroes before, but I think Super does it best.
I think the only thing that comes close is Kick-Ass, but I think Super is still better.
Oh, speaking of Kick-Ass, Hit Girl, Chloe Grace Moretz, is another actress who started young and put out some really great performances.
That's true. I might say Hit Girl was her best role.
I liked her in Dark Shadows.
I've never seen it. I've been meaning to watch Let Me In forever, too.
I forgot she was in that.
Yeah, she's been in a lot of movies.
I think she's actually in three movies this year.
Wow, she must keep busy.
Making movies keeps people busy.
Maybe so, but it keeps us entertained.
