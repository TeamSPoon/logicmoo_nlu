We were watching a great movie last night and I can't remember the name.
What was it about?
It took place in the midevil times but had cross references with modern music and funny sayings.
Who was in it?
Heath Ledger was the main character.
Was anyone else good in it?
There was but I don't know there names. He pretended to be a knight so he could win money in Jousts.
That was called A Knights Tale.
That's it. You're right. I liked it.
It was a funny movie. I liked the guy who used to introduce him in the jousts.
Yes, that blonde actor.
Yeah. I think he was also in that movie The Replacements.
Wish I could remember his name.
I liked that they played more modern music in it too.
The bad guy in the movie , I don't know his name, seems to be bad in every movie he is in.
I know who you are talking about. Yes, he is always cast as a bad guy.
They could have made a second one. It would've been good. Those characters all went together well.
Yes, even the girl who was the blacksmith.
I wonder if she was ever in any other movies.
Yes, she was. Not many popular ones.
