One of my favorite thriller movies was Silence Of the Lambs.
Wow,that was so scary.
I've watched that about ten times.
It's definitely a classic.
Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as Hannibal Lector.
He was great and so was Jodie Foster.
Her character was Clarice,right?
Yes,she was an FBI student.
He would talk to no one but her.
That's right and it was something about information on another case.
Yes,they believed Lecter had some kind of knowledge of another case.
Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist who happened to be a violent psychopath.
It was a huge hit.
I believe it won the Oscar for best picture.
Yes it did.
When he ripped that guys face off and put it on himself to escape was gory.
I get goosebumps thinking of it.
One of the creepiest movies ever.
Scott Glen was in it too.
Yes he played Jack Crawford of the FBI.
