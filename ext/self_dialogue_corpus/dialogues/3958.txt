Anything good on tonight?
Yeah, I'm watching Hush. It's a thriller about a deaf woman who lives in the woods and someone is stalking her.
Oh, my sister watched that the other night! She loved it.
You should watch it! I don't usually recommend movies, especially thrillers, but it's so unique and well done.
Yeah it seems like it would be different from anything done before.
There is a great scene near the beginning, I won't spoil it for you, but it's one of the most impacting and climactic scenes I've ever seen.
Ooh, you're keeping me in suspense, now I have to see it.
Please do. It puts you kind of in the shoes of the deaf woman by eliminating sound in certain parts which I thought was very interesting.
That is a very scary position to be in.
Yeah, but you kind of see how it helps her in the end. I won't say any more than that for fear of giving spoilers.
