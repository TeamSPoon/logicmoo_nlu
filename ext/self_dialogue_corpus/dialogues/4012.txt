Do you like foreign thriller movies?
I don't like asian horror movies. They're usually too gory.
Oh you're right.
I do like French ones though. Matryrs is great.
That's the goriest of them all!
Yeah but it has other stuff going on too

What did you think about that greek one?
Dogtooth? I loved it. So weird.
