So who do you think is the NFL team of the future?
Well either the Cowboys or the Texans.
Yeah, with Dak the Cowboys seem to have a good future.
The Texans have a good coaching system, and with Watson who knows how things will look a couple years from now.
Lets not forget they have a lights out defense.
Oh man yeah they do.
Would be nice if they could get set at Quarterback too.
Yeah, hold on to that defense for a few years and they will be a real threat.
Cowboys are already there.
Yeah, some people say Dak is the new Brady.
A lot like him, overlooked then lights out.
Lets just see if he can keep it up.
I think he can.  He looked pretty good out there this year.
Yeah he did.
What about Tampa Bay?
Yes!  Winston is pretty good and next year might be a sleeper.
Titans too.  Not too long ago these teams were trash.
Yeah, and then drafted franchise QB's.  But Tampa has made the bigger turn around.
Yeah, I think Winston is the better one.
I think one or both of those guys might make the playoffs next year.
