Was inside out a disney movie?
Yes but also pixar, you know they sometimes do them together.
Ah that makes sense. Felt a little different than regular disney animated films.
I too notice the pixar flair in the collaborations they do.
Maybe it is the actual annimation technique or drawings.
Well whatever it is I enjoy it.
Ya they seem to have a winning history. They did Up and Wall-e too.
They have done so many good ones.  Brave was also a joint effort I believe.
Brave was so good. Loved seeing a redhead for a change.
Ya, I liked that aspect too. Also just how strong minded she was as well.
