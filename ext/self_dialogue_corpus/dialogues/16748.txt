Would you want to go to the Blink 182 concert this weekend?
Maybe, do you know what songs they are going to be playing?
They are covering their classics like "All The Small Things" and "What's My Age Again?"
Sweet! I will go.
Cool, I have a few other friends going as well.
Okay, will you be driving?
Yes, you and everyone will ride with me.
That's cool, and what day will it be?
On July 5th
Okay, that's a Saturday right?
Yes it sure is.
Okay that will work for me then.
Cool, this will be my fourth time going to their concert.
Yea this will be my second time.
The last time I went was when I was 16 and just getting into rock music.
Yea I have always been a fan of Blink 182.
