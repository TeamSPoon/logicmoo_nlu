Toy Story has gone too far.
I know. I wish they had stopped after the second.
Right? And I hear they're doing another movie!
No way! Who's even asking for that? All the original toy story fans are old as heck now!
I know! I'm one of 'em
I guess I miss Slink. If he's in it, I won't complain too much
Yeah, but Andy's grown up. what's the point?
I just realized...we're andy. we're all grown up.
Oh my god. you're right.
andy represents the audience! Insane
