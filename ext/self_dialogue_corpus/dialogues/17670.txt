So I just got this new Alice in Chains album and I'm actually quite impressed.
Did you think it was going to be bad?
No, I just thought that with the absence of their original singer the music would sound different.
Like what happened with AC/DC?
Exactly.  Alice in Chains basically sounds the same as they did before though.
I guess they chose their new singer very carefully then.
Actually, I think its because the chorus style of singing they use.
That's right, they usually had two people singing at once.
And one of those two people is still in the band, so I guess his voice in the chorus makes it sound just like it used to.
That's great.  What's the name of the album?
It's called The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.
I haven't heard of that one.
They also have another album with the new singer called Black Gives Way to Blue.
They've been busy haven't they?
They definitely have.
Maybe the fact that their new music sounds so similar created a lot of desire for it.
I think it did.  At least, I'm impressed by it as I said.
What's the name of their new singer?
His name is William DuVall.
Haven't heard of him.  He must be new to the scene.
