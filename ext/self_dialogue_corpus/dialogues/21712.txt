Have you seen the latest Alien movie?
You mean Alien: Covenant? Haven't seen it yet, have you?
No, I want to, maybe this weekend. I hear it's quite good.
It's got to be better than Prometheus, am I right? Wow that movie sucked.
It was amazingly bad. Like, they spent so much money on special effects, you'd think they could pay a good writer to write a great script.
For sure. Although, I have to say it was kind of hilariously bad. After a while I was enjoying it just to kind of point and laugh.
Ha, I see what you mean. Still, it was so illogical it really bugged me.
Yeah, well, I just try to roll with it. The first three movies in the alien series were all quite good, though.
Yes, especially the first two in my opinion. But each one was quite different.
The first one even passed the Bechdel test.
That should not be a remarkable achievement!
Yeah, have two women with names talk to each other about something other than a man. Not difficult.
And yet, a comparatively rare achievement.
I really liked the Alien movie where Ripley was acting sort of autistic. What was that called?
Oh yeah, Ripley 8 was the character's name. Hmm, I think that was Alien: Resurrection.
Loved it! Didn't Sigourney Weaver play an autistic character in another movie?
Yes, Snow Cake. I really liked that too, although very different from the Alien movies.
True, she didn't kick as much butt in that movie. But wow, what an actress.
Agreed! The world needs more Sigourney Weaver.
She really should be in all the movies!
