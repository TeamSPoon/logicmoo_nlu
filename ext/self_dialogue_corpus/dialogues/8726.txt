Do you prefer the old ACDC songs?
Yes. Highway to Hell and TNT
What about Thunderstruck and Shoot to Thrill?
Those are great songs too.
I like all of their stuff.
I wish I could see them live.
Me too. They are a great rock band
Are there any better?
Maybe Black Sabbath and Metallica
I think all three are spectacular.
