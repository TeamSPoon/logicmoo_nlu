Have you ever listened to any of Chris Crocker's  music?
You're talking about the guy that loved Britney Spears, right?
Yep, he's the one.
In that case, no I've never listened to any of his music. I didn't even know he made music.
I didn't know either until recently, but some of his songs are actually good.
Really? What genre are they?
They are like of mixture of electronic and pop music.
Do they remind you of Britney Spears' music?
A little bit, but nobody is as good as Britney.
Oh, I definitely agree.
I love her older music the best.
Me too. You Drive Me Crazy is one of my favorite songs of all time.
I love the cowbell in that song.
That's what makes it sound so good.
I agree. I really like her song Touch of My Hand.
I like how instrumental that song sounds.
Me too, and it's more serious than some of her other songs.
Oh definitely, but it's nice to listen to her more carefree songs, too.
Yeah, I like will.i.am's song Scream & Shout that she sang on.
That song is great.
