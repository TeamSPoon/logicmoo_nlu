What was the greatest Super Bowl of all time?
Easy, Super Bowl XX
Who played in that one?
Oh come on, Da Bears and the Pats!
Oh that's right. That was quite the Bears team.
One of the greatest teams of all time.
I wouldn't go that far.
Oh really, why not?
How many Super Bowls did they win?
Well, just that one, but they still had some characters.
Yeah, Jim McMahon was the biggest character of them all.
Man, that guy was crazy. Played like he didn't care about his body.
Yeah, the also had Sweetness.
Oh yeah, Walter Payton.
I think he was the greatest running back of all time.
Yes, many would agree.
Remember their coach at the time?
Of course, Mike Ditka.
Yeah, he was pure Chicago.
Actually he's from PA.
