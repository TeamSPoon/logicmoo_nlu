What do you think of Britney Spears?
I was a big fan of her back then, but it seems she is still doing very well these days.
Yea, she has a consistent Vegas show.
I know, I still have to go and check it out.
Definitely.  What about Zayn as a soloist on One Direction?
I think his solo album is doing pretty well.
I would have to agree, I think he is the most successful of the band.
Yea, his collaboration with Taylor in 'I Don't Wanna Live Forever' is pretty fantastic.
I know! I can't stop listening to it.
They really make a great combination.
Speaking of Taylor, what is your favorite song by her?
I really love 'Shake it off,' it's so fun and the lyrics are catchy.
Me too, she has alot of catchy songs.
What about you?
I like 'Blank Space' because it really speaks to me about past relationships.
That's a good one and the music video was epic.
I agree, she was great in that video. Her outfits were on point.
Loved her style in that video and the men were super hunks!
Haha, yes so true. I hope she comes out with a new album soon.
When she does, I'll be the first in line to buy it.
