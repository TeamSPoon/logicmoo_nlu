how is the new linkin park album?
it wasnt that bad
everyone hates it
they switched up their sound
they turned so pop out of nowhere
its weird because their last album was so heavy
and then they followed it up with their poppiest album
its very strange
i like the first song from the album though
what song was it?
nobody can save me
i like heavy and talking to myself
those songs are okay
heavy is so poppy
i wonder why they did that
its a weird title for a song like that
they sound like the chainsmokers
ew, thats a bad look
it really is
they are too late
