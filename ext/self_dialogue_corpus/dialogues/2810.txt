How do you think the New Orleans Saints are going to do this season?
I think they'll do okay since they picked up Adrian Peterson and some other new players.
I'm thinking they'll win 8 or 9 games this season but not more than that.
They made some improvements on offense, but they also lost some quality players at wide receiver.
That's true but I think a 8 or 9 game win season is very possible.What do you think?
I figure that they'll win 6  games this season...maybe 7 but that's about it.
Why are you thinking so few?
Well, they did do some improvements on offense, but they didn't do anything to improve their defense.
You do have a point as that could be a huge problem once again.
Yep, I have no idea why they chose not to improve the defense.
Me neither as they had chances in the draft to pick up some youth and free agency had some good players available.
I know, but for some reason they concentrated on offense again.
So true as the fact that their defense was weak really cost them last season.
Definitely as it doesn't do any good to lead the league in scoring if you are the worst in the league in points given up per game.
Sadly, it been that way for the last several years.
I have no idea what Sean Payton is thinking as if he doesn't coach the team better this year, he'll be fired.
I am thinking the same way as he has had plenty of time to get the team to improve.
I know, the last few years haven't been great and I think that he's just not coaching material anymore.
We'll have to see how this season goes.
Yep, if it goes poorly, he's going to be out of a coaching position.
