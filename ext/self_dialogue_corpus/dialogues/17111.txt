Ok, so who's your favorite group?
Probably Fort Minor.
I've never heard of them. What are they?
They're hip-hop. I never really liked hip-hop until them.
I do like it, so tell me about them?
It's put together by Mike Shinoda.
Who's he?
He's the "other singer" and keyboardist for Linkin Park.
They're not hip-hop though.
They're not but he is, so he got a bunch of people together do do Just hip-hop.
Oh, so it's a side project?
Yeah, but a good one. I first heard them on the radio and really liked the song but had no idea who it was.
What song did you hear?
Remember the Name. It's straight-up rap and introduces the guys on the album.
What did you like the most about it?
I really liked the rhythm of the words and the way the rhymes fell, but also the energy.
Yeah, hip-hop is really great at mixing up beats.
I was out running when I first heard it and I swear I got faster!
Ha! And this guy from Linkin Park is good at writing rhymes?
Seriously, yes. Give it a listen!
