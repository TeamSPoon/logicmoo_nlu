Was Darth Vader in the first Star Wars movie, or the second one?
He was in the original Star Wars.
What was his name in the movie?
Anakin Skywalker. You know , Lukes father.
Yeah, I know. Luke I am your father.
That line has been made fun of so many times.
Maybe because of the way he spoke in that mask.
True. Sounded like he had a breathing problem.
Was he in any more movies or just the first Star Wars?
I didn't see them all. I don't know.
