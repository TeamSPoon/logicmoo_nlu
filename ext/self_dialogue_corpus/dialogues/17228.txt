What are you planning on doing today?
Not a whole lot, I have a lot of house work to do.
I hate cleaning house, I can only get through it if I listen to music!
I am the same way, in fact I am getting my CD's out as we speak.
Cool, what do you think you will end up listening to?
I am thinking of going with Alanis Morissette!
I have not listened to her music in such a long time!
Me either, and I used to be a big fan of hers as well.
Which one of her songs do you enjoy the most?
Not sure about my favorite; I like so many of hers!
I always loved that song Ironic. I used to listen to it all the time!
Yea that is a great song actually! It never gets old when you listen to it.
Do you remember the name of the album that song was released on?
I think it was released on her album called Jagged Little Pill; which came out in 1995.
What other songs were on that album?
I remember You Oughta Know and Hand In My Pocket were on it.
That is right, what a great album that was!
It sure was, I can remember buying it when it first came out.
I also think You Learn was on it as well!
So many great songs on one CD, what a great artist she is!
