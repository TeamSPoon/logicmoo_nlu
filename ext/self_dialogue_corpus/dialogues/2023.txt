Are you ready for some football this year?
I'm more ready for NFL than any of the college teams.
Why is that?
I just prefer people who play professionally. They seem to have their ducks in a row.
Who is your favorite team?
The Steelers.
Me too. I really do think that they will need to have a team rebuild here pretty soon.
What makes you think that?
Well Ben Roethlisberger seems to be getting old along with a lot of the defensive line.
I guess you are right, the key players are about to retire soon.
They do have a few new guys like Antonio Brown who actually do a decent job though.
Do you think they will do better than what they did last season?
Well they went 11-5 which isn't bad but they could always improve.
They were first in their conference, weren't they?
They were, yes, but their other competitors kept them from going to the Super Bowl.
They have won six of them already though, you cannot say that they don't have the potential.
I would never doubt my team. This year should be vastly different for them.
I sure hope you are right.
A saying that I have kept to me since I have been to Pittsburgh, "Stairway to Seven"
I sure hope the seventh comes this season.
