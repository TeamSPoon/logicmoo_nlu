What do you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Oh, is that the live action remake?
Yeah, the one that stars Emma Watson.
I haven't had time to go see it yet. Was it any good?
Yeah I really liked it a lot.  It changed a few things from the original.
Was it weird to see it in live action?
No, it didn't take away at all. They can do such good things with CGI these days.
That's true, so the Chip and Mrs. Potts were still in it?
Yeah all of the animated furniture was still there, and still really funny.
Well, maybe I'll have to see it.  I think maybe it's already out on DVD now.
