What is the first movie you ever watched?
I barely remember going to see the original Rocky at a drive in with my parents.
Wow, that must be quite a memory. I've never been to a drive in.
It's a pretty cool experience. There are still a few in existence and I've always meant to find one to go to.
What about Rocky? How much of the movie did your remember?
I fell asleep that night during the movie. But I have seen it since, along with some of the others.
Which one was your favorite?
The first one was really good, the classic underdog story.
As I remember, some of them are pretty corny.
I don't remember Rocky II very well, but III and IV I did see. Rocky III I thought was pretty good.
Rocky III had Mr. T in it right? And Hulk Hogan?
Yes, it was a bit much but I still liked it. Even though Apollo Creed died in the ring.
Yes, what about Rocky IV, the one with the Russian?
I liked that one too, Rocky against the Russian Machine. The training montage was both epic and corny.
I think that's a hallmark of the Rocky movies. The training montage, the very earnest dialogue.
Rocky ripping down the Russian's picture, I laugh when I think about it.
Then there's Adrian. Her relationship with Rocky was what motivated him.
She was his inspiration, but some of the things they said to each other made me cringe.
Have you seen the more recent movies?
I've never seen Rocky V and probably won't. But I saw Rocky Balboa and liked it and I want to see Creed.
