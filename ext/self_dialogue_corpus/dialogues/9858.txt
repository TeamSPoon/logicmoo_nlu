How do you feel about the current state of hip hop?
I think it is horrible?
Why do you think it is horrible?
It's horrible because you don't have to be any good to get on the radio.
What do you mean?
DJs and radio stations are playing songs that are horrible just for views and listeners because it pays money.
I agree, but we have a few good rappers out today.
Yes, Kendrick Lamar and J-Cole are amazing.
They are and I like their songs as well.
Overall the state of hiphop is going down in my opinion.
