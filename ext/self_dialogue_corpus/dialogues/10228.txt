Did you see doctor strange yet?
I finally got around to watching it
weren't the space time bending effects insane?
yeah , that part where doctor strange has the cloak "come to him" was crazy
he got totally lucky in that scene as the bad guys had him outnumbered
what did you think of that time-loop sequence at the end
that was unreal. that was pretty creative way for strange to get the upper hand
I know , right. that was amazing!
I really hope they make a sequel soon
I have no doubt that they will
