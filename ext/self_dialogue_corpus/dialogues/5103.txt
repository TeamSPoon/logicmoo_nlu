Good morning.
Morning.
How are you.
Well and you.
Not bad, you like baseball.
I love baseball.
Is it your favorite sport.
Yeah baseball and football.
Same here.
Do you have a team?
I like the Mets.
They look good this year.
Yeah, but our pitcher was just in a sort of scandal?
Oh really?
Yeah Matt Harvey.
What happened?
He showed up to a game late because he was partying too hard.
Dang.
Yeah you'd think with all that money they paid him he would show up.
True.
