My husband and I watched "Maleficent" last night.
I have been wanting to see that movie, where did you go to see it?
It was on the television. My husband loves Angelina Jolie and all of her movies.
Was it any good? Did you like it?
Oh, yes it was so good. I don't know who did her make-up but it was great.
In the previews for the movie she looked like she had the best cheek bones.
Yeah, and she had these horns on her head and they looked so real.
She is one woman that always looks so beautiful even with horns.
She made you just fall in love with her character.
Really, I thought she played some sort of evil witch.
Well, as a young woman she had a pure heart, and when an invading army threatens her land she rises to protect it.
Did she have wings in that movie.
The king had cut off her wings and that is when her life took a turn for the worst.
I thought the story was based off of Sleeping Beauty.
Well it was, it just shows the story about Maleficent and how she feel in love with Princess Aurora.
Who played Princess Aurora?
Elle Fanning played her but Angelina's daughter had a short role and played her as a little girl.
Oh, how sweet. Does she look live Angelina?
No, I think she looks more like Brad but she did a really good job.
Well it sounds like you really liked the movie.
