I like older, classic Disney films. Do you?
Yes, I love the classics. Lady and the Tramp is a favorite of mine.
I loved that, too. Even though it was released in 1955, it's still one of the best in my opinion.
Jock is the cutest. He cracks me up the way he skips and buries his bones.
I like all the characters. I couldn't stand the mean Aunt that came to stay with the baby.
She was horrible, she was so mean to Lady.
I also got upset with the coach hit Trusty in the end. I was worried he wouldn't make it.
That was upsetting. He came through which is a good thing.
I love Peggy Lee was great as Peg the shelter dog. She had such a beautiful voice in the movie.
Did you know she also voiced the characters of Darling and the siamese cats?
