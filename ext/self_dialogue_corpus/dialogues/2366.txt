I am so excited for football this year.
Do you mean College or NFL?
NFL.
They are both fun to watch.
Yes but I prefer NFL.
What is your favorite team?
I like the Seahawks.
They are a good team.
I am a bit Russel Wilson fan.
He is a great player.
I like that he is a threat with his arms and his legs.
He must be one of the fastest QB's don't you think.
Yes, I think I have heard that.
He has been a great player since leaving Wisconsin.
He was good in College and has gotten even better now.
He seems to get along with Pete Carrol as well.
He does.
That is important for the QB and coach to get along.
Things don't work well if they don't.
No, it can be a bad situation.
