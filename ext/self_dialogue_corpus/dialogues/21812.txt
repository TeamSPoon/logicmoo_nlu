Did you catch La La Land?
Oh yeah, great movie.
Yeah, I wasn't into it at first. That first scene is ridiculous.
Ha, I thought it was great. Dancing in the middle of a LA traffic jam
Wasn't very realistic.
Well, it's a movie paying tribute to a musical. Of course it's not realistic.
I didn't like Ryan Gosling's singing.
A lot of people mentioned that. I think he's a great actor though.
True. I thought Emma Stone did a good job.
Yes, although some say she's overrated.
No way. She was the highlight of the movie.
I liked all the colors on the different sets.
Yes, felt like an old time movie.
I really liked the ending.
A lot of people didn't like it.
I liked how it didn't end all fairytale like.
Right, like a real world situation.
Yes, and in the end they both helped each other achieve their dreams.
That is true. Didn't need to end up together.
Just end up happy in life.
