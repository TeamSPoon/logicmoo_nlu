Hey Beth.
Hi Scott.
You ready for some football?
You know it!  How much longer?
I think it's like two months.
Yeah, you are right.  Early September.
Training camp stuff will start at the end of the month.
That's right.  I saw something about that on Facebook.  You going?
I was thinking of heading over to the Razor for one day to check stuff out.
Taking the kids?
You know it.  It's half the reason to enjoy it.  I like showing them around and teaching them the game.
Gonna eat at Toby Keith's grill?
Why not?  Patriot Place is a cool area with shops and stuff.
Yeah, I got this hat and tank top there, last year.
We went over at Christmas time and got a bunch of stuff for under the tree.  It was really pretty.
Oh I bet it was.  Mr Kraft does a really nice job with his businesses.
I think they are putting in a new hotel to have more people be able to stay on game nights.
That will be  a big plus.  I love to tailgate and hang out after the game.
Especially when we win!
HAHA.  You are totally right about that!
