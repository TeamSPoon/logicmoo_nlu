What is your favorite band?
Do you mean current band or a band that is no longer together?
It doesn't matter. What is it?
I'd have to say the Monkees!
The Monkees? I love them!
They're amazing and their music is so catchy.
Didn't other people write their songs?
I believe so. I think Carole King & Neil Diamond wrote a few.
What was their big hit?
You're thinking of the song "I'm A Believer"
I love that track!
Yes, me too. I loved the remake they did for Shrek.
I prefer the original.
I do too. But I was happy they brought the song back to life.
Do they have any other hits?
Yes, I think "Last Train to Clarksville" was a hit
What is that song about?
I assumed it was about a train. But many artists love to use metaphors.
Maybe it is about life and death and the passing of time.
That is possible. But it also might just be simple and about a train.
