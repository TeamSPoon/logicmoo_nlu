Hey, man, are you ready for some NFL?
I can hardly wait. When does training camp begin?
I'm not sure but soon. It's July, you know. Preseason'll start soon.
Who do you think's going to win the NFC South this year?
I like the Falcons again. What about you?
I can't decide, man. I want the Falcons to win, of course, but New Orleans is supposed to be much better this year.
Yeah, I heard that too. Drew Brees is tough.
He is, man. And he just seems to find a way to win if you give him the chance.
Yeah, I think last year was just an off year for the Saints.
I hope this year is too then. And I'm worried about Carolina.
What did they finish last year? Man, Super Bowl one year and wash outs the next.
Cam Newton is just so strong. He's like a pro playing with eighth graders sometimes.
I know. That arm is like a rocket. But he doesn't scramble like he used to.
I guess even Cam is taking some knocks that slow him down.
That's what they're complaining about, man. That the refs won't throw the flag on roughing.
I guess it isn't really fair. But Carolina definitely depends on him.
That's true. If Cam has a good year, Carolina will be tough to beat.
Like Brees and the Saints. When he's on and got a good team around him, I don't like to play him.
I hear you. But we'll see. What about Tampa Bay? They got anything?
Man, I haven't kept up with them at all but I think they drafted a pretty good QB maybe.
