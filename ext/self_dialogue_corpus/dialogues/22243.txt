Have you seen any good documentaries lately?
I've seen a few, actually, and there's a couple that are available on Netflix now that I'd like to see.
What have you seen recently that you liked?
Well, I just watched a new true crime documentary on HBO that was very interesting.
What was it called? What was it about?
It was called Mommy Dead and Dearest. It was about a girl whose boyfriend killed her mother and she was part of the plan to do it.
Oh yeah! I think I heard about that on a podcast I listen to. That movie sounds really intense.
It was pretty intense. It was interesting though, too. It made me feel bad for some of the girl's family, actually.
Yeah, I bet! That's the documentary about the girl whose mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, right?
Yeah, it was. That's what made the film even crazier, actually - just learning about how her mom had gotten away with everything she did.
Yeah. That's really sad but the documentary actually sounds really fascinating.
It was. Obviously it wasn't a lighthearted movie to watch, but my girlfriend and I watched it and we were both totally absorbed.
Well, I'm definitely going to watch it now.
You definitely should! Especially if you like true crime stuff.
I do. I'm always watching those types of documentaries.
Also, watching anything about someone with Munchausen by proxy always makes me think of that M. Night Shyamalan movie. Haha.
The Sixth Sense? That's funny.
Yeah! because of that little girl ghost that's in the movie who shows Haley Joel Osment's character that her mom did that to her!
I totally get why you would think of that movie. I remember that part! Wow, it's crazy that something that happens in a movie like The Sixth Sense could happen in real life.
I know. It is totally scary, to be honest!
