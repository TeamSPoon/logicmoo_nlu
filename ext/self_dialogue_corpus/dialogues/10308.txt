The latest Jack Reacher film, Never Go Back is so improbable. Reacher is supposedly huge, but actor Tom Cruise is not.
I know, but the worst action movie I ever saw was Contraband. Did you see that one?
Yeah. Mark Wahlberg is an ex-drug-runner who's gonna just do one last job.
Right. Like in Heist, and so many others. Just one last job.
In The Usual Suspects they were doing one last caper.
Great great flick though. I believed it all, all the way through.
How about The Town. It's one last job, and a romance.
Oh yeah. Ben Affleck, he was totally believeable.
Yeah. A great actor, in any role.
The Italian Job was one last job, both the first version and its remake. And its sequel was The Brazilian Job. No rest for the wicked.
