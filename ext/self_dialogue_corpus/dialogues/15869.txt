Have you heard any of Carly Pearce's songs?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
Her latest song Every Little Thing is on the Top 10 list today.
That is amazing.  I like Dare Ya, she does a nice job on that one.
I agree. Do you know she is only in her twenties?
She has done well for being so young.
Every Little Thing has had over a million hits on you tube.
That is amazing, she must be great in that video.
Her debut album is coming out soon.
What is it called?
If My Name Was Whiskey!
Too funny, she must be a country girl!
Yes, I think that fact was shown at the Grand Ol Opry.
You don't sing there unless you have country roots for sure.
She has sung some nice Christmas songs as well.
I am sure she will do well in Nashville.
Her career is just beginning.
What album was the country Chris songs on?
I think it was on Bluegrass Christmas album.
It was released in 1991.
