What do you think of Lady Gaga as an actress in American Horror Story?
I have never seen it, is she any good?
She really is pretty good.  I was impressed.
It's not my kind of show, I like her music though.
So do I.  Lately I can't get enough of Million Reasons.
Yes, that one is definitely one of my favorites.  But You and I is my favorite.
I like that one too, I hope she continues doing well.  Even though she is a little eccentrc, I still like her.
Yes, her outfits are sometimes a little outrageous.
Especially the meat dress, who does that.
Someone who doesn't care what people think, apparently.
