So I hear Dumbledore is gay?
Yeah, I heard about that. Jk Rowling was all over that in an interview.
That's pretty cool. Hogwarts is in to diversity.
So you think there was anything going on with Grindlewald?
I don't know. It makes their interaction more interesting and tragic.
Yeah, it seems Dumbledore was dealing with his baggage his whole life.
Yeah, kind of makes it real.
Yeah and contemporary in way.
Never thought about that but you're right.
So many layers to Harry Potter. I get something out of it every time.
