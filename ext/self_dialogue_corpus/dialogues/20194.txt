Do you watch foreign movies?
No, I am not a fan of movies with subtitles.
Do you speak any language besides English that make it easier to watch foreign movies?
I do not, I have watched some subtitled movies though.
Did you ever watch any of the old Asian karate movies that were subtitled?
I have seen a few, but it was years ago.
There are some good movies that mix the English and Spanish languages.
Have you seen Get the Gringo?
That has Mel Gibson, right?
Yes, he is in a mexican prison. It has some spanish speaking in it.
Do they subtitle the spanish?
I do not remember, but I think so.
I think we could learn a lot about foreign films, gives a chance to see other cultures.
I just am not a fan of having to read a movie.
I can see that, it can get a little boring.
Especially if they talk too fast, and if someone is not a fast reader, it can make it unenjoyable.
I can agree on that.
I am not saying foreign films are bad though, they are just not for me.
Well, if I hear of any good ones, I will let you know.
Yes, I am open to suggestions.
