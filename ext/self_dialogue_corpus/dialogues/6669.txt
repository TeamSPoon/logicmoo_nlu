What is your favorite Disney film?
That is hard because it seems I always like the newest one I see more than the others.
That is funny. I have a favorite.
What is it?
It is Tangled, the one about Rapunzel.
Really? I like that one too but it isn't my favorite.
Well it has so many great attributes. It is funny, the music is great and so is the singing.
Yes I did love the music in that film.
It was romantic too. I loved the lantern scene where they all float up.
There was a great song during that scene.
