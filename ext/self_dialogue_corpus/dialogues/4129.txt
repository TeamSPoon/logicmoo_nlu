Can you recall that movie with Drew Barrymore from the 80's where she is telekenetic?
I Think that the movie is called "Firestarter" what about it?
I was just trying to remember some of the better thrillers from when I was a kid
That definitely was a great movie but I would say that the book was far better
Really?  it was a book?
Yes by Stephen King, he also wrote Cujo and Carrie
No Kidding?  man those movies were great also
Dont forget the other classic Pet Semetary
That one was super creepy
I still don't have a cat because of that movie
