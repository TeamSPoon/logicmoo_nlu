The film Pocahontas is based on the biographical and real story of a sailor and soldier named John Smith!
Yes, and an Indian princess from the tribe of Native American Indians called Matoaka, whom they all knew as Pocahontas because of their long hair.
All this happened in 1608!
Very well and the official premiere of the film in the United States was June 23, 1995. It was a movie that won several awards
It was a movie that won several awards
Sure, like the Oscar, Best Soundtrack, Best Song.
I love the whole plot.
And it is! Especially since Pocahontas is a revelry Indian princess.
The love story between Pocahontas and John Smint is beautiful!
It's a shame that they have to split up at the end, with one last farewell kiss.
