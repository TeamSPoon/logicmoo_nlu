Do you think they can speed the game up anymore?
Oh they definitely can soon.
I would like to see batters take pitches quicker.
That is the easiest route to take.
I would say once they get the ball back they have 10 seconds to throw it.
Yeah I would be OK with that.
And get rid of all the relief pitching changes.
I think thats a fine line they have to toe.
What do you mean by that?
Well who is to tell a manager who he can put it.
The problem is that takes 6 minutes sometimes to do.
Yeah just eliminate the warm up pitches on the mound.
Then theres advertising dollars that are lost
I dont think so because what if theres no changes.
True. Any more suggestions?
I would start there and go forward
I think you are on to something.
They may be able to reduce some times in other places but I am not sure what that would entail.
Trimming the roster?
That could be the way to stop with all the relievers.
