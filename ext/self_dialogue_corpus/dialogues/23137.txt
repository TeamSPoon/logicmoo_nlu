Are you into action movies?
Well, it depends. I don't like cliche action movies.
What about mafia action movies?
Yeah, most of them are really interesting and based on true stories.
Have you seen the movie Goodfellas?
Of course! That is one of my favorite movies of all time.
That movie is awesome, I watch it every week.
Do you remember the part where they rob the airport for like 2 million dollars?
Yeah, the Lufthansa Heist. That actually happened in real life too.
That's so crazy that the mafia really did stuff like that.
Yeah, and Billy Batts was actually killed in real life, and was not sanctioned by the mafia.
Wow, that's pretty rough. Why was he killed in real life?
Well, I think it was similar to the scene in the movie, but the guys name was Tommy DeSimone.
Was he just like the short guy in the movie?
Well he was a loose cannon yes, but he was actually really tall.
Well I still feel like Joe Pesci was a good pick for that role.
I agree, he just had to be in that movie.
What about Jimmy the Gent, was he based on a real guy from the mafia?
Yes, he was affiliated with the mafia and later killed by them.
That's crazy, I'm gonna watch that movie again soon.
