So, was Snape a good guy or a bad guy?
Snape was a good man who did bad things.
Doesn't answer the question.
Okay then, maybe he was a bad man who did good things.
Still doesn't answer the question. Was he a good guy or not? A hero or not?
He was absolutely a hero. He ended up giving his life to help Harry and the cause. So he was absolutely a hero
But what about how mean he was, how he abused harry?
That was personal. when he saw Harry, he saw Lily and blamed Harry for what happened to her.
So, everything Snape did is forgiven because of Lily?
No. But some of it can be overlooked. Harry forgave him.
