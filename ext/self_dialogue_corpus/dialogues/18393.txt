Have you ever heard of the band Treponem Pal?
No, never actually. Who are they?
They're a French alternative band that does some crazy stuff.
That's interesting, I don't know many French bands.
They sing in English for the most part though, but I've heard them perform in French.
What kind of music do they do?
They do all kinds of music really, and mix some genres together.
That's really cool! Tell me more.
They have a lot of reggae sounds mixed in with industrial metal.
That's very different from any kind of music I've heard of.
You would think so, but when you hear it it just sound so natural and right.
What are some of their good songs?
Anything off of their Higher album is great, like Renegade.
Are they easy to find?
You can find most of their music on the internet thankfully.
Where do you go to listen to them?
Youtube has a lot of their popular stuff, but my dad has luckily found several of their albums.
That's cool. I'll give that album a listen sometime.
Yeah, and if you like metal or just pink floyd type stuff, you'll probably like them a lot.
Such a strange combination of music, sounds cool to me.
