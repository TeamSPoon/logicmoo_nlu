Dez Bryant is going to tear the league up this year.
Doubtful in my opinion.
Well, your opinion is your opinion.  Trust me, the X will get thrown up.
It feels like Dez has been in the league forever yet there's still tons of receivers better than him.
In some cases of the game maybe.
In all cases I would say.
You're crazy.  He's got awesome hands.
But he drops a lot of passes, led the league a few years back I think.
Don't remember that.  His hands are huge.
But he's not very fast.
He's plenty fast enough.  Look at how many touchdowns he scores.
Anyone can score if they are wide open.
And how do you think he gets that wide open?
Because defenses are keying on Beasley and Witten all the time.
That's crazy talk.  You obviously don't watch any games.
I've seen enough to know he's overrated.
I wouldn't take anyone else over him in the red zone.
You're obviously not thinking hard enough.
I'm thinking plenty hard.  He's the best red zone receiver in the league.
Laughable, but whatever you say.
