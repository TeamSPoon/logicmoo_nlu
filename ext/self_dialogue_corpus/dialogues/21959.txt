Have you seen the last Star Wars movie?
Yes I watched it, Rougue One.
What did you think about it?
I liked it, I think it had a nice touch to it.
I liked it too but think that more Jedi action would have been better.
Yeah I know, I was expecting that as well.
So what was your favorite part in the movie?
I liked the final part when Darth Vader appeared.
Yeah it was a pretty good scene..
I just like how he came with hes light saver and imposed hes power.
I think they should make a sequel but it would be great to have more parts with Vader.
Yeah, it would certainly be a hit.
So are you exited about an upcoming movie?
I am, I want to watch Cars 3.
Yeah, you do? I watched the preview and it looks interesting.
Yeah it does im also a big Cars movies fan.
I like them too but im not sure if I'll watch it.
Howcome?
I'm not that big of a fan really.
Oh I see.
