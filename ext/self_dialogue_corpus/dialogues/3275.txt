What's your favorite horror movie?
That's a tough one as there are so many. I've always been partial to the Shining.
The old one, right? The new one wasn't nearly as good.
Definitely the old one. It deviated from the original a lot, but it was so well made.
Jack Nicholson is truly frightening in that movie.
He does a really good job of showcasing the descent into madness.
Those twins in the hallway were super creepy, too.
Yeah and the naked chick in the tub? So gross.
I wasn't really a fan of the portrayal of Wendy.
She did seem a bit whiny and incapable, didn't she?
