do you like twenty one pilots
i like their first album better
you mean vessels?
yeah, it was darker but more melodic
i guess blurryface got a bit boring
a lot of the songs sounded the same
i get your point
vessels was dancy but depression and also catchy
it was a weird bag
blurryface was just dark and boring
i would not put it that far
i thought it was boring. so monotone
that album made them famous though
yeah because stressed out
i like that song but it got overplayed
it was playing on every pop station
twenty one pilots dont even like the song that much
probably because they keep playing it
yeah they get tired of it
i wouldnt blame them
