I really liked the movie Moana.
I saw that one. Dwayne Johnson does the voice of Maui.
Yeah, he is a pretty entertaining character.
I liked the song he sings called, "Your Welcome"
That is a really good song. I like Moana's song though called How Far I'll Go.
I love that song. I also liked Moana's Grandmother in the movie.
Yeah her grandmother was very endearing and funny.
It's sad though in some parts involving her grandma.
Some people don't like Moana much but others do.
It does seem to be one of Disney's more popular films lately.
