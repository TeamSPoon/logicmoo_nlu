Do you like Johnny Cash?
I love him.
So many of his songs tell stories and I really enjoy that.
So do I.
What's your favorite Cash story song?
Oh, I don't know. They're all so great.
I like 'Ballad of a Teenage Queen.'
So do I. 'The Ballad of Ira Hays' is great too.
That one is sad.
It's accurate, though. Cash was never afraid to tell the truth.
That's true. He was always honest.
I was pretty sad when he died.
I actually teared up.
I was a senior in high school when it happened.
I was in college.
It was 2005.
Yep. He died soon after his wife.
Do you like her music too?
Not as much. There is a garbled quality to her voice.
I know what you mean. I don't like her stuff.
