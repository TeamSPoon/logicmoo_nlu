who gives the best performance of batman?
Tough call, but I go with michael keaton.
Really?
Yes, I know the more popular choice may  be christian bale but keaton is strong in the role and I always associate him as batman.
Do you also prefer that era of batman films?
I think part of the child me does, but I do think the nolan batman films are stronger overall.
I agree the Nolan series of batman movies are far superior to the 80s made batman films.
But didn't first seeing those stick with you more to your idea of who batman is?
You assume I am also a child of the 80s , Adam West was my first idea of batman, so no.
Interesting, I sometimes forget about adam west. Maybe it is generation thing which batman you think is best and not actually based on acting chops.
