Well you just multiplied 4 by 4 and said 16. Wrong.
Yes. That's what I did. And it sounds good to me. I'm happy with it.
it really depends on how you approach this. It's a permutations problem
Yeah, permute this. I say 16.
Now we started this because we wanted to understand how to construct an atonal music piece.
Yes. There are 16. I took the 4 and mutliplied it it. Looks good to me.
That's... just wrong. Let's try this. is the music only going to be 2 rows?
Oh. wait...
Yeah. you get it now.
I see. So it combinatorailly explodes as the number or the rosw increase.
it's not without a reason all these atonal music sound so different from each other and yet still sound the same
because there are so many possibilities.
All of them following the same rule of having no keys
how do you have no keys?
Um... we just talked about it.
yes, but summarize it.
No.
Yes. one was what? Don;t use the same notes?
Sigh... No.. use all 12 notes of the chrimatic scale. Rule 2 is do not use the same notes in a row. (which is kinda breakble)
Oh yeah... And rule 3 is the tranformation stuff and the 4 is start the row with any note you want.
