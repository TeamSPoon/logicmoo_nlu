Have you seen Ms. Sloane?
No, I haven't, is it good?
I don't know, I haven't seen it but would like to.  The preview looks really good.
What is it about?
She is a lobbyist in D.C. and seems like she does some really crazy stuff to keep her clients on top.
Oh yeah, interesting.
Yeah, it is Jessica Chastain, who I love, and several other people.
I will have to check it out.
I think I am going to try and rent it this weekend.
Okay, let me know and maybe we can watch together.
Yeah, I will.
What other movies has she done?
Zero Dark Thirty, it was really good.  It was about getting Osama Bin Laden.
Oh, that's right.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  She was really good in it.
Yeah, her character was very tenacious and she played it very well.
Yeah, she did.
You know what other movie she was in that was really good, the Martian with Matt Damon.
I loved that movie, it was sooo good.
I know, I really liked it too.
Yeah, let's try to get together and watch Ms. Sloane
