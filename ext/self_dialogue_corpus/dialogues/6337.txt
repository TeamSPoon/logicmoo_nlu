Who is your favorite? Tinker Bell or Wendy?
Tinker Bell, no question.
Why Tinker Bell?
Tinker Bell has that pixie dust. She can fly and everything.
What about Wendy Darling?
Wendy is okay, but she leaves Peter and the boys to go grow up.
Yeah, but she went back to her family. I assume her parents missed her.
Sure, but she still left the boys behind.
The Lost Boys would never leave.
I still like Tinker Bell much more.
