Have you ever watched some of the older Disney movies, the ones with Haley Mills?
I don't remember.  What are some of them about?
There's one called Summer Magic.  It has her going to Maine with her family.
I'm still not remembering. What else?
They rent a house from this rich guy they've never met.  An old man is the caretaker and he agrees to let them stay.
Wait a second!  At the end, the rich guy turns up and he's young and good looking!
Right! He immediately likes Haley Mills character and the movies ends with you having the impression that they will get together.
I do remember that!  I remember one where she traveled on a ship looking for her parents.
I think that was called In Search of the Castaways.  It had some really great special effects for the time period.
It did.  Disney put out some good movies back in the day.
