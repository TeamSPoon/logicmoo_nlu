I have been listening to a lot of Lady Gaga recently. Have you?
No actually I have not.
That is a shame.
I heard she came out with a new album though.
She did and it was fantastic.
I feel like she is not as popular now.
That is only because she stays under the radar.
That is very true.
Well anyways it was nice talking to you.
Same to you.
