Have you seen any of the John Wick movies?
I have seen both of them. Have you?
I saw the first one. I really like Keanu Reeves.
Me too. The second one also stars my favorite actress Ruby Rose.
She has been in a lot of movies lately. I like her too.
She has a pretty big role in the second John Wick.
Is she a good guy or a villain?
She plays a villain which is perfect for her. Can't tell you much else without giving away the movie.
She always plays such good villains. Please tell me if his new dog dies?
No, he the dog does not die in the new movie.
