Do you like football?
Yeah, I like the NFL.
Have you ever been to a game?
No.
Me either.
I have been to a couple stadiums.
Which ones?
I've been to the one in Nashville and Atlanta. I also saw the one from the road in Cincinnati.
The stadiums are so expesive.
They are.
I read about the one in Seattle, which was $200 million.
Most of the time they are empty.
Yeah, it's hard to see how they turn a profit.
I guess the ticket prices add up since they hold so many people.
Yeah, but if you have a bad team, you might not sell so many tickets.
Right, or you might have too small of a town.
It's interesting that in New York the two teams use the same stadium.
Yeah, but it's a big one.
Right, they sell plenty of tickets.
There are plenty of sports teams there.
