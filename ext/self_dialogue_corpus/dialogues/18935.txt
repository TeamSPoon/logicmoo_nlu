Have you heard any Indian music ?
U mean bollywood music ?
No. he actual Indian music
I thought both were same
Well looks like they are not
How u got to know about this
Actually i was hearing some musc in my colleagues car and he had some regional hits in his playlist
U mean there are several types in Indian music
Yes.What i heard was flim music similar to our albums
Like our musical
No Not like our musicals.Its just that they ahve songs in every movie it seems
Well i havent heard that one before
I heard the music from some 80s movies and it was so like meditation
Looks like you have enjoyed a lot
More than enjoyment it brought be peace and relaxation
Music is supposed to do that but current music is just full of mess
Hey dont classify everything under blanket.There are some good music still out there
Hope I find them soon
Have you seen the Bad Liar ?
See I told you there were no good music now
