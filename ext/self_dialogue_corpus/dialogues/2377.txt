I like the DALLAS COWBOYS logo.
It is simple.
It used to be a solid Star.
In 1964 they added the stripe around it.
The owners other team uses that logo.
It is used for the TEXAS DESPERADOS.
That is an AFL team.
Their home jersey is royal blue.
And pants are silver.
They call it the STARS AND STRIPES jersey.
They use a serifed font for the letters.
Helmets are silver.
They also have a blue and while stripe.
They player's name is also on the helmet.
But it is in small letter.
When they started in the 1960's the helmet was white.
They got the current uniform style in 1964.
In 1970 they started putting players names on uniforms.
In 1976 the helmet also had a red strip.
That was for the USA bicentennial.
