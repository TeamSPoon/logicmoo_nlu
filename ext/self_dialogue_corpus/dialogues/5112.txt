How long were you a Yankee fan?
Oh gosh since the glory days when i was a kid.
Who was playing then?
My favorite was Mickey Mantle
Did you see him play?
Yes my dad used to take me to games and I saw him play several times
What did you see him do?
One time he hit a homer into the upper deck and the ball bounced off the top pf a sign and bounced into the section we were sitting in.
Was it a big game?
It was a important game with the Red Sox and my dad was able to catch the ball because we were in a thinly populated section of the bleachers.  It was a walk off homer, it won the game.
Wow, cool what happened to the ball?
I still have it and my dad was somehow able to get the Mick to sign it after the game.  He was really nice and patted me on the head.
Any other special Yankee games?
Yeah, we got tickets to the 1977 World Series, the first one for the Yankees that they won in 13 years.
What do you remember?
The best memory was when Reggie Jackson hit three home runs on three pitches to win the game.  Those Dodgers could not get over that.
What did you see.
We were in the lower deck on the third base side and saw Reggie swing with all he had and drive the ball into another zip code.
Ha ha that must have been cool.
Yeah, that was before players got paid so much that they became corporations in themselves, they really loved to play and you might get to meet some of them.  Those were the good old days.
