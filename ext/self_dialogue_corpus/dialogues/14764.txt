If you could pick your favorite comedy movie, what would that be?
I love the movie "Bridesmaids."  I think it is so funny.
Who was your favorite character in it?
I thought Melissa McCarthy  was so funny.  She just doesn't care if she looks good or not.
I know.  That scene in the bridal shop was epic.
Hilarious.  I can't even imagine.
Wouldn't you hate to clean up that mess?
I think I would just burn the shop down and start over.
It was great.  There were so many funny scenes in it.
Yes, I would watch another movie that Kristen Wiig does.  She's super funny.
