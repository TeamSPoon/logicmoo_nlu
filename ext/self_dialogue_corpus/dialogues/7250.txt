I watched Pinocchio the other day. I hadn't seen it in years.
I watched that a few times when I was a kid, but it was a little too scary for me.
The whale still scares me a little!
I would never want to get swallowed by a whale like that, that's for sure.
All of the Pleasure Island parts are scary, too! He basically gets kidnapped!
And he almost turns into a donkey like the other boys.
When you talk about it like this, it's surprising that it's a movie for children!
Yeah, but there were cute parts.
Everything with Jiminy Cricket was cute, I think!
I thought Figaro and Cleo were cute, too.
