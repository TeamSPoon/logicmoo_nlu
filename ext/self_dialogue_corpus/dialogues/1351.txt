Who's your favorite NFL player?
You mean of all time? Probably Joe Montana from the 49ers
Yeah he's a legend all around. What about current players?
Overall, I think my favorite is probably Aaron Rodgers
Do you think Rodgers is better than Tom Brady?
Well the Patriots have more of a dynasty than the Packers do, at least recently, but I think Rodgers is the superior player overall
And yet Brady will probably go down as the greatest quarterback--if not overall player--of all time
I can't really argue against that when the numbers back it up
The numbers are one thing, but who would you want to lead your team when your best players are hurt or have retired?
I heard that the Patriots are statistically worse when Rob Gronkowski isn't playing
Yes, and same with Brady, so you know the two of them have an enormous impact
Without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers would probably be average at best
Now there's a sign of a really good player, even if the team doesn't have as many wins as the Patriots do
So who is your favorite current player?
It's so hard to choose, but I like defense so I think I'd say J. J. Watt
Oh yeah he's really good, and people thought he was a bad pick when he got drafted
Hindsight is 20/20, after all. Just look at what happened with RGIII
Yeah but he got hurt a lot and the Redskins totally mismanaged his career, he was really talented and had a lot of potential
Do you think he'll bounce back again?
Not with the Browns, he won't.
