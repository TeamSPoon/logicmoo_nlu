Are you into rock?
I like some stuff.
I am a big fan of Aerosmith.
I think everyone likes them to an extent.
Kind of how everyone seems to say they dislike Nickleback.
I actually like their songs.
I like the one called Animals.
They had some fun hits a while ago.
They started out having to walk to some of their shows.
Really?
Yes, then went on to have like twenty top rated songs.
I liked the way the main guy sounded when he sang.
I liked the song Photograph.
Their songs always told a full story.
Not unlike The Rolling Stones.
Some of the Stone Songs are over rated.
I think they fit the genre they were sung in well.
I still think Aerosmith had better stuff.
They both have pop songs written about them.
That must mean you made it in the music world.
