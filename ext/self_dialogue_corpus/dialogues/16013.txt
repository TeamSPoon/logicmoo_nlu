What's your favorite kind of music?
I like a lot of folk sounding music.
I'm not sure what folk music is these days.
Have you ever heard of Gregory Alan Isakov?
No, is he a folk musician?
He kind of is. He plays a lot of music I would consider folk.
Do they play him on the radio?
I think I've heard him on some smaller local radio stations. I first heard of him on Pandora though.
I love discovering new music on Pandora.
I like it too. I never would have heard of him if it wasn't for that.
So what's your favorite song by him?
I like one called "Stable Song."
Is it about animals?
I'm not sure why it's called that because it isn't about animals.
Maybe you'll have to play me some of his music sometime.
Yeah, it's definitely worth a listen if you like that kind of music.
I think I would. I'm not sure what modern folk sounds like though.
It is a little bit different than the old stuff like Peter, Paul, and Mary.
No songs like "Puff the Magic Dragon"?
They're a little different than that.
