Have you heard of a new breaking artist named Justin Carder?
Yes, his voice is really great!
Right! His voice is so awesome!
He performs in Las Vegas. I saved his music on Reverbnation.
I enjoyed his song called the wine and the whisky.
Me too! That's a meaningful song.
Yeah. He was very expressive.
I heard his song will be on a Netflix show!
Yes! The show has Ashton Kutcher in it.
That's cool. That will bring more viewers who could hear the song.
Yeah, that's great exposure.
He is also performing at the Hard Rock in Vegas.
Sometimes he performs at the house of blues.
We should go see him. I mean soon!
Yes! Let's find out where his next show is.
Let's check my phone. It says he will be at Rosalita's Cantina in June 30th!
Sounds great. I will check for tickets.
Okay. Let me know what you see.
There's no cover charge!
Even better!
