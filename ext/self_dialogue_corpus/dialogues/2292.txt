I was so surprised about this info on NFL players.
What are you talking about?
t’s become almost an expected norm that close to 78% of NFL players become bankrupt barely 2 years after ending their careers.
You would think they would have financial advisors to help them be a little smarter with their earnings.
This is an interesting fact that when I first heard it I couldn't wrap my brain around it at first.
What are you talking about?
The Arizona Cardinals are older than the state of Arizona.
Huh? How is that possible?
Exactly totally confusing until you know the Cardinals were founded in 1898, while Arizona was granted statehood in 1912.
Okay that makes sense now.
This one will crack you up! Brett Favre's first completed pass was to Brett Favre.
Say what?! How is that possible?
The longtime Green Bay Packers quarterback completed his first pass to himself for a loss of seven yards. (Favre's first attempted pass was a touchdown ... for the other team.)
That is funny ! It's a wonder they didn't fire him.
You know there are some crazy things about helmets that I didn't know about.
oh wait I know one the Philadelphia Eagles are the only NFL team with a logo that faces left.
That is a good one. But I found this fact(not about helmets) to be confusing.
What is it about? Or what team?
Since 1971, the Dallas Cowboys haven’t had a game in Dallas. In fact, their stadium isn’t even in that city. It’s in Arlington, Texas!
That's just weird to me.
