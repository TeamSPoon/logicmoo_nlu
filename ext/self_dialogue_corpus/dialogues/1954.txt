Let's talk about who you think will win each AFC division.  Let's start with the AFC East.
The New England Patriots - hands down.
I agree with you on that.  Miami will be improved, but they still can't touch the Patriots.
How about the AFC North?
That's going to be a tough division. for sure the Browns won't win it.  They are really bad again.
I agree with that statement.  i think this divisions is going to be one of the toughest in the league.
Yeah, it looks like a three team race between the Ravens, Bengals, and Steelers.
I think the Ravens will take it.  they picked up Maclin and have a stellar defense, and Flacco has been in big games before.
Speaking of big game players, Roethlisberger's been there too.  They have Bell and Brown, I'm going with the Steelers.
On to the AFC West. Another tough division.
I really think the Raiders are going to be tough.  They picked up Lynch.
For me, it's a toss up between Denver and Kansas City.
Denver's quarterback is really suspect.
I agree with that, I would pick Kansas City to win it.
KC has a great defense and Smith is a decent QB.
How About the AFC South?
This one is easy for me.  I like Houston's defense, so I'm going Houston.
Houston has a great defense, but their QB is suspect.
Who do you think then?
I'm picking Tennessee. I think Mariotta surprises people and they win the division.
