What was your favorite part about Order of the Phenix?
I liked the scenes practicing in the room or requirement.
That was pretty cool, and seeing all the different Petronus.
I also liked how Harry finally got the girl.
Yeah that was great.  At least for a couple seconds it was.
We got a good look at Luna too, she's quite the character.
Tell me about it, she's a little strange but adds depth to the show.
Yeah, not everyone is big family somewhat normal Rob, or perfect little Harmine.
I also liked Dumpledore's escape.
Yep, that one guy was right.  He sure knows how to make an exit.
