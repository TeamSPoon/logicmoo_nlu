Seems weird, the whole concept of Horcruxes.
Well, it's definitely different.
I think Voldemort was kind of dumb though.
How so?
Why hide your soul in well-known objects?  Do it in a tin can or something.
If I remember right, it was because he wanted to prove a point.
What point is that?
That he respected the wizarding world and wanted the objects to have meeting.
Well, if it were me, I would have done it in rocks or something.
That's why you're not a wizard.
