How would you describe your style?
Umm, I don't think I fit into a category haha.
But if you had to chose one...
Maybe I'm a hipster? I just wear what I like.
What kinda stuff do you like?
It's gotta be unique and original. And better if it's vintage.
Where do you shop?
Mostly just thrift stores. I like to find stuff there and make it my own.
What do you mean?
I like to sew on things, add patches, cut pants into shorts... whatever strikes my fancy!
Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?
Probably some old cutoff bleached men's levis. I think they've been around since 1990!
You'll have to show me the ropes of the thrift shop.
Totally. There's lots of great finds, no matter what your style.
As long as I can find something other than 20 year old shorts! haha
Definitely. But I hope they have some more for me!
What are you up to this weekend? My friend's and I are having a fashion swap!
Cool! I do have a bunch of stuff I never wear.
There's gonna be a ton of people, and we all have different styles, so you'll be able to find whatever!
Sweet! I'm in!
