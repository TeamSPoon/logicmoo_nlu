Guardians of the Galaxy 2 bothered me.
I loved it! What didn't you like?
There were a lot of implications that need to be played out.
Like what?
Well, his body is in ALL planets and were growing and killing millions, if not more. Will the Marvel movies address that?
Probably SHIELD will make a passing reference and fix the problem.
So, Peter saw the whole universe, remember?
Yup, his dad showed it with the God powers.
He stripped Peter of those powers and he's now mortal.
yes, so?
They never said that he lost his memory. Did he see Thanos? Does he know what's coming?
That actually could be interesting.
Did anything bother you?
No, I'm an optimist. Keep going.
I love Gamora Nebula, but their whole existence in the movie had no meaning.
Why? There was some redemption.
They literally fought until they stopped. The plot of the movie did NOT have this be necessary.
At least Baby Groot was around!
He was so irritating! Cute, but he did nothing!
Yeah, but he's so adorable
