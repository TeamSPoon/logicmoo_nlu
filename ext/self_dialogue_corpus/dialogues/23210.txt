Have you seen the movie Rough Night?
Yea! That was hilarious. Scarlett Johannson was great.
She was, but the supporting cast was even better.
Yea Kate Mckinnon was hilarious.
So was Jillian Bell.
Yea. I knew there was something up with the first stripper guy.
Yea you could tell. I also knew they would come back to that jacket at some point.
Yea it was pretty obvious by the way they focused on it when he threw it.
But yea, I didn't like it at first, because I had no idea about the direction it was going.
Yea same here, I thought it was just some chick flick until that guy died.
I know! It got dark so fast.
It kind of fell apart at the end though.
No way! I loved the ending.
Yea, but it was just so unbelievable.
The whole movie was unbelievable. That's not the point of the movie.
Yea that's true, I was probably too harsh on it.
You definitely were, how else could they have ended it?
Well, the police could have showed up or something more realstic.
No way, that would have been so boring.
You're right, the ending was fitting.
