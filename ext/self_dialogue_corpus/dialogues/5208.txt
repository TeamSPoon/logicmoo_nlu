Wasn't there going to be a Lion King sequel?
There were some sequels.
That's funny, I never saw them in the theater.
They were released straight to DVD.
Oh, I see.  Are they worth watching?
Not really.  They are just kind of standalone movies.
Is Scar in them?
No, he died in the original.  Remember, the hyenas did him in?
I do now.  Sad, really, he was a great villain.
He was a murderer.  He deserved what he got.
