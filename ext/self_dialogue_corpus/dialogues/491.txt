I can't wait until the NFL comes back.
It should be a great year with teams having so much talent.
You think the Redskins can take it this year?
I doubt it because they need a better defense.
That and a long term quarterback.
They haven't signed a contract with Cousins yet?
No. He's going to play under the franchise tag if they don't come up with an agreement by July 17th.
I don't understand why they don't just give him a long term contract already.
I think they're looking to trade him for someone else and don't want to get strapped with him long term.
He also wants a lot more money than they want to pay.
A lot more than he should get considering he has never gotten them very far.
Well they will end up paying him more if they keep the franchise tag option every year.
That's true. This year he will get 23.9 million for the franchise tag and if they did it again next year it would be 34 million.
They definitely could have offered him at least a 3 year contract for that much money.
It doesn't make a quarterback really want to play hard if they think the team isn't fully behind them either.
If they don't want to give him a good contract they should at least let him have the opportunity to play for another team.
He has improved, but I don't think he is championship material yet.
Who is their back up quarterback?
Colt McCoy
Oh that's right. Well he's pretty good as an option if the deal falls through with Cousins.
