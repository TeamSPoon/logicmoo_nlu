What horror film do you feel should get more attention?
For recent movies I would say the witch.
Anya Taylor-Joy as thomasin ,is really incredible in that role.
Yes she was. I also thought overall that movie was great and underappreciated.
Ya for such a well done film, did not really get the attention it deserved.
They put a lot into authenticity of the film.
How so?
Well the dialect to start with, but even the costumes. They had the fabric woven the traditional way to have be true to the times.
Wow I did not know that. Even more impressive now.
They also had shot in the now rare 1.33:1 aspect ratio ,I guess represent the time/ era better as well.
