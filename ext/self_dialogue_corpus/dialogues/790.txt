Do you think the Seahawks will get back to the Superbowl this season?
No, I think that there defense is no longer on the level that the Superbowl teams were.
Yeah, I have to agree, the league has changed in over the years, more emphasis on passing the ball
Yeah, I don't see the Seahawks winning many scoring battles when airing it out.
They should still win the division though, I think they get to 10-12 wins.
Yes, I can see that, the Cardinals are the only real competition in the division.
Yeah, they may only need 9 wins to win that division.
Yes, unless the Rams end up surprising everybody.
Not happening, they don't have the players to push for a playoff berth yet.
What about the 49er's?
Oh man, they are an absolute mess right now, they will be battling the Rams for last place in the division.
Right, I can't believe how fast they have gone down, felt like the rivalry with the Seahawks was just yesterday.
They were so close to a Superbowl too, one of the best defensive teams during that span.
Yeah, just shows how crazy it is to be a consistent team.
Well getting back to the Seahawks I think they are reloading for another run right now.
Perhaps, it is all up to player development, there anchor players are all in their prime right now.
Yeah, I think they are still a Top 5 overall team.
You're right, however I think the Packers are about to have a resurgence.
I can see that, you got Rodgers for MVP?
Yes, he's going to have an amazing season.
