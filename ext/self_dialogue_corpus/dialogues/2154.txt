Training camp is almost here and I can't wait for the season to start!
Yeah this year's draft was awesome and a lot of teams will be in the hunt for the championship.
I still can't believe Atlanta crumbled in the big game after such a big lead.
Well, you can never count out the Pats and the greatest of all time, Brady.
Whoa there! I dunno if I would call him the greatest. There are way better people to call the greatest.
Like who!?
I will always think of Joe Montana as the greatest. Other QBs like Bradshaw, Steve Young, Elway, and even Manning I would put above Brady.
You are out of your mind! Brady is a proven winner and has the rings to prove it.
I guess we will wait and see. Just my opinion.
Yeah I guess so.
I think the team to watch this year could be the Tennessee Titans, surprisingly
They do have Mariotta who has another year under his belt, and DeMarco who still has a lot left in the tank to do well this year.
Exactly. People seem to forget about them. They just need to shore up their defense a bit and they are a legit contender.
I would agree to that.
But you know who isn't going to do well this year?
Who is that?
The Chicago Bears
Da Bears! Yeah it was a bad showing at the draft, especially the trade to move up.
Yeah I don't get it at all. But I guess they needed to move on and get another quarterback to rely on.
I dunno who is worse at getting QBs....Chicago or the Browns, lol.
