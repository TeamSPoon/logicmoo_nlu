The Top Dogs!
Cool, what instrument will you play in the band?
I'm going to be the singer.
What style of music will you guys play?
Alternative Rock music.
Awesome! Do you sound like any other bands?
Yes actually. We sound like the Kooks.
I love the Kooks! Anyone else?
We sound a bit like Coldplay too.
Wow, very impressive. You must be very inspired by British bands.
We are. The UK produces some incredible music
I fully agree
Have you ever been in a band?
No, but I'd love to be in one someday.
You should join mine then!
What instrumental can I play?
We need a trumpet player. Do you play that?
