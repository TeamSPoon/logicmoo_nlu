Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
Yes, I just saw it last night.
Awesome; I saw it a few nights ago at a drive-in theater.
I didn't realize there were any of those nearby. What did you think of it?
I thought it was great! I really enjoyed the film.
I did as well.
I definitely think it's the best of the new set of DC superhero films.
It was certainly better than Batman vs Superman.
I didn't even watch that one because the reviews were so poor.
Do you think they will tie it in with the rest of the movies?
I think I heard something about a Justice League film.
It seems strange that this one was set in World War One, so it seems harder to connect.
Oh there was one weird thing I noticed about the movie.
What was that?
So the island is supposed to be somewhere in the Mediterranean, right?
Yeah, I guess so. That makes sense anyway.
So why would there be armadillos there since they're native to the Americas?
That's a good question; I hadn't considered that.
I still enjoyed the film though.
Yeah I hope they learn from this one and keep making good films.
