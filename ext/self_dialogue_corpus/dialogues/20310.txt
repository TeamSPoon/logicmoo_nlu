Do you think the Community movie will come out anytime soon?
I don't know. Dan Harmon says he's working on it, but then Mitch Hurwitz said that ages ago, and there still isn't an Arrested Development movie.
It must be hard to adapt a TV show into a movie.
Is it really though? I mean, it's been done successfully a few times.
Like what?
Well, there was the South Park movie.
That movie was a little ridiculous.
It was funny though.
Yeah, it was. Just a little inappropriate too.
And there was The Simpsons Movie.
Same deal there--funny but a little off.
Hmm. Okay. Well, what about any of the TV shows Joss Whedon has turned into movies?
I don't know those.
Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Wasn't that a movie to begin with.
Hmm. Okay. I might be wrong about that. What about Serenity.
Oh, okay. I'll buy that one. That was good.
It wasn't as good as firefly though.
Maybe TV shows and movies and just different things.
You might be right!
