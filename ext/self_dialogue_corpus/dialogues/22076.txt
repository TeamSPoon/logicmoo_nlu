Whats the scariest movie you've ever seen?
Are you talking about old classic ones, or newer scary ones?
Whichever, just the scariest movie you've ever seen.
Well, thats two different categories, and both have scary movies in it.
I dont get what you mean, shouldn't they just be in one category?
Not at all, older movies are cult classics, newer movies have a scare factor.
I guess I get what you mean, which cult classic was the scariest for you then?
That would have to be the original Halloween, although Rob Zombie did a pretty good remake.
What did you like about the remake?
I liked how it delved into Michael Meyers background more than the original.
I really liked that about his remake too, one of the reasons I liked the remake better.
I can understand that, but to me, the original is much scarier.
Which new age movie, is the scariest to you?
I would have to say, any of the Saw movies.
Really? I thought they were really cheesy and not very good.
I really enjoy the gore and torturous plots of the movie.
So youre more into the gore than the actual plot of movies?
No, i really liked the plots of the saw movies too, but i like the torture.
Youre kind of an odd ball arent you.
I just know how i like my movies, thats all.
