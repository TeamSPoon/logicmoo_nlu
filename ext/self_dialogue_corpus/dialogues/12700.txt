Did you know that Disney owns Star Wars?
That's been a thing for years now, hasn't it?
Yeah. Some weren't too happy about it at first.
Did they think that the films would be marketed towards kids again?
Yeah, but thankfully that wasn't the case.
Agreed. The latest two were still great films, even under Disney's name.
It shouldn't come as a surprise, either.
What makes you say that?
Disney owns Marvel, and Marvel Studios has been killing it with their films.
This is very true.
