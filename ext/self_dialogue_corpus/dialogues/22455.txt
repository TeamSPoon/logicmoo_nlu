hey have you seen the movie toy story 3 ?
not yet ..is it any good ?
any good ..this one's amazing man !
oh really ..how is that so !
well the story is like nothing I have ever seen
is that one of those spy stories ?
not really a spy story ...more of a family thing actually
oh cool ...what kind of a family thing ..
well i am sure you know that this is an animation ..so they tell this story through  a lot of metaphors
OK....
so it explains better than anyone or anything else why its so important to stick to family
oh...sounds cool
yeh ....and every scene to be so uniquely crafted ...you will so into it
you are making me jealous
so where did you see it ? are they playing it on a theater ?
not really ..this one is a little old one...so you probably need to get a dvd
i see ...did you rent it from redbox ?
yep ..I got it from redbox ..but you can find it online too
also i think its still on netflix
awesome ..thank you so much for catching me upto this
