Okay, so, which Steven Spielberg movie is your favorite?
Are we just talking about movies he directed, or anything he was involved in?
Either way, just tell me your favorite. Mine is War of the Worlds?
That's your favorite? Weird; mine is Indiana Jones, the first one.
Okay, so, what do you think his best movie is?
That's easy. Schindler's List, no question about it.
Oh, see, I would say Saving Private Ryan.
They're both good films, but I think Ryan is more of a standard war film, while Schindler is just a better film.
Well, if you want a non-standard war film try 1941. Now that's an underrated movie.
If we're talking about underrated Spielberg films, then the most underrated has to go to The Terminal.
No, no way. Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can are both better than it.
Agree to disagree. What do you think is his worst movie though?
Well, he has produced all of the Transformers films.
Worst movie he directed then.
That's easy, it's gotta be Hook. It's such a weird movie; doesn't know what it wants to be.
Yeah, but it's got Robin Williams as Peter Pan! How can you not like that?
Robin Williams has been in his share of bad films, God rest his soul. Fern Gully, anyone?
That's just a voice role. Besides, he made up for it by being the Genie in Aladdin.
Well, I'll give him that. He was also the best portrayal of Popeye, hands down.
Now speaking of underrated films, there's an underrated film!
