Do you remember the planet Hoth?
Is that the snow/ice planet?
Yes, the one from Empire Strikes Back
Yes, that was a pretty cool planet. A lot of strange creatures
Yeah, I liked all the different outfits everyone wore
Yeah, I liked the snow stormtroopers
Yeah, they were pretty cool
Darth Vader didn't require a snow outfit
That's because he's mostly machine
Good point.
