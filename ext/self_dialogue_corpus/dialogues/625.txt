I'm very impressed by Timber Thomas.
The NFL player?
Absolutely.
What'd he do?
I just finished watching the Dragons play.
Right.
He made 3 touchdowns in the game!
That's impressive!
He has one of the best stats in the team.
I didn't know that.
Yes, he had a great season last year too.
Is that when you first noticed him?
Oh yeah.
I hope he keeps it up.
As long as he keeps the injuries away.
Yes, he could get a leg injury from running so much.
So far, he's only pulled muscles.
How do you know?
He said it on his twitter.
Oh ok.
