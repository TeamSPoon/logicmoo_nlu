Do you remember the rock band Skid Row?
Yes that guy could scream.
My best song was 18 and Life to go. What was yours?
I liked I Remember You.  That guy Sebastien had a voice didn't he?
One of the best. Did you like Heart?
Them sisters made some good music.
Remember Barracuda?  Everyone played that on the guitar.
We used to sing that song while driving in my friends Barracuda.
I remember that, Ann and Nancy Wilson were their names right?
Yes and we went to their concert in L.A. too.
