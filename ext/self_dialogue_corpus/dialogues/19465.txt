What do you think happened to Tupac?
I think he was murdered by the police.
Really, why would they murder a rapper?
That's what I don't really know.
He had some controversial songs but nothing to crazy.
I guess that's true.
I liked him as a rapper but don't think he was one of the best.
Who do you think is the best rapper?
I would have to go with Eminem.
You think he's better than Jay-Z?
I love Jay-Z but I think Eminem is better.
Jay-z seems more like a business man than a rapper now days.
He has made a ton of money.
Jay-z use to be friends with Tupac and Biggie.
Yeah, I knew him and Biggie were pretty tight.
I don't know if they did any songs together.
I'm sure they probably have or Jay-z has atleast used Biggie's voice in a rap.
Jay-z did make it's all a dream on the Black Album.
I think Eminem has a song with Tupac.
Tupac released more songs dead than when he was alive.
