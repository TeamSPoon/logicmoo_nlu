Is Jackie Chan still doing movies? I don't think I've seen him that Karate Kid remake.
He's still acting. Most of his recent works have released in China first then in the US without much fanfare.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
You should check out Chinese Zodiac. That one was released in 2013 I think.
What's it about?
Something about stolen relics he has to find.
It's action right? Lots of martial arts?
I think so.
Cool. I'll look into it.
You might want to try Skiptrace too. It was released in 2016 in China.
Is it in English?
Of course.
It would be nice if they did another Rush Hour.
With Chris Tucker?
Yeah. I loved the first two movies. The last one wasn't as good.
I remember hearing a rumor about there being a Rush Hour 4.
Really? I hope it's true.
Those guys are too old for that kind of action if you ask me.
That could be the plot of the movie. Both Chris and Jackie are helping out a rookie cop and his or her partner.
I'd like Chris' character to go to China this time and get caught up in Jackie's work, just for a change of scenery.
