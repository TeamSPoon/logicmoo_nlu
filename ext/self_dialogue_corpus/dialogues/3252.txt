Have you seen the movie Get Out yet?
No I haven't seen it. Is it as good as the hype?
Even better. Jordan Peele did such a good job writing and directing that film.
I heard that was his debut film too, is that right?
That's true. And with him being a comedian it's surprising that he could delve into such dark territory.
Right you are. I've been wanting to see it because I've heard so many positive things about it.
It's filled with subliminal messages and little easter eggs to look for.
Right and I did hear it was actually frightening. That means a lot since modern horror movies aren't scary anymore.
This one definitely is. There's a seen where the main character is sent into the Sunken Place, which is just blood curdling.
He was under hypnosis, I remember hearing about that part.
