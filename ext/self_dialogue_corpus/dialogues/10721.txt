Have you seen the latest Fast and the Furious movie?
Which one is that? Fast 10?
No it's The Fate of the Furious!
So, Fast 8? Which one is the one that Paul Walker was in?
That was Furious 7, this one's the 8th one or something like that since they're numbered weird.
How did they handle the lack of Paul Walker?
They just mentioned Brian and Mia but that they're retired and not apart of the team anymore.
Oh that's nice, and I guess a respectful way to deal with him being gone instead of dying like other characters.
Yeah! Its a different tone I think, but not that bad.
Okay, I'll watch it!
