do you like nickleback
no, do you?
why does everyone hate them?
they are just kinda cheesy
they have some decent songs though
like what?
how you remind me is pretty good
they sound like they wanna be the next nirvana
a lot of bands wanna be nirvana though
they are just poppy too
so what?
alot of their songs have no substance
thats nothing new. theyre just a pop rock band then
they are just kinda boring and lame
thats just your opinion
yeah but a lot of peoples opinions too
its probably split 50/50
yeah because they still have a lot of fans
they do arenas
i wonder who goes
