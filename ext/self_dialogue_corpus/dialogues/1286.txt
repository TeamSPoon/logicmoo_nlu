It won't be long until the NFL season starts.
I know! I can't wait.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
I used to follow the Packers.  I liked them when Favre was the quarterback.
Aaron Rodgers is a really good quarterback too.
Is he as good as Favre was?
I think he may even be better!
Really?  My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys.
How long have you liked them?
I started following them when Roger Staubach was the quarterback.
That was 40 years ago!
I know.  I went to a couple of games when Troy Aikman was the quarterback.
Have you been to the new stadium, Jerry's World?
No.  I haven't been to any games recently.
I went to a game last season.  That place is huge!
What do you think of Dak Prescott?
He's pretty good!  I like him.
I hate to say it, but if Tony Romo hadn't got hurt, we would never have known how good he is.
True.  I bet Prescott has a great season this year.
