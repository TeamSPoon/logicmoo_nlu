I've been watching a lot of horror movies lately
Oh yea, any good ones?
I really like Saw
It is a classic, especially the 1st movie
It definetly had elements of mystery and some really horrific scenes
Being trapped in a room with a physcho like that would make me crazy.
Yea, I think thats the point
Saw 2 was pretty good too.
Yea, it was not a bad sequel
I liked that it kept the same elements and didnt go too crazy with the storyline.
