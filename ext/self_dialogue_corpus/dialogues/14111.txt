Did you watch the music awards last night?
yes I did, who was your favorite?
Definitely Lady gaga, that woman is a true artist
I agree, she is very stylish as well, whats your favorite song?
I like a few, but the one that I love is poker face
Oh ya, I like that, makes me want to dance. I love "do what u want"
That one is good too, have you ever been to one of her performances
sadly no, I would love to though
I have tickets, want to join me next weekend?
I would love that!
