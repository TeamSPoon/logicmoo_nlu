What do you think about Las Vegas getting an NFL team?
I think that's completely ridiculous. It should be put elsewhere.
Why?
Well that area already has the Cardinals, 49ers, and Rams, who JUST moved there.
Overkill?
A bit.
What about the city in general? Could it support a team?
Easily, surprisingly.  There's always a ton of tourists year-round so I doubt they'd have trouble filling seats.
Do you think it'll affect the nearby markets?
No, they will be fine. Football fans don't just change allegiances.
So where would you put a new team?
Any of the following: Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Des Moines, or Santa Fe.
Why those?
They're kind of in the middle of nowhere but far enough away from the Cowboys, Chiefs, and Vikings.
Do you think the population will support it?
Of course! If college sports are big there, the NFL will be too.
I have a different idea.
Shut down some teams and re-purpose the stadiums.
NO, no no no.
Ha, just kidding. The NFL will succeed anywhere.
