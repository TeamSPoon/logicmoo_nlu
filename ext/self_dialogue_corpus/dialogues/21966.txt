How do you feel about movie remakes?
Just in general? Or did you have something more particular in mind?
Well, I feel like they do work sometimes. Like the remake of Ocean's Eleven was good.
It was. I like George Clooney and Julia Roberts.
And Brad Pitt! It had a great cast.
Sure. But I feel like remakes have a reputation for not being good.
Like what?
Well, the remake of Old Boy wasn't as good as the Korean one.
That could be a cultural thing. Like they ruined it while localizing it.
Maybe, but there are others. I didn't like the remake of The Parent Trap.
I loved that when it came out.
How old were you.
Maybe 10. I guess that could be it.
Exactly. It's not a good movie.
Okay. But does that mean you think it's bad to remake movies?
Not at all. It just has to be a movie worth remaking.
What kind of movie is that?
I think it would have to be a movie that you could do better today, with the current technology.
That makes sense. Sometimes the effects matter.
Yeah. So long as it's not just recycling the idea.
