Did you ever watch Tarzan?
Of course, that movie was a classic.
It was interesting seeing the clash of Tarzan and Jane.
What do you mean by clash?
Well, Tarzan was from the forest while Jane was a normal person.
They do say that opposites attract.
I've seen alot of romantic movies but this one was special.
I always watch Tarzan every now and then.
The Jungle theme was so well put out.
It really added a mystique to the movie.
