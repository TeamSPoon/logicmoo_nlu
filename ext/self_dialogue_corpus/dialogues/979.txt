I think Tom Brady should retire?
Why do you think that.
I think he is getting up there in his age.
I agree he may put ome strain on himself.
Peyton Manning is his age too luckily he realized.
Yeah I think he could get hurt.
They all should retire earlier.
I agree you never know what could happen.
I think that the Falcons are going to do better than them this year.
Really why.
Did you see how they played last year?
They were good.
I think they can get to the Superbowl again.
I think the Cowboys will.
Yeah they could.
It could end up between them two.
Wow never thought of that.
that would be a good game.
Yeah both teams are awesome.
Could not agree more with you on that.
