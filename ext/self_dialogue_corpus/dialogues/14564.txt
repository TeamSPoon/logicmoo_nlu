It looks like it's going to be Boston and Cleveland in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Probably but Washington isn't dead yet. They can still force a game 7.
Yeah, but if they do game 7 will be in Boston.
It doesn't matter. Cleveland is still going to the finals.
Cleveland is going to have a lot of rest waiting around for the Celtics to finish their series.
So will Golden State waiting around for the Spurs or Rockets.
So the question is if Cleveland can repeat as champs.
It will be a great finals, but I don't think so.
Because of Durant?
Yeah, adding him to the Warriors is just too much.
Last year was an upset, but not this year.
Unless Mike Brown screws things up.
It's crazy that he used to coach the Cavaliers but now can beat them in the finals.
Yeah, especially since he came up short when he was with the Cavs.
Something tells me that LeBron is going to have to work really hard to win this one.
He's going to have to put the team on his back again.
He'll try but I think he's going to wear out this time.
He's going to have to slow down at some point.
We'll I'm not a big fan of either team so I just want it to be interesting.
Me too!
