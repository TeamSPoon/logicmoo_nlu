Is it just me or was Artpop an underrated album?
I believe that it was underrated. I think that Gypsy is a top 5 Lady Gaga song that no one talks about.
Yeah. I just think that it gets a bad reputation because it under performed commercially.
I would probably attribute that to the weakness of the lead single, Applause.
Yeah, and Do What U Want didn't get the promotion it deserved.
Agreed. I like it when Lady Gaga collaborates with other artists on songs and wish she did it more.
I think that her collaborations are hit or miss. While I liked Do What U Want, I found Telephone very overrated.
Aside from the music video being too long, I loved that song when it came out.
The length wasn't the issue for me. I just thought that Lady Gaga and Beyonce made a weird mix.
Really, I thought the fact that the two perfectly complemented each other in the song.
