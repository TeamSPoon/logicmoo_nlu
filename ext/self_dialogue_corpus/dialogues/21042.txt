Have you seen the latest rumor for The Last Jedi?
No, what is it?
Well, they say that Luke is gonna head off at the end of the movie to kill snoke
But does he fight during the movie?
I don't know, but if the rumor is true then we at least know that Luke doesn't die.
That's good, I didn't want him to die.
He is supposed to change through the movie to want to be a jedi again.
He didn't want to be a jedi anymore?
No, remember the trailer where he said "the jedi must end"?
Oh yeah.
Well, apparently something changes his mind and he decides to kick some butt.
I hope he does.
They also say that he doesn't have a lightsaber at the beginning, but an old cane instead.
He was walking fine in the trailer.
Well yeah, but he also has some kind of zapper for the animals on the island
A zapper?
Yeah to keep the animals from bothering him or something.
Yeah, but he's a jedi he could just use the force and get rid of them.
True.
I hope the movie is good.
