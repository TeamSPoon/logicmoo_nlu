Ryan Shaizer can only get better from here, guys! Go Steelers!
I've been saying this for a while: Ryan Shazier is the best run stopper in the NFL.
I don't recall many ball carriers breaking Shazier's tackles.
Yup. If he made contact, the ball carrier went down.
Shaz goes all in for the tackles, so it's easier to be juked by the carrier.
But when he hits, he hits hard.
People often bring up missed tackles when talking about Shazier. He's a risk taker.
That's why it's called a risk.
He's an All-Pro if he stays on the field for all 16 games.
He does get hurt a lot...
My Ravens fan buddy talking smack. He said he also lead the league in missed tackles per attempt.
Tell your buddy to stop hating.
They hate us cuz they ain't us.
Ha Ha! All day every day!
He goes through the O-Line like a knife through butter.
I am thinking he is gonna have a big big year.
Yup. All-Pro or bust!
He has potential to be a lifelong all pro
Shazier is the best player on a pretty young and talented defense.
He's getting there. Zeus is still King
