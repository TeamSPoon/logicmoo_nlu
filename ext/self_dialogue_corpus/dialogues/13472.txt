who is stronger than yoda?
i dont know. vader?
vader would beat him...but maybe not, if yoda was in his prime.
yoda would have beaten anakin before he turned  vader.
palpatine kinda beat yoda and left.
i thought it was more of a tie.
he just left yoda literally hanging so i'd think he won.
i wonder what young yoda would have been like.
i wonder if there are actual pictures.
we can check
