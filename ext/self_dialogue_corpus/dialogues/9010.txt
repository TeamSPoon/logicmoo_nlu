Do you like Metallica?
Yes they are one of my favorite rock bands.
What is your favorite song?
Enter Sandman, is a great song.
It is? Don't you remember what song we played at my sisters memorial?
Wasn't it Brown Eyed Girl?
That was at the end. What did we play at the beginning?
I'm not sure, was it a Metallica song?
Yes, it was Nothing Else Matters.
Oh yes, I remember now. It was a perfect song for her.
