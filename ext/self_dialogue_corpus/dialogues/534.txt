Are you a Dallas Cowboy fan?
Oh yes very much so, I used to live in Dallas.
Are you up set that Tony Romo retired?
Yes, I was hoping he could win a Super Bowl, but his back just couldn't hold up to the strain of the NFL.
Do you think Dak Prescott will improve this year?
Yes he should, he's very talented.
Will Ezekiel Elliot repeat last years performance?
He's a great running back and they need to just keep giving him the ball.
Who is Dallas's best wide receiver right now?
I would say it's Dez Bryant, as long as he can control his temper, he can play well.
Who is their best tight end?
They have Jason Witten, he's really good, but he's getting older, hopefully he has a great year.
Do they have some other good wide receivers?
Yes, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley are pretty good.
Was their defense good last year?
Not really, if their defense was better they could have won the Super Bowl.
Who is their head coach?
It's Jason Garrett, he used to play for them.

Jerry Jones owns the team and he's very involved in their football operations.
