What are some movies that you really liked watching growing up?
Oh, man. I have a lot of those.
Pick two and tell me about them.
Well, I really liked the Ace Ventura movies.
What are those about? I haven't heard of them.
They're about this crazy guy played by Jim Carrey that loves animals, but is really vulgar and silly.
That kind of sounds like a Monty Python skit.
It's really the same kind of humor.
Oh, nice! I love that kind of humor.
Me too, Jim Carrey does a great job with his role. He's very funny and wild.
What's the other movie that comes to mind?
I liked The Secret of Nimh a lot.
I haven't heard of that one either.
It's pretty good, though it's a cartoon.
What's that one about?
This one is about rats and mice that have been experimented on.
That's an interesting idea. Are they still normal or what?
They become super intelligent and create a whole city underground.
Whoa, that's wild!
Yeah, but the rats are pretty scary in the movie and have electric spears.
