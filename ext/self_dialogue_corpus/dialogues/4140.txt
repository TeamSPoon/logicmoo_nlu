Did you see the original Psycho?
Yeah, pure classic.
Norman bates just seems so normal when you talk to him most of the time.
A bit of a mama's boy though.
Even though he killed his mother.
The ending was a little twisted too.
Where he wouldn't even kill a fly.
That's why Hitchcock is the master of suspense.
Don't forget the shower scene.
Still one of the best movie scenes ever made.
