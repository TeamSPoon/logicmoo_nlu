Are you familiar with Mary Poppins?
It's one of my favorites.
Have you seen Saving Mr. Banks?
I haven't heard of it. What's it about?
It's the true story as to how Walt Disney acquired the rights to Mary Poppins.
It sounds interesting.
There's also a sequel to Mary Poppins coming out.
That's news to me.
IIt's supposed to come out in 2018.
I would see it.
