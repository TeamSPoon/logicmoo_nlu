Have you heard of Preservation Hall?
No, what's that?
It's a place in New Orleans where old musicians perform concerts for really reasonable rates.
What kind of concerts do they perform?
They perform original New Orleans Jazz music. They want people to experience what traditional New Orleans Jazz was like.
Have you ever been there?
Yes, when I was in college we went to New Orleans and I stood outside half the night to get into Preservation Hall.
Wow! Was it really that busy?
There was a line half way around the block and the hall was full when I got there.
You must really like Jazz music. Did you ever get in?
Yes, after the musicians finished their final concert a group of students including myself were still outside. One of the musicians asked us why we were still waiting and when he heard we were musicians he invited us in.
That's cool. Did you get to talk with him about music.
Way better than that! The men put on a private concert for us. They showed us their instruments and we got to ask questions.
That sounds very educational. Was it fun?
It was amazing to listen to how much they loved Jazz and New Orleans and performing for people.
When was Preservation Hall built?
I think it was established back in the 1960's to help keep New Orleans Jazz alive.
That's a great idea but where do they get the musicians from? Surely they aren't the same people who played back in the 60's!
To be honest I'm not sure. All I know is that the guys I heard were really old and really good at playing Jazz.
I'm glad you liked it but I don't really like Jazz that much so I don't think I'll ever go there.
