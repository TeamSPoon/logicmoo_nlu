Who do you think was the best Spider Man?
I'd say Tobey Maguire.
You're crazy.  Andrew Garfield was better.
No way.  Those movies were horrible compared to the original.
What are you talking about?  Those were tons better.
Tobey was the original Spider Man.  Andrew was a backup and a wimp to boot.
You have no idea what you're talking about.  You should really watch the new ones again.
I don't need to when the first ones were that much better.
We'll have to agree to disagree.
Agree with your disagreement.
