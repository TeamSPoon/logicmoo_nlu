Any thoughts on the Detroit Lions?
I think they have a nice team.
Yeah I was rooting for them this season.
It was a shame they went down to the Seahawks in the first round.
I know I was hoping they would advance to the second round.
Well it's all the more reason to make that their goal this season.
There is no reason for them to think they aren't capable of that.
Seeing the Detroit Lions get to the Superbowl would be fun to watch.
If they won the Superbowl I would celebrate for a week!
Yeah I love to see underdogs do the unexpected.
I doubt any analysts are talking about the Lions winning the Superbowl next season.
They should look at all possibilities!
With a little luck and a healthy roster anything is possible.
Let's hope for a miracle run by the Detroit Lions.
I'll be hoping that happens all summer.
At the least I want to see them have a good year.
Yeah improvement would be great.
I would love to see them win more then ten games in the regular season.
That would give them confidence in the playoffs.
Exactly what I was thinking!
