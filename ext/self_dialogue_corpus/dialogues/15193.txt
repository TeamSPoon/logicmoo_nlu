Have you ever heard of the band The Eagles?
I have.  I really like their music.
It's tough to pick a favorite song but I'd have to say mine is Hotel California.  What is yours?
I like that one too but to be different I'll pick Life in the Fast Lane.
Whenever I hear that on the radio and I'm driving I always end up driving way too fast!
Me too!  They have a lot of great songs and you know, they are still great today.
I know what you mean.  I think it is because each member of the band is super talented in his own right.
The songs they wrote back in the day could really touch your soul.
They were real too.  They were about stuff everybody goes through not like the music out there now.
I hear you on that.
I brought them up because I heard that they are going on tour again soon.
Even after Glen Frey's death?  Who'd they get to replace him as if anybody ever could?
They actually got his son to do it.  I think that is very very cool.
Definitely.  I would love to hear how he sounds. I hope he can sing just like his dad.
They are also tapping Vince Gill to tour with them.
I bet he'll do the songs with all the high notes in them.
I bet you are right.
I wonder if they'll release a new album or at least a new song or two.
I don't know but if they do I'm sure it will be great!
I hope they do it in rock style instead of country.
