What are some of your favorite Horror films?
I love most of them! I especially love the Rob Zombie films.
Oh yeah like House of 1000 Corpses?
Yes, and also Devil's Rejects.
I really liked both of those too.
I enjoyed his Halloween remake too.
So did I! I'm not into remakes all the time but his was phenomenal.
I feel the same. Halloween is one of my favorites so I was worried about him remaking it.
I was so pleased with his version.
Same here. I like how he told the back story.
That's my favorite part. We were missing that in the originals.
And he made everything so gruesome. I was genuinely scared.
Yeah, having Tyler Mane play Michael helped. He's larger than life!
And the kid they had play the young Michael really freaked me out too.
I know! He did such a great job for a young kid.
I heard that he wasn't able to watch anything other than his scenes while they were filming.
That's a good idea. Although, his parts were the most gruesome.
Yeah that's true. Sounds like he had a good supportive family though.
That's good. I grew up on horror and turned out just fine.
Right. Most of us 80's kids did.
