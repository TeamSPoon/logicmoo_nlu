When was the last time you watched a classic Disney movie?
Probably a year or two ago I watched Fantasia with my little cousins.
I just recently re-watched Snow White and I miss that style of animation so much.
Oh, I know the colors and everything.
Can you imagine drawing all those dwarves over and over like that?
Not at all, but that's what made those movies special, all the hard work.
Very true, if only they still did animations like that.
Imagine if Frozen was animated by hand.
Ahhh it could be beautiful, don't make my heart think like that.
Only in our dreams.
