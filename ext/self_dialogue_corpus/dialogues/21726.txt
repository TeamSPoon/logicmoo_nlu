So what movies are you interested in for this year?
I can tell you what I'm not interested in. All of these crappy looking horror movies
That Happy Death Day is a total rip off of Edge of Tomorrow. Sheesh
And its coming off the heels of Annabelle 2, and that atrocious Bye Bye Man
Yeah..okay what about movies you are interested in?
Black Panther looks amazing. That comes to mind first
I'm with you. That trailer was so good. The visuals, actors, and of the course, Coogler directing
How lame is the news about the Han Solo film?
Yeah, just shows what Disney is all about. Marvel was similar in the handling of Ant Man. I'm surprised Black Panther seems so stylish
It's just a trailer. It probably follows the formula. But Coogler is good at formula, just look at Creed
The Han Solo mess does worry me about the next main line Star Wars film. How much room will these directors have?
And they are just going to keep pumping these films out.
Okay, to be negative, any film with Miles Teller is pretty much out for me.
That guy is terrible. He's good at one thing, and that one thing is stale now
He also picks terrible looking films that I have no time for.
Once again, I think the indie scene will have to produce the best films. There's been little good so far
Best movie is probably Get Out? I need to see now
No I think Get Out is clearly the best, even though I'm not crazy in love with it
Hopefully the summer has some more decent films and we get good stuff come Oscar season
I definitely have my doubts but Wonder Woman restored some hopes!
