Have you listened to Taylor Swift lately?
Um yes, how could you not?
Haha, I just had a throwback of her song 'Love Story' last night.
"Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.." Ah love those lyrics!
You know it by heart huh? What's your favorite?
From which album??
Um...'Fearless?'
Ah it would have to be 'Fifteen.'  Such a sweet song.
I agree, but I think 'You Belong With Me' is much better.
Hm..you have a point there! That song is just so upbeat.
She has so much great songs and is a great writer too.
I know, her album '1989' was always on top of the charts.
It was! I think that was when she really transitioned to pop.
Right, 'Blank Space' was soo pop.
I loved that song.  'Welcome to New York' was a great opener to the album.
I thought so too! She also did great by making a deluxe portion of it.
Yes! The polaroids were so hipster.
Just like majority of her songs. Haha!
Ok, do you wanna dance to 'Shake it off' right now?
Let's do it!
