Why does everyone rave about the Greatful Dead so much!
I have no clue.
I couldn't even tell you one of their songs.
Sitting on Top of the World?
Oh, yeah. That was all right.
No too much to get worked up about.
You're not a Dead Head either?
Far from it.
Jerry Garcia was a pretty interesting fellow though.
True.
