Hey, so who is your favorite rock band?
It is linkin park without any doubt.
I used to be fan of them, But not anymore.
Oh, why is that so?
I think LP has changed is genre from rock to more of a techno.
Yes, their last album of mix of techno and rock.
Yes, Exactly, Their first two albums were pure rock.
But what's wrong with techno rock? I find it to be better than rock music.
I guess that is individual preference.
Yes, that is just what I feel.
Though, I did like thousand suns album, even though it was not pure rock.
Well, I am glad to hear that, tell me more about it.
I especially loved the catalyst song.
Wow what a co incidence. that is my favorite song as well!
I even loved the music video of catalyst.
