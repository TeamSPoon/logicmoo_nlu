Do you have a favorite film from a Stephen King story?
Stand By Me was really good.
It most definitely was, and it's not really a horror film is it?
Not at all, I mean there is a dead kid and Kiefer Sutherland plays a really bad dude but that's about it.
What about Chopper?
You mean the junkyard dog?
Yeah, he was kind of scary. He was definitely a mean dog, might have had rabies or something.
You know who was in that movie but looks completely different today?
Yeah, that's easy. It's Jerry O'Connell. Wil Wheaton looks exactly the same still.
You're right. Wil looks like a kind of grown up kid with a beard.
I wonder if River Phoenix hadn't died, would he have been as successful an actor as his brother?
Probably, he was really talented. It would have been cool to see him and Joaquin in movies together.
Yeah, they would have been better than the Baldwin brothers.
Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez were in some movies together weren't they?
Men at Work is the only one that I can think of. It definitely wasn't the best film.
Emilio kind of fell off the map didn't he?
Yes he did. The last big hit that I remember him starring in was Young Guns.
Great movie, and Charlie Sheen was in that film too. I forgot about that one.
At least Emilio didn't slide down the rabbit hole like Charlie. Unfortunately, I think that's it for Sheen.
Yeah man, it's no good. Wall Street is one of my favorite movies. I kind of miss Charlie.
