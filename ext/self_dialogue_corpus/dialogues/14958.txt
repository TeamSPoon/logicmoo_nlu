Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?
I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come?
Well, Superbad is super funny.
You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.
I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out. I love Michael Cera.
I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie. I especially loved the scenes at the party.
I was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.
That's exactly how I felt.
