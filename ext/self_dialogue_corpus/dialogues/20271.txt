Did you ever see Jurassic Park?
Yes, it is one of my all time favorite movies!
Mine as well!  I think Steven Spielberg did a great job directing this movie.
What year was it released again?
1993 was when it was released.
Do you know who wrote the screenplay?
Michael Crichton and David Koepp wrote the screenplay for this blockbuster.
Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill did a phenomenal job in it.
Samuel L Jackson was my favorite actor in the film. He played a scientist who tried to help get things right after all the plant went down.
I think Jeff Goldblum was mine.  He played the mathematician, and was hilarious in most of it.
I loved how they showed the dinosaurs, it was really well done for the story line.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
When they escaped from the veloceraptors, that was the best.
Most of the big theme parks have made different rides having to do with Jurassic Park themes.
That would be exciting to visit one like that.
I think Laura Dern did a great job in it too.
Jurassic Park never left you bored, that's for sure.
The next movie I liked was Jurassic World, it was amazing too.
Jurassic World was outstanding too, I wonder who directed that one.
The movies both did very well in the box office.
