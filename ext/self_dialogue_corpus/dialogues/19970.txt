What do you think of Portugal the Man's new album?
The one with Feel It Still?
That's the one.
Yeah, I guess. I'm not sure
What do you mean?
The song is catchy, but also very pop. I'm torn
Is that a bad thing?
Not really, it's just not Portugal the Man's usual style
That's true, especially compared to in the Mountain Clouds.
Exactly and the Satanic Satanist. But in the Mountain Clouds only dropped like two years ago.
I see what you're saying. So you don't like it?
I do. Like I said I'm torn.
They always switch up their styles though, between every album
Exactly, and that's generally the mark of a good artist.
Exactly! Don't be such an old man.
You're right. I have to give the whole album a listen through.
Well it just came out. I think it's on Spotify
Really? I'll have to give it a listen
Yeah, let me know what you think. They come to town next month
Oh let's go to that concert for sure
