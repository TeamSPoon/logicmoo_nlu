What's the difference between Hip Hop and Rap Music?
Well Hip Hop is from back in the days like the 90s and rap is the new stuff.
Well Rap developed from Hip Hop. Gangster rap started around the early 90's. As were Hip Hop deals with the 5 elements.
What are the 5 elements!?
The 5 elements are how Hip Hop was developed. You needed your DJ (disc jockey) and during his time is when DJ's became DJ's and began to scratch records. The Break dancers. The graffiti artists. The EmCee (mc) which is the rapper beatboxing.
Who are the top rappers from the 90s then?
I don't really see it that way but there is an order to how everyone has contributed to hip hop. People will automatically say Tupac and Biggie but KRS1 opened doors for knowlegde to be rapped about. LL cool J was or first FLASHY rapper with big chains and excessive women.
Ok so who is your favorite rapper?
I like many rappers for many reasons. Some give me knowledge, hope and drive others help me have a good time and never forget where Im from. Im a big NAS fan.
I like Nas too.
