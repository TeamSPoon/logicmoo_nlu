Have you listened to Harry Styles' new songs.
Yeah, I saw him perform on Saturday Night Live and looked up a few YouTube videos.
What do you think of them?
I didn't care for them at first.
Really? That is surprising.
They remind me of John Lennon.
And how is that a bad thing?
It felt inauthentic at first, like he was relying on other artists' methods for success.
Ah, I can understand why you feel that way.
The songs have grown on me though.
Ha, I knew you would come around!
The songs are a great fit for his voice.
Yes, he sounds a lot more mature.
I agree, much more so than all the other One Direction solo efforts.
Do you like any other of the groups' solo music?
Zayn's stuff has been great, very fitting.
Yes, I expected him to go the R&B, hip-hop route.
It suits his personality much more than One Direction's cheesy pop music.
Zayn's stuff are my favorite of all the other band members.
I agree, but Harry's is coming in a close second.
