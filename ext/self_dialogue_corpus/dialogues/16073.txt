Are you going to Glastonbury this weekend?
Yes. I can't wait!
Which bands are you hoping to see?
The Foo Fighters of course, and Ed Sheeran, and I thought I might check out some of the bands playing the Other Stage.
Oh yes, I think British Sea Power are playing on Saturday afternoon.
I haven't heard their recent stuff, but I liked the old album The Decline of British Sea Power.
And it's a funny album name! I think they are playing quite early so it could be quite chilled out.
Do you know what stage BadBadNotGood are playing?
In my programme it says they are at the West Holts Stage. I am going to need to check the site map!
Oh yes, they are playing on Saturday afternoon. Didn't they win the RAdio 6 album of the year last year?
I think so, and the Avalanches are on the same stage a bit later. That might be worth checking out.
There are so many good bands, it is hard to choose which ones to see.
I quite like to see one or two bands I have never heard of to see if they are any good.
Yes, but there are so many I want to see that I can't fit it all in.
I found an app to help work out what to see and when with maps of the site
That sounds brilliant. Does it give recommendations too?
Yes, it suggests bands you might like based on ones you have selected.
Can you send me a link?
No problem. Let's try and meet up at one of the stages on Saturday.
Great plan. I'll send you my programme so you can see where I am planning to be.
