Did you ever get around to seeing Moana?
Yes. It is one of my favorite movies now.
Me too. I love how family friendly it is.
I agree. I enjoy just as much as my 3 year old niece.
My younger cousins love the song that the crab sings.
Oh, you're talking about the song "Shiny". That song was really funny.
On the topic of songs, I was surprised that Dwayne Johnson sang for his role.
Yeah, I didn't expect that from him, and his character was really funny too.
I agree. The chemistry between Moana and Maui was great.
I wonder if they're planning on making a sequel, so we can see what the characters are up to now.
