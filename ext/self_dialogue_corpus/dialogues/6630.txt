I just love the Little Mermaid, it's my favorite Disney movie!
Me too!
Growing up I always wanted to be Ariel and find my Prince Eric.
I just wanted to have a dad that could control the weather!
Haha that would have been a good trait to have, especially on those days when a snow day could have really come in handy!
When I was a kid, I had a Sebastian stuffed animal that I carried everywhere. I could never decide whether he was a crab or a lobster though!
I think he was a lobster. I had a Ariel barbie doll that I took with me to the pool every summer.
The one with the clip on tail?
That's the one! She swam with me and we sang "Part of Your World," my mom thought it was hilarious!
I had the same doll! I always pretended I was diving in the shipwreck like she did at the beginning of the movie!
