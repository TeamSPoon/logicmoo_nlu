Do you think the Han Solo stand alone movie will explain about how he got the Falcon?
I hope so, and how he met Chewy.  Best team in movie history.
I hope Lando has some good parts in it too.  One of the most underrated Characters in Star Wars history.
He definitely needs plenty of screen time.
I hope Harrison Ford makes some type of appearance in it.
Like in the beginning, talking to a young Ben Solo before he becomes Kilo Ren.
Exactly like that.  I understand Harrison is older than dirt and cannot play young Han but you have to tip your hat to the original.
It should be good, I also hope they find a way to get Vader and some other Star Wars characters in there.
I'm sure they will.  They always do find a way, and I hope they use a good plot device to get them in there.
Great way to start the movie, Leah says to Han, "tell Ben how you met Chewy" Han says "I've got a bad feeling about this"
