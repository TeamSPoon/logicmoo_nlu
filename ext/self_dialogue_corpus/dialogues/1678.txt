Who do you think the greatest quarterback of all time is?
That's a tough one. I don't know if it's Manning or Montana for me.
What about Brady?
What about him?
You don't think he deserves to be in the conversation?
Nope. I think if he would've had the same career without the controversy we'd have that conversation.
You're crazy, what controversy?
Where have you been? Deflategate, spy gate, do those ring a bell?
Let's be honest here though, none of those determined whether or not Brady won the games.
Are you kidding me? How is cheating not related to gaining an unfair advantage over the other team?
Because even if those events wouldn't have happened Brady still would have won.
You don't know that.
And you don't know that he would've lost if he didn't.
I have a pretty good idea.
I guess we'll never know, so until that happens he's a winner.
Yea, winner with an asterisk.
Come on, hes the greatest quarterback of all time.
No, he's the greatest QB who had to resort to cheating.
So you don't think he would've won the same without cheating?
No I do not.
