Hey, how was your weekend?
Not bad.  How about yours?
Pretty good.  I saw a movie that I really enjoyed.
Which movie?
It was called 'Split.'
Is that an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
Yeah.  Starring James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy.
How was it?  I sort of lost faith in M. Night after 'The Last Airbender.'
This was really good.  I think it may be the comeback for M. Night.
It's about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three girls right?
Yea.  It's really unique.
I'll check it out.  It can't be worse than 'Lady in the Water.'
That was such a bad movie.  Don't forget 'After Earth.'
That one was actually worse, and wasted Will Smith's talent.
It really was.  I can't say anything else about 'Split' without giving anything away, but there are connections with M. Night's previous films.
Now I'm really excited about it.  Who is Anya Taylor-Joy?
She was in the movie 'Barry' and in 'Witch.'
Oh, I saw 'Witch.'  She's incredibly talented.
She was perfect for this role.  Same with James McAvoy.
I am a big James McAvoy fan.  I will see the movie this weekend.
