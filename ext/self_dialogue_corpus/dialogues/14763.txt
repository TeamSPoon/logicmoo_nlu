I wish we had something funny to watch!
We do actually! I just bought Dumb and Dumber.
Seriously? That is one of my all time favirotes!
I love Jim Carey movies!
Me and you both! He is great.
Have you ever seen Liar Liar?
Yes! That is also a funny one.
Most of his movies are funny except for a few.
That is true. He is very talented.
No doubt about it. He is an all time great for sure!
