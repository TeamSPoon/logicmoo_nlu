My Bengals were trash last year.
Huge trash.  What happened there?
Things just fell apart.  Couldn't score, couldn't defend.
Sounds like a good recipe for losing.
And lose they did.  I thought Marvin Lewis was a goner.
He was on the hot seat for quite a while.
I'm glad they didn't fire him though.
He's a good coach, but you can only do so much.
I don't think that Andy Dalton is the right answer though.
He's the definition of an average QB.
Not bad, not great, but not somebody who will get you to the Super Bowl.
But they have nobody behind him right.
Right.  He's the best you can do.
I do think he's got a real weapon to throw to though in AJ Green.
Yeah, straight beast and a top 5 receive in the league.
He was injured a lot last year I think.
Yeah, bad year for him.
Sounds like a bad year for all the Bengals in general.
I think if they stay healthy, they'll be in the thick of it.
Hopefully.  I can't stand the Steelers in that division.
