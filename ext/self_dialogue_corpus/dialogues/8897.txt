Did you know that Tool is releasing a new album?
Are you serious? No, I had no idea.
Yeah, apparently its coming out soon and they're also going to tour again.
Wow. I'd pretty much given up on Manyard ever doing anything with Tool again.
I know, when he started yet another side band, I figured Tool was done.
At least all of his side bands are really good.
True. I really do like A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.
I went and saw Puscifer last year.
How were they?
Incredible, but unfortunately, Manyard made use all promise not to talk about it.
