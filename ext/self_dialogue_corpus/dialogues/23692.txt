What did you think about the Twilight movies?
I only saw the first one.
Only the first one?  You didn't like it?
Not really.  I don't like Kristen Stewart's acting at all.
Oh, she was perfect as Bella.
I think she is just an emotionless actress.  I didn't want to see her anymore.
So you didn't watch the other movies?
Exactly.  I did read the books though.
Did you like those?
I finished the series in a week.
Wow.  So you never want to see the movies?
Nope.  I just feel it would ruin the books for me.
All because of Kristen Stewart?
Not totally.  She's a big part of it, but I didn't like the movie.
What did you think about Robert Pattinson?
I didn't think he was worth swooning over.
Wow, so you didn't like any of the actors?
I thought a lot of the characters did not match up to what I had in mind.
Did any of the characters meet your expectations?
That Taylor guy was okay as Jacob I guess.  The vampires were pretty much off.
