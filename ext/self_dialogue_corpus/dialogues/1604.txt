What do you think about the new football rules.
I like some of them.
Yeah some of them need to provide more safety.
I agree.
People could get hurt bad.
There are alot of concussions.
I think that if they break something they should be pulled out.
but it is there job.
I agree but it is their body too.
Yeah I never though of it that way.
Some are fathers to kids and that is dangerous.
Yeah something bad could happen.
Concussions are bad in the nfl.
I agree.
I am glad there are rules in place for that.
I am too.
It is good they check the players out.
Yeah something severe could happen.
It could cost some their lifes.
It could also cost them their careers.
