Do you like Lady Gaga's music?
I like her music but have never like her stage name, sounds like a baby.
I loved her in this years Superbowl half-time show. I hated how some people wrote negative remarks about her weight and some of her outfits.
Some people a just bullies. She is tiny and I did not think that she had a big belly.
When she sang at the superbowl, I could not believe how many songs that I knew that she sang.
She has had alot of top hits, my favorite is Poker Face.
Did you know that her parents stilll have the same home and phone number, as when she grew up.
No, bet that phone rings off the hook. I heard she was bullied so much when she was in high school.
I heard that too! She was pushed in lockers and once they threw in a trash can.
Maybe that is why she is such an advacte against bullying. I wish more people in view of the public could be more like her.
