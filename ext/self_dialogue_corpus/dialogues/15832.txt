What kind of new music do you like that has come out recently?
I am an old guy I know hardly any new music that comes out.
Does anything even come out any more?
Some things do I know but it was not like it used to be.
Yes with computers the whole game seems to have changed.
Music isn't as much of a hobby as it used to be.
Yes, I do not see kids today just sitting in a room and listening to music like we did.
I do not either.
They seem to be watching funny videos on youtube instead.
I would listen to the same Led Zeppelin tape over and over again.
I had a fee favorites I would listen to all the time.
We could only afford a few tapes
It was rare to get a new tape.
I had Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath as my favorites.
Yuck did you listen to Crazy Train.
Yes it was amazing when I think about it the stuff my parents let me listen to.
There were songs about drugs and everything else on those albums.
My mom had no idea what was going on.
Even when sweet leaf was playing she didn;t not seem to notice.
They could not understand the lyrics anyway.
