Did you ever notice the connection between Star Wars and Et: The Extra Terrestrial?
No!  Seriously there's a connection?
Yes.  If you watch ET, you will see Yoda, and if you watch Star Wars, you'll see ET.
I remember ET in Star Wars.  He was in the senate in episodes 1-3, right?
Yes!  Good memory.
But where was Yoda in ET?
Well, remember when they went trick-or-treating on Halloween?
Yeah
A kid was dressed up as Yoda, and when ET saw him, he signaled him as if he knew him.
Wow!  Mind blown!
