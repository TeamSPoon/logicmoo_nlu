Do you want to go see a horror show tonight.
Sure.  I saw that Screemdream is out now.  Looks pretty scary.
No.  I like the old B rated horror flicks like the ones they play at 5th avenue.
Oh, that sounds good.  Something like "The Swamp Thing".
Exactly, an old black and white flick.  I think the original Dracula is playing.
With Bela Lugosi?
Yeah, that's a classic for sure.
Ok, that sounds good.  But next week we've got to go see something modern like Light's Out.
I've heard that one will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Yeah, I've heard it's an unsettling, fright-filled experience.
