When you were growing up, did you have a favorite NFL coach?
I think coaches are usually overrated. But I liked Tom Landry.
I remember Tom Landry. He's the one that always wore a fedora hat. I don't remember what happened to him.
When Jerry Jones bought the team, he fired Tom Landry.
That must've made a lot of people mad.
It did for a while, but Jerry Jones hired Jimmy Johnson and they started winning.
Do people think Jimmy Johnson was the reason they started winning? I wonder what it was that he did.
They drafted a bunch of young players, pretty much started from scratch.
That must've been when they hired Troy Aikman.
Yeah, they drafted a bunch of players around that time that went on to become Hall of Famers.
I remember they beat the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.
I remember that game, the Buffalo Bills went to four straight Super Bowls. They never could win one though.
Was that when Emmitt Smith was rushing for the Dallas Cowboys?
Yeah, Dallas drafted Emmitt Smith about the same time as Troy Aikman.
I think they got Michael Irvin at the same time as well.
Troy Aikman, Emmett Smith, and Michael Irvin. Are they all in the Hall of Fame?
All three of them. Emmitt Smith was the last one to be inducted.
Emma Smith, one of the greatest running backs ever. I seem to remember he played a few seasons in Arizona.
I think he went on to Arizona when he should've retired. He must've hated to stop playing.
Haven't heard much about Emmitt Smith since he retired. Out of the three, the one I see the most is Troy Aikman as an announcer.
