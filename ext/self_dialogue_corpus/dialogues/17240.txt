Would you like to spend the night at my house tonight?
Sounds good to me, what can we do?
I thought we could lift weights and listen to some music.
Sounds great, I have not listened to some good music in a while!
Yea I have some awesome CD's that we can check out.
What kind of music is on them?
I have a lot of Slipknot songs. Do you like them?
To be honest, I am not really familiar with their music.
You have not heard Left Behind, or Before I Forget?
I do not think that I have. I could  give them a shot though.
Great, I will let you listen to a few of their songs and see if you like them or not.
That will be fine with me, I may discover a new favorite!
You never know! I enjoy trying out new music personally.
What other types of music do you have?
I also have a lot of Fort Minor songs. Have you ever listened to them?
Yes, I used to love a few of their songs actually. Which ones do you have?
I have several; are you familiar with Remember The Name, or Where'd You Go?
Yes! Those are actually two of their songs that I used to listen to all the time.
They were both released in 2005 and were solid hits.
Both of those tracks used to get jammed in my room quite a bit!
