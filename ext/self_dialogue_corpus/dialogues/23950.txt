Hey. Do you like prison movies?
Prison movies? You mean true crime stuff?
No. I mean a drama.  Like what you would see in the theater.
I'm a huge action fan.
I think you'd like an older film by the name of The Shawshank Redemption.
I dunno.  That doesn't sound very appealing to me.
It was nominated for a boat load of Oscars in 1994.
What?  Get out of here. No way.
It actually lost out best picture to Forrest Gump.
Forrest Gump. I remember that one.
Yeah.  They came out the same year.
Funny.  I don't remember this Shawshank movie.
There are a lot of others like you who didn't either.  Do you like Stephen King?
I love Stephen King.  His books are my favorite.
The Shawshank Redemption is based on one of his novellas.
I really liked most of his movies.
Shawshank only got more and more popular years later.
It must have been like a cult movie or something.
I guess you could say that.
I'll have to check it out some time.
