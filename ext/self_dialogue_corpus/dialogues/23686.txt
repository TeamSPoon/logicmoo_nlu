I am watching this movie right now and it is quite horrible
What movie is it
The one with batman villians in it without batman
Suicide squad?
Yeah that one
I saw it in theaters last  year
What did you think of it?
I hated it to be honest the movie is just low quality
That is what  i am getting so far from the movie
Your better off just turning it off
Well  i already invested time into it
Well if you want but it is my advice
Did you like any of the movie
I did like one or two things that is about it
What things were they
I liked the premise and i like will smiths acting
I mean out of all the main players he is the best
The rest are just cookie cutter
That would be lightly describing it
Well i will give you a full review soon
