Have you been watching the NHL playoffs?
I watched a game last night.
Who did you watch?
Pittsburgh versus Ottawa.
I watched that game too.
Did you see the goal by Phil Kessel?
Yes, he just doesn't quit.
I know right! I thought it was funny how he was talking to himself on the sidelines.
That was funny. Did he play in Minnesota?
He might have went to college there.
What do you want to win this series?
I am rooting for Ottawa.
Me too. I would like to see them win, it's nice to have different teams in the finals.
I agree.
Have you watched any other games?
I've been watching Nashville a little.
I like Nashville too.
Maybe they will go all the way.
Don't you just love the Stanley cup playoffs?
Yes, nothing else like it.
