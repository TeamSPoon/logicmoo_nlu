Are you ready for some football?
Yes, I can't wait, I really hope the Rams do good this season.
Do you think they will start of with Jared Goff?
I hope so, he really needs to prove that he is a franchise player.
I don't know he has not lived up to the expectations of a franchise player.
I know, I am worried about it, he has to show something.
Agreed, hopefully he has improved over the summer.
How about you, are you high on your team, the Saints?
Yes, I think we got Drew Brees a decent defense, I think we will get back into the playoffs.
I really do want to see Brees in the playoffs, he is a top 3 quarterback and really deserves more post season success.
Exactly, he has been lighting up the league, imagine if he had a good defense.
Yep, I think they would have won a few more Superbowls.
Well, I'll be happy as long as the Patriots don't win again, I really don't like their arrogance.
I agree, hopefully they get taken out early and not make the Superbowl so we can see new teams.
Yep, I kind of want them to miss the post season, but more likely they win more than 12 games again this season.
Yeah that's a safe bet.
Any teams you think will be a surprise this season?
Maybe Miami, they may come out of nowhere and do good.
I don't think so, I think the Bears may surprise.
Well one thing is for certain, this season will be a roller coaster.
