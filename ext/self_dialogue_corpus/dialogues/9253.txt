Alot of early Rock music came out of Memphis.
That's where I am from.
Really that's interesting. Have you been to Sun Studios?
No, but I worked down the street from there.
Carl Perkins, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all recorded there.
Johnny Cash did too.
Memphis is a big music town.
They have alot of live music rock shows too.
I loved Elvis' "Blue Suede Shoes".
Elvis could really move those hips and bang out some rock and roll.
