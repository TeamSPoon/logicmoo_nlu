Did you see the match between the St. Louis Blues and the Nashville Predators last week?
Yeah, I cannot believe that Nashville is in the semi finals.
I know. They have never made it this far into the playoffs. Did you think the would win that series against the Blues?
Never. But the forward Joe Pavleski is their top leading scorer an was able to pull through in the final game and lead them 3-1.
Do you know who they are playing in the conference finals?
Yea they are going to play the Anaheim Ducks.
Are the Anaheim Ducks any good?
Yeah they are good, they just beat the Edmonton Oilers in a pretty good series?
Oh yeah, that went to seven games didnt it?
Yep. Seven game series and the Ducks ended up winning at home in Game seven 2-1, it was a nailbiter.
Who is playing in the conference finals on the other side?
Pittsburgh Penguins are playing against the Ottowa Senators.
Oh that should be a good matchup, has Crosby been playing well?
No he has actually had an injured ankle and almost didnt play the last series in game 7.
Who did they play last series?
It was a great series, the Penguins played the Washington Capitals and won game 7 2-0.
Wow, who do you think will make it to the Stanley Cup?
I am rooting for Nashville since they have never made it there.
What about between the Penguins and the Senators?
Depends, if Crosby is healthy I think the Penguins. If he is not, I would say the Senators will win.
