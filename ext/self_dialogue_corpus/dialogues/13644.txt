Who do you like better, R2D2 or C3PO?
I don't know if that is a fair comparison.  I mean, R2D2 never speaks English.
But he's so cute!
Well, by never speaking English, he can't be as annoying at C3PO.
You think C3PO is annoying?
Yes, he's pompous.  I don't even care when they take him apart.
The only thing I don't like is how he doesn't know who Luke is in the first movie.
Well, that just shows it wasn't well planned.
I also don't like how they don't explain what happened to his arm in the new movie.
I read that was just to show that time had passed.
