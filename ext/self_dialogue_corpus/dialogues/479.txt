Yea, I am not sure about the Seahawks. I believe more in the Patriots.
Yea, I'm not sure. I just feel like the Patriots have to lose eventually.
Yea, whose gonna beat them? The Jets?
HA! Thats laughable. Talk about a disgrace of a team.
Yea, they really seem to be going nowhere fast.
Exactly! Miami could pose a challenge though.
Yea, I'm just not sold on Ryan Tannehill yet. Are you?
I'm not sure about him either, but he has a nice supporting cast.
I agree, but eventually he has to just do it or not.
He is still just a middle of the road quarterback.
Yea, Miami needs a top flight quarterback if they really want to do good.
Yea, I agree, but he has not proven to do that yet.
Yea, I agree. They have some good receivers and playmakers, but he hasn't proven much yet.
Yea, Miami just hasn't done much.
Yea, even if they have some success, I'm not sure that they can take down New England.
Yea, New England just continues to get stronger and especially with their addition of a star cornerback.
Yea, they just keep getting better.
They sure use free agency that way it is intended to be.
Yea, they do build through the draft, but fill holes through free agency.
Yea, well that is definitely the right way to do it.
