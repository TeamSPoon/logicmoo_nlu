I just saw the Manchuian Candidate for the first time.
Which one?
Is there more that one?
There was the original in the 60's and then a remake.
It must have been the remake. It had Denzel in it.
Definitely the remake.
It was pretty good.
Yeah. I thought it was OK.
How was the original?
Super bizzar.
