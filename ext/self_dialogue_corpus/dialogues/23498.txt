I was looking through my DVD's and found a great movie.
Which one is that?
Identity.
How old is that? Don't recognize the name.
Early 2000's I think.
Who's in it?
John Cusack and Ray Liotta.
Is it an action movie?
No it's a thriller.
Don't know it.
I'll lend it to you, it was very good.
What's it about?
Well, ten strangers end up at a motel in a storm. One by one they end up getting killed.
Is Liotta the killer? He plays good nuts.
Nope, but if he was I wouldn't tell you.
Is it just a random person?
No. You could keep guessing but you won't figure it out.
Okay, well I guess I'll have to watch it.
It's only ninety minutes but boy does it have a lot happening.
Good, I'll watch it this weekend.
