What DIsney movies are out?
I know Cars 3 just got released.
Oh, fun! I loved the first one!
Me, too. My kids have always loved watching the first one.
Mine, too. But none of us like the sequels.
Nah, but the third one is getting really good reviews.
Maybe we'll try it. It has to be better than Captain Underpants, right?
I would think so! Let me know how it is.
I will. My kids will probably be quoting it for weeks.
Speed? I am speed!
