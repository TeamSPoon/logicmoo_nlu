Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest? I can't get enough.
I can't say that I have, sport. Tell me all about it.
It's called "Boys, Boys, Boys" and it's the best. I'll sing it if you want.
I have to be honest, I have no idea who she is. Is she that girl who wore the meat dress?
Oh yes, exactly. And my second favorite is "Disco Heaven" and my third favorite is "Don't Speak" but I think that might be someone else.
Hmmm. I'll wiki it. You are correct, it is someone else. Hey, you're a little late; those were released like 9 years ago.
But I just bought them today so they're new to me.
Can't argue with that logic. So something like "The Cure" from this year isn't new?
I haven't bought it yet. All me all the time, that's how I live.
I fear for the future.
