I heard that the new Tom Cruise Mummy movie didn't do so hot its opening weekend.
I guess his movie star mojo works better in Mission Impossible movies.
Personally, I prefer the classic Universal horror films anyway. Nothing will ever top them.
Those creaky old things? They're so...old.
My friend, you do not appreciate the masterfulness of the original Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man, and Mummy movies. They are amazing.
They're in black and white. Boring.
Karloff was incredible. His stage presence, even playing Frankenstein's Monster with no dialogue.
Not my cup of tea. Now Freddy Krueger, that's a horror villain.
Nah, modern horror films are mostly shock cuts and gouts of blood. Just watch the original Dracula with the lights out, you'll pee your pants.
Okay, maybe I'll rent one-- just one, mind you-- and check it out. Draculal - I thought Lugosi was badass in that movie about Ed Wood.
