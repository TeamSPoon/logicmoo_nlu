Hey are you ready for the falcon game?
Yeah i can't wait.
Do you know who they are up against?
I think the NE Pats.
The patriots?
Yeah you think they will win?
I'm not sure what do you think?
Maybe who knows.
I do like tom brady
Oh yeah, i saw a video on him on youtube
What was it about?
How far he can throw a ball.
Really how far was it
I think it was like 250 yards
Wow he must have a cannon arm.
Yeah he's a very good QB.
However i'm going with the falcons
I'm going with the pats.
We will see who will win
I guess we will.
