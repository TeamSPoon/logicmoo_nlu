Here's what I'm wondering.. why is Michael Vick been giving a second chance, when someone like Pete Rose can't get the time of day?
Well, those are two different circumstances. Rose bet on baseball knowing that was THE cardinal sin in the game and that it would likely bring on a lifetime ban if he was caught.. then he stoutly lied about it for years
Yeah, sure, but is that worse that what Vick?
Well, plus Vick DID serve a prison sentence, and, cruel as it might sound, there's no rule in football against running a dog fight operation.
Still say it's a crappy situation.
Hey, I'm not saying I endorse what he did by any means, but still... anyway let's change the subject shall we?
Yeah, that sounds good.
So, do you think Donald Brown will make a big impact for the Indianapolis Colts?
I really like him  in the colts offense.. he's like Joseph addai but with fewer miles on him..
You, switching subjects... I think it was a snub to Jamie Moyer to move him to the bull pen when he's been the best pitcher Philly has had in awhile.
I don't know, I mean, I like the guy a lot but but he hasn't been the phils best pitcher of late.
What do you mean?
Well, his era was 3rd worst in the nl when he was sent to the bullpen
I don't know, not sure you could say it's been THAT bad.
I'm sorry, but it has.  I mean, the guy at 46 just is not functioning like he did at 45.  Something about this last year...
He'll always be the best to me though.
I think the next games will be interesting to see what shakes up with the time.
Well, they've been pushing Pedro a lot.
Yeah, I know he got like what, 10 runs last time?
No, 12.
