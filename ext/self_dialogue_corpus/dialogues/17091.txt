So, what type of music do you prefer?
I really enjoy country music for the most part!
Me to! My whole family actually enjoys country music.
My favorite group is Rascal Flats. I have always liked them.
I like them as well, which songs do you like the most?
My favorite from them is that song I Melt.
That one came out a long time ago, right?
Yea, it really helped turn them into a popular band.
I love that song Fast Cars and Freedom.
Yea that is a good one as well. I love to listen to it when I travel.
Have you ever heard What Hurts The Most?
Yes! That song is my mom's favorite song of all time.
Cool, it is not my favorite ever; but I do really like it.
My dad sings sometimes at local festivals and he sang their song I Like The Sound Of That.
Wow, I would have liked to heard his version of it!
My dream is to see Rascal Flats in concert one day.
Yea, that would be really cool. Especially for you and your family since you guys are big country fans.
I know, my mom and dad had tickets one time but something came up and they could not go.
That is so unfortunate! I really hate that for them.
I know, they were really depressed about not being able to go.
