I don't know if I want to see that new Baywatch movie or not.
I'm not sure if I'm going to see it either.
It looked kind of silly, but I heard Zac Efron is in it.
Isn't he from High School Musical?
Yeah he is, but he looks a lot different now.
All I can think of when I think of Zac Efron is high school musical.
Zac Efron was good in Neighbors if you saw that.
I didn't see that yet. Is it worth a watch?
I think so if you like comedies.
Yeah I do. I think I'd like it.
