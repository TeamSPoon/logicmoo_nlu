Isn't it great that the Beatles just reissued Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
I heard about it has something to do with the album's 50th anniversary right?
Yeah, they made a regular reissue, a double-cd version, and a super deluxe edition.
What comes in the super deluxe edition?
It has a total of four CDs, a blu-ray, a DVD, a book, and some other collectible inserts.
Sounds awesome!
It's so cool to hear demos and alternate versions of some of their classics, especially "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "A Day in the Life".
Wait a minute, "Strawberry Fields" wasn't on Sgt. Pepper's originally.
Several takes were included on one of the bonus discs for this collection, since the song was recorded during the same sessions.
That makes sense - I'll have to pick up a copy!
