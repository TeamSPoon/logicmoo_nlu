My favorite 60s band was Paul Revere and the Raiders.
Wasn't that the leader's real name?
Yes, Paul Revere Dick.
What were some of their hits?
Like, Long Hair was their first hit in 1961.
Didn't they do a Chuck Berry song?
Louie, Louie in 1963.
Cool. Didn't they have a name change?
They became The Raiders in the 70s.
By then I think they were out of fashion.
