Okay, yes, Gal Gadot needs to have a resurrection or whatever they do that brings back supposedly killed off characters!
Is that right? That's going to be weird. They killed him off in Tokyo Drift, and then he came back in the Justin Lin ones since they were suppose to have occurred before Tokyo Drift.
Yeah the whole sequence is a bit confusing if you haven't been following the series the whole way through.
If I remember correctly it goes The Fast and The Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast and Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, Tokyo Drift, Furious 7, The Fate of the Furious.
You got it. That's the correct chronological order.
It always throws me off since there was also that one short after the first and second one where it covers Paul Walker's trip to Miami and obtaining that Skyline.
The bonus feature, not a lot of people have seen that or know that it exist.
Yeah it's a fun extra for the fans. I'm looking forward to seeing if they do bring Han back somehow. I wouldn't be surprised.
Yeah they brought back Michelle Rodriguez' character, so I'm not surprised if Han comes back and Gal Gadot needs to come back too!
