What's going on Brett? You looking at Fandango?
Yeah man, I just wanted to pick up a movie ticket for this Saturday.
What is playing at that local 5 theater cinema?
I think that theater only shows older movies, but they are showing Inside Out.
That is the Pixar film right? Which one is that about?
A bunch of different emotions inside a child's mind, we experience emotions having emotions I think.
That sounds in depth and crazy! But it is animated...
Yeah that is why I really wanted to see it.
I know it is cheaper on DVD, but this movie might be better in the theatre.
Very true, I know it won a few oscars and awards.
This movie got rated incredibly high on Rotten Tomatoes too!
People said when it first came out it might be the best Pixar film ever!
Wow, we are convincing ourselves to see this film.
Haha indeed! I think we should go today instead of Saturday!
That sounds awesome, let us clear our plans and get some snacks.
This is gonna be great, we are going to experience some true nostalgia.
We used to see Pixar and Disney films all the time, I can't wait.
I am glad we agreed to see this movie.
So am I, this is gonna be fun.
Maybe we can go to Disneyland after!
