Have you seen Interstellar?
Yea, it took me a while to get to it but I did.
What did you think?
It was not really for me, some parts of it were good ideas though.
What parts did you not like.
The whole love part was somewhat weird and did not really fit.
How about the Martian?
I thought that was a much more enjoyable movie.
Yea, the book is great too.
There was so much boring stuff in that movie, like growing potatoes, but it was still interesting and funny.
That's one of my favorite things about the movie too.
No other movie can you talk about the math of growing plants and hold the audience.
Speaking of space movies, how about Gravity?
I thought that was the worst of the three.
I agree, there was so much stupid stuff.
Like physically impossible things were happening left and right.
Space shows and movies should definitely be realistic when portraying it.
The way she catapulted back when she cut herself loose was terrible.
I was laughing when I saw that.
Me too, I could not contain myself.
