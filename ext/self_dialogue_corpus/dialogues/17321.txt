Have you listened to any of George Strait's music?
I have heard some of his songs and I like most of them.  Do you?
I do!  I think he is one of the best ever for country music.
He is pretty good I have to admit.  Do you have a favorite song?
It's very hard to choose.  I think if i had to say I'd say Troubador.
That's a good one! My favorite is The Fireman.
I like that one too!  His songs are just timeless.
They really are. I mean, stuff he came out with thirty years ago could be hits today.
I agree with that.  Do you have any other favorite country artists?
For new country I do like a little of Thomas Rett.  What about you?
I like some of his stuff.  I also like a little of Dirks Bentley.
That song What Was I Thinkin' is really good!  Have you ever heard of Wade Bowen?
He sounds familiar.  What does he sing?
He sings that song Mood Ring. Have you heard it?
I have and I really like it!  I didn't know who's song it was though.
It's his.  He's got some others that are also good.
I'm not that familiar with his stuff.  I'll have to check him out online.
You should definitely do that.  Oh, and check out Whiskey Myers if you've never heard of them.
Are they a country band?
They are a combination of country and southern rock.  I think you'll like their music.
