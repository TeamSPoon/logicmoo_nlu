Rock music just isn't what it used to be.
There are a few good bands out right now, some cool songs.
I can't get into the new stuff. Metallica's putting out fresh material but the newer bands just don't do it for me.
What about Highly Suspect, do you like them?
Yeah, they're alright. My Name is Human is a cool track.
What about Kings of Leon, have you heard their music?
They're actually my favorite of the newer rock bands. They're pretty good.
Hey, did you know Axl Rose was touring with AC/DC?
Yeah man, it's a shame about Brian Johnson.
Yeah, the dude has basically lost his hearing. He's officially deaf.
I wish Motley Crue would get back together and make some new music.
Those dudes have been off and on for most of their careers. Unfortunately, I think they're done for good.
I bet Vince can still sing though and I know Nikki Sixx is still rocking a mean guitar.
What about the Chili Peppers?
Yeah, you're right. They're putting out new music.
It's not as good as there old stuff though.
Flea is as good as ever though. When his bass riff start to play, you immediately know it's him.
Yeah, he has such a unique sound. His style is completely original.
Those dudes have been playing together for well over 30 years now.
Yeah, it's amazing how they've been able to sustain the band's success given all their personal trials and tribulations.
