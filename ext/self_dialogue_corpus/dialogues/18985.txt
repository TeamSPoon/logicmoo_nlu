Did you like George Michael more when he was in Wham! or when he was a solo artist?
If forced to decide, I would lean slightly towards Wham!, but he was a great solo artist.
Totally agree, Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go is one of my favorite 80s songs.
Really? I would have pegged you more as a Careless Whisper kind of guy.
In terms of his slower songs, I much prefer Father Figure.
Yeah, they're both very similar. The 80s had tons of ballads in those styles.
That's my favorite type of 80s music, especially those ballad type pop songs that were associated with movies.
You mean like Hungry Eyes from Dirty Dancing or Man in Motion from St. Elmo's Fire?
Exactly, I love that synth heavy style.
What about new wave? That was also synth heavy.
I also enjoyed that. However, I found many of those groups like Duran Duran overrated.
Really? They define the 80s for me. You know they were the first group to incorporate models into their music videos?
All I know is that their songs Rio and Hungry Like the Wolf sound very similar.
I agree, but they were both great songs so I can look past that.
Fair, but I preferred other new wave groups to Duran Duran, such as Culture Club and ABC.
I am not familiar with ABC, who are they?
They were an English band that had hits like Poison Arrow and The Look of Love.
I'll have to check them out. I love obscure 80s groups.
Well speaking of obscure 80s music, are you familiar with the group Modern English?
Of course! I Melt with You is a classic 1980s song.
