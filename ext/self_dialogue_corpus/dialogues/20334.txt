So I heard some news you're just going to love.
Hit me with it.
There's apparently a new trailer out for Pitch Perfect 3.
You're kidding me.
Nope, they made yet another one.
Why?  This story is old.  Just let it go!
Sorry Elsa, they ain't letting go.
They only did this because the second one make a lot of cash.
Right.  And they are cheap to make.
What's the premise of this one?
Not sure yet, haven't seen the trailer.
I would guess a lot more scat jokes and fat jokes at Amy's expense.
Probably.  It worked the first two times.
Who is in it?
All the original cast, they're all back again I believe.
This just sounds dreadful.  I don't even want to watch the trailer.
It's probably one of those movies you'll have to see though because everybody else will see it.
I know, I just hate that I have to do that to remain socially relevant.
You're a brave man.
I know.  Buy my ticket for me, please.
