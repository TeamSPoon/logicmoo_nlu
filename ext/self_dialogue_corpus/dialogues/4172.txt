Have you seen that thriller movie "Ghost in the Shell" with Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah, I saw it last month. I was surprised that I liked it.
Why, what did you expect going in?
Oh, I thought it might just be mindless action, something short on plot and just loud.
So, did it have a good plot? Isn't it a remake of a Japanese movie?
It's based on a Japanese manga, a comic of the same name. And the plot gave me something to think about later.
Oh, I like that kind of plot. Makes me want to see the movie again.
I would see it again so that I can pay more attention to the detailed sets and the little things now that I know what's going to happen.
Were there any other big name stars? Names I might recognize?
You'd recognize the French actress Juliette Binoche. We saw her play Bryan Cranston's wife in the Godzilla movie that came out in 2014.
