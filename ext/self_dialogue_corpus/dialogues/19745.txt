who is your favorite singer
I like too many to have one favorite but I do like Shania Twain
oh ya she's hot good taste so you like country music
I do but it wasn't always that way
why what do you mean
I grew up loving 60's and 70s' rock n roll but got turned on to country in the mid 90's
That's cool I've been to a couple of country concerts how about you
Ya I've been to dozens, Chesney 5 times he's the best when it come to live music
I never saw him but I did see Garth Brooks he was awesome.
Maybe we should go to a show I hear Zach Brown is coming to our town this summer
sound like a plan love his beach music
me too it would be the first time I would see him
did you like disco back in the day
oh some I love the bee gees but some disco I didn't like
I was always a stone's fan
they have been around since music started
for sure that's why they are so good
can't argue that and I did see them once.
that must have been awesome
it was I still have the ticket stubs
