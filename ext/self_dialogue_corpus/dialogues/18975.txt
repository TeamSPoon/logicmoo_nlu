Do you like 80s music?
Oh yeah that's my favorite genre.
What's your favorite singer or group from the 80s?
That's a hard one, there's so many. I guess New Edition is my favorite 80s group
Yeah I used to stay listening to them but I loved El Debarge.
Oh The Rhythm of the Night. That's definitely a dance classic.
And New Edition did have some great ones. Popcorn Love and Mr. Telephone Man.
Very catchy lyrics. Do you remember A-Ha?
They did that song Take on Me. Best video ever to this day in my opinion.
And Phil Collins was real big in the 80s with Genesis.
Right I'd have to say Against All Odds is my favorite of his.
Mine would have to be Coming In The Air Tonight.
Yes that's my song too. I loved Richard Marx and Bryan Adams in the 80s.
Everything I do, I do it for you. That song still makes me cry.
And Bryan Adams' Have you Ever Really Loved a Woman.
That spanish guitar is to die for. I just heard that song the other day.
They sure knew how to make love ballads in the 80s.
My favorite ballad from that era is definitely More than Words from Extreme.
That is such a beautiful song. A guy named Frankie J redid it not too long ago.
He really did put his own spin on it. I love his voice.
