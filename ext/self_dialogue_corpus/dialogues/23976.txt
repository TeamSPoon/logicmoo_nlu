Do you like Rob Reiner Films?
I only know a few.
Which ones do you know?
Alex and Emma.
I do not know if I know that one, who plays in it?
Kate Hudson is the leading lady.
Oh, with the Wilson actor right?
Yes, it was cute romance.
She was hired to help write his book.
And they fell in love through the story.
I do not know why that one did not do well.
At the time the actors were not that famous.
Do you like any more of his movies?
I liked the one called North.
That was one of the first for Elijah Wood.
He was so cute with his new families.
That film also had one of Scarlet Johnason's first too.
I did not even notice her in it.
I loved Bruce Willis as the sort of magic bunny.
That whole show was so big and fun.
