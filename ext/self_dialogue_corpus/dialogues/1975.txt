What's good, man? How are the Chiefs looking this year?
We're looking good, man. We're looking good!
AFC is stacked this year.
Yeah. Pats, Ravens, Chiefs, Steelers...
It's going to be a great year.
NFC is looking decent too.
Oh yeah. I want Brees to win one more.
That defense, man... they're ALWAYS letting him down.
Tell me about it. He's probably, technically, the best QB in the game.
Well... he's no Tom Brady.
That's true. I'm also ready to see Lynch return.
Oh, yeah. That's gonna be sick!
He's gonna be running DOWN people.
No doubt. And then with Carr on the team...
They're looking good, for sure. Hopefully, they can do better than last year.
I think they will. Carr is just maturing.
He reminds me of Cam a lot. I hope he rebounds.
I think he will. He was really hurt a lot last year.
True that. Well, I'll hit you up next month for a preseason game.
Sounds good to me, man. See you then.
