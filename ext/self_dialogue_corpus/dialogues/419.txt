Let's talk about the NFL.
Sounds good to me.
What is your favorite team?
The Patroits.
Mine too!
Do you have a favorite player?
No, actually I don't.
That is rather interesting.
Brady is decent though.
I agree, no one is like him.
Have you been to any games recently?
No I have not.
That is too bad.
Yeah but hopefully next year I can go.
Have you watched all of the games?
Yeah.
Were you happy with the SuperBowl win?
Totally!
Well it was great talking to you!
Same.
