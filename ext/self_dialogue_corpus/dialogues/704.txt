Are you going to any NFL games this upcoming season?
I hope so! We usually get partial season tickets.
For which team?
The Giants.
Ah, that's good. They have exciting games.
Yea, they're definitely better than the Jets.
Are tickets to the Giants and Jets the same price?
Honestly, I never even checked for the Jets.
I don't blame you.
Right. Besides, my uncle is a Cowboys fan.
Ah, so the Giants Cowboys games are the most important to him
Yea for the only reason that he wants to make it a competition with my dad
Do you always get those tickets for that game?
Usually. I sometimes don't get to go though.
Why not?
If my dad and uncle are going, sometimes they want to bring my grandpa with them
Ohh. Does your grandpa like the Giants?
Of course! Although he says hes a "New York" fan
What does that mean?
That he'll root for the Jets too!
