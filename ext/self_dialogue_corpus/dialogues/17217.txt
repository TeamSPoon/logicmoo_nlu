Who's your favorite singer for 2017 so far?
Either Katy Perry or Adele.
Katy has been on fire this year especially since it's a touring year for her. What's your favorite song so far from her new released?
My favorite new Katy son is Bon Appetite. it has such a catchy beat and she sounds really good in it.
I love the video. I think my favorite new Katy song is Chained To The Rhythm. It's so smooth, takes me to another place.
It reminds me of the the Jessie J, Price Tag song.
You're right, it does use a bit of the same beat.
I like Chained To The Rhythm too, but Bon Appetite is my favorite current Katy song.
Is that your favorite Katy song of all time?
No, there are so many Katy favorites all time that I can't just name one.
Where would you rank her Dark Horse?
Dark Horse would definitely be in the top 10 for me. It's such a cool beat.
I have it somewhere between Firework, Roar, and E.T.
Oh, E.T. is a great one, especially with Kanye on that track.
Come to think of it, I don't think I can name one particular top favorite because like you, I have so many.
I'm looking forward to catching one of her show tours when it comes around. I've been hearing good things about the performances and song choices.
She probably has a few of her classics in there.
Oh no doubt, you know she has to have it there.
People have been waiting for her to come back and she's finally back!
Bigger and better than ever before!
