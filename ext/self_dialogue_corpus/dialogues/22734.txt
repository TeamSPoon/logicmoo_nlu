I just do not like Marvel movies.
How can you not like them?
I think the plot is always the same?
The good guy beats the bad guy?
No, like in X-men it is always just getting over people not liking them.
Because the are mutant?
Yes, since they are new.
Well, the last one actually said mutants had been around for a long time.
What movie was that?
X-Men Apocalypse.
Really? I thought the other ones said they were fairly new?
No, even the old trilogy said they did not know.
I really miss the Jean Grey actress in the old ones.
Her name is Famke Jannesen.
Do you think Sophie Turner is a good replacement?
I mean, she seems like a new take on it.
In the old ones Jean Grey dies.
No, not any more.
Why not?
Days of Future Past changed the story of the old ones, they do not even matter any more.
