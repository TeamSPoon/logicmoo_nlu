Do you like the direction Disney is heading in terms of movies?
Yes, I feel like Disney movies have only gotten better as the years progressed. I am optimistic about the future.
I like Disney movies from all of its history, however I do like how the girls are portrayed as more strong lately.
I would have to agree with you there.
In what way do you think Disney movies are getting better?
The stories are just so true to life these days. For instance, Moana really struck a chord with me.
That was definitely a departure from classic princess stories.
Yes, and yet it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
Did you like the music in it? I thought that song "You're Welcome" was hilarious.
Yes, I feel that Moana's soundtrack is in the top 5 of Disney soundtracks.
