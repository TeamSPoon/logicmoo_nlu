Have you seen the movie concussion?
Yes I did. It was sad to see the stuff that went on.
Didn't make the NFL look to good.
No it did not.
I didn't realize how bad it was back then.
I didn't either.
It was an eye opener.
For me and a lot of people it was.
Will smith was fantastic.
He was outstanding!
David Morse as Mike Webster was unreal.
God that was sad to see.
It was terrible.
Alec Baldwin played a great part too.
Yes he did. I like him a lot.
He is a very good actor.
Albert Brooks was really good too.
He was also.
At least the NFL has changed how they treat concussions now.
Yes,the movie helped a lot.
