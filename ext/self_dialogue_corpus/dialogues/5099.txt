So you pitched?
Yeah, In high school. varsity. Saved a few games, actually.
Nice. How fast is your fastball?
I'mm a side armer, so my fast ball isn't my forte, you know.
Ok, what is? Curve ball? Slider?
Slider definitely. I got it to a point where it spirals.
The thing is, though, it could spiral all it wants, if it goes over the plate straight, it's useless
Yep, yep. my curve does that. But my slider, it spirals right up to the plate.
Nice. That must be hard to hit.
Yep, yep. I used to love watching that slide up and way into the right corner of the box.
You said you saved a few games?
Yeah, i get tired easily, so I didn't start much, but I can shut out a team for a few innings.
Nice. That's gotta be a bummer though. Not being able to start much.
Well, it's a team game. I don't mind. This one time We were up by 2 and it was the 5 inning. And boom, all of sudden they were up by 3 point.
So they scored 5 points nonstop?
Yeah, just back to back. They were just banging it out. So I was told to go in
Man, that's some nerve racking job.
Yeah, but I did Ok. Shut them down pretty quick with my sliders.
Spirals, up and away eh?
Yep. Up and away into the right corner. Straight to the top corner.
