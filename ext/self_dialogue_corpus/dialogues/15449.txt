Hey, what are your thoughts on Bon Iver's latest CD "22, A Million"?
Trying way too hard. Like it's tailor made for the Urban Outfitters crowd.
That's what I thought.
What kind of song name is "21 M♢♢N WATER"? It's all so extra.
What made his earlier music so haunting was the simplicity. I'm not a fan of this new direction.
What was your favorite Bon Iver song from his earlier stuff?
I've always loved "Holocene" from the 2011 "Bon Iver" album.
Me too! I just want to grab a blanket and sit in a cabin in the woods.
That's his whole aesthetic. Or was his whole aesthetic.
Did you know Justin Vernon came up with the idea for Bon Iver when he had mono?
I did know that? He was cooped up in his dad's cabin in Wisconsin, right?
The stuff of legends, no? That's probably why his first CD is so melancholy.
A Pitchfork review I read of "22 Million" tries to argue that it's experimental but they are still "deeply felt songs about uncertainty."
I mean, I guess I could see that. The sound of the songs doesn't show it as much, but maybe the lyrics do.
Like, "I'm unorphaned in our northern lights / Dedicoding every daemon." What does that even mean?
Who knows. But it feels like it should be deep.
Or in "33 GOD"-- "When we leave this room it's gone." Trippy, man.
Not the masterpiece of "Re: Stacks" but maybe I'll give it another listen. With the lyrics in front of me.
Otherwise you'll miss the whole thing. I'll give it a run through again.
Then. listen to "Skinny Love" on repeat after it's all done.
