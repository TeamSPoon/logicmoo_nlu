Frank Zappa is really famous.
I know. Everyone's heard of him.
I'm not sure I could name a single song.
He has a ton.
What are some good ones?
"Don't Eat Yellow Snow."
No. Really.
Really.
That's what it's called?
It's a good tune.
Is it funny?
If you're ten years old.
Any others?
There's a best of you should check out.
Is "Don't Eat Yellow Snow" on it?
You bet.
I will. Any proper albums I should hear?
He has too many to recommend just one.
So I'll just get the compilation.
It came out on Rykodisc Records, I think.
