I am so pumped for football season! IT will be here before we know it!
Me too! I  can't wait
Who do you have winning the Superbowl this year?
I have to pull for the Seahawks.
The Seahawks? Really?
Yeah!Who else is it gonna be?
I have to go with my COWBOYS!
The cowboys? You're joking, right??
No! You saw them last season! And it was their first season with Dak as QB
That was just a fluke
A fluke?? No way. More like destiny and a little preview of what they have to build on for the future
(laughs) yeah, right.
You'll see.   What makes you think the Seahawks are gonna pull it off anyway?
Just a good feeling...and look at their team! They are stacked
(laughs)  Thats about the worst reason I have ever heard.
Just wait and see!
They play each other at some point in the season.
Yeah, they do.... And the Seahawks are going to stomp the cowboys
I guess we will see when they play on December 24.
I guess so! It'll be an interesting Christmas Eve, for sure.
