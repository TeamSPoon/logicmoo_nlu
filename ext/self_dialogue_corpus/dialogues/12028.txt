Did you watch the scene after the credits in The Force Awakens?
Of course I did!
I can't believe Luke Skywalker is just hiding on an island.
Me either! It's so funny!
It's funny that they went through all the trouble to find the map piece.
It made for a fun movie though.
Yes it did!
Luke Skywalker's and Rey's stand off was everything to me!
I loved that part!
I can only hope that they are somehow related.
