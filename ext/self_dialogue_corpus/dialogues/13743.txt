Have you ever been to a Lady Gaga concert?
Yes, I saw here in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans arena.
Did you watch the season of American Horror Story that Lady Gaga was on?
Yes, it was really good.  She won a Golden Globe award for it.
Did you know she was named Billboard's woman of the year in 2015?
No, I didn't know that but she has her own organization called the Born This Way Foundation which is cool.
Yeah, I love that she tries to promote youth empowerment and stands up against bullying.
She's a great role model.  She has a couple drinks at Starbucks too.  I want to try them!
I saw that!  It's called the Cups of Kindness Collection!  Which drink do you want to try?
The Ombre pink drink looks really pretty but the violet drink sounds delicious!
