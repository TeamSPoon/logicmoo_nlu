You know, I am tired of a lot of movies they come out with these days.
Why is that?
They are either essentially a remake of an old story, or full of crude humor.
That's true. Sometimes I feel like Hollywood is running out of ideas for good movies.
I have started to watch a lot of movies from before our time and I am really enjoying them.
How old are we talking here?
Well lately I have been on a Doris Day kick.
What is the most recent movie of hers that you watched?
I watched Pillow Talk just the other day.
That has Rock Hudson in it as well, right?
It sure does. What a classic combo!
They were very good together.
What is your favorite older movie?
Well, I guess I would have to say State Fair.
That is an old one, but a good one!
I really like the way of life from back then. It seemed simpler.
How do you feel about musicals?
I like them. I haven't seen too many though.
I really enjoy South Pacific. I think it is a fantastic movie.
Maybe I will have to try to watch that one.
