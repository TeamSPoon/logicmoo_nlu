There are lots of bad sequels, but what are some good ones?
I think all of the Harry Potter sequels are as good as the original.
I felt that way about Lord of The Rings.
Those sequels seemed to get better with time.
I think the scenery in those movies are just breath taking.
Most of that was filmed in New Zealand.
Wow, I thought it was fake.
No, most is real.
So, what are some that are better than the original.
Jeez that is hard, it would have to be a Star Wars one I think.
Which film?
I think Empire Strikes back is better than A New Hope.
See, I thought A New Hope was the best, it was so new and mildly happy.
What sequel would you say is better than?
I think the second Captain America was better than the first.
The Winter Soldier?
Yes, it showed so much more humanity with Steve Rogers.
I did like the role Bucky played.
I think the second Avengers is better as well.
It felt like we got to know the characters better at least.
