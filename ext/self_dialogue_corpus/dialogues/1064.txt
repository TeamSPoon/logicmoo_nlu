Did you watch the NFL Draft?
Yes, it was boring though.
What do you mean? The Browns got their first pick!
The Browns will still be at the bottom of the league, they are awful.
Years of mismanagement and bad contracts.
And Johnny Manziel? That was a disaster.
You aren't even a Browns fan - imagine how we feel about it.
True, true. Steelers are still going to win their game against the Browns though.
Maybe, we'll see - Ohio sports have had a revival recently - The Cavs, the Indians, the Blue Jackets - all are competitive teams now!
Too bad the Browns can't get any of their players!
Ha ha, Very Funny. Who do you think will win the Big Game, though?
It has to be the Steelers. Big Ben is getting old and he needs another ring before turning it in.
He has to stay healthy, though.
Tell me about it, he is made of glass.
I never hope for injuries, but I wouldn't complain if we had to go against your 2nd string in our meeting.
Steelers can beat the Browns with a cardboard cut out of Big Ben!
Well, Good luck this season - I think we both agree - anyone but the Patriots!
Absolutely! I just hope it's my boys in black and gold.
And I hope it's my Browns! Good to talk to you!
You Too! Go Steelers!
