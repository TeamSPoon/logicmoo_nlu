I really love the Discover Weekly feature on Spotify.
Oh? Why?
It does a pretty incredible job of picking out songs I wouldn't have found otherwise but which really suit my taste.
That's pretty cool. What is it exactly?
It's a playlist that updates every week with songs they think you'll like.
Is it all new music?
It is mostly new, though it has some older things that you've never listened to before in it as well.
Cool, I'll have to check it out.
You should. I've never had a bad song in mine, and there is usually at least 1 per week that winds up being a favorite.
What is in yours this week?
It has Sander Kleinenberg, ZHU, Stanton Warriors, Pablo Nouvelle, and a bunch of others I don't think I'd heard of before.
Sounds pretty solid, though yours is a bit heavy on techno for me.
The more you listen on Spotify the better it gets. So if you listen to rock that is what will be in there.
I listen to a lot of things though, what would happen then?
It will give you a mix of things based on how often you listen to each.
That is pretty cool.
It's like having a friend with really good taste make you a mixtape every week.
God I remember those, they were always fun.
Well if you liked that you will love this.
Cool. I will have to try it.
