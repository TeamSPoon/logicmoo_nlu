Hey, do you like the new Fast & Furious?
It was ok, I really miss Paul Walker through.
Yes, that was a terrible shame.
The last FF movie was so sad.
Yes, that song at the end literally had me in tears.
What a beautiful man, such a shame.
I know right? But Vin Diesel is hott.
Heck yeah he is! I like the all the movies, they are all entertaining.
Yes, definately. Especially the special effects..
I can watch them all a few times each.
