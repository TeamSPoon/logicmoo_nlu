Hey you haven't seen the new Star Wars movie have you.
Nope. That last trilogy killed all the Star Wars love in me.
Come on, really? You didnt like the action in them?
Yea Darth Maul was pretty much the best thing about them and he got cut in two in the first movie.
Agreed, but still they look amazing and there's alot of awesome characters. Like General uh what's his name? half robot half...
..Grevious.
Haha. You knew his name! You do love everything Star Wars! Even the sequels!
OK. Ok. But they really pissed me off with all the plot junk. Where's the emotion? Not in the horrible romance between Anakin and Natalie Portman...
..Princess Amidala
..whatever..But yea you're right- they can be enjoyed for just the shear action. Dump the rest.
