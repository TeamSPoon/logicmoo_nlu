What is the craziest play you have ever heard of in NFL history?
Oh I'd have to say it was the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders in 1972.
Thats an incredibly old game.
Yeah it's way before your time but let me tell you. You'll never see another play like that ever,
So what happened in this game?
Pittsburgh was down 7 to 6 with 22 seconds left and had a fourth and tenth situation at their 40 line.
Sounds like a bad situation.
Oh it was, If I was on the team at that time I'd assume it's game over at this point.
So what happened next?
The quarterback which was Terry Bradshaw at the time threw a pass intended for one of his teammates I can't remember who.
I take it he didn't find his mark?
No the throw got blocked by one of the raiders and the ball went flying off screen.
Then what happened?
One of the steelers Franco Harris I believe managed to catch the ball keeping it in play.
No way.
Yes sir, he then sprinted his way to the goal making his team take the lead with 5 seconds left on the clock.
That is amazing I'll have to look up that play.
It was such an impossible play that it's been named "The Immaculate Reception".
That's pretty funny.
It was an amazing thing to see. Like I said that will never happen again in the NFL.
