Do you know of any good new bands I should listen to?
I don't know how new they are but I've been listening to a band called Seapony lately.
I've never heard of them before. What kind of music do they play?
It's just indie rock. They have a female singer and they just have simple, nice and catchy songs.
Very cool, what are some bands that they sound like?
Maybe a cross between Cat Power and The Lemonheads.
Sounds interesting. What's the name of a recent album of theirs and what's a good song on that album?
The most recent album is called A Vision. There's a lot of good songs on that album but if I had to pick one I'd say that the song Let Go in really good.
I will see if I can find that song. Maybe I'll download it to my phone and give it a listen while I'm driving home later.
If you want I can send you a YouTube link to some songs so that you can preview them and see if it's something you'd like.
