what type of music do you listen to
I like Jazz
really like who do you listen to
I love Miles Davis
thats kind of old
yes but it is classic Jazz
What about maybe more modern Jazz/Pop type music
If I had to pick someone I would say Sade
what is your favorite song of hers
I would say Smooth Operator
oh yes that one was really popular
it became played on more pop stations but it is a great one
I think she brought back some of the old Jazz sound and made it a bit modern
I agree, she was a leader in that
who else do you like
John Coltrane
That is one person that I just do not care for his music
really why
I just do not like the sound
he is classic but the sound is a bit different
