Were you into Red Hot Chili Peppers?
Yes, still am.
Yeah, they're pretty great. Some good songs.
My favorite is still Californication
Really, that seems like some of their overrated work.
No way, I have some good memories with that one.
I have to go with Give it Away Now
Yeah, everyone likes that one.
They've been around since 1983.
Man, that's crazy. Durable band.
