Hey, have you heard of Harry Potter?
... you can't be serious right now can you?
I'm so Sirius my last name is black. Hahaha.
Wow... just... wow.  I didn't know you were a potter fan,  what is your favorite book?
I really enjoyed the prizoner of azkaban.
My favorite book was the goblet of fire. I also liked the movie adaptation because I'm a big robert Pattenson fan.
Meh, he's ok I guess.  Rupert grint is my faster actor in the movies.
Yeah he's good,  that reminds me of the scene in the half blood prince where Ron drinks the love potion.  SO FUNNY!
Wait,  no spoilers! I'm only up to the order of the Phoenix!!
Oops, sorry pal.  Better get back to reading!
