There's this weird thing in the Star Wars prequels no one ever talks about. It's about the Chancellorship.
What about the Chancellorship?
So, in Episode I Chancellor Valorum gets voted out, and Palpatine is voted into office, right?
So what's wrong with that? Besides him being a Sith Lord, I mean.
Well, the weird thing is that Mas Amedda, who was Valorum's Vice Chancellor, stays on as Palpatine's Vice as well.
That would be like if Dick Cheney stayed on as Vice President to Barack Obama. That is weird.
Yeah, and no one questioned it really. Except the Jedi eventually.
Why did the Jedi care?
I don't know if it's canon anymore or not, but they thought it was a little weird, and figured he was the Sith Lord behind the war.
It would make sense, seeing how he was able to maintain power under two administrations. Too bad they were all wrong.
