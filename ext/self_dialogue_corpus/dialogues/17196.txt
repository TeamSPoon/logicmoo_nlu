Are you a Doors fan?
Yes, one of the best bands of the 60's and 70's.
Call me odd.  But anytime I do something and it's the last time I always have "This is the End" stuck in my head.
I thought I was the only one that did that.
Guess not.  But all there songs have this psychological feel to them.
Yeah, and Jim Morrison wrote some outstanding lyrics in his day.
Like Riders of the Storm.
That's an awesome song.  What else did they do?
So many others.  Maybe my favorite Road House Blues.
Oh yeah!  I woke up this morning and I go myself a beer!
Best part of the song.
What about People Are Strange?
Great song, another good one is Touch Me Baby.
Yes!  I used to change people's screen savers to the lyrics to that.
Ha!  That's a great prank.
Good song too.  How about Light My Fire.
Yep another good one.
A little off topic but did you see the Doors movie?
Yeah it was good.
Val Kilmer was perfect as Jim Morrison.
