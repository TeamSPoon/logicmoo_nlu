What is your favorite action movie?
My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.
That's an interesting choice.
How so?
Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.
I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.
That's true, he never killed an innocent person.
Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.
I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.
Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film.
