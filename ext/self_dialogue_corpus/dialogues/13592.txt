Remember that sand creature in the original STAR WARS?
Yes, they were really scary.
Their heads were all wrapped up.
And their eyes where through those round metal things.
They made strange noises.
It was scary when they attacked Luke.
And the tore off C3-PO's arm!
Fortunately Ben Kenoby showed up to help Luke.
Like it was meant to be.
And they the arm back on.
