Do you like Michael Jackson?
His music? Of course.
I think he was the best pop aritst of all time, no joke.
Yes, I would put him in my top 5.
I just think he was so avant garde for his time.
Agreed, I think he was judged so harsh though by the public.
Yes, that was really sad. His music was amazing, though.
His albums span how many decades?
Three, I would say.
Which album is your favorite?
It's a toss up between Thriller and Bad.
I LOVE Thriller, it's amazing.
Besides the title song, the whole album flows together so well.
I do really like Bad too, though.
I don't know if this counts, but I also enjoy his greatest hits album.
It counts! I love an album with all the hits.
I just think he made so many good songs.
I agree, he stands the test of time forever.
I wish he was still here to make more music!
Me too, RIP.
