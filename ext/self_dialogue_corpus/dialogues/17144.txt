Did you see the Radiohead set at Glastonbury?
I saw some of it, but I admit I fell asleep in front of the TV when they were on.
I thought they were great, a good mix of old and new stuff.
A bit too self-indulgent for my liking: who plays Pulk/Pull if they want to have a good time?
But you can't fault No Surprises...
You're right, that at least is a singalong classic.
And Fake Plastic Trees?
Again, good, but for everyone one of those there's a Weird Fishes.
You must have been happy they played Creep though.
I guess, though I find it a bit cringey now.
Tell you what else made me cringe. All the old acts coming back.
Like Craig David?
Exactly like Craig David.
I reckon 90% of the audience were there ironically.
I did like Barry Gibb though. So many classics.
It's only sad that these days so many people only know the Bee Gees because so many people cover them.
I tell you what Glastonbury was missing this year though. A strong female stand-out figure.
Like Rihanna, Beyonce?
This year the best they could come up with Katy Perry. I like her but where's the girl power?
I know what you mean.
