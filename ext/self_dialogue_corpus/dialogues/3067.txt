Football isn't coming soon enough
I know. I can't wait for preseason to start?
Who looks good so far
Miami. It is about time
Really, I was thinking Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh has had its time. Need someone new.
What about Carolina?
Cam choked last season after getting to the Superbowl?
Atlanta might do well.
Yeah, they play different than the other teams.
I can't wait for the Dallas vs. Philadelphia game
Me too. Big NFC rivalry.
As long as the Giants are losing, I am fine.
Or the Patriots. We need someone different.
How about those Raiders, moving again?
They seem to move a lot, First Oakland, then LA, then Oakland again.
Could be worse, like Baltimore going to Indianapolis.
That was a long time ago, and Baltimore has embraced their Ravens
Who knows, maybe we will get another team soon.
Or just have one move, again.
