One major thing we have in common is our love for the NFL. Would you agree?
Oh absolutely. I love football in general, but of course the NFL is where it's at.
Refresh me, if you would. Who is your team?
I am from Cleveland, so of course, I love my Browns.
Ah, hey, I respect that. I am a Denver fan.
The Broncos are a great team. I am sure you were a very happy guy last year?
Oh, absolutely. I was at the edge of my seat for that entire game.
It was just such a great way for Manning to go out, also.
That's what I thought. Do you think he would've gone another year if they hadn't won?
It is quite possible. He was very determined to get that last ring.
I also really respect that he retired quietly.
That was really respectable of him. Payton did not want to take anything away from the team.
He sure didn't. He is simply an pro.
Do you think he could go on to be a commentator?
I wouldn't rule that out, no. I could see him perhaps on Sports Center.
If he were to do it, I don't think it would be anytime soon.
No? Why do you say that?
Because I think he would want to enjoy retirement for the time being.
Good point. That being said, he was such an awesome quarterback.
Definitely. I think he will go down as one the greatest!
