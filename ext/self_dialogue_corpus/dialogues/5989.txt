Do you remember Toy Story?
Are you talking about the original film?
Yes I am.
That movie is the best!
Haha yes I watched it again recently, it was really great.
Wow was it good the second time.
Since I first saw it many years ago, I really enjoyed watching it now.
Wow that is interesting.
Yes it was super funny, usually I dont laugh at comedies the second time, but this one I did.
I really like to laugh, so I plan on watching it again too, thank you for telling me this.
