Do you like Star Trek movies?
No, I am a Star Wars fan.
You can like both franchises and their films.
I mean, are we talking the old ones too?
Yes, the feature films.
I think the older ones were silly.
What did you think of the newer ones.
With Chris Pine as Captain Kirk?
Yeah, post 2000 versions.
I think he was a good person to play Kirk.
He has that cheeky but big heart look.
Yes, I like that they rewrote the time line.
I think that is always a fun plot device with space travel.
I guess Star Wars never would do that would they?
That might mess with the force too much.
Well, JJ Abrams is behind the wheel of both films now.
Jeez, I hope they do not start feeling like the other, you know?
I think one can like both, but they should never feel similar.
If the Enterprise shows up in Star Wars, then I will worry.
Fun fact, there was a cameo of that ship in the Empire Strikes back, in the back ground.
