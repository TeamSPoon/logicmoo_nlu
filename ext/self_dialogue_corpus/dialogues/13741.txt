Hey how do you like the newest Lady Gaga's album?
Are you talking about "Joanne?" Yes I love it!
What do you love about the album?
I don't know it just sounds different from her previous album. It is not like I don't like her other albums though.
I like the song "Hey Girl" from that album.
Why do you like that song so much?
Well, it features my other favorite singer; Florence Welch.
Also that song has this late 80s and early 90s vibe in it.
I agree. It has that electric acoustics as background music.
I agree. Also the beat is so 90s!
