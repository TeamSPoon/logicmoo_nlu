I'm really excited for the upcoming season.
Yeah, me too.  I'm thinking New England is the team to beat again.
I know, still in shock on what they did to Atlanta last year.
That may be the biggest choke job every.  Can believe they blew that lead.
They will come out on fire this year but will have a hard time winning that division.
Carolina will be tough to be know that they will have a run game.
Even Tampa will push them, their offense looks good and they have a solid quick defense.
I'm not sure who will come out of the NFC.  Seattle and Green Bay should still be tough, thinking Dallas declines a little.
I hope Dallas is terrible, they are my least favorite team.
The way they run the ball is crazy.
Best O-line in the league.  They blow the defense back 5 years before Elliot hits the line.
I'm rooting for Washington, I want to see Cousins throw for 5,000 yards.
I'm surprised they have not given hit a long term deal.
Well they'll need to next year if they want to keep him.  He needs to cut down the INT's though.
Does it matter?  It's New Englands league to lose.
They are they best all around team.  I'm sick of seeing them win.
I want them to make the playoffs and lose by about 70 in the first round
That would be awesome, watching Brady turn into a turn over machine.
He needs to retire so there can be some new blood in the AFC.
I'd like to see the Raiders, take them down.
