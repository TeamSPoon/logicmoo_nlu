I think a lot of football players have some really cool nicknames.
Like William, the Refrigerator, Perry.,
Did you know he already weighed 200 pounds when he was only eleven years old?
That's massive.
I always liked the name Broadway Joe Namath.
I think it was fitting for him.
Remember the cheesy Noxzema commercial he did?
That was pretty funny.
What about Dick Lane who was known as the Night Train?
Let me guess. It was because he ran over people like a train?
Actually no. It's because he would travel by train to out of town games because he was afraid of flying.
I would not have guessed that one.
What about The Assassin?
You mean Jack Tatum? I would be afraid to play against him given his reputation.
I think a really sweet one is Lance, Bambi, Alworth.
I don't think I would like that nickname if I was a football player. You know a really cool one?
What?
The Nigerian Nightmare.
That was really fitting for Christian Okoye.
Especially since he was really from Nigeria.
