What are your thoughts on the Washington Redskins?
Decent team with a strong heritage
Have they won any Super Bowls?
Oh sure, back in 82, 87 and 91
Oh so it's been awhile
Yeah, they had Joe Gibbs as a coach and he was legendary
What have they done recently?
They've made the play-offs a number of times recently, but haven't gone far.
Who's their current QB?
Kirk Cousins. He's okay, but not Tom Brady.
Oh man, Brady is the greatest.
Yeah, he's pretty great.
Who are the Redskins' biggest rivals?
I would say the Cowboys, Eagles and Giants.
Oh, they all play in the same division right?
Yes, the NFC East
Some call it the NFC Least
Well, depends on the year.
Well, hopefully they'll be competitive this year.
Yeah, agree. Always good to have a good NFC East division.
