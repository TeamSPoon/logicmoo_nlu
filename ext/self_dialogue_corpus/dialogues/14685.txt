Did you hear about the game between the Celtics and the Wizards?
It was a really close game!
Yea, I really thought the Celtics were going to close out the series.
Yea me too, I didn't expect that.
The Wizards are hard to beat at their home stadium.
That's for sure.
Are you planning to watch the Spurs and Golden State Warriors game on Sunday?
Yes, I think that'll be a really interesting game to watch.
I agree, that'll be Golden State's toughest test to date in the playoffs.
Hopefully Kawhi Leonard will be healthy for the game...
Yea that'll give the Spurs a better chance to beat the Warriors.
Lemarcus Aldridge needs to play well in this series also.
True, he is starting to pick up his productions in the playoffs.
Yea, this may help them have a chance against the Warriors.
Also, the Spurs need better bench productivity as Tony Parker is hurt.
I concur. They need to rely on their back up point guards to play well.
Patty Mills has to run the team effectively in Tony Parker's place.
I think so too. Patty Mills needs to run the offense well and continue to shoot well.
However, with that being said I still think Golden State will win easily.
Yea I think the series will not go past five games.
