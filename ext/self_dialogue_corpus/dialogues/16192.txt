I am thinking of going to a concert
What concert
The one downtown next week
oh that sounds cool
It will be
How much is it
45 dollars
Is that not a bit much
Not at all
Who is the headliner
Danzig
That sounds good but is he not old
But he can still sing
I guess that is true
Yeah it is
I wonder how he sounds
I do not care about that
Why not
He is a legend
I guess
