Who is to blame for Anakin's fall?  Qui-Gon or the Emperor?
That's an interesting question.  I think it's a bunch of factors together.
If you had to choose between the two options though?
I think the Emperor then.  Because Qui-Gon saw the potential and good in Anakin, which was still a path for him when they met.
I guess if it weren't for the Emperor, Anakin's potential for evil would not have been met.
If anything though, wouldn't the Tuskan Raiders who killed Anakin's mother have more blame?
Definitely more than Qui-Gon.  What about Padm√© you think?
Well, I don't think she chose to die.  You can't blame characters for falling in love.
I guess that's a good point.  Lots of different factors led to Anakin's demise.
It's definitely sad that it happened, but it led to Darth Vader, the coolest sci-fi villain of all time.
