What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I think her first single, Just Dance, is probably her best song.
I agree, her best music is probably her earliest songs.
Definitely, her later music starts to get a little strange.
I once saw her infamous meat dress at the rock and roll hall of fame.
That must have been interesting
It was, I was shocked by how small it was.
Really?  I never realized Lady Gaga was very thin.
Neither did I.
I look forward to the music she creates in the future.
