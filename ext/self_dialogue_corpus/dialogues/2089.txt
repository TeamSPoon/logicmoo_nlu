So how about those Cowboys, huh?
I'm looking forward to the upcoming season!
You know I'm a Giants fan, but I gotta ask an honest question, do you think Dak Prescott's gonna have a sophmore slump?
I hope not! He's the future of the Cowboys! I kind of expect it though.
I'm looking forward to the Giants shutting him down twice a season.
I don't know about the Giants defense, though, can any of your defensive backs cover Dez Bryant?
I like our chances. How about you guys and covering Odell Beckham?
You guys got a lot of great receivers now, but it's gonna be hard to take advantage when we knock Eli on his back!
Eh.. we'll see.
You guys still got Ereck Flowers, and our pass rush is dangerous.
True, Eli's gonna have to get rid of the ball quickly, but our defensive line is good, too!
Well, yeah, but the Cowboys have a great offensive line. Why do you think Prescott and Elliott tore defenses to shreds last season?
We know what's coming, and we'll be ready!
I certainly hope so. It's still gonna be some great games, but you know I'm pulling for the Cowboys until the day I die.
The Giants/Cowboys Sunday Night week 1 has become a tradition.
Too bad we don't play each other on Thanksgiving.
I think it's about time the Giants got to play on Thanksgiving, but they're playing the Redskins.
That team's a mess.
Tell me about it, their situation with Cousins is silly. Pay the man already.
Well, they paid Albert Haynesworth a whole lot of money one time and look what happened!
