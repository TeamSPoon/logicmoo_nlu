Do you want to go see Rough Night with me?
Is that a movie or a band?
It's a movie, lol.
Who's in it?
It's got  Scarlett Johansson, ZoÃ« Kravitz, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell and Ilana Glazer.
Sounds like a pretty good cast. What's it about?
It's like a female version of the Hangover.
Oh, I've heard of that one I think.
So do you want to go see it?
I'm not sure aren't the reviews pretty bad?
I think they're pretty mixed, my sister saw it and said it was really funny though.
Hmmm, maybe.
Is there something else you would rather see?
I really want to see 47 meters down.
Whats that one about?
It's about divers getting stuck on the bottom of the ocean with a bunch of sharks.
That sounds kind of scary.
It's is, but its supposed to be really good.
Can we do both?
Sure, sounds good to me.
