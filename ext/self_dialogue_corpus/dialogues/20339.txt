Do you like any musical movies?
What does that mean?
They're movies but pretty much just movie versions of a musical play.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Yeah, so do you like any particular ones?
I haven't seen many, what's a good one?
I just watched The Phantom of the Opera again, that's probably the best one.
What makes it the best?
The music is just wonderful, it's so much better than the other musicals'.
Why do you think that?
The way each song is written is just so pleasing, and the melodies are incredibly memorable.
Any songs in particular you like?
The whole scene they do where the Phantom takes the girl to his lair underground to the main theme is great.
That's kind of creepy.
Yeah there's some creepy themes that go on, but it's all really well done.
Cool, I'll definitely have to watch it sometime.
Something great about it is that you don't even have to like musicals to enjoy it.
That's good to hear, I'm not really a big fan of musicals.
I'm sure you'll like it, just watching all the costumes and scenery is enjoyable.
Wow, sounds like they really did a good job with all of that.
