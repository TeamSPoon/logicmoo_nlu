Have you seen The Incredibles?
I have, it's one of my favorite Disney movies.
Mine too. I wish they would make a second one.
I thought they were?
No, I don't think so. What other Disney movies do you like?
Cinderella is my favorite.
The song, "So this is love" is beautiful.
I like that too. When they're dancing it plays. Seems romantic.
The wicked Stepmother was awful.
She was, and so were Anastasia and Drizzella. And that awful cat Lucifer.
