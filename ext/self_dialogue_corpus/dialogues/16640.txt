Did you hear Chris Cornell died?
No, I've been living under a rock for the past week.
Very funny. They're saying it was a suicide.
Yeah I heard that, that's really sad. I recently fell in love with his cover of Prince's "Nothing Compares to You".
That's a Prince song? I thought Sinead O'Connor did that song?
She did, but it was originally written by Prince. The version Chris Cornell did was Prince's original version.
I'd love to hear it. Is it great?
It's beautiful. And you know, I'd been playing the song every day in the car, and thinking there was something so sad about Chris's version. Now I wonder...
You wonder if maybe the song was a suicide note?
No, not really, but something about his voice when he sings it.. when I hear it now, it hurts my heart.
It could be he was pouring out his emotions in the song.
Could be. It seems he did that a lot.
You know he suffered from anxiety and depression all his life?
Yes I read that after he died. It makes me feel even sadder, because I can understand what he was going through.
That's right, you suffer from severe anxiety and depression too, don't you?
Yes I do. And I think maybe now, with his death, people are starting to realize the messages in all of his past lyrics.
Right, songs like, "Fell on Black Days", "Black Hole Sun", lots of songs about depression.
Who knows, maybe a person who is depressed will seek out his music and find some comfort in it now.
Yeah like he's reaching out to them posthumously.
Hopefully it helps.
