Have you heard any good christian music lately?
I've heard lots of good christian music.
I don't listen to the radio much and I don't buy cds.
Well, how do you expect to keep up with the latest christian music?
I know. Who are some of your favorite christian singers?
That's hard to say but I love Chris Tomlin.
Chris Tomlin, what does he sing?
Have you heard of the song good good father?
I sure have. Someone was singing it on our lunch break yesterday.
Did you like it?
I sure did. I asked who sung that song but no one knew.
I guess people like the song and don't care who sings it.
Is there a cd out with that song on it?
Sure. I have the cd.
Where did you get it from?
I ordered it from amazon.com.
How much did it cost with shipping and handling and taxes?
It was $12.99 but with shipping and handling and taxes it came to $16. 97.
That's not bad. I'm going to order it when I get home.
Good. Let me know how you like the whole cd.
