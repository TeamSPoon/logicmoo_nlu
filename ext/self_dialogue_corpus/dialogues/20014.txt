Have you heard of Flotsam and Jetsam?
I know those are the eels from The Little Mermaid.
No, I'm talking about the metal band.
Oh, then no I haven't heard of them.
Not a lot of people now know of them I guess.
Why's that?
They were really big in the 80's.
Were they like a hair metal band?
It was kind of like that, there was a lot of screaming so I guess you could say that.
Was it any good?
Actually yes, much of their early stuff is good but the mixing is kind of strange.
How is it strange?
Some albums sound really piercing on the high end, and can get tiring to listen to. The music is really good though.
Do they have any newer stuff?
They've got a ton of newer stuff, and have been putting a lot of albums out lately.
What's one of the better new ones?
Their newest one, which is the self-titled album, is really good.
Is it heavy heavy metal or does it sound like 80's stuff?
Some songs are pretty heavy, but they are pretty varied. All of it is good though.
That's cool, it's nice that they're still around and productive.
