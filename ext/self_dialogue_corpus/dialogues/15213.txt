Has there ever been a song that made you cry?
Oh, definitely!
Yeah, me too. Music has that ability to make me emotional.
I'd probably say that there a lot of songs that have made me cry.
I listened to the song 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston right after my mom died, and I cried like a baby.
Yeah, that's one of the things about music - if it hits you in the right way, it can devastate you emotionally.
So, what's the song that's most provoked that emotion for you?
Hmm, I'm not sure I can think of one.
So then what's one example?
OK, I can think of one. It's probably a slightly weird one.
I doubt it's that weird. What is it?
I was listening to the Talib Kweli song called 'For Women', and at the end, I started to cry.
What made you cry?
The song just gave me so much empathy for people for whom the world has been unkind and cruel.
I've never heard the song.
Most people probably wouldn't have that reaction. I probably wouldn't have had that reaction, most times.
Yeah, I can understand that. The music hit you in exactly the right way in the moment.
It's interesting, the connection between music and emotions.
It's an intense thing!
It's good to talk about it, though.
