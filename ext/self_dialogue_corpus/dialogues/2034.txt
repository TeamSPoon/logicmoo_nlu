Looking at the upcoming schedule for the NFL, what games interesting games stand out?
Patriots and Raiders in Mexico City.
Good one. Those two teams in Mexico City with the high elevation and pollution thick enough to chew. Interesting to say the least.
The Cowboys have a string of games heading into Christmas that are insane.
Which games?
They go to Giants stadium for a rivalry, they play in Oakland, then they have the Seahawks coming into Cowboys stadium.
Oh wow. That is a rough patch. Giants have had their number and should be even better, then a rejuvenated Raiders in Oakland, then licking their wounds back home against a team like Seattle. Man.
That sandwich game in the middle with the Raiders is interesting. Cowboys will be coming in after their rivalry and Raiders will be off of a rivalry in Arrowhead vs. Kansas City.
Who does Oakland play after the Cowboys?
They go to Philly. Never know which Eagles team will show up year to year. I know they don't like Christmas though lol.
So the Raiders have to face their rival, the Cowboys, and then go into Philly on Christmas Eve where they boo Santa Claus and throw snowballs at him?
Yep. Should be a real interesting stretch late in the season with teams that are already fighting hard heading into the playoffs.
That is some insane scheduling.
Yeah the AFC West and NFC East playing each other this year makes it extra brutal for those teams in particular.
Patriots @ Broncos. Patriots struggle in Denver in the thin air. This is the week before they go to Mexico City in the Raider game.
So they'll have the back to back road games vs. tough teams in high elevation environments. The scheduling seems extra harsh this year.
A lot of good games though.
Great games, actually, but rapid fire. I shouldn't be this excited about football this early.
I know. I've barely flipped through the schedule myself and this just seems like a really intense season.
Can't wait.
