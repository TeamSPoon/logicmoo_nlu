You know what's crazy?
What?
I was always a Beatles fan but I never knew it.
How's that?
I always associated The Beatles with songs like Hard Day's Night or I Love You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. But then I discovered how many of my favorite songs are Beatles songs.
Their catalogue is huge!
Yeah, like Eleanor Rigby, Revolution, Strawberry Fields, Blackbirds. So many great songs.
Right! And it's great when you get into their full albums, like Magical Mystery Tour or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Here Comes the Sun. I love that one.
Me too! I could fall asleep to that song!
