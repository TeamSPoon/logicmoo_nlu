Is it true that Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush are buying the Miami Marlins?
I thought this was joke at first but wow haha.
Right? That seems like strange bedfellows, no?
Money brings people together I guess. It says their is other bidders too.
Yeah, I'm reading Tom Glavine is involved in one of the groups that are bidding.
They have that new ballpark already, you'd think that new ownership would have a clear path to make their investment back quickly.
It's Miami though...they have a hard time getting fans in the park on a regular basis for those Florida teams.
True, but it isn't as bad as Tampa. Winning helps a lot.
Agree, but it's hard not root against Jeb Bush.
LOL the Bushes already owned the Rangers, we saw how that worked out.
For 1.3 Billion they better win something.
Fun fact: the Marlins haven't lost a playoff series.
Gotta get them there again to put that to the test.
I like a lot of their players, still such a shame about Jose Fernandez.
Aw man, yeah, He was supposed to be their anchor for years.
Poor choice of words.
You know what I mean LOL
Gotcha. Still have Stanton though.
They win when he's on the field but he's a little injury prone.
The knee, the wrist, it's always something.
