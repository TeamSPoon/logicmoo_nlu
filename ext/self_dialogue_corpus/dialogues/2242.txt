Do you think RG3 will have a chance in the NFL?
I am not sure since he was cut from the Browns back in early March.
So he is stil a free agent?
Yes and I believe training camps have already started too.
I haven't heard of any teams reaching out to him yet.
That's just too bad.
I hear he just had a baby girl early this month.
Yes that is true. Her name is Gloria.
He is a former Heisman winner that led him to be the first round draft pick for the Cleveland Browns
Oh yeah I remember, what year was that?
I believe it was back in 2012.
I thought it was 2011, but Ok.
I think the NFL teams are looking at him as a risk.
Why do you say that?
Because last year he was injured and he was only limited to play 5 games.
Oh that is terrible.
Prior to that he sat on the bench the entire 2015 season as a backup to Kirk Cousins.
Well I see why he has not been picked yet.
I just hope too much time doesn't pass by or else he won't be able to play.
I totally agree with that.
