Have you ever heard of the group the Monkees?
No, are they a new group?
No, they were in the mid-and late 60s.
I don't know much about the older groups, how did they start out?
Four young men were brought together to be a musical group on a TV show.
So they weren't a real musical group?
They were a real group, they had records out although at first they didn't play their own instruments on their records, they use studio musicians, but that was common with a lot of groups back then.
Were they popular?
Very much so, their first two albums were huge sellers and were even outselling the Beatles.
Who are the Beatles?
Umm, never mind, back to the Monkees. At the height of their popularity, they decided they wanted to play concerts.
They played concerts? I thought they couldn't play any instruments?
Two of them could play instruments when the band was formed, the other two learned how to play.
Were they successful?
Yes, they played quite a number of concerts including some in other countries.
How long did the show last?
Two years.
Did they disappear after the show ended?
No, they continued to release albums for a number of years, back in the 80s they got back together and released a couple more albums and had a couple of hits and they continued to do some concerts until recently.
Wow, I've never heard of them, I will have to look them up on YouTube.
