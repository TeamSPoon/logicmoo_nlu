David Bowie was one of the greatest songwriters ever.
He had quite an imagination when it came to lyrics.
He did.
What are some of your favorite songs that he wrote?
Starman was one of them, so was Under Pressure.
I have read he was extemley intelligent and collected fine art.
He would have to be intelligent and artistic to come up with the songs and lyrics that he did.
Remember Ziggy Stardust and the SPiders from Mars?
I sure do.
He had nine platinum albums!
Wow and I know he had  top selling albums.
That is because his voice and music is amazing.
Truly.
Some of his early inspiration came from Little Richard and Elvis.
That is interesting.
He started his first band when he was 15.
Really , what was the name of it.
The Konrads.
Wow never heard of that.
They played a lot of weddings and events.
