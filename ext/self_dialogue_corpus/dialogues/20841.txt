Have you ever seen the Sharknado movies?
Oh, they are so stupid!
Oh, so you don't like them?
I actually love them.
I thought you said they were stupid.
They are, but I like that kind of stuff.
They are funny, right.
Yeah, it's fun watching something totally unrealistic like that.
Yeah, and I like all the cameos.
Yeah, so many people have been on those movies.
Are you a fan of stupid movies in general?
If it's stupid, but funny.
Give me an example.
Idiocracy is stupid, but it's also hilarious.
I think Idiocracy was smarter than Sharknado.
Yeah, they might have had slightly different kinds of humor, but both stupid funny.
Idiocracy seems like it is becoming a reality.
What do you mean?
People will eventually be that stupid.
You are probably right.
