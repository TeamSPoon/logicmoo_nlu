What's your favorite newer Disney movie?
Well, I really liked Finding Dory a lot.
Oh, that was really funny.
Yeah, they came up with such a great story line.
Definitely, and the scenes with the van driving out of control were great.
They had a long time to come up with something good and it worked.
I also really liked Brave.
It was nice to see that they put out a movie with a strong female lead.
Yeah, both Merida and her mom got to be shown as strong women in that movie.
It was good to see a movie that wasn't just a love story.
