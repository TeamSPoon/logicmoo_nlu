Hey, did you see the movie Logan with Hugh Jackman?
Oh yes, I seen it the day it came out!
What did you think from one to ten?
I give it an eleven! It was by far the best movie this year in my opinion.
Oh wow that is saying a lot that makes me wanna take my kids and see it!
The premise is interesting because the Mutants are gone so Logan is isolated in this one.
Is Patrick Stewart still in it though?
Yes, he is still there and a few other actors but it starts with Logan all alone.
My curiosity is peaked and I am ready for a great thriller movie this summer!
Go see it and you won't be sorry!
