Who is the best rock and roll band of all time?
Most people would probably say The Beatles, or The Rolling Stones.
Are those the bands that you would choose personally?
No, I would pick Guns N' Roses!
Nice, I like a pick that goes against the grain.
They are the perfect rock and roll band in my opinion.
My dad used to love them! He went and seen them live when he was younger.
That would have been an amazing opportunity. I bet he had an awesome time.
He still has a T-shirt that he bought at the show that night.
Cool! I would like to talk to him about it one of these days.
So what are your favorite songs from them?
There are so many great ones to choose from!  Don't Cry and November rain are the two that comes to mind.
Those are good songs without a doubt. What about Paradise City?
I love Paradise City! What a great song to jam along with!
You sound like a true fan to say the least.
I sure am! Which rock band would you say is the best ever?
I would have to go with Pink Floyd as my choice.
That is a great pick actually. I love their music myself.
I could listen to Hey You and Wish You Were Here all day and night.
Me and you both! I love talking legendary rock and roll bands.
