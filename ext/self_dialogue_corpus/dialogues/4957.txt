Did you see that no hitter last night?
I quit watching in the 8th, thought for sure he'd blow it.
Was crazy he actually was perfect through 7 but that one close pitch and he walked the pitcher of all people.
So what happened past the 8th?
The first batter up in the 9th, he actually hit  up on the shoulder...looked like he was done for...was his 111th pitch btw.
They left him in because of the no hitter?
Yeah so then, like he walked two more batters AND THEY STILL left him in with only a 1 run lead with the bases loaded.
Man thats crazy...seems like it wouldnt happen in modern era baseball.
The crazy thing was...the next batter...
yeah?
He had him in the hole at 3-1 and he got him to bite an up and a away fastball.
Lol, who swings there?
I know...then the next pitch was dead on the corner...I thought it was a ball til the replay with that plate thing.
Yeah?
Caught the corner just BARELY.
So then what?
It was all smooth sailing from there...he faced 7 and 8 from there, and they were being fanned all night.
So much for the ruined no hitter
Yeah...I was happy though...first one in months, and for once it was for my favorite team..
We'll give you that one *laughs*
