What do you think about Akikan killing all of the young Jedis?
It's awful of course.
But I mean, do you think that it is consistent with his character?
Well, you don't obviously.   I mean, he is Darth Vader.
But I thought it was the death of Padame and the thought of loosing his kids that drove him over the edge.
Why did you think that?
Well, when Darth Vader dies defending Luke, I kind of thought that the loose of family was what drove him nuts.
I see your point. That the death of family is what drive him nuts.
I think the idea that his ambition was that blood thirsty was a bit out of characer.
Yeah, but he was evil.
