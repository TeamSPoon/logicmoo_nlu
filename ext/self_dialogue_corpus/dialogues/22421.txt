I saw Tokyo Story the other day.
Never heard of it.  Japanese movie?
Yes, 1953.
An oldie.  What's the plot?
An old married couple go to visit their adult children, who have no time for them.
Sounds sad.
It is.  At one point the kids pay for them to go on vacation.  They end up in a noisy hotel.
Sounds funny.
It was a bit humorous.
What else goes on?
The old man bumps into a friend and they get drunk talking about the war.
Must have been sad.
It was bitter, as both men lost children in the war.
The human side of war.
Yes, an interesting perspective.  The people in the movie are pretty decent, except for the kids.
Yes, I guess there's no room for the old.
Yep.  The wife dies in the movie.
Too bad.
The kids have a funeral, then scoot back to their lives.
Just like life in the USA.
