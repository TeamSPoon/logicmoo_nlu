Do you feel rock music nowadays compares to the old stuff?
Absolutely not, the classics are always better.
I would tend to agree, there's exceptions, but they just don't make them like they used to.
Yeah give me Bad Company, Reo Speedwagon and Kansas over modern stuff anyday.
Speaking of Kansas did you know Anthrax covered Carry On my Wayward son?
Really interesting how was it?
Really good actually, almost sounds like it's Kansas.
Will have to check it out, I've heard Gwar's rather original version of the song.
Now that's a unique twist in it.
You're not kidding, it sure was.
