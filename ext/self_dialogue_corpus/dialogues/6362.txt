Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes! Wasn't it great!
Yes, but I would have preferred they make it a little more unique?
I loved how close they stuck to the original story. What would you have liked to see?
I don't know, but it didn't have any surprises, even the songs were the same.
They changed the wording of the songs some, but not a lot.  Don't you think it was good that they didn't completely change them?
I guess, I just wish it was a little more different than the cartoon.
The cartoon version was one of my favorites when I was little so I was very happy with this one.  Will you buy it when it comes out on DVD?
No, I didn't like it enough to buy it.
That's too bad, I can't wait to own it!
