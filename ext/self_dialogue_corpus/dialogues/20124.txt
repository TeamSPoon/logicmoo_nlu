Let's rent a movie tonight.  Any ideas?
Yes!  I was just thinking that I would love to see 'Local Hero' again.  Have you seen it?
I LOVE that movie!  I remember Al Gore saying it was his favorite movie, so I knew I loved him!  It has such an off beat, weird kind of humor!
I never was a big  Burt Lancaster fan, but he was great in this.
He really was, especially with that psychiatrist Clapper or Trapper!
That's right!   I forgot about him!
That is definitely on my top 10 list.
I would put in my top five.
Now I want to go to Scotland!
I remember that gorgeous scenery.
Like on the drive, when they hit that little rabbit.
Her name was Trudy.
It was so sad when that other guy found out they had eaten her!
I know.  There are so many little, wonderful scenes.  I think about that movie a lot.
I always think of that scene on the beach, with the old man who wouldn't sell his land, becausr it was such a special place.  It sure was.
Like the oranges washing up on the beach.
I wonder how many beautiful places like that are destroyed by the oil industry.
I know.  I didn't realize how many things were made from petroleum.  For instance, dry cleaning fluid.
It was great that Mr. Knox changed his mind.
It really was. A happy ending!
