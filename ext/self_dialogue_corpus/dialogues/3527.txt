Have you ever heard of the movie Rubber?
No what is it about?
A killer tire.
That sounds so fake.
It was an independent horror film.
So the tire goes around killing people?
Essentially, yes thats the movie in a nutshell
Do you see how stupid that sounds?
They have to try and kill the tire before it kills them.
I just dont see that kind of film working in America.
