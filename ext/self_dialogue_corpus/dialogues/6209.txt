Have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I went and saw it when it was first released in the theaters. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up.
Mine too, I always liked Belle because she was smart and brave. She wasn't the typical damsel in distress.
Belle is a great character. I felt bad for her that she had to constantly reject Gaston and he would never get the hint.
He was an interesting character. What a narcissist! I liked Gaston's sidekick  LeFou too.
I think Emma Thompson did a terrific job as Belle. I didn't know she could sing so well.
I agree. The special effects were fantastic as well. I brought my niece to see the movie and she was nervous that the Best wouldn't find true love in time before the final petal fell from the rose.
That's so cute. Was she happy when Belle and the Beast ended up together at the end?
She was ecstatic and she liked seeing all the Beast's servants turn back into people after being objects for so long.
I love happy endings.
