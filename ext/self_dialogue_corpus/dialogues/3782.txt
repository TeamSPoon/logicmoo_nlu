There is a good movie out called" The Hollow".
I heard of that movie, it sounds like a good movie to see.
I going to see it tonight with a friend.
I am to stay home and watch the movie"The Howling" on TV that is a really scary movie.
I saw that movie, is it about a bunch of werewolves in this community?
Yes !  It is like the movie called "American Werewolf in London".
Yea, that was a cool movie, with all those special effects.
That movie called" Blood and Chocolate is good too.
I like the movie "Silver Bullet" that was a good werewolf movie.
I have seen a couple of great werewolf movies.
