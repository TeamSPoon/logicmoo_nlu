Have you seen Wonder Woman?
No but I will see it.
Are you looking forward to it?
Kind of but I usually prefer comedy.
Oh yeah? What are your favorites?
Lots I love Dumb and Dumber, Tootsie, Bridesmaids, Beverly Hills Cop
Great, those are some funny movie. I enjoy anything by the Coen Brothers.
Me too. There's lots of good comedy lately.
How about dramas, you go for them
I like big sweeping epics
Really? I don't. I prefer small plot driven drama
Like what?
I loved Green Mile
That's an all time great
Lately I like Manchester by the Sea
Haven't seen it. Wasn't it Oscar nominated?
Yes it was, Casey Affleck was in it. It's really great
Thanks I'll rent it
You'll like it. Watch something funny after because it's a tearjerker. Bruce Almighty or something.
Okay, I will.
