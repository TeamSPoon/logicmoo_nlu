Did you know that they are making a Spider-Man spin off movie?
This is my first time hearing of this. Who's in it?
Silver Sable and Black Cat. Really?
Yeah. Have you seen the trailer?
No. 'Silver and Black', that is the title of it,  is looking to start production this fall.
Silver and Black.
Who's directing it?
Gina Prince-Bythewood.
Who's that?
She wrote and directed The Secret Life of Bees.
The Secret Life of Bees? I have never heard of this.
What can they do with Black Cat? The only thing that's fun about Black Cat is her relationship with Spider-Man.
You're right and  I don't know how you make a movie with her that doesn't have Spidey.
I don't think many people will care about these characters with out Spider-Man
They might. You never know.
I want to know is why are they being kept separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe .
No Spider-Man could very well spell out no hit with this movie.
Indeed.
It looks like Sony is chipping away at Spider-man's supporting cast until the MCU has nothing to work with for the sequels.
Maybe one day we'll have a perfect world where Marvel has full control of all its properties.
