I'm back.  Whose in the lead?
The Indians!
Oh snap.
Who you going for?
The Alphas.
They're 3 points behind.
We can catch up!
If the Indians slow down.
Our best guy is out there!
Who?
Matthew Comp.
Yeah, he's good.
How about great?
Not that great!
The Alphas need 2 good touchdowns to take the Indians.
True, but unlikely.
Why is that?
Kemp Taylor is out on injury.
Oooh. Not good.
His replacement sucks.
