What is your favorite Lady Gaga performance?
Actually, it was her Julie Andrews tribute on the Oscars.
That wasn't exactly classic Gaga.
That's exactly why I loved it. Who knew she could do Julie Andrews standards from movies like The Sound of Music and do it like she was born to it?
How did the crowd like it?
I think they were kind of thrown by the ball gown and the tattoos, but the singing, it was amazing.
Was Julie Andrews there?
Yes, she came on at the end of the number and gave Lady Gaga a big hug. She was very emotional.
Aw, that sounds like a really sweet moment.
It was awesome seeing the two of them arm in arm, but totally bonded by their shared love of that music.
