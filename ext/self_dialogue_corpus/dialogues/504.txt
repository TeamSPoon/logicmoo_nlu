I know some people call football an American past time, but it seems popular all over the world.
Why's that?
I read about how the prime minister of Israel met with a bunch of NFL Hall Of Famers.
Netanyahu? I didn't know he was a football fan.
The Patriot's team owner took a bunch of them for a tour.
That would be really cool to see.
Apparently the team owner was joking with the prime minister about him playing.
Wow, Netanyahu actually plays football?
Yeah, the owner gave him a ball and they were tossing it back and forth.
I wonder where he learned to play?
Netanyahu went to school in the States, and that's where he picked up football.
I always thought it was funny how in Europe they call soccer football.
It does seem confusing. But really, soccer is playing with a ball with your foot, so it is more logical.
As devoted as they are to soccer, Europe has built some really great teams with great players.
They are VERY devoted to soccer in Europe. It's like the MAIN sport, whereas here you have competition between football, basketball, and baseball as to which is the favorite.
With the way they are spread out over the seasons, it makes it easy to be a fan of all three.
I know. And there's hockey, but that always falls behind the big three for favorite sport.
I personally love baseball the best. I think most people would pick it as number one.
It would be a toss up I think between baseball and football. Basketball would probably be in third place.
I agree, basketball defintely falls behind baseball and football.
