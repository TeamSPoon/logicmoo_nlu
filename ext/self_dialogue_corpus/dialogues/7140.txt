I know it is not a big one, but I always loved Oliver and Company.
The one with Billie Joel as the dog?
Yep, that's the one.  It's based on the show Oliver and has all these cute animals.
Yeah, I know there was the chihuahua, and the little cat is Oliver.
Fagan is in it too, as the leader of the gang.
It sounds just like the original Oliver, then
The music is so good in the movie too.
I would hope so, with Billie Joel involved.
I wonder why the movie was not as successful as some of the others.
Well like you, I am sure there are many die hard fans.
