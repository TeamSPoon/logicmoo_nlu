I'm a big Britney Spears fan.
She was great way back when.
Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did It Again were big in 1999-2000.
What was the song she sang with the snake?
'I'm a Slave 4 U'
She was hot in that one.
I loved her album In the Zone.
What was the big song in that?
Toxic.
I think she still has mental issues.
