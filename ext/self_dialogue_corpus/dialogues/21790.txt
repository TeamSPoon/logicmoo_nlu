Hey, have you seen the movie Memento?
No, I've never even heard of it!  When did it come out?
Oh, wow, it was back in the late nineties I believe.  It's been awhile.
Maybe that's why.  I didn't watch many movies back then.
Well this is one that you don't want to miss!  I could easily say it's my favorite movie.
Who's in it?
Guy Ritchie and some other people I can't remember.  Nobody ridiculously famous.
What's so great about it?
The plot!  It's totally unlike anything you've ever seen.
That's hard to believe - everything's been played out and done and redone nowadays.
Not this one!  You can watch it over and over and you catch something new every time.
What type of movie is it even?
It's a mystery.  But it's told in reverse order, like it starts at the end and works backwards towards the beginning.
Weird, how does that work?
You'd have to watch it to see.  The main character has some sort of amnesia condition and he can't remember things well.
Sounds strange.
It is strange, but it's strange in a good way.  You are put into the same confused state he is in throughout the movie.
I'm intrigued!
You should watch it!  He's trying to figure out who killed his wife.  The ending is really perplexing.
Maybe I will get it tonight and check it out.  It better be good!
