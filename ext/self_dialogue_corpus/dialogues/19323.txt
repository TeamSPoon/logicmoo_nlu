Are you a Blake Shelton fan?
Yes, he is one of my favorite country singers.
I saw him in concert last fall; it was awesome!
You did?  I really wanted to go to that concert.
What is your favorite Blake song?
I like "Boys 'Round Here."  What about you?
I think it is probably "Mine Would Be You."
It's kind of surprising how many hits he has.
I know!  There are way more than I expected.
Who opened for him when he was in concert?
I think her name was Rae Lynn, a girl from The Voice.
Was she good?
She was OK.
Did Gwen Stefani sing with him?
Yes, they sang a song together.  It was really good.
I like her, but I liked Miranda better.
Me too.   It was sad that they split up.
Have you ever seen her in concert?
Yes, I was supposed to see the Pistol Annie's, but she was solo instead.
I bet that was good.  She has a lot of hits.
