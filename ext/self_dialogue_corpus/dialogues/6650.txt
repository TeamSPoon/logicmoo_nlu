I always thought I had seen a lot of Disney movies, but apparently not...
There's a lot of Disney movies, so it's not surprising if there's some you haven't seen.
There was a list challenge website that had 492 Disney movies, and you could click on each one that had a picture and the title that you'd seen, and it gave you a total.
That kind of sounds like fun. Did it take a long time?
YES. About a half an hour. It was 13 pages of Disney movies.
So how many have you seen?
67 out of 492. The average was 164. A LOT of people had claimed to have seen all 492, but I think they just cheated and clicked on them all.
I know it seems like I've seen a lot, but I'm probably just like you.
It was fun looking at all the old movie pictures, like Bambi and Cinderella, and 101 Dalmatians.
The old Disney movies are my favorite too.
