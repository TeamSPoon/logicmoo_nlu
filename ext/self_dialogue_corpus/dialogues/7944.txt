Hey Dad, what is Pop music?
I don't really know. I used to know, but now I am confused...
What do you mean?
Well, when I was young, Pop music was from bands like The Beach Boys...
I remember them!
...And the Beatles...
Another good one!
Yeah, but today, music from those bands are played in elevators, and are called "Oldies"
What were oldies when you were young?
"Itsy bitsy spider" and "Mary had a little lamb..."
