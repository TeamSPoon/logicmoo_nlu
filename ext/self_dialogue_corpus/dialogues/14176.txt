Lady Gaga is my all time favorite performer.
What do you like the most about her?
I like that while she is an amazing showman, she always has great vocals.
I agree. She is crazy talented.
Yeah. And she writes her songs, can play instruments legitimately, and doesn't lip sync.
Her acoustic version of Poker Face is one of my favorite performances.
I really like it when Lady Gaga plays the piano.
Yeah. I also feel like she gives so much to every performance.
She must practice like crazy.
Yeah. I saw a video of her doing vocal warmups while doing yoga.
