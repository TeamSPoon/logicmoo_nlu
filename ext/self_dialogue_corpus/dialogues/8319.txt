Do you like any of Justin Bieber's music?
I like some of his songs actually.
Oh really which ones?
I like the song "I'm the One" that he sang with DJ Khaled recently.
Yes I play that one over and over in my car.
I also like the song "Let me Love you."
Also a favorite of mine! His music is pretty good actually.
I like the sound of his voice, he could sing to me any day.
I don't know why some people act like he doesn't have good music.
They're probably just tired of the hype of his music.
