Have you heard about Lady Gaga's song The Cure?
Yes! I love that song!
Me too, the beat is spot on
And the words are very uplifting
True, I've been playing it several times a day
I do too! And I don't get tired of listening to it.
She's really inspiring singer
I agree, and her lyrics are really inspiring
I wish I can be as talented as her
Me too.
