Did you make it out to see Wonder Woman yet?
No! I really need to. How was it?
It was amazing. I haven't felt that inspired in a long time.
Why is that?
Just seeing a woman in such a powerful role, and she really killed it!
That's awesome. I was reading an article about all these young girls that were dressing up as her for school.
I saw that too; it was adorable!
I clearly need to go see it.
There was a scene where Wonder Woman sneaked a sword into a party by wearing it in the back of her dress, and now there's tutorials for doing that all over the internet.
That sounds amazing. How do you get a full sword in a dress?
I have no idea, but she did it and looked great!
Who played Wonder Woman again?
Gal Gadot. She was completely stunning. Plus Chris Pine was awesome in it too.
Oh I love Chris Pine. He was in the new Star Trek films right?
Yeah, he was Jim Kirk.
Right, I think he did a great interpretation of Kirk.
Oh for sure, not to mention their Spock. Zachary Quinto is too good.
Oh absolutely, he looked just like Nimoy!
I really believed I was watching a story about the original cast. I love those films.
Me too, I hope they keep putting out more!
