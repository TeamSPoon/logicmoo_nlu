Michael Jackson's Thriller is my favorite record of all time.
Yeah, I loved that album when I was a kid. You can't beat Beat It and Billie Jean.
The song Thriller was great too but I never really got into the music video.
I think the video was awesome. It was groundbreaking for it's time.
Do you remember the song Somebody's Watching Me by Rockwell?
Yeah man, that was a great song.
Michael Jackson did the vocals in the chorus of that song.
That's awesome, that's probably why I liked it so much.
80's music turned out to be really good didn't it?
Yup, it's still what I listen to more than anything else today.
