What kind of puppy are you planning to get?
You know I've always been partial to 101 Dalmatians, so I think I'm gonna have to go with a cute little spotted guy.
My little sister found a fork  when she was looking for shells at the beach.
I bet I would have started brushing my hair and singing like Ariel if I were her!
As corny as it was, I was smitten when he pull a Lady & The Tramp during dinner.
I can't believe he had you both suck on the same piece of spaghetti to a kiss, what a goof!
Even though it was years and years ago, I Pocahontas still calls when I go in the woods sometimes...
Especially in the fall!  I can paint with all the colorsss of the wiiind.
It feels like I'm just waiting for Prince Charming...
Hopefully you're not a Sleeping Beauty for too long, and he comes to kiss you!
