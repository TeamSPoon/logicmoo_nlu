You know, I have been watching that reality music show The Voice, but I haven't heard much about people after they leave.
I don't know that too many have made it big in music.
Have you heard of any who have had hits?
I think that Danielle Bradberry from season 8 has had some success.
I remember her, a country singer right?
Yes, she sings kind of pop-country.
I really liked her cover of "Born to Fly".
Who is the original artist of that song.
I believe that is a Sara Evans song.
Well there is a name I have not heard in awhile.
She had a good run there, but I have not heard any new songs from her recently.
I think my all time favorite song of hers was "Suds in the Bucket".
Oh yeah, that was a good one. I could always really picture that happening.
What is your favorite Sara Evans song?
I always liked "Little Bit Stronger".
I remember that one. It is pretty inspirational.
I think that is why I like country music. It is all relateable.
True, they write about real life, not just the party life as pop music does.
You pretty much cannot go wrong with country music, no matter what artist you choose.
I agree.
