Have you seen Leonardo Dicaprio's new movie?
No I haven't! What is it?
The Reverent.
The Reverent?
Yeah? Why?
I just thought he had another movie after that.
What do you mean?
Didn't that movie come out a while ago?
Yeah, maybe he did make another after that.
Well, did you like it anyway? I haven't seen it, so.
Yeah, it was so good! Gory, but good.
Gory?
So much blood everywhere. And animals.
Like Tarrentino?
Tarrentino style but realistic and with Dicaprio.
Sounds interesting!
It is, I guess. What have you seen recently?
Well, I've seen Beauty and the Beast.
How was it?
It was great!
