What is you favorite Star Wars movie?
I liked the War of the Clons the most.
I thought that movie was interesting, I liked it as well.
Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
I didnt like them that much I think that a lot elements from previous movies are missing.
Yeah I miss the Jedi fights.
Exactly, theres no more jedi action any more, or too little jedi action.
Yeah and thats what made Star War movies special to me.
I hope that the movies that come out in the future improve.
Yeah I hope so too.
