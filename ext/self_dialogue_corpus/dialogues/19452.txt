i cannot get this song out of my head.
what song is it?
i think its called spanish flea?
oh my god i love that song.
its way too catchy.
i know right?
its like the music they would play on the elevator ride to heaven.
Or the ride to hell. its starting to get a little annoying.
I cant stop listening, its too good.
You know what else is good?
More of this song?
I was thinking ragtime piano.
Old timey stuff?
Yeah, you know, like the entertainer!
It pales in comparison.
Its just as good man.
Let's just agree to disagree.
Apples and oranges?
I guess so.
Finally we see eye to eye.
