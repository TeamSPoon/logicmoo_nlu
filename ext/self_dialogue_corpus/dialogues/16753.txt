Who is your favorite music artist?
Don't know, I like a lot from the eightees.
Me too. One of my favorites is Stevie Nicks.
I like her music too.
I have all of her CD's.
Which is your favorite?
I think Stand back.
That was an amazing song.
Yes, but my favorite song was Enchanted.
I don't know that one.
It wasn't a single, so no one ever really did unless you listened to the album.
White Winged Dove was also good.
Yes, way too many good ones.
How about her music with Fleetwood Mac, did you like that?
I liked some of their music, but she was better alone.
Yeah, I agree.
Her music is different because of her raspy voice.
She does have a very distinctive voice.
Did you ever see her in concert.
Yes, at Radio City a long time ago.
