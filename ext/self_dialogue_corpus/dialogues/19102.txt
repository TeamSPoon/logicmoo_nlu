Do you listen to a lot of music?
I listened a lot more when I used to commute to work.
You don't listen to music anymore?
Now I work from home so I'm rarely in my car.  And even when I'm in my car I tend to listen to the news.
Don't you find music relaxing?
Some music.  But when I'm driving I don't want to be too relaxed.
I have certain songs that I like to drive to.
Me too!  I used to have a specific playlist with songs that I liked to drive to.
That's interesting.  Some music is just very good for driving.
I like to think of music as a sound track and how it would fit in to a movie.
Yes, music can make a world of difference in a movie.
Once I saw a movie in pre-production, before the music was added and it was just bizarre.
Do you have any favorite soundtracks?
I like some but I can't think of any right now.
I like the soundtrack for Apollo 13.
Pandora has a station just for soundtracks.
That sounds like my kind of station.
I like Hans Zimmer.  The Dark Knight soundtracks were good.
I like the soundtrack for Tron.
The new one or the old one?
