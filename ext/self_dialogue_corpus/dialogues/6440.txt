Who do you think will play Mulan in the new live-action Mulan movie?
Gosh, I have no idea. How can that movie possibly live up to the original?
I don't know. I have high hopes, though.
I hope they cast Lucy Liu.
No way, she's too old!
I hope they cast another unknown. That girl was so good in Moana!
Yeah, I agree, although I can't remember her name.
Me neither, I'll look it up later. She's so talented though.
And she's only 14!
Wow, I wish I could sing like that when I was 14. Or now!
