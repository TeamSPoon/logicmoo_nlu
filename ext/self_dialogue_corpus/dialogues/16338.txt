What do you think of Low Down Dirty Blues?
I'm not sure I know about that, what is it?
Well you know what blues music is right?
Of course I do.
Well the Low Down Dirty version is what you would find in New Orleans in the local clubs and saloons.
I still don't understand, wasn't Blues music like that too?
Sort of, but the Low Down artists would interact with the patrons.
Oh like walk around?
Well yes, and it's a lot of fun!
Sounds okay, but not great.
You have to go try a show out, they bring the audience in and make you laugh.
What else do they do besides walk around?
Sometimes they call audience members on stage and try to embarrass them.
Ooh now that sounds fun!
It is, unless you're the one being called onstage.
Haha, yea, I could see that being a problem.
It's not a problem, it's really fun still, but it can be embarrassing.
Why would I want to go then?
Because they don't always pick you and even when they do it's still fun.
Sounds like I'll have to try it sometime!
