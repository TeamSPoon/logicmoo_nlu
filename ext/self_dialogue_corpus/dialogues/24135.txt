So what kind of shows have you been watching lately.
I like to watch Survivor.
Really? What do you like about Survivor?
Its a really interesting show about human reactions. I like watching how people behave in difficult situations like that; its the ultimate study on human behavior.
Cool! I saw a show this last Spring called Hunted.
What's it about?
Its about pairs of people -- couples, friends, siblings -- and they have to evade FBI agents for forty days. If they can they get a quarter-of-a-million bucks!
What is the geographical region that they have available to them?
The have all of Georgia and some space in ajoining states, also.
That's a huge amount of territory to hide out in!
I know, and yet, I was amazed how often the pairs of people got caught.
What kinds of tactics did the pairs use to evade the FBI?
They drove around, hid in the woods; sometimes they woudl hide at a friend's house or at the house of a friend of their friend, so it would be harder to find them.
That sounds like it would be easy to hid out for fourty days!
It does, but some of these people woudl go on social media, make phone calls, and the FBI would know exactly where they were.
Dude, we should totally do that!
What do you mean?
We should go on that show, hide out in the woods, eat berries and stuff, live off the land; it'll be awesome!
I'm not sure that we're really that rugged. I'm gonna go to Starbucks; wanna come?
Sure, why not!
