Do you think Carmelo Anthony is going to be playing in New York next year?
I think so.
You don't think the Knicks are going to try to use him as trade fodder?
I think they might, but I don't think they'll get as much in return as they could have gotten two or three years ago.
He's still an All-Star!
Yes, but he's at the tail end of his prime and I think the Knicks are not going to accept that reality.
Well, you forget that Melo doesn't exactly seem happy in New York. He might ask for a trade.
Well, that would be different. If Melo pushes the issue, I could see the Knicks cutting a deal.
You just don't think the Knicks will get a player of his caliber?
Not exactly. I think the Knicks are going to over-estimate Carmelo's abilities and demand someone better than he is.
Surely they know he's not on the same level as a James Harden or Russell Westbrook!
No doubt, but it doesn't mean they won't act like they don't know. They might take a developing player, but they're not going to accept a medire one.
Do you think Melo definitely wants out?
I don't know, but I suspect he'd bolt for a chance to win. His window for a championship is closing.
Where would he go, if he went, do you think?
Maybe Boston. I can't see him landing anywhere like Cleveland or Golden State because they have no room.
The Cavs always seem willing to trade Kevin Love and Melo is friends with LeBron.
Love is a way better fit for the Cavs than Melo and I'm sure LeBron knows that.
Why Boston, then?
They're young and could use solid veteran leadership. Actually, so could a team like the Sixers.
