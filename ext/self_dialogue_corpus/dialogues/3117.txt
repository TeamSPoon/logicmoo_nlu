Marshawn Lynch is back, though!
Yeah, and so is Tom Brady.
How many Super Bowls you think the Pats are gonna take?
Most likely 10 or more, depending on Brady's health and performance.
But what about that incident with the deflated footballs?
Well, that was over a long time ago, so that ain't gonna slide this time.
Yeah, you're right.
I think the Giants can win another one, though.
Of course they can!
Eli Manning's a reliable QB.
He's one of the best out there!
Of course, he is!
Well, who else is better than him?
His brother, Brady, Kapernick.
Oh, him.
He's pretty good, right?
Yes, indeed.
Oh yeah!
Now what?
Now we wait for the Browns vs Chiefs game to begin!
