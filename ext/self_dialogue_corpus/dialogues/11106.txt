My grandmother is 67, and she still cares about fashion.
Why not?
I agree. She spends a half hour on her make-up, faithfully, though she's retired and doesn't go out much. And shops every season.
What does she wear?
Coldwater Creek styles mostly. Nothing bare, nothing revealing, though. Soft, drapey clothes.
I like their clothes too. Sort of an arty feel.
Yes, she's pretty arty. And she believes certain colors and shapes flatter her, and is careful to choose them.
I should do that. I just grab what I need for whatever occasion, whatever's new and stylish.
She's pretty stylish, actually, in her own way.
I bet you wouldn't see her in Topshop or Modcloth.
Well no. But she appreciates that kind of thing though. She enjoys fashion in all its forms.
That's so sweet.
She's pretty sharp, actually. And she feels free to comment on other people's clothes, too.
She complements them.
Not always. She doesn't like underwear to show, for example, and she'll tell a grandchild so  directly.
You mean like bra straps.
Or boys' underwear that shows above their pants. That wasn't her idea of style!
I think showing your underwear is out of fashion anyway.
Around her it always was.
I don't know. If it's summer, and you're wearing a pretty camisole...
