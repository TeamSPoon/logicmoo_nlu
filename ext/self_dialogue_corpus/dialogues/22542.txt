Oh my god, have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
No, is it good?
Yes, it's amazing.
Yeah, I've heard good things.
Did you like the first one?
Yeah it was pretty good.
The second one is even better!
I'll have to put it on my list.
Have you seen anything good lately.
Not in theaters, but I just watched a really good horror movie on hulu last night.
What is it called?
10 Clover field lane.
What's it about?
It's about this girl who gets kidnapped. But the world has been invaded by aliens.
That sounds kind of weird.
Yeah it's kind of different. Like the girl gets kidnapped by a psycho killer and doesn't know whether the world has ended or not.
Hmm. Maybe I'll watch it. Who's in it?
John Goodman plays the kidnapper!
Really? Like the dad from Roseanne?
Yep, him. He is great in it!
