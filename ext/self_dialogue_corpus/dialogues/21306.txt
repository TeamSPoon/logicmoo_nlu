I finally watched the new Star Wars movie the other day.
How did you like it?
I thought it had way too many characters that went nowhere, but the action was good.
I haven't seen it, but that's what other people were saying.
You must not see many movies then if you haven't seen the new Star Wars.
No, I usually just watch what I can get on Netflix.
Then you'll miss out on a lot of good movies.
I know, but I can't justify the price of tickets at the theater.
What about old movies, though? Did you see the old Star Wars movies?
Do you mean like the one with Jar Jar Binks?
No, that's The Phantom Menace, Episode I. The "prequels" were terrible.
I know, I was just joking. Of course I've seen the originals; everyone has.
OK, that's good. A New Hope is probably my all time favorite movie.
It was good, but I like movies that don't take themselves so seriously.
Like what?
Have you ever seen The Fifth Element? That's the best sci-fi movie I've seen.
Really? That movie was ridiculous.
That's the whole point. It made me laugh.
Ah, you're one of those comedy movie type people, then.
Yeah, that's usually what I prefer to watch over some really serious movie like a horror or scifi or drama.
