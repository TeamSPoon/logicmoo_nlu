Look at him pitch. That's amazing.
I know. I can't believe how good he is.
Luke's not a terrible batter either.
Did you see that homer he hit last week?
Yeah. Did they evr find the ball?
No.
That's really funny.
Someone will find it some day and they won't know where it came from.
I can't believe how it just soared away.
I know. I was dumbstruck.
I think most of us were.
Did you hear that cheering?
It went on forever.
I bet they heard it in the next town.
Our town sure loves them some baseball.
True, especially when there's something like that to watch.
Did you just see that? Another homer!
Yeah!
This game is getting good.
I'm glad you invited me. Thanks.
