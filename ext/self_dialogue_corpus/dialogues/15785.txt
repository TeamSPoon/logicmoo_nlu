I've been looking into Delia Derbyshire some more. She's kind of amazing, actually.
She's the one who did the Doctor Who theme, right?
Yeah, the original one -- and all its adjustments up through Tom Baker. And that's kind of amazing in itself, but there's so much more.
Lay it on me, then.
Well. How about that she invented Acid House somewhere around 1970?
What do you mean?
Some tapes turned up a little while ago of some experiments she did back then, all through tape splices and very very early room-filling synthesizers, that basically sound like they were done in the mid-late '90s. Could have been Aphex Twin.
That's... kind of remarkable, yeah. You said they found them. She never released this stuff?
No, there's even a lead-in on the tape that says something like "This is just for my own amusement, so never mind this."
Man. So, did she get any kind of recognition in her time for all of this stuff?
No, not really. She was operating as part of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, so the group (which was mostly men) got collective credit if any credit was to be given.
Didn't she do anything outside of the BBC, like, on her own time?
Yeah, a little. There was a weird band she was in, briefly, called White Noise. It's... loopy.
Loopy how? Like, super experimental.
That, and just... deliberately strange. Kind of makes me think of early Frank Zappa.
Man. Or, I guess woman. I get the feeling women are quietly responsible for most of the good things in the world, but just never get any credit for it.
That does seem to largely be the case, yes. Hidden Figures and all.
Right, exactly. So I guess she never made much money off of this stuff.
Doesn't seem so. She quit music after a while and went from one dead-end job to another, eventually dying in her sixties, thinking herself a failure.
Oh God.
