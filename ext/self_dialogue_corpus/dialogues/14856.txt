I just watched National Lampoon's Vacation again for the 15th time
Oh wow, that's a classic
Chevy Chase in his prime was amazing
Him and Bill Murray together , we should have had more of those movies.
Dan Akroyd was okay, but not at that level
Wasn't he in the original Ghostbusters
Ghostbusters, so sad what they did to that franchise
I know right, what were they thinking
Any good comedies coming out this year
Not that I know of
