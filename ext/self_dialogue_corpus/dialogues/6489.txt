Have you seen Moana yet?
Yes. I actually saw it last week.
What did you think?
It was okay. I really like the music.
Me too! I like the music number Dwayne Johnson did with Maui.
That was catchy. I think my favorite has to be the one with the big crab.
Are you referring to Tamatoa, when Moana and Maui went down in the to the underworld?
Yes, that's the one. I'm shiny!
Yeah, that's a really catchy tune as well.
Jemaine Clement did a great job with that song.
