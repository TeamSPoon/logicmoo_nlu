Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, which is better?
Definetly the dark knight.
I'd have to agree, the Joker is amazing
He really makes the whole move a masterpiece.
Its sad that heath ledger died though
Yea, they could have kept making direct sequels with his character
That scene when he is in the jail talking to Batman was classic
And Harvey Dent was a really complex character.
I loved him too!
I think I watched that movie about 8 times.
