I rented Arrival from the Redbox last night.
How was it.
Not what I expected, but overall good.
What was your favorite part.
It was actually pretty sad, so no favorite parts.
It was sad, but I liked how she told Shang his wife's dying words and he called off the Chinese attack.
It was a great story, and I liked the movie, but I kept trying to understand what that whole thing with the kid was.
It was her daughter.
I know it was her daughter.
And her daughter died.
I understand that. I just didn't understand why it was interwoven with flashbacks.
They were flashforwards.
What do you mean.
She hadn't had a daughter at the time of the aliens, she was seeing her future.
Oh, wow. I misunderstood that.
After the aliens left that when she married Ian, and they have a daughter who dies.
I get it now. She saw ahead because of the "tool".
Right, the alien language let her see the future.
Well it's a way better movie than I thought it was.
It was deep.
