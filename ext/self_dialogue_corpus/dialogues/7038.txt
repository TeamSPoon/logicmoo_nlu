Do you like the older Disney movies or the newer versions?
I like the older ones better, more nostalgia there.
Yea, I agree, but I like the modern day CGI in the remakes.
I did really like like the remake of the Jungle Book.
Oh, that was amazing! have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, who is in it?
It stars Emma Watson.
Oh man, she is absolutely gorgeous and a very talented actress to boot!
I know, she came a long way from The harry potter films.
I might have to watch the movie now!
