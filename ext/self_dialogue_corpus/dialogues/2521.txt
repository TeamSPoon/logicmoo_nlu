have you heard any word on who might be starting this year for the Dallas cowboys??
Well i heard Tony Romo was quitting and gonna try his hand at coaching.
yeah he is getting old and way to injured to just keep dragging the Cowboys down
Daq Sheppard looked real solid last year.
pretty sure he surprised everyone last year wth those stats.
Yep sometimes the unknowns are who can bring back a team
This year is the dallas cowboys year
Lol dont you say that every year pre season???
The seattle Seahawks coach if moved to the cowboys would be a super asset.
yeah the cowboys really need to gain ground with a first run coach.
Dont matter who the team players are if the coach cant keep a team united then the team will fall apart.
I was sad to see the ex head coach of the oregon ducks being fired from lack of game wins last year
Evweryone has stats to keep coaches are really no diffrent.
the owner of the teams dont want any kind of looser. Team members change as frequently as a season coaches are known to become the teams family.
Honestly i dont care who goes to the super bowl this year long as its not the patriots.
ha still hating on the team or what??
well tom brady has been csaught red handed cheating. we all know that without the cheating the patriots would never made it to the superbowl that year
yep they lol stole the dallas cowboys chance to go to the superbowl
that is one case that cheaters never prosper
true to point.
