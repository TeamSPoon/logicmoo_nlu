I think Tupac is the best rapper of all time.
You think? I know!
Great to find someone who agrees!
I don't think someone can successfully argue with that fact.
People try. Someone said Future is better than Tupac.
What? in what sense?
That Future has better lyrics.
That could be true if the listener is an eighteen year old.
Tupac's lyrics are obviously superior to most rapper's, but it will take a discerning listener.
Yes. His words in Changes are deep.
I wonder how much more he'd have done had he been alive today.
The hip hop scene has changed a lot. Do you think he'd still be relevant?
Yes! Look at Snoop Dog and Nas.
And Eminem- Who was  mentored somewhat by him.
Eminen! I think he sits on the throne in Tupac's absence.
Certainly. Can't think of a more fitting title that rap god
Is he the fastest rapper though?
I'm not sure. I think Twister is faster though.
How about Busta Rhymes?
oh, there's him too!
