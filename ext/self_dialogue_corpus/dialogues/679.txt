Did you see the NFL draft at all?
I follow it a little bit.
Did you check out the rosters at all afterwards?
Yeah, I don't keep up with the draft but I always look over the rosters to see big changes.
Who do you think has the best offense in the coming season?
I think the Steelers are looking pretty scary.
I agree. I'm very excited about that.
They play really hard, too. It'll be fun to watch.
I totally agree. Ben Roethlisberger has a good team this year.
It'll be good to see him finally having the support he needs.
Yeah, he's had a rough go offensively in the past years.
I felt their defense was even worse.
I don't really remember much about their defense last year.
Still, offensively I think the Patriots are still going to be on top.
Yeah, it's hard to deny Tom Brady at this point.
I also have to say the Falcons will probably do very well again.
I honestly thought their offense was better than the Patriots last year.
I completely agree. They just were beaten when it mattered most.
That's because the patriots held the ball for the entire game.
True. They forced them to play defense.
