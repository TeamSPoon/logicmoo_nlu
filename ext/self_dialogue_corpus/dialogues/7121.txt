Aren't you excited about the upcoming Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi?
I am. December can't come soon enough!
With stars like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher coming back again to play their characters Luke and Leia, you know it will be a great movie.
Yes, but not only those two but all of the other characters and the continuation of the saga.
Star  Wars is one of those franchises that we can ever get enough from.
It has been around for almost 40 years and counting. And it gets better with  every sequel.
George Lucas is a genius. The movies just keep getting better and better.
They do. My boyfriend told me we have to do a movie marathon for a plot refresher.
I can't wait to see this movie.
Me either. Its a must see for me.
