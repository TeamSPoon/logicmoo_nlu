Do I have to start at the beginning of the Harry Potter series?
Yes! They could do okay stand alone but you won't get nearly as much out of it!

Yes, and basically grows up during it. The whole thing is about him and his friends and how they grow as characters.
Will I be missing out by not reading it first?
I always love the books more and there is definetly some things you will miss by not reading first.
But just watching the movies is okay to?
Oh for sure! The movies might even inspire you to read it!
Okay, cool. I just bought the first dvd so I will watch tonight.
Oh good! I can come over if you want and we can discuss it after.
