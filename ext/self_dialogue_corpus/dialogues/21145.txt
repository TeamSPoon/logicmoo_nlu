My boyfriend and I recently saw The Fate of the Furious. Have you seen it?
I can't recall if I know which movie you are talking about, who are some of the actors in it?
Girl, you have to know which movie, it's very popular with the guys. It has Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in it.
Yes, I know which one you are talking about now, I did see it. Did you like the movie?
I actually thought it was one of the best out of the The Fast and the Furious movies. It had a lot of action and was pretty funny too.
Yes, I liked it too. I don't usually like "guy' movies, but I thought all of the actors really integrated well and connected.
I agree. My boyfriend really enjoyed it, as you know how men are with action-packed movies, especially with fast cars!
That's so true, but it's nice when us girls actually get to like it too! Sometimes, I'm ready to fall asleep with some movies.
I thought that is how I would be, but I was totally involved with the movie, from beginning to end.
The actors in the movie really fit the roles they had in the movie, I thought. What did you think?
I agree. I thought Charlize Theron was really good too, I loved her dreadlocks in it!
She actually could pull that hairstyle off! Did you like Kurt Russell in it?
Yes, I realized that he has aged more than I realized though. I bet he is in his 70s?
I think you are right? He has been with Goldie Hawne for about 30 years or so, did you know that?
Wow! I didn't realize they had been together that long!
Yes, but never married.
Well, after so many years, what's the point?
Exactly, why ruin it, if it works.
Well, I would definitely recommend the movie to my friends.
Me too!
