What kind of music do you like?
Oh, probably top 40's, rock, pop, that kind of stuff.
I can respect that. There have been some great hits lately.
Yeah, I've really been enjoying Harry Styles' new album.
What's it called?
It's just called "Harry Styles." It's actually really good!
I've liked a few of One Direction's songs on the radio. Maybe I should check it out.
It's really different from what they've done, but still good.
Yeah, I'll give it a go. Personally, I like country and rap.
That's sort of a weird combination.
I know, people are always surprised when I tell them that.
Those are usually two of the most commonly disliked types of music.
I can't help that I like them.
It's not a bad thing at all! What is it about them that you like?
Well, with rap, it's satisfying to hear so many rhyming sounds in such a short time. Plus, they can get really clever.
I can see that. It's sort of like poetry.
Exactly! And with country I'm always reminded of mornings at my grandma's house.
That's what music should be - something that makes you feel good.
I'm glad you can see it that way, even if it's not your type of music.
If it makes you happy, I support it.
