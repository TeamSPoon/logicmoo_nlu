I love the Sunday afternoon games on Fox, but there's on massive issue for me.
So nice of you to say hello before you spoke
Sorry.
Anyway, go ahead.
I love The Simpsons
Me too!
But so much Sunday TV, especially that show, are delayed week after week.
Why?
Runover. Once a game starts, they're contractually obligated to show the complete game.
Aren't they at 4pm?
Yes.
So they should be over by 7, 7:30 at the latest.
You're forgetting about an extra half hour.
Which is?
The post-game coverage. They for some reason HAVE to examine the game on TV after it airs.
Yeah, I hate that too, I just don't watch Sunday TV outside of non-sports channels so I haven't considered it.
Does the same post-game happen on CBS and NBC?
You know what, I'm not sure.
You don't watch those networks at night?
Nope, at least not on Sunday.
