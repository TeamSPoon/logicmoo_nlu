Hey man, I heard some throw back jams last night. Had me in my element.
What did you hear?
This internet radio station was playing Run-DMC, 2Pac, Biggie, NWA, some old Dr. Dre, some 50-Cent.
I like all them. Do you like Rakim?
The R? The 13th Letter? Hell yeah.
Rakim got this song called When I be on Da Mic. You ever hear it?
I got the video stored on my computer. I like the lyrics and he be wearing that gear.
I know right. I like the song he made for the Juice soundtrack.
Oh, you talking about Know The Ledge.
Yeah. That one and the Big Daddy Kane song that was on there, both them songs are fire.
I been listening to Kane ever since he did that song Raw.
Man, I like the Raw Remix. Here it comes...
Yeah, that was like the late eighties. We were banging Kane and like NWA.
NWA took it to another level. That Straight out of Compton put the west coast on the map.
Yeah but you know Dre took all that over. Before he hooked up with Suge and Death Row.
Naw man, when Suge had Death Row with Dre and Pac? The game was crazy.
I know right. They dropped California Love and everybody lost their minds.
But what about the original Chronic album?
You already know. That whole album is a classic.
I still be listening to that whole CD from start to finish. Stranded on Death row, so duck when I swing my ish? CLASSIC.
