Have you seen the new Harry Potter movie?
Do you mean Fantastic Beasts?
Yes, that.
I watched part of it.
Was it good?
It was OK but it didn't have Harry in it.
Oh. What was it about?
It was the story of the guy writing the book used at Hogwarts.
Sounds good.
It wasn't bad.
Do you lke Rowling's books and the movies?
I love the Harry Potter series?
So do I. The other stuff is less good.
I agree. There will be more movies made but probably without Harry.
I always prefer the books.
So do I actually.
I wonder if there will be any more movies with Harry ever.
I hope so but there aren't any more books other than that Cursed Child thing.
Maybe they'll make that a movie.
I hope they do.
