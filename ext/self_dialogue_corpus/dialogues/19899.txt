Do you remember the band "Barenaked Ladies?"
Yeah, I used to have one of their CD's.
What ever happened to them?
I have no idea.
So they haven't been putting out any more music.
Well, they do the theme song for "The Big Bang Theory."
Oh, I wondered who that was.  It sounded so familiar.
What CD did you have by them?
I don't remember, but I'm sure it was from the late 90s or early 2000s.
That's pretty much when they were popular, right.
Yeah, around then.  They had some fun music.
What was your favorite song by them?
I liked "All Been Done" and "Pinch Me."
I remember "Pinch Me".  Not so much the other one.
I liked the line where he says "I just made you say underwear."
Oh yeah,  They were pretty quirky.
Yeah, but that's why they were perfect for doing "The Big Bang Theory."  They are pretty nerdy.
Fun to listen to though.
Definately were fun to listen to.
I think I might have to look them up again.
