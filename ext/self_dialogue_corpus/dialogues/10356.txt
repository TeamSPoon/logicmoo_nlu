What is your favorite action movie?
Definitely Gone In 60 Seconds.
Ohhh that is a great movie!
I love all of the cool cars and how they're always racing.
I thought that was pretty good too.  I liked the stunts they did while driving.
I know.  It was incredible!  I can't believe what those cars are capable of!
How about that Shelby?
I know.  That car was hot!  I would have loved to have been the actor that got to drive that car!
I thought Vin Diesel did a great job in that movie.
I agree.  So did Angelina Jolie and Nicholas Cage!
