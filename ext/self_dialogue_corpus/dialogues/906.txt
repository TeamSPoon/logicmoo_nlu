I can't wait for football season!
Who's your favorite team?
I like the Vikings.
Wow, it's been a rough life for you.
Yes, but that's in the past.
You think this is their year?
Well, not sure about the Superbowl yet.
But you think they will improve.
I know they will.
Do you think they can win the North division?
Without a doubt.
What about Green Bay?
They are in decline.
What about the Lions?
Well, they look good, but they are the Lions.
I won't even ask about the Bears.
Yea, the Bears are a joke.
Who is your favorite Viking of all time?
I love Fran Tarkenton.
I love Cris Carter.
