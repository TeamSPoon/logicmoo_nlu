People forget Remember the Titans was a disney film
I forgot that it was to be honest.
It was a great story.
Denzel Washington did great in his role.
Oh for sure he acted the heck out of it.
Do you think it was the best sports movie of all time?
It is up there, especially with the cast.
I loved when they united the team.
It was based on a true story.
I know and I couldnt imagine going through that!
