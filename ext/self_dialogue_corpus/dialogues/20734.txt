What's your favorite movie?
I really like the oldies, especially those written by Nora Ephron.
Oh my! She is fantastic, 'You've got Mail' is totally my favorite.
I'm gonna have to agree.  That's pretty much up there with 'Sleepless in Seattle.'
Yes! I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were a dynamic duo.
How I miss those days! Did you see her other movie 'Julie and Julia?'
Oh my goodness, I probably watched that a million times.
Meryl Streep is always bringing her best to every film.
I know! And Amy Adams, she rocked that part!
I didn't like her short hair though.
Really? I loved it on her.
You know, Amy Adams did that movie with Jake Gyllenhaal?
Oh are you talking about 'Nocturnal Animals?'
That's the movie! I thought it was so good.
It was a great thriller! Had me on the edge of my seat.
We need more thrillers like that in our lives.
The script was amazing in that movie.
I really can't wait for another Amy Adams movie.
She is to die for! I love her in every way.
