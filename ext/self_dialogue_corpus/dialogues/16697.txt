Hey, dude have you heard this song where Bieber was signing in spanish?
What? The real question here is why do you listen to that girl?
Dude, I was listening to it and it is lit. I mean Bieber was okay but the rest of the song is lit.
Oh really?
Yea, let me send you the video from youtube. Tell me what you think.
Okay let me check my phone.
So what do you think?
I like the beat even though I can't understand most of it. I did click the same song without Bieber. That one sounded so much better haha.
Oh yea I also saw that. The beat was also lit. Who was the singer again?
Its Luis Fonsi. Pretty lit, I'm listening to the rest of their music.
What else are you listening to?
Its the one featuring Daddy Yankee. I like this combo better.
Oh yea you're right sounds better.
I can listen to this song over and over again the whole day haha.
Yea you did that with the other song before for the whole month! What was that song again?
Shoot, let me see if I can remember.
Oh! It's that one with Kygo!
Oh yea you're right! I think I'm going to listen to that again after this song.
I went to check which one and its actually a remix by Kygo. The actual singer is name Mellow titled M83.
Yea you're right. Hey you made my life easier by not googling it. You're my google!
