what type of music do you like
i like all kinds of music
anything in perticular
i love oldies like 70's and 80's music
do you have favorites
actually I love the 1 hit wonders
what is that
you know people who had 1 hit but never really did anything else that got popular
oh like what kind of songs
like the song Somebody's watching me
oh I know that one, I guess he never did anything else
or Electric Avenue from the 80's
oh yeah, that was the guy in the video with the long dredlocks
yes, but he never had anymore hits after that
Yea those songs are kinda fun to remember
what about modern music do you like any
no not at all, it all sounds the same to me
I agree, not much variety
do you like rap
not at all again all sounds the same and the language is so bad.
