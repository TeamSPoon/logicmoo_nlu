Have you ever seen The 40 year old virgin?
Yes I have and it was hilarious! Steve Carrel cracks me up.
He is so funny. I thought Seth Rogen did a good lowkey job in that movie too.
And the dialogue was so clever. They made you believe a man could actually be a virgin at 40.
Those guys when they get together make some really funny movies. Do you like Adam Sandler?
I definitely do. Happy Gilmore is my favorite movie of his.
Oh yeah? Mine is Little Nicky.
I think it's funny how we blatantly puts his sponsors in the spotlight in those movies.
You're right. It becomes like a little easter egg hunt to spot the sponsors.
Click was an excellent movie by him too. It was a little different from his usual but surprisingly heartwarming.
