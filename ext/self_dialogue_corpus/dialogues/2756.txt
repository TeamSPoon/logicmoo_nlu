How do you like Jacksonville's chances this year?
Not much to be honest with you.
But they're getting better don't you think?
Their defense is getting better, not the offense.
They seem to have a carousel at QB.
I just don't think Blake Bortles is the answer.
He's been a drag on them for the most part.
I think they'll give up on him after this year and rebuild.
I like the defense though.
Yeah, lots of talent there.  Jalen Ramsey is a real good player.
He was a good pick for them for sure.  Tons of upside.
And if he can get healthy, I want to see what Dante Fowler can do.
Yeah, I miss not seeing him rush the passer.  Sad that he missed his whole first year.
You know who I'm excited to see on defense for them is Myles Jack.
Yeah, that guy should be a beast.
I'm hoping he's healthy now to start.
He had tons of talent coming out of UCLA.
Right, now's the time to bounce back from his knee injury.
Who knows, maybe their offense will click for them this year.
Not likely, but Leonard Fournette will help.
