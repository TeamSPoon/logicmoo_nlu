Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?
Yes I've seen all of them i'm a big fan.
Which did you like the move?
I actually liked the first one the most?
Why is that?
It's where it all began and we got to learn all the characters and see the world in movie format for the first time.
That's a good point it was an exciting time.
Yes it was.
Do you think they did a good job putting it on the big screen?
I think they did a fabulous job actually I didn't think for one second this isn't right.
I thought that way too.
I just love Harry as a character.
He's your typical person except braver and more determined.
Don't forget about the powers.
That's true that's a big part of this magical movie.
Hogwarts is beautiful and terrifying in the moves.
Why do you say it's terrifying?
Every turn or room has it's secrets and their are plenty of those in the place.
That's true it can be a bit scary.
Yeah but it's a good kind of scary.
