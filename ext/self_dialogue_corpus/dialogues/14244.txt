Did you see the Cavs/Raptors game last night?
Yeah the Raptors are done.
I know. They just aren't on the same level.
Lebron is too good.
Yep and they're too deep. Did you see that 3 Korver made?
I did. They've got him, JR Smith, Frye...
It's just not fair. They have the highest payroll in the league.
They do?
Yeah, by far. Lebron is good but they also basically just bought their team.
I know that's kind of lame.
Who do you think is going to win in the Celtics/Wizards series?
I don't know. I want the Celtics to win.
Yeah, me too. The Wizards look really good though.
Marcin Gortat is a beast.
John Wall is crazy good, too.
He's so good. He can steal, rebound score.
He's a great athlete.
A little out of control, though, he gets a lot of turnovers.
They sort of lack discipline.
Yeah I guess so.
