Who's your favourite NFL team?
Probably the Cowboys. I guess.
What do you mean I guess?
Well, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with them.
Why do you hate them?
I don't like their owner; he fired my favourite coach.
Oh yeah? Who was he?
Well, it was 30 years ago. It was Tom Laundry.
Dang, you can certainly hold a grudge. Why was he fired?
They weren't satisfied with his record, I guess.
Oh. So why did you like him?
I thought he was smart, and I appreciated that he made his athletes behave themselves.
Was he the main reason you loved them?
No, there were a lot of things. I like their quarterback, among others.
So it was a players thing?
Well, honestly, when I was five years old the biggest thing was that I liked their uniforms.
Really? That's adorable.
I thought it was cool that they had a star, and they were cowboys, and stuff.
That is pretty enticing for a five year old.
Yeah. So, I guess I mostly like them for who they were.
