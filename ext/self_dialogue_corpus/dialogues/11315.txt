Well, we are both old enough to have grown up with the Beatles.
Yes, I was in college when they hit it big.
"I Want to Hold Your Hand"--I thought that song was really something.
Same thing with "She Loves You"--so simple but so catchy.
Who was your favorite Beatle?
I was a Paul McCartney guy.
Not very deep, huh.
So you were a John Lennon guy, imagining no religion and the world as one.
Well, not so much at the time, but I have come to appreciate him.
Yes, I know what you mean--he had a sensitivity that I've come to admire.
