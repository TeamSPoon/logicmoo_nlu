What is your favourite Disney movie?
I have always loved Toy Story, I've seen it a hundred times.
Have you seen Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 as well?
Yes, although I think that the first one was the best.
I agree. I especially liked Woody, I think he's very funny.
Yes, Tom Hanks did a great job there.
When did the first Toy Story come out anyway?
I think it was in 1995.
And the last one came out just a while ago, right?
Yes, it came out in 2010.
