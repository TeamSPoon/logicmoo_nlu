Good Morning.
Hi there.
How are you doing today?
Doing okay, yourself?
Not too bad.
What kind of music are you listening to now?
All kinds of stuff really.
Oh okay, yeah I like a lot of different stuff as well.
Cool.
How do you mainly listen to your music?
Like online or radio?
Yeah?
I mostly stream music from spotify or pandora.
Yeah same here unless I'm in my car then it's the radio.
Man I hate listening to the radio.
Yeah I'm not the biggest fan, but it's all I really have in the car.
No XM?
Hah no my car is old.
Oh I see.
Yeah.
