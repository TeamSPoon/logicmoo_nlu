Who has the best uniform in the NBA?
I like the Celtics uniform a lot.
Yeah, that's a classic.
I think the Bulls have nice uniforms as well.
I really like the black alternate uniform the Bulls have.
I think the Lakers uniforms are overrated.
What do you mean?
I think the gold and purple colors look pretty cheesy. We've just become used to it.
I can kind of understand that. Those colors are pretty bold.
It's also really funny that they kept the Lakers name even after the team moved from Minnesota.
Yeah, there are a couple even more extreme examples of that sort of thing.
Right. The Utah Jazz and the Memphis Grizzlies come to mind.
Utah isn't exactly known for pumping out great jazz music.
And when's the last time anyone saw a grizzly bear in Tennessee?
I guess it's a little too late to change the names now though.
Yeah. They've been able to make it work I guess.
The Grizzlies were originally from Vancouver, right?
Yeah I believe so.
I wonder if Canada will ever have another NBA team besides the Raptors?
I don't know, but I think it would be pretty cool if they did.
