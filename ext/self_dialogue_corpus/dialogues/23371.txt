Do you remember Lake Placid?
Not really.  What was it about?
It was a kind of a nature horror movie.
What does that even mean?
Well, it was about a mutant animal living in this lake.
Sounds kind of common and boring.
Oh, it wasn't that bad.  It was kind of like Jaws set in a lake.
So there was a shark in the lake?
No, it actually turned out to be an overfed crocodile!
Oh wait, did it have Betty White in it?
Yes, she owned the land by the lake.
Wasn't she the one feeding the croc?
Yes, wasn't she hilarious?
Betty White is awesome and I loved this part!
Yeah, anyway she had fed the cows to the croc.
It was like a pet to her right?
Yeah, she wanted to protect it too.
Hadn't the crocodile eaten her husband?
Yeah, and as bad as it was, I laughed at that part too!
Me too!  It was the best!
