Have you ever seen the movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?
No, what's it about?
You have to see it! It's about a guy who tries to get home for Thanksgiving and he ends up traveling with this crazy guy.
Who's in it?
It stars Steve Martin and John Candy.
I love Steve Martin!
Yeah, me too! He hasn't been in too much lately though, has he?
Not that I can think of. I just remember him in Roxanne from years ago.
I'm not sure if I've seen that one.
You should see it! You'd love it!
