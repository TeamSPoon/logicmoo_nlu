Do you like Disney movies?
Well, that's kind of a broad question. There's different kinds of Disney movies?
What do you mean?
You know, there's animated films, live action films,  movies on the Disney Channel, all sorts of different kinds.
Yeah, I guess that's true. I mean, do you like them in general? All of them?
Sure. What's not to like? I love the classics like Snow White and Peter Pan.
Me, too. I love 101 Dalmatians. The originals. And the remakes, too.
And Lady and the Tramp. A great one.
I also like the old live action ones. The cheesy ones, even. Like Escape from Witch Mountain.
