Have you seen the new "Pirates" movie?
No, I've not. You?
Yes, it was amazing!
Did they have the same theme song?
Yeah, I love that!
I know.
I hope they get that out to the remixers again.
Yes, I love the Oakenfold mix.
That's my favorite too!
I love Depp.
He's amazing in "Pirates" again!
Not surprised.
They say it's the last movie in the series.
I don't believe it!
I hope it's not so.
I'd hate to lose the soundtrack too.
I know.
I'm sure Hans Zimmer will keep making music though.
Yeah, I wonder what other movie he's doing the music for.
I don't know. I'll look it up.
