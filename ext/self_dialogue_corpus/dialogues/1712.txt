I can't wait for the football season to start back up! Are you excited?
Definitely!  I've been keeping up with the Dallas Cowboys all summer.
Me too.  I think Dak Prescott will be just as good if not better this year.
I do too.  What the Cowboys needed to do this offseason was strengthen their defense.
I totally agree with that.  Their offense was extremely good.
I think they kept most of their offense.  I do think they added some defense to the roster.
After watching some college games, I hope they added some players from Alabama!
That, or made some trades with Green Bay.  They had a good defense last year.
They really did.  Do you know who they got for defense?
I can't think of any names off the top of my head.  You know, I think they should hire Demarcus Ware as a coach though.
Oh yeah!  He's fantastic!
So who do you see in the superbowl?
Without seeing a preseason game I would say Dallas and Denver.  You?
I agree with Dallas for the NFC and I'd put Houston as the AFC side.
That would be cool! A totally Texas superbowl!  I'm not sure if Houston is that good though.
You never know with them.  I do know they've made a lot of changes to their team.
I still think Denver would get the AFC side.  I know Peyton's not their anymore but they are still good.
Denver takes a lot of former Dallas players so that is what makes them good.  I wonder who their quarterback is.
I don't know but I'm excited to find out.  I know preseason is only preseason but I'm still going to watch all of the games that I can!
Me too!  August can't get here soon enough!
