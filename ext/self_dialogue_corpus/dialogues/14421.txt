Why are there only two good teams?
Because the best players decided to join on one team.
The Spurs are pretty good too though.
Yeah, but too bad Pachulia took out Leonard.
So, why do you think Durant joined the Warriors?
Because he did. I have no idea what his motives were. We can only guess.
Yeah, it's not fun though when all the good players join one team.
I know. Basketball is pretty silly.
Yeah, what's the overall point anyway?
Teamwork, and fun.
Good points.
What do you think of the draft?
Nothing, it's pretty pointless to care about who the Lakers get.
I miss the Michael Jordan days.
So do I.
There was no James Harden back then.
Yeah, those were the days.
Do you think Harden will ever win?
Who cares?
Good point.
