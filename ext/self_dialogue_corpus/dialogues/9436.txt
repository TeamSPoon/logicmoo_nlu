Did you hear Jay Z changed how he's spelling his name?
No, but I know he has a new album coming out, 4:44
He's changing it to all caps, no hyphen: J-A-Y Z.
Why do people like him and Sean Combs, I mean Puffy, change their names all the time?
Not sure, it just seems confusing to me.
There's that new Tupac movie out.
The actor looks just like him. I will always love the song California.
That is a great one.
I wonder if we'd be calling him Wiz Tupak now if he'd lived.
And Biggie would be Big Notez!
