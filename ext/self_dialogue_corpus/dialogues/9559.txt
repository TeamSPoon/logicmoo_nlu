Do you like Ludocris music?
Yep-My favorite cd was "Rappers Delight".
Man-that is going way back to 1979. I like more of his modern songs.
Like what?
Remember when Tiger Woods was caught cheating and Luda rapped about it.
That was so cool. I forgot about it.
He really is not a bad actor. I like him in the "Fast and Furious" movies.
I do too! I always look forward to seeing those movies in the theater.
Do you own the Ludaversal cd and if you do can I borrow it.
No I don't sorry.
