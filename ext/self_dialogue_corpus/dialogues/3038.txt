Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
Not really it has become more about making money for the owners than serving the fans.
Why do you think that?
In the past several years teams have moved from one city to another so the owners could make more money and not cared about the fans left behind.
What else is the cause?
The owners want the taxpayers to finance a new facility rather than find the means to do it themselves.
Do You think the teams are playing well?
Not as well as they did a decade or 2 ago.
What makes you say that?
There are too many penalties and the players are not paying attention to the rules and fundamentals.
Do you have a team you like?
Yes I do.
Which team is that?
It is the Packers.
What makes the Packers one that you like?
They put a good product on the field.
Is their anything else?
They have to be tough to play home in the middle of winter.
Is there another reason?
They are usually a team in the playoffs.
