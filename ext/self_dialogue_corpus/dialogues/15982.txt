Do you like the band Type O Negative?
I used to love them. My friends and I used to follow them around on tour back in the day.
Meaning you don't love them anymore?
I still love their old stuff, but after they turned Goth, I lost interest.
You mean they weren't always Goth?
Noooo. They used to be a hardcore punk band! Their songs were really rough, harsh and offensive.
Oh wow, I didn't know that! When was that?
In the late 80's. The vocalist, Peter Steele, started off in a band called Carnivore. Type O Negative was a spin-off of that.
I started to listen to them after the Bloody Kisses album.
That was when they were still a little bit punk, but the big hits on that album were Goth. The hits were so big, in fact, that they completely switched to the Goth genre after that.
Oh you mean those fast songs on that album like "Fay Wray, Come Out and Play".
Yes, like that. But their earlier albums were much more harsh sounding.
So you don't like the Bloody Kisses album at all?
Actually I really do like that album, I even prefer the Goth songs on that album. It's really the full Goth albums afterward that turned me off.
It's too bad that Peter Steele died so young. He was truly a brilliant musician.
He wouldn't have said so. He would have said, "Don't mistake lack of talent for genius."
That's true, he did say that. That's funny.
He said a lot of sarcastic and hilarious things. He could also be very offensive.
Did you know that he used to be a sanitation worker before he got famous?
Yes, I read about that.I also read that he lived with his mom until he passed away. Seems like a very down to earth guy for someone so famous.
