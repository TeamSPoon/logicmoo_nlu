Who do you like in The Lion King?
I like Simba the most.
Did you like Scar?
I thought he was a good character for sure.
Do you like Mufasa?
Yes, James Earl Jones did a great job with his voice.
I miss those cartoons. It is all Pixar now.
Yeah, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella and Robin Hood are all so good. I wish they could make more.
I think the most recent cartoon was The Princes and the Frog.
Yeah, that was a really good one.
