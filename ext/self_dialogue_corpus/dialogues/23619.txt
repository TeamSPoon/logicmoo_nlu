Do you remember the Scream movies?
Yeah, I only saw the first two though.
Why didn't you see them all?
It got repetitious after a while.
What do you mean?
The first one was good, but it should have ended at that.
Oh, I see.
Why make it a trilogy?
Well, actually they did make a fourth.
Yeah, they didn't need that one either.
I guess not.
The first one was great.  It was a new type of horror movie.
Yeah, and the others weren't as good.  I see what you are saying.
And then there were other movies that did the same thing.
Like "I Know What You Did Last Summer?"
Exactly.  That didn't need a sequel either.
Which did you like more?
Probably "I Know What You Did Last Summer."
Oh, that's because you are a Jennifer Love fan.
Probably.  But Scream wasn't nearly as good.
