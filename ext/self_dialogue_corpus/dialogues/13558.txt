Hello
Hi there.
Did you hear they are making a new Han Solo movie?
Yeah I did hear that.
Sounds pretty neat.
Yeah, but I don't know too much about it.
I don't know too much either.  I know Woody Harleson is going to be in it.
Really, that's an interesting choice.
Yeah, but I think he'll be great.
Guess we will find out.
