When did van halen break up anyway?
They're still touring.
But sammy Hagar is no longer with the band?
David lee Roth joined back
That's so cool. When did that happen?
um, When they announced the last tour. Back in 2015.
Then when's the next tour date?
I dunno. I have to check. let's see. Oh wait. there are no more tour dates.
Hah. That sucks.
i guess we missed the last tour in 2015.
guess so. I'm sure they'll start it up again.
They're getting too old for touring. How old is Eddie? He's like 62. He's a senior citizen.
So are all the old rockers from the 80s. Look at Ozzy though. He's still going strong.
Dude can barely walk. He'll need a walker soon.
That'll be so hilarious to see. Grandpa's rocking out using their walkers.
Throwing up the metal signs, bobbing their heads. screaming rock'n roll!
It's golden. We should make a documentary on senile old metal fans.
That will make money I'm sure.`
It might even win a few awards.
The best documentary Oscars. Boom!
