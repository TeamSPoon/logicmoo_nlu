Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL will be this year?  And you can't say Tom Brady.
Wow, that kind of ties my hands, but I'll give it a shot.
Okay, then.  Who are you picking?
How about Aaron Rodgers?  He definitely makes the Packers go.
That's a pretty good choice; I'll give you that.  But how about Matt Ryan?
He's pretty good for sure, but that Super Bowl loss last year makes me wonder about his big game ability.
To be fair, you can't really blame that all on him.  The offensive coordinator made several questionable play calls in the second half.
No doubt.  And the Falcons could never get back in an offensive rhythm.
I would have loved to have seen Atlanta win that game.
Me too.  I was really rooting for them.
Hopefully, they will be able to make a return to the big game this season.
I don't know.  Sometimes even the best teams never make it back.
All right, then.  Who do you see in the Super Bowl this year if not the Falcons?
Call me crazy, but I think the Cowboys or the Packers may have a shot in the NFC.
Who's your AFC pick?
I'll take the Chiefs or maybe the Raiders, but it will probably be the Patriots.
I'd be happy to see either KC or Oakland?  It would be nice to see someone new have some success.
Even though Brady is awesome and a decent guy, it's time for someone else to have a turn, indeed.
Well, only about 2 months until the season begins and we can start seeing how it will all fall into place.
Oh man, I can hardly wait!  I've been needing an pro football fix ever since the Super Bowl ended!
