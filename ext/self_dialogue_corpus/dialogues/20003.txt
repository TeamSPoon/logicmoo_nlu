Do you like Fleetwood Mac?
I have no strong opinion either way, really. Do you?
Yeah! I love them, actually.
Interesting. What makes you such a fan?
I think the whole story of the band is great. They went through a lot.
How is that?
Well it's named after Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. They formed in England as a Blues band
Really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, and eventually most of the members dropped and they picked up two unknowns named Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks
Well they're not so unknown anymore, that's for sure
Seriously, and at that time they move away from blue and into Rock
Interesting, not that many bands just totally switch styles
True, and the whole band had a lot of personal drama
Really? I didn't know that.
Yes, Buckingham and Nicks dated and broke up and were not on good terms. A few other band members dated too
I can definitely see why that caused some conflict
Absolutely. If you listen to most of their old songs, you can tell they're breakup songs or about them not getting along, especially on their album Rumors
I would have never guessed, that's crazy
Yeah most of the band didn't either. They kept it a secret
Someone should write a biography!
