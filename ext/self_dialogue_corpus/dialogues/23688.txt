Hey I hear the new Aliens movie is out.
I think it came out last weekend.
Its supposed to be pretty good.  Some flaws.
That director is like that.  Slow with pacing a story.
He's still a good director.
Will you go see it?
If I can get a group together.
Yeah that's a film that would be best on a big screen.
Did you see the last one, Prometheus?
I did.  That was different.
Different how?
You know, new worlds, engineers, DNA, and the making of aliens.
Gotcha.  Pure sci fi stuff though.
That's true.  Just so different from the other Alien movies.
Those other ones are old school now, but classics.
I really liked those old ones...so scary.
Prometheus was scary too.
And really cutting edge.
I want to go see this new film really badly.
Tell me how it goes.  I'll try to get out there.
