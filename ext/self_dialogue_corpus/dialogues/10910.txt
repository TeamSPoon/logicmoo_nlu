Do you know what year the movie "Fast & Furious " came out?
I believe it came out in 2009.  It was right after Tokyo Drift.
I believe this was Paul Walker's best acting performance when speaking of the fast and furious movies.
I agree with you. He was really strong in this movie.
I also think Michelle Rodriquez did well in this movie. She matched well with Vin Diesel.
That is so true. They look like a match made in heaven. They were so into each other.
Did you see the types of cars they use in this movie? I was really feeling the Buick GNX.
It was a nice car but I liked the Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R that  was in the movie.
I'm sure they enjoyed driving those cars. It sure looks like a lot of fun.
Tell me about it. I need all those cars in my life some day.
