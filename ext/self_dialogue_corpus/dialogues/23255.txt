Do you like monster movies?
I think they're okay, but it's not my favorite genre.  How about you?
I was always a huge fan.  Particularly kaiju movies.
You mean like Godzilla?
Exactly.  Anything with giant monsters is good to me.
I did like 'Cloverfield.'
That was good.  And an interesting American take on the genre.
What did you think about the American 'Godzilla' movies?
I think I like the Japanese ones better.  The Matthew Broderick one was a mess.
The writing was really bad.  Dialogue didn't make sense.
I think the Bryan Cranston one from a few years ago was better.
That said, he only came out in the first 20 minutes or so.
True.  They definitely marketed the movie to be Bryan Cranston vs. Godzilla, and they kill off his character immediately.
What did you think about King Kong?
The most recent one?  That was very entertaining.
I liked it too.  Plus they're setting the stage for a monster cinematic universe.
That could have potential to be huge, no pun intended.
Is Pacific Rim in the same universe?
Not to my knowledge, though that's a spin-off I'd fully support.
Me too.  That was a cool movie.
