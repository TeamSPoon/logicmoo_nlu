Have you watched any new movies recently?
Sure! I watched Alien Covenant because I'm a huge fan of the Alien movies franchise.
Oh, that's interesting. I've been thinking of watching it.
Well, I wouldn't recommend it. It was extremely disappointing.
Really? Can you tell me why?
Well, it was disappointing on so many levels. The acting, screenplay, direction etc. I could go on.
Wait a minute! Didn't Ridley Scott direct this movie?
Yes, he did. And that's what makes it even more disappointing.
That a director of his caliber can churn our mediocre films?
Yes, and it also makes me feel now that the Alien franchise has become a caricature of what it used to be.
That does sound very disappointing. Yes, the earlier Alien movies were amazing.
This movie is actually a continuation of the story from Prometheus.
Does it have the same characters?
Sadly, no. We only see Michael Fassbender reprising his role as David.
He was good though at portraying the character, I imagine?
Yes he was. But very few of the rest of the cast were as competent.
How about the story itself?
It was massively disappointing. There were so many plot holes.
Well, I am really shocked to hear all this. I guess I won't watch it after all.
Yes, I would instead recommend watching some of the older Alien movies.
