Wow what a day. I need to take a break and listen to some music and unwind
What kind of music helps you unwind?
I like ambient music the best.
Like what or who?
Oh let's see... i like Nicholas Gunn. He is from England.
I haven't heard of him
He is very new age and also EDM, and plays flute.
What do you mean a flute? Like a metal flute or a Zamfir like thing?
He was trained in classical music from 7- 11 and then he moved with his family to California.
well that is a broad scope from EDm to New Age
yeah I guess he had to find his "voice".
What do you like of his that I should listen to?
Hi album Afternoon in Sedona Is what made me like his music.
Ok I will give it a try
If you don't listen to but one of his songs try Bamboo. It's a little less "sweet and syrupy" as some of the other ones. It's got a beat to it.
Not really something that i would normally go for but hey who knows..
That particular one is more like what I would call World Music.
Yeah I know what you mean by world music.
OOo that reminds me of that video that is on youtube with people from all over the world played parts of the song Stand by Me from the indigenous countries. So cool!
O good I need to look that one up too. Thanks!
