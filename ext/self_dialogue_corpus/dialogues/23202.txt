Do you like watch Stephen King movies?
Some of them! My favorite is The Green Mile.
That's a really good one.
I also like The Shawshank Redemption.
That one is my favorite!
Andy Dufrane is such a lovable character.
You can't help but root for him in the movie.
And the prison guard is such a jerk.
Yeah but luckily he gets his revenge.
I can't believe he made andy work for him.
And he took advantage of him!
When he locked him in the confinement was horrible.
The whole movie is just so great.
I want to rewatch it again now.
I'm sure you can find a copy of it somewhere.
No doubt. It's a classic.
It's funny how it didn't do too well when it first came out.
Oh really?
Yeah it bombed at the box office.
And now it's one of the best rated movies ever!
