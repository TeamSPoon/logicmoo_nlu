What do you think of the Happiest Millonaire?
I actually kind of like it.
I don't. I think it is one of the lesser Disney movies.
I like it better than Summer Magic.
Well, that one was a total waste of talent.
At least the Happiest Millionaire had Fred McMurrary and Greer Garson.
I do like Lesley Ann Warren in that.
Eh. I'm not too crazy about her.  I like Haley Mills better.
But, the songs are kind of cute in Happiest Millionaire.
I agree.
