Hey, are you going to be home Sunday for the game?
Which one, the 12:00 or 3:00?
The Cowboys vs Eagles game at 3.
Oh yeah, I have to run errands in the morning. But, I'll be there for that for sure.
Man Cowboys gonna whoop up on some Eagles.
You know that. Man Prescott is going show them what Texas ball is.
Yeah and Eagles defense is Whack!
I don't know. They grabbed up some defense during the draft.
We'll see. But, Dallas is got that offense, yo!
Yeah they do. Man Elliott is a beast.
The Eagles got a good rookie quarterback though.
Yeah but do they have anything else on offense?
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
Yeah we will. Dallas got that crazy offense.
Yeah man, defense isn't too bad either.
No, but hopefully some of that they picked up in the draft will strengthen it.
Heck yeah.
Man, this going to be a pretty good game.
Yeah, sure enough. You watching on the big screen?
You know it. I got that mancave set up for NFL,yo!
