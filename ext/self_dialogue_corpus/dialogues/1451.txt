Wow, that's a classic Niners shirt!
It sure is. I'm a second generation fan.
I got to see a few games in 95, nothing like it.
So you got to see Deion Sanders fly around the field?
That was unbelievable! I bought a shirt there that said "Deion does Dallas"
I saw those shirts. Our family has had season tickets forever. How about Jerry Rice?
I swear he was like an acrobat and ballet dancer on that field.
He was also an Olympic sprinter and World Series outfielder too.
My friend's uncle went on a cruise and we got to use his season's tickets.
it was the best show in town, with the best audience anywhere before they moved the stadium to yuppieville.
I know, what a tragedy. Have you been to the new stadium?
I refuse to go. A friend of mine hosts a great tailgate party on a lake every Sunday.
The home television situation has come a long way lately. Better screens and more access to games.
Yeah. I get the NFL package on direct TV, what about you?
Same although I would like to see some healthy competion. I don't like them as a cable provider.
Right? I would wager that more than half of their business is made up of football fans.
I assume you saw that game where Steve Young threw the ball and then caught it himself?
That was sweet.  It's a shame that he played through so much injury.
The live game experience is just not what it used to be.
I will travel to see an out of town game now before a home game. The fans were betrayed here.
