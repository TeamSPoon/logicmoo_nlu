What was the last thing you saw Adam Sandler in?
I've been watching his new movies on Netflix.
I don't think I've seen any of them.
You have to watch them, especially The Do Over.
What si that one about.
He's a secret agent and gets help from David spade, but David is this loser guy from his high school.
It sounds more like an action movie.
Adam makes it funny. He's basically the same as he would be in real life, but with cool spy moves.
Well David Spade and Adam Sandler is a great place to start for big comedy.
And this movie certainly delivers on that bill.
