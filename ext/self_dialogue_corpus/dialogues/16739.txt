Back in the days, when the music recording wasn't widely, people had to learn the music by playing it or singing it.
And for that they needed the musical scores.
And thus born was this music publishing industry.
Tin pan alley was the most favorite of them all if you ask me.
Perhaps. It was the biggest for sure. But Europe has richer publishing history than the US.
Maybe, but the popular music was made "popular" by and tin pan alley.
By two folks named Woodard and Harms. And they specialized in popular music, instead of the usuall hymns or classical music.
they really started to popularize the "popular" music for the masses.
And that's why it took hold among the American public evolving into what it is today.
Just absolute global domination of cultural and musical scene, not many other countries can even come close to competing against it
American market share is twice as large as Japan's
Vast majority of 50 best selling musical acts are American.
We sure do love out music.
Yep. Hey, we have to listen to our music, otherwise, we would have to go back to actual work.
Anything but that...
Hey. did you know an American worker's productivity has almost doubled in the last 3 decades?
Really? Huh. Maybe listening to music helps with our productivity...
Anyway, but still, i gotta say, the best musical act of all time has to be the Beatles.
That's a tall order... The best musical act...
The Beatles or Elvis. I'm kinda conflicted.
