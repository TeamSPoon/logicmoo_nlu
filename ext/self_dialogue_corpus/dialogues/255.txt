What is your favorite recent superhero movie?
I have to say wonder woman.
I just saw it, pretty good. I like chris pine.
I was wondering what he had done to his skin.
What do you mean?
Well pine's skin has always been noticeably bad, but in wonder woman looks different.
Probably a chemical peel or some other holly wood secret trick.
I would love to know Gal Godot's secret , she is so beautiful.
Easy.. be brought to life by zeus and born an amazon woman.
If only.. I really enjoyed the story of her origins. Cool it is based on ancient myths.
