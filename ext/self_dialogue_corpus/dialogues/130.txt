I hope they get rid of Aflec as Batman.
That'll take a while.
Probably.
Justice League is coming out and I heard they have another Suicide Squad in the works.
Oh boy!
I didn't mind that movie so much.
Little heavy handed with the CGI. The villain really left me wanting more.
Fortunately, we didn't have to see Ben to much!
True. The Joker was OK.
Ledger was better.
