What was the first music concert you ever went to?
Hall and Oates. We won a contest, and they came to our high school and played.
what was the contest?
It was a radio contest. You had to write Hall and Oates on a 3 by 5 piece of paper, and all the high schools were participating. The school that sent in the most papers won.
How did your school write the most papers?
Our teachers were really supportive. They let us write during class while they talked.
That's amazing the teachers would let you do that.
The art class teachers let their classes spend the whole time cutting up papers for everyone.
They must have really wanted you to win.
Our high school was very competitive. The sports teams always won awards. They wanted us to learn to strive to be winners.
Was it a good concert?
Of course. We were all teens, and most of us had never been to a concert.
Did you live in a small town?
Yes, and it was very conservative, and the 70s, so for a lot of us it was our first rock music concert experience.
Were you a fan of the band?
They had a song out that played on the radio all the time called "Rich Girl." I used to drive my dad nuts singing that song.
He didn't like it, or you sang it too much?
It had a cuss word in it. Witch only with a B. So he made me sing Witch, but I would always sing the bad word when he wasn't around, and he was always trying to catch me doing it.
Was your dad really strict?
YES. WHen I was 16, some friends were traveling to Chicago to see Pink Floyd, and my dad refused to let me go. He said a sixteen year old girl does not need to go to Chicago, or to a Pink Floyd concert.
