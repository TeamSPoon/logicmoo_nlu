How about those Yankees this year.
I know right, who would of expect them to be playing this well.
They have such a young team this year, thought this was a year to just gain some experience.
They are hitting the ball like the bronx bombers of old.
I know this Aaron Judge is a monster of a man.
Yeah, he's like 6'7" and a tank out there.
He has such a quick bat and can hit to any field.
What has surprised me is that everyone on the team has been hitting.
The pitching has also been solid tis year.
Who would of thought, they would be coming through likethey are.
They got a shot at the playoff if they can keep up this pace.
With Toronto playing like they are, starting off slow again maybe they can get some distance between them.
Yeah Toronto, has once again started off slowly, but they usually turn it around in June.
Did you catch the Jeter ceremony the other night.
Yeah, it was awesome and well deserved.
They should of gave him his statue after his last at bat.
He was truly the heart and sole of the team.
I really miss seeing him play.
I'm glad I got to see him place live in person before he retired.
Yep, me too.  Something I will tell my kids about.
