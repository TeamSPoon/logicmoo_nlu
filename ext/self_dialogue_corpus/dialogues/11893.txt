Paul McCarthy wrote and performed "Coming Up" with his wife Linda. You remember that?
Course I remember that. I also remember that John Lennon wrote "Imagine".
You ever saw footage of when the Beatles came to the states?
Yeah, they were performing on the Ed Sullivan show and they sung "She Love You Yeah Yeah Yeah."
You remember when John Lennon of the Beatles was murdered?
Yeah, it was like the world stopped. I think every radio in the world played "Let It Be" for over 24 hours.
You remember when Linda, Paul's wife died?
Yeah, I wondered how it would affect his song writing and the I remembered he wrote "And I love her."
Were you there during these incidencts or did you research this information?
Both, while researching I listened to the Beatles version of "Come Together." Superb!
