I went to go see a Lifehouse concert when I was 14, do you remember them?
I do! I loved their music.
3 Doors Down was also there at their concert.
I remember their song "Kryptonite".
Also a fave of mine! You don't hear songs like that no.
You really don't! I enjoyed their music.
I did too.  I actually downloaded that song on my phone last month.
Do you remember the name of the lead singer in 3 Doors Down?
I'm not sure but I know it's something familiar, let me think.
Was it Brad Arnold I think?
