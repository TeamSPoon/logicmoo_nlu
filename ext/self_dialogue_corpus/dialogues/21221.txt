Do you think Donald Trump will get a movie made about his Presidency?
He could but people may be scared away from creating one around him?
Why is that?
He would sue them if he thought it was disparaging to him.
Thats true, I guess we wont see it.
I think we may see a movie about the election and campaigns.
Couldnt that be more of a Netflix documentary?
Yes it could be but I think having a movie about it would be better.
There was enough drama to not have to manufacture any.
I agree and to be honest I think that it could have dire consequences for movies going forward.
In what respect?
I think that you need to toe the line between telling the story and telling the story with drama.
What would be the end result for that?
You dont want to real life characters to come out and speak about how bad the movie is.
OK so you think more directors will pay attention to accuracy?
I do due to the world we live in.
That we demand perfection?
No its jut that we needed to make sure these films are on point and dont go off track too far.
So we are a smarter film culture now?
No its just that we demand a level of intelligence to be reflected in our movies.
