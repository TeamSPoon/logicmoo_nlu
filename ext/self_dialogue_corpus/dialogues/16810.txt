Do you listen to k-pop?
No, I've never heard of it. What is that?
It's korean pop music. It's becoming more and more popular internationally.
That sounds pretty interesting. What does it sound like?
It really covers lots of genres. It can be rap, rock, EDM, or just regular pop-sounding music.
I like all of these things. Do they sing in English?
Usually the songs are in Korean, although some songs are written in Chinese, Japanese, or English as well.
That sounds pretty unique.
A lot of the time the songs in Korean have English words and phrases sprinkled throughout them as well.
Can you recommend any music to me? I'd like to check this out.
If you like rap music, you should check out Big Bang, BTS, Monsta X, or NCT 127.
I like rap, but what about more pop-sounding music?
In that case, you could listen to EXO, Seventeen, or SF9. These are all popular boy groups.
Oh, are there any girls that sing k-pop?
Yes! Some of the most popular groups right now are girl groups.
What are they called?
Blackpink is very dance-y and rap focused, and Twice and Gfriend are more fun pop style music.
These sound right up my alley!
I have some of these CDs if you want to borrow them.
Sure! Maybe it's time for me to become a k-pop fan.
