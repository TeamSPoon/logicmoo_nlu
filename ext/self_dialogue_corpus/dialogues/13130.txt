I saw the first Star Wars movie when it came out in theaters.
Do you mean "Star Wars IV: A New Hope?"
Yes, and I saw "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" when they were released in theaters.
When was the first movie released?
"A New Hope" was released in 1977.
Have they released all of the movies in the series?
No, they are supposed to start filming Episode IX in 2017.
I heard that the filming was delayed due to Carrie Fisher's death.
Yes, she was supposed to have a key role in episode IX.
Now they have to make some changes!
