You ready for football season?
Yes my son has been so excited since he kinda understands it now and he can watch with his dad.
My kids are ready for the Sunday football partys the guys have.
Are your kids rooting for any one special?
Definatly everyones with the Saints and i want the Steelers to go to the play offs.
My husband wants the Saints to win every year.
Do you remind him how bad they are.
I remind him how sad his quarter back is.
That is true i dont care for Drew Brees eigther.
My husband and kids think he is the quarter back god.
They need to see Peyton Manning or Tom Brady theres a quarterback for them to admire.
Oh no my husband hates Tom Brady and the Patriots.
I dont care for Bill Belicheck the coach but i think Tom Bradys a very talented player.
I have heard that Bill Bellicheck has been accused of cheating before.
Yes i remember hearing about that before something about playbooks or something.
I have heard my family complain about it but Bellicheck never got in trouble from the NFL so i assumed it didnt happen.
I dont know i just like to watch and rub it in when my team is doing great and his cant even make it to the playoffs.
I know that is the best part and the kids hate it when my team wins.
Maybe we can get both familys together for a game.
That would be fun for us and the kids lets make a weekend of it.
