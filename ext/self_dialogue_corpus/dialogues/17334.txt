Do you have a favorite band?
Right now I listen to a lot of Mazzy Starr.
Really?  Weren't they big in the 90's?
Yea, that had at least one big hit.
What was it?
It was called Fade Into You.
Oh, that's right.  That was a smooth song.
Yes, it was very mellow and relaxing.
So why do you still listen to them so much?
I need music that helps me relax!
How many albums do they have?
I think three in total.
There were two in the 90's, right?
I think so...then they released one a couple years ago.
How was the new music?
A little spottier than their older stuff but still enjoyable!
Maybe I'll give one of their albums a spin.
You really should!  It's great to listen to when trying to relax after work.
I could sure use some of that!
I know how stressed you have been!  Enjoy!
