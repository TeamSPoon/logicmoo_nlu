What was the name of Paul McCartney's band?
You mean the Beatles?
No, the one after the Beatles broke up.
Oh, in the 70s and 80s?
Yeah, what was his band's name?
I think it was Wings.
Yeah, that's it.
Why do you ask?
I was wondering the name of the song they did for the James Bond movie.
Oh, that was Live and Let Die.
