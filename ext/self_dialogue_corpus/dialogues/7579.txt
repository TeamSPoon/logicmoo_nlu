Which Harry Potter movie did you like the best?
I loved all of them.
If you had to choose, which one would you pick?
I would have to say, Deathly Hollows part 2.
That one is kind of sad.
It is. But it needed to be, they were growing up.
I was so sad when the Weasly twin died!
But it showed that war is not a happy thing.
I think you are right, I felt like I grew with the characters.
It was a sad, but fitting end to the series.
