We sure have lost a lot of musicians lately.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you hadn't noticed.
We Prince of course. That was all over the news.
How about Merle Haggard?
Who's he?
A country artist.
Well, that's why I didn't hear about that.
David Bowie?
Oh, yeah.
George Michael.
Your right.
Yup. Dropping like flies.
That's really sad.
Yeah, especially for the ones that were so young.
Like who?
Chris Cornnelle just past?
How old was he?
Like 50.
That is too young.
