Who was the best Disney Villain?
Scar all the way.
No doubt!
I know, he killed and betrayed his own brother.
And made a deal with those hyenas.
Jeremy Irons was perfect in that role.
Tell me about it.  You know who else was awesome?
Captain Hook.
I was just about to say that.
Great minds think alike.
