Do you have a favorite Disney ballad?
I do. It's When You Wish Upon a Star.
Why do you like it so much?
I think the lyrics are realy inspirational.
My favorite is So This is Love from Cinderella.
That's a pretty song.
It is and I like how romantic it is.
True.
Seems like Disney has a lot of good ballads.
They have some good song writers.
