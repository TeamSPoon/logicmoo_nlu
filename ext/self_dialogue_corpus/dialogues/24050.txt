Did you hear about the new wonder woman movie?
Yeah, I've heard it's really good.
Yeah me too, but it seems like people either love it or hate it.
Yeah, it's kind of weird that they chose such unknown actors for it.
Yeah, I was surprised by that too. Whats the name of the actress?
Which one?
The one that plays wonder woman.
oh Gal Gadot I think.
Hmm, that's an odd name.
Yeah, Chris Pine is in it though too.
He's great I loved him in Star Trek
Yeah me too, and in into the woods.
You know I just realized he was in the Princess Diaries.
Oh wow, I didn't realize that I loved that movie!
Me too, both of them.
Yeah Anne Hathaway was the best!
I miss when she still did cute movies!
Yeah, do you remember Ella Enchanted?
Yeah, that was a great one, we should have movie marathon!
That would be fun!
