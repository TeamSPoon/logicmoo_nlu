You're a big Beatles fan, aren't you?
I LOVE The Beatles! I have all of their music.
I just got the White Album and I'm listening to it right now. It's good.
It's REALLY good. I really like Happiness is a Warm Gun and I Will.
I like While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Who is singing on that?
That one is George Harrison. It's one of the best songs of his.
I also like Why Don't We Do It In the Road? Funny!
Yes, that's a good one. If you're going to buy Beatles music you need to check out Rubber Soul.
Okay, what's good on that one? I'll be sure to look into it.
The whole album is good. My favorite is the song Girl. Beautiful!
