When was the first time you saw Star Wars?
I saw Return of the Jedi at the drive-in when it was first released, and from there I was hooked.
That's funny.  Me too!
I begged my parents to let me see all three movies and I tried to buy all things Star Wars.
What did you like so much?
It was the characters, the setting, the plot, the epic-ness of the whole thing.  I had never seen a movie like it in my life.
I felt the same way.  I used to pretend I was Luke Skywalker coming to rescue everyone.
I used to try to perform Jedi mind tricks on everyone.
Hahaha.  Did it ever work.
Unfortunately, no.  The force is not strong in me.
