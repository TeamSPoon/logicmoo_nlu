Did you hear there is a Star Wars 8 coming out soon?
Yes1 I heard it is called Star Wars 8 "The Last Jedi 8".
It has many new Characters, I heard.
Luke Skywalker will be in it.
I can not wait till it comes out.
Me too! they have shown a trailer of the movie.
Star Wars V is a good episode, it is when Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fight.
That was great! Luke did not know Darth Vader was his dad.
Darth Vader was always trying to make Luke Skywalker join the dark side but he did not.
I know!, but in the end Darth Vader became a decent person and left the dark side.
