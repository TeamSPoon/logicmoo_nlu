So I was surprised by how much I like Harry Style's new music.
Same! Especially since I haven't been all that impressed by the other ones from One Direction.
Right? Like, I'll hear their stuff and I don't hate it, but I didn't go look it up to hear it again.
I never thought he release an album like that.
Me neither, I'm pleasantly surprised. It's got a very Paul McCartney-esque sound to it.
Yes! And some David Bowie too. You can really hear the British influence to it, not just pop.
Good point. I think I'm going to listen to the whole album, I've only listened to a couple of the songs.
You should, it's really good.
Did you see the video for Sign of the Times though?
It's weird, I know. I couldn't even watch the whole thing.
