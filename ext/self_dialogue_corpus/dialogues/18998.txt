I found an old AKAI cassette machine today, model GXC-730D. When it was new in 1977 or 1979 it cost about $600.
Holy cow! Probably sells for $50 on eBay nowadays. Probably weighs 40 pounds, too.
It does. But it has a feature of playing tapes backwards. I ran a bunch of my old Beatles tapes through it.
What did you hear when you played the Beatles tapes backwards?
"All Together Now" becomes "1984, 1984, 1984".
Like the George Orwell book.
Right. And "Bungalo Bill" has "Hey, Beelzebub, Hey, Lucifer" over and over again.
Yikes. I haven't heard that song in years. And I always thought "Sexy Sadie" was saying "Sexy Satan".
I thought so too, after the first time you hear the phrase.
And "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" has nothing to do with LSD. It's actually "The Moon, The Stars, and the Sun."
Which Lennon used later on. Right. Lucifer meaning the Sun, when people worshiped the Sun not the Moon.
What else did you discover, playing the tapes backwards?
Well of course on "Revolution 9", there's "Turn Me On Dead Man, turn me on.."
Supposedly a reference to their deceased manager, Brian Epstein.
And I swear I heard "We're Revolutionary" on George Harrison's song, "Julia".
That's a new one on me. The song was for his mother, I think.
And also in "Revolution 9", backwards, you can hear Paul yelling, "Let Me Out! Let Me Out!"
Because he was supposedly killed in a car crash and replaced by a Doppleganger.
Right.
I remember the Lennon and Elton John version of "Lucy In The Sky" having "Hey! Paul!" planted in the background, to annoy Paul McCartney.
