So what do you think is the bigger franchise, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings?
That's not even a question is it? It's obviously Star Wars.
Okay, maybe so, but I'd argue that the public knows just as many Lord of the Ring characters as they do Star Wars.
Ha, no way. Name some then.
Gandolf, Frodo, Samwise, Gollum, Legolas, Aragorn, Bilbo, and plenty more.
Sure, but in Yoda, Vader, the Emperor, Han, Luke, Chewie, Leia, R2D2, C-3P0, and even characters like Tarkin. That's just the original trilogy.
Seems close. If I add in The Hobbit there's a lot more.
And then I'd add in the prequels, the sequels, and the spin-off movies. Even characters everyone hates like Jar-Jar people still know.
Yeah, yeah, I guess it was kind of dumb to compare them.
Look, Lord of the Rings is huge, really it is. But it's no Star Wars.
