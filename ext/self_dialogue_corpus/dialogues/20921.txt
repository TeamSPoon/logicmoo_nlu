Have you seen any classic movies lately?
No I do not usually watch classics, what about you?
I recently watched what I consider classic 80's movies
like what?
St. Elmos Fire
oh, I think I saw that a long time ago
It was super popular in the 80's
who was in it
the classic brat pack, Demi Moore, Andrew Mccarthy, Judd Nelson Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estavez
I think I do remember that
They were all collage friends, kind of a coming of age story
can you rent it on video
I am not sure about renting but I am sure there is a streaming service that you can watch it on
I will check Netflix
you may need to check Amazon video, they have a lot of the older shows
do you have to pay for that service
Yes but it also allows you freee shipping on purchases, music downloads and more
Maybe I can just buy it on Ebay
It probably would be pretty cheap
I will try there
