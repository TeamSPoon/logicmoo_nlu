Whats your favorite Rocky movie?
Of course the original, but they all pretty good.
The original was so good, they made a real statue!
Yea, and people run up the art museum steps all the time, reenacting the scenes.
Sylvestor Stallone literally made himself famous with that movie
Yea, it was really lucky and a lot of hardwork on his part.
And eating a lot of raw eggs probably played a part in it.
Boxing movies are really well done as far as movie genres go.
Million Dollar Baby was so fun to watch
Yea, but the ending was really sad.
I liked how they showed how a female fighter could make it in this sport
I think it did help people think about female roles in sports
Clint Eastwood was a very decent actor in that
I liked Ali too
It was ok, Will Smith is a great actor though
He put on a lot of muscle on for that movie
It was cool to see the behind the scenes for it
I like how dedicated actors are for their roles
For sports movies, an actor really needs to become a professional athlete
Yes, It makes the movies more authentic and engaging.
