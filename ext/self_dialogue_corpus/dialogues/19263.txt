Do you ever listen to Zac Brown Band?
A little bit! What are your favorite songs by them?
I think that my all-time favorite is Chicken Fried.
Everyone loves Chicken Fried, myself included!
It is a great song, an oldie but a goodie.
Do they have any new song?
Homegrown is the newest song I know of.
Oh, how it? I think I may have heard it before.
It's good. It's a typical song about a small town.
That sounds like a lot of country songs! What other country artists do you like?
I really miss the older singers of the 1990s. Those are my ultimate favorites.
Who are some examples?
Definitely George Strait, Travis Tritt, and Alabama.
Oh I love George Strait. He is one of the best country singers of all time.
Absolutely! I never got to see him in concert, which makes me sad.
Oh, does he not tour anymore?
Not really. I think technically he is "semi-retired."
Oh that is too bad. I would have liked to see him live as well.
Alabama still tours though and they actually have some new music.
Yeah, I've heard it. It isn't nearly as good as their old stuff.
