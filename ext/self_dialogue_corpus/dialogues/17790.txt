What is the type of music you prefer?
I really enjoy house and electronic music.
I don't know much about that genre.
I feel like a lot of people don't, unfortunately.
What do you recommend as an intro?
Well I love deadmaus. I feel he is not too heavy and pretty popular.
I think I have heard of him, is he canadian?
Yes he is from toronto.
any particular album or track?
I love his song ghosts and stuff.
Cool , I will check it out.
What is your favorite style?
I gotta say pop.
I am sucker for some good pop.
Obviously me too, who do you like?
Lady gaga is pretty impressive to me.
She is very talented. I can see how a techno lover would enjoy her.
Ya she has a got a few kind of electronic influenced hits. But like her pure pop stuff too.
I am also a fan of britney and janet.
I think most people are whether they admit that or not.
