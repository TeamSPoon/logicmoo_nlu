Have you seen Mosters Inc with your kid?
Yeah she loved it.
Mine too.  Truth is I liked it too.
Yeah John Goodman and Billy Crystle were awesome.
They sure were.
My daughter liked Boo a lot.
Yeah she was cute.
That's what she says.  She always thought it was funny the monsters were scared of the kid.
I thought the end when they found laughter was even better was great.
Yeah, it was like a happy ending and a lesson learned.
Oh don't forget about the abominable snowman.
That part was awesome.  He was just a goof.
Yeah, my favorite though was Mike.
Yes, Billy Crystal is always funny.  At his best in this movie.
It's the cheesy jokes.  He just delivers them perfectly.
Always has, like in Princess Bride.
Yeah he was really funny there too.
Yeah, he's almost dead.
Or mostly dead, something like that.
Yet another good kid movie there too.
