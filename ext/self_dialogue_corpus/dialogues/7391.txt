Have you seen the real to life Cinderella with Lily James and Cate Blanchett?
No, I haven't. When did it come out?
It was released in 2015. If you liked the animated Cinderella, you should check it out.
I will have to! I love the animated Cinderella by Disney.
Me too.
Can't believe it came out in 1950. Seems so long ago.
It does. Who's your favorite character?
I love Cinderella of course, but I also love the mice!
They really are cute. Gus is especially a favorite of mine. I like how his shirt is too tight!
He's adorable! I couldn't stand the black cat Lucifer. What a jerk!
