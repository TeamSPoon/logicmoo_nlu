I was watching Entourage today and want to see more things that Jeremy Piven is in.
Have you seen Smokin Aces?
No, is that a movie?
Yes! Piven's best work in my opinion.
What kind of film is it?
It's a crime and drama. He's phenomenal.
I haven't heard of it. Anyone else famous in it?
Yes, a bunch of people. Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman, Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta, Alicia Keys, Common.
How have I never heard of this?
I think it got overlooked because there were a lot of great films that year including The Departed.
Oh ok. I will have to give it a watch.
You will like it. It's so good and intense.
Cool. Anything g else with Piven that I may not have seen?
Very Bad Things. Ever see that?
Nope. What's it about?
A giy and his buddies go to Vegas for a bachelor party and end up in very deep water.
Sounds like The Hangover.
Yeah, this was made before that though and is more dark.
Ok, I will get that too. Thanks!
Sure. Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, and Jon Favreau ate in it too.
