I think Frozen might have the most iconic songs Disney's ever created.
Oh, definitely not. Think of all the songs in the classics!
I was never much a fan of some of the older ones, though--Snow White is such a bore.
I'll give you that, but that was their very first film. What about Aladdin?
What songs does it have?
Well, most obviously there's A Whole New World!
Oh, that one is iconic! And that song the genie sings, too!
But of course, the most important one in my opinion is The Little Mermaid.
She's got Part of Your World, right?
And Under the Sea, and Poor Unfortunate Souls, and Kiss the Girl--you get the idea. It's easily the best.
