Have you heard of the Tedeschi Trucks Band?
Yes, I've heard the name, but I don't know any of their stuff.
They are a husband and wife team, and they have a full band behind them.
So what is their main genre?
They are rock, but there are elements of blues and jazz as well.
They sound good, but where can I hear them?
Well your best bet is online, like all music now of course.
Don't they get air time or play shows?
I have never heard a radio station play their stuff, and they play a lot of small venues and colleges.
I'll have to search for them, but it sounds like it might be a challenge.
Band founder Derek Trucks is a guitar virtuoso, and his wife Susan Tedeschi has an incredibly soulful voice.
So did they get married first, or start the band first?
I believe they were married a while before they formed the band.
So when you said band, did you mean like a full orchestral band?
They do have some flutes and brass instrumentalists behind them.
That's pretty unique for a modern band.
Yes, and it really allows them to play a wider range of genres.
Just from the sheer size of the band, they must create a better sound than just a trio of guys or a soloist.
I think so, because I've been really into their music lately.
Thanks for the recommendation, and I really want to check them out.
