hey what was your favorite band as a kid?
thats a tough one because i like alot of artist, but i would have to say Destiny's Child and TLC were my favorite
Yes, I love those girl groups and I also liked to listen to 3LW and Nysync
Oh wow Nysync was a hit in the early 90s, thats when POP music was really popular
Yes, it was thats during the Britney Spears and Pink error
I loved listening to Pink, especially her song "Just Like a Pill" and "Family Potrait"
Yes her music was very deep, really passionate, i wonder what happened to her these days
Yes its been awhile since she has had any songs come out, I would love to hear new music come from her
Yes, me too but my favorite band in that error would have to be "Jagged Edge"
Yea, they were a good group too, I used to tell myself i would play "lets get married" as my wedding song
Thats funny, I used to think the same thing too
Its crazy I dont really like the new music out these days, its so different
Yea like have you heard of lil uzivert or the band "migos"?
No, I havent and I dont think I would really enjoy their music
they are more hip hop and rap type of artist, although i wouldnt say their hip hop
Yea i like the 90s hip hop, not this new generation's definition of hip hop
Yea, they make anything music these days, bring back the Biggie error thats hip hop to me
or the JaRule, even though he was more R&B/pop not so much of hiphop
Yes I was a huge JaRule fan I loved all of his songs, especially his songs with Jennifer Lopez
Yes, my favorite song from him was "Put it On Me' and "Always On Time", with Ashanti
