I heard Cyndi Lauper is touring again.
That is great what do you think about her?
I love her music and the style she emulates.
Would you consider her pop, new wave or punk?
She looks punk but she is definitely her own unique expression of pop.
What are some of your favorite songs by her?
I love True Colors and I drove all night.
Do you have a favorite album of hers?
Hat Full of Stars is very special.
I never heard of that one.
Yes it tackles a lot of cultural issues and wasn't as mainstream as her other stuff.
The song Sally's Pigeons is particularly moving and lovely.
What about the song of hers called Change of Heart?
I love that, and it's off of her True Colors album.
Yes I think that album is very popular.
What do you think of her voice?
It is very unique and special.
Yes she has such a big vocal range and healthy belt.
I love it and it almost sounds like it has an effect on her voice when it doesn't.
I know and she sounds just as good as ever now.
