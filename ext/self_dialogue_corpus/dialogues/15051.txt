What is your favorite comedy movie?
I'm a fan of older comedies such as old Charlie Chaplin movies.  How about you?
I like some of the older stuff too, but one of my favorite newer comedies is "Dumb and Dumber."
Really?  That seems such an odd choice.
Yes, it does, but the sheer ridiculousness of it is genius.  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are brilliantly stupid.
Yes, I guess they are.  What are your favorite parts?
I don't necessarily have a favorite part or theme; pretty much everything they do from the scenes in the doggy van to them riding on the moped are hilarious.
I guess my favorite scenes are when they are skiing and at the ski lodge.
And Lauren Holly is the perfect foil for Jim's and Jeff's foolish characters.
I will have to watch it again just for kicks sometime when I need a laugh.
