Who were some of the big winners at the Grammys this year?
I believe Adele was a big winner
Oh yeah, she's got a really nice voice.
Yeah I think she won Record of the year for Hello
Yes! I love that song
And then she won for Album of the Year
25?
Yes, that's it.
Right. I need to buy that album. I only buy certain songs now a days
Yeah, I haven't bought an album in a long time.
What about Lemonade by Beyonce?
I think it was nominated, but it didn't win
No, have you listened to any songs from Lemonade?
No, I'm not really a fan of Beyonce
Really? I think she has some talent
I think she's kind of overrated.
Unbelievable. You're clearly misguided.
Whatever man. I think I have good taste.
Well at least we both like Adele.
Yeah, I guess so.
