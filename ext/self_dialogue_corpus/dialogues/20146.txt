Favorite Pokemon Movie?
You mean the ones in theaters or overall?
Favorite one overall.
Probably Pokemon The Movie 2000.
I love that one, but its not my favorite. Why is it your favorite?
Probably because of the nostalgia and also because of Lugia.
I do have great memories of going to see that with my friend and his mom.
Remember the toys Burger King gave out for that movie?
Yes! The Pokeballs. I still have one.
The best scene was when Ash had to look through the rock with all three stones.
I vaguely remember that part. That's when Lugia appeared, right?
One of the times.
My favorite one is Pokemon The First Movie.
I love that one, too. The scene when Pikachu thought Ash was gone was so sad.
Yeah, I still see tweets about that. That scene has become somewhat of a meme.
Mewtwo needs to make a comeback in a new movie.
They won't make a movie with the original Pokemon again, there are like 800 now
Yeah, I miss when it was just the 151.
I still enjoy it. I haven't seen all the movies, though.
Neither have I
