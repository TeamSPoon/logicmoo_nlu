Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yes! The Beatles are my favorite band of all time.
Cool, me too!
Who do you think was a better songwriter between John Lennon and Paul McCartney?
I'm not sure really. I think they worked best as a team honestly.
That's a good point.
I also think George Harrison is an extremely underrated songwriter.
I didn't realize he wrote too. What songs did he write?
Here Comes the Sun, Something, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are three examples that come to mind.
Oh wow. He really was talented too!
