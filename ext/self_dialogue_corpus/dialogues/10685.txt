Have you seen all the Fast and Furious movies?
Nope. I've only seen like the first two and then the 6th one.
Yea, it's pretty ridiculous that they can make so many movies from that one franchise.
I don't get it. I mean I liked the first one alright, but I feel like the other movies would just kind of all be the same storyline.
How'd you like the 6th one?
Well first off, I only watched it because it was playing on the airplane I was on.
Haha, so you were basically forced to watch it?
I guess you could say that. I mean the movie was alright, it was pretty ridiculous at times and I didn't really know/remember half of the characters since it had been so long since I last saw a Fast and Furious movie.
Well maybe you should watch the other ones then. Haha.
Yea, no thanks. I mean I know of people who really enjoy them, but personally not really my cup of tea.
