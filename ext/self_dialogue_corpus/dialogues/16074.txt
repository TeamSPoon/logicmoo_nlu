Do you have any favorite sixties bands?
Well I was kind of young then but The Beatles for sure! I wanna hold your hand, Love Me Do , Help, remember them?
I sure do. I remember the Beach boys back then too. Remember Surfin Safari and Barbara Ann?
Yea , they had some great songs!!
And they could really harmonize!
How about the Dave Clark Five?
Oh Yea I loved them! They had the same style haircuts as the Beatles.
Yea, that became a really popular style.
The sixties were really a decade of change for the music industry.
You are right. Once the Beatles hit the scene, everything changed.
For the better I think.
Everything was changing in America then , music included.
Do you remember any other bands?
How about Peter , Paul and Mary?
I remember them. Were they on Ed Sullivan?
I do not remember, but he had a lot of great bands on that show.
I know , I saw the Beatles on it, the Dave Clark Five, Credence Clearwater Revival and more.
Me too , I would watch it every Sunday night.
Music was so much better then than today.
Yea, it sure was.
