What's your favorite type of music?
I really like pop music.  It's my go to.
Pop is really good.  Who are you into right now?
I know it's probably bad, but I like Justin Bieber.
Oh!  Justin Bieber... that's interesting.
Stop!  He's really talented, you can't deny that.
Fine, he is really talented.  But he seems like a brat.
Look, he's a child star.  They're all messed up in the head.
I guess you're right.  I wonder what makes them all go crazy.
Being too famous so young probably gives them complexes.
Yeah, and they can't deal with them.
Exactly, by the time they realize they're careers aren't like they used to be is usually when the trouble starts.
It's like they crave the spotlight.
But you can't be in the spotlight forever.
They should have managers who tell them this.
Yeah, but their management is probably just thinking about the money.
That's so sad.  I feel sorry for child stars.
Yeah, some of my favorite actors were child stars.
I know, I keep waiting for Elijah Wood to go crazy.
No, not Frodo!
