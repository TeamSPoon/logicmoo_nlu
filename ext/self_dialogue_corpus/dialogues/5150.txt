Was Cinderella any good.
It was ok i'm kinda tired of every princesses always needing a prince to save them.
Well when you think about it these Disney movies are based off old fables.
That is true just kinda wish there was a princess that didn't need a prince to save them.
Oh come on there are plenty of princess that was not saved by a prince Mulan, Frozen, Brave.
Brave isn't Disney?
Well no the less she was a princess that was strong.
I see that is true I stand corrected.
Hey you wanna do a Disney marathon?
Yes I would love to.
