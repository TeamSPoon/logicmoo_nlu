What is your favorite Disney movie?
I like Pocahontas.
That is a good movie.  I love the songs in that one.
I do too. But I like that there is a message in the movie.
What is the message?
You know, be kind to the earth.
I guess I didn't figure that out when I saw the movie.
Yes remember the song Colors of the Wind?
Yes I love that song!
The song is about being kind to the earth and love!
