I like Sleeping Beauty a lot.  Aurora is my favorite heroine of the Disney films.
She's drawn to look so pretty.
Do you like the fairies in the movie?
Yes, I do.  They are very charming.
I like that they are portrayed as older women.
That was something I liked, too.  They seemed like mother figures to Aurora.
Prince Phillip is my favorite prince of the Disney films.  He is so handsome.
I had such a crush on him when I was a kid.
I did, too.  I love that scene where Aurora meets him for the first time in the forest.
That's one of my favorite scenes, too.  I love the song they sing.
