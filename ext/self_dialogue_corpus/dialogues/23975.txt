I freaking love the Harry Potter movies.
Me too, I have a marathon at least once per year.
I need to do that!
Which is your favorite movie?
I'm not sure they are all so good!
I know!
What about you, whats your favorite?
I would have to say it's a tie between the fourth movie and the sixth.
Yeah, those ones were both so good.
I really liked the last two films too but they were just so sad!
I know I cried like a baby when Dobby died!
I know, me too. He was one of my favorite characters.
At least Hagrid survived.
Yes, Hagrid is the best.
Have you seen fantastic beasts?
Yes but honestly it was kind of disappointing.
Really what didn't you like?
I guess I'm just really attached to the characters from Harry Potter, I wish it had been more related.
Yeah, I hear that. I wish J.K. Rowling would write more books.
Me too!
