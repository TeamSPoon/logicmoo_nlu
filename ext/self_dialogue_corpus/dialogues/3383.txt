I loved the horror movie The Crazies. Did you ever watch that one?
Thats with Timothy Olyphant , right?
Yes.
Funny how he's a cop in that one too.
Yes, he does seem to play a policeman a lot.
That was a pretty good movie.
Could you imagine having an outbreak like that and people going nuts.
Seems like they do anyway.
True. Real life has become a horror movie.
Sad but true.
