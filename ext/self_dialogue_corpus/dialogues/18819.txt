Hi, long time no see.  Are you still into that singer, what's her name?
Do you mean Adele?  Yes!  I love her music.
Yeah!  I understand she's done really well all over the world.
Indeed.  She won a whole bunch of Grammys last year.
I saw that show.  She was so beautiful.  And sang so well.
I love the way she is so classy.
It is nice to bring class back to music again.  I hate some of the singers that swear and stuff.
Yup.  How much can you love someone who hits it big with a song with a title of "HELLO"?
Gee, could it be simpler?  And it's such a beautiful song.
She doesn't need all the fireworks and huge sound effects and stuff to keep an audience, does she?
No, just a piano and a microphone works for her.
She relates so well to the audience, too.
I understand she went to the firehouse in London to visit with the firefighters after the big apartment fire there.
Yes.  She just walked in.  She wanted to tell them how much she appreciated what they did.
Gosh, not very many stars do that kind of stuff.
No.  She seems to be really down to earth.
That's part of what I like about her.
That and her voice?
Yes.  She sings like an angel.  Do you think we will ever be able to get tickets?
I don't know.  But if we can, can I go with you?
