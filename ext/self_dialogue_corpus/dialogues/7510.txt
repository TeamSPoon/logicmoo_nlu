Have you seen all off the Harry Potter movies?
Hell yeah, they are some of my favorite all time movies.
Mine too, I loved the whole series.  The way they brought it to live was amazing.
I know, they did a great job of making you feel like it was real.
The Deathly Hallows part two was a great ending to the series.
I agree, they did a great job of bringing the book to life.
I wish they would make more.  Know that Harry is older and a father, I would love to see a new movie.
Me to, He could be a teacher or the Headmaster now.
I hate that Dumbledore died.  I loved him.
Yes, the character and the actor were awesome.
