Guess what I'm doing right now? Hint: it involves Harry Potter.
Let me guess, you're rewatching the entire series again? Which one are you on, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"?
You caught me! No, I'm on "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
That's my least favorit--they changed so much from the book. The Firebolt was given to Harry at the beginning, not the end.
You're right, but we get to meet Sirius.
You mean Padfoot. The Maruader's Map is revealed in "Prisoner of Azkaban" isn't it?
I think so! Fred and George Weasley give it to Harry Potter so that he can sneak around the castle and even into town.
That's right! And then he sees Peter Pettigrew, or Wormtail, on the map even though he's supposed to be dead.
What a twist! That jerk, Wormtail, I can't believe he is the one responsible for James and Lilly Potter's death.
I can! He's a wormy Wormtail. At least Harry got to finally have family in the end of that Book and Movie.
