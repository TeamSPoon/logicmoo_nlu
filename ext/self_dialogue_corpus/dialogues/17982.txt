Do you like the Black Eyed Peas?
The band?  They are okay.
Just okay?  I love them.
I think they are okay and they have a way of incorporating music.
Well, what is it that you don't like?
They kind of sample too much.
Wait, I've only heard sampling on one song.
Are you kidding?  They sample a lot.
On what songs?
My Humps, Pump It, and Meet Me Halfway to start with.
Really.
Yeah, even Fergie sampled a bit on her solo stuff.
Are you serious?
Yeah, have you ever listened to Fergalicious?
Yeah, but I thought it was original?
Not a lot of what they do is original.
The way they incorporate it is, though.
Yeah, I'm not arguing that.  They do use it in a very good way.
But they aren't the most original group?
No.
