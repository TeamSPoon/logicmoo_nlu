Did you see Miley Cyrus on Jimmy Fallon the other night?
Yeah I did. What did you think of the new singles she performed?
I thought they were really good. What did you think?
I agree. It's interesting how much her sound has evolved over the years
For real. I'm excited for her new album.
Me too. Judging by the singles I've heard so far, her new music feels a lot more authentic.
Yeah I think that's true. She seems to be returning more to her authentic self lately.
I don't really like how she's been so dismissive and critical of rap and hip hop in her interviews lately though.
Yeah, just because it wasn't the right genre for her to perform in doesn't mean the genre itself is a problem.
Totally. There are a lot of really talented artists in hip hop and rap right now.
I wonder what the critical reception will be for Miley's new album.
I imagine it'll be pretty good judging by what she's released so far.
How do you think her album will do commercially?
It might not produce quite as many hits as her albums previously have but I bet it'll sell alright.
She definitely has produced quite a lot of hits in her time.
Seriously! I still get 'Party in the U.S.A.' stuck in my head from time to time.
That was such a fun song! I hope her new album still has some of that pop sensibility to it.
Yeah I hope so too.
Do you know when the album is set to be released?
I have no idea but I think we still have a few months of waiting left.
