Have you seen a Manfred Mann concert?
No.
I saw one back in 1980 in Germany, it was awesome.
Really, why?
They had a cartoon playing during one of their songs,
What was it about?
It showed a guy shopping and came across a can of instant fun.
Say what?
Yeah and it showed him starting to open the can and then it showed a flash.
What then?
Next thing it shows the guy running to the store and getting a cart full of cans.
So then what?
Then they show his house with flashes going off all the time,
Ha ha, so.
Then it shows him running back and fourth with more carts full.
What then? more flashes?
No, it shows him grabbing a can from a mountain of cans. Then the mountain comes falling on him, crushing him.
Oh no.
Then at the end it has a can roll towards you and says, Warning, too much fun is harmful to your health.
Ha Ha, nice story.
