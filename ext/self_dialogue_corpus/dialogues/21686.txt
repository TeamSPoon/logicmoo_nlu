What is your favorite Sci Fi movie?
Probably the movie called Alien.
That one is really crazy.
Oh, you have seen it?
Yeah do you remember the part with the face hugger?
Yeah, that part is so nasty haha.
It really is, I would hate to discover an alien like that.
The only thing worse than that is when it grows into the full alien.
Yeah that thing gets huge.
It would be scary to be stuck on a spaceship with something that deadly.
I wish they made more movies like that.
Yeah, now a days all you see is a bunch of jump scare movies.
It kind of ruins the genre.
Have you ever seen any of The Predator movies?
Yeah, I saw the first one with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That one was awesome, how they are in the jungle and stuff.
Yeah, it was cool to see a bunch of soldiers try to fight it.
It was crazy how at the end Arnold ended up using mud to hide from its thermal vision.
I thought that part was awesome.
I'm just really surprised that he managed to beat the predator.
