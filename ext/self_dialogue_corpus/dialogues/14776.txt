What's your favorite comedy movie?
I loved Central Intelligence!
Oh yea, with the Rock and Kevin Hart, right?
Yea, you can't go wrong with those two!
That's for sure. I loved that scene when they meet up at that bar.
Yea, after all those years. He doesn't even recognize the Rock at first.
Oh yea because he was so fat and awkward as a teenager!
Yea, but then he got all buff and ripped.
The ending almost tricked me.
Not me, I knew he would never be the bad guy.
