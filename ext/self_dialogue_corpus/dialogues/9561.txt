Do you prefer older rap artist or the new rap/hip-hop?
I love older rap artist and songs. You could understand what that where saying
Yes, now of days I do not understand the words or could even hear them.
Tons of new artist are changing rap/hip-hop in a bad way
That is true I dislike some of the new rappers such as Lil yatchy and Kodak Black.
There music seems to be a mixture of rap and rock-n-roll
I never thought of it that way. I just thought they were screaming and saying crazy stuff.
It sounds that way to us but younger people are in love with these new rappers.
I know I wonder how rap music will sound like in 10 years
There is no telling but I hope it goes back to sounding good.
