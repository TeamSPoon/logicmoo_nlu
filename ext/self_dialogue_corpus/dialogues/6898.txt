Hey, have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No, I haven't but I have been wanting to. How was it?
It was great! I actually watched the new one before the old cartoon one.
Really? I watched the old cartoon one a long time ago, but I'd like to watch this one too.
You really should, it was so good! Emma Watson played the perfect Belle.
I imagine she would have played a good Belle, she is beautiful!
Yes she definitely is, but what was most impressive was her acting skills.
She is a great actress!  Was the storyline the same as the cartoon movie?
Yes, exactly like it, right down to the musicals.
They usually change movies so much when remaking them. That's so surprising that they didn't do it with this one.
