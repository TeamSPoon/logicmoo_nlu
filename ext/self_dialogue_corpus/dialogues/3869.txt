Did you see Ghost in the Shell?
The new one with Scarlett Johansson?
Right, not the anime version.
I did.  Massive disappointment in my opinion.
Right there with you, total missed opportunity.
It looked great, but the plot was just incoherent.
They really butchered it in my opinion.  Could have used another scribe.
It felt like they just thought looking cool would make a good movie.
A lot of these films make a similar mistake I'm afraid.
It will probably be on the clearance shelf soon I'm guessing.
