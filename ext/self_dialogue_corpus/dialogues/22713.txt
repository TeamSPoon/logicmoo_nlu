I watched this documentary on Steve Jobs.
Why?
He invented the iPhone and the Mac and the iPod.
No, you're nuts. He's more like a designer than an engineer.
Who cares, he and some guy started a billion dollar business in their garage.
Why do you care?
I want to start my own business and be rich like Jobs.
You watched the whole movie yet you know nothing about him.
Yes I do, he like meditated with monks and fought with IBM and Microisoft and he created Pixar.
He didn't create Pixar, he bought it.
that's what I love about him, all the other guys do the work while he yells at them.
That's what you learned from his movie?
Yeah, you hook up with smart guys and let them do the work.
The way you let your lab partner do all the work in science class?
See, I'm already getting smarter.
The difference between you and Steve Jobs is that he was good at something.
See you later, I'm going to watch that documenary again.
Why?
Because I haven't learned how to bend people to my will yet.
Good luck with that.
