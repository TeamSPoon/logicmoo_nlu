Who is your favorite actor?
Gary Oldman for sure!
Who's that?
Jim Gordon in the Batman Begins trilogy.
Oh yeah.
Why is he your favorite.
He just has so much range.
What do you mean.
Well, every character he plays is so different from the last.
Example?
He was Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films.
That was him?!
Yup. Or how about Bram Stoker's Dracula?
Who did he play?
Dracula!
No way!
Yup, that was him.
I can't believe it.
Or how about The Fifth Element? He played Zorg.
That guy is good!
