Man, SZA is really blowing up right now.
I remember when she was sort of underground.
Yeah, but she did those tracks with Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper on Z.
After that everybody knew about her. You don't get names like that and stay underground.
No, you don't. I think it's nice that she's finally getting some recognition.
For sure. She's got a voice on her. Ice Moon is still in my top 10 favorite songs right now.
And that dropped forever ago.
Yeah, but it's classic. So is Babylon.
See, I like that track more without the Kendrick Lamar verse. I think it cuts into her flow.
I don't think you'll get anyone to agree with you on that, man.
