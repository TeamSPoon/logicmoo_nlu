So what is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the Empire Strikes Back.
Even with all of the new films that have come out since then?
Yep, even with all of them.
What do you like about it so much?
Well a lot of different things!
For example?
Well I definitely think it has the best story out of any of the films. It's pretty dark and there's a lot of conflict and you just don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah, it's definitely not nearly as bright and cheery as the first movie was.
and this might be a weird thing to like, but I like the sets and landscapes of that film the best. Hoth, the asteroid field, Dagobah, Cloud City, the carbonite freezing chamber. They're just the coolest.
