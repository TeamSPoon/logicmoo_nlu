Have you seen any movies this summer?
Not yet, lately the pickings are slim
I know what you mean, it's mostly stuff for kids or the young
Also, everything is so politicized
I know, it all has to be pushing a social agenda
Star Wars doesn't even have any white males anymore
Yeah, I heard they are going to make Luke Skywalker be bisexual
Great, wow.
Womder Woman is all about how wonderful life would be without men
It's just crazy, and nothing is really family friendly anymore
Plus there is such little innovation
Everything is cookie cutter
I don't even rent movies anymore
Me either
There was some really good TV being made, but that seems to have died out too
I know, again, the political correctness thing has taken over
Yeah, like OITNB
And there have to be sex scenes in every movie
Nothing wholesome or even interesting
I used to enjoy foreign films, but those have gotten worse too
