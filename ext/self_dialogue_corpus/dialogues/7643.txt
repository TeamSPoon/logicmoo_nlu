Can you believe that Harry Potter actually ended up with Ron's sister?
Yeah, it was a bit surprising, because I couldn't tell they liked each other through most of the movies.
Can you believe how many people actually love the Harry Potter series?
Yeah, its pretty unreal. I think everyone I know has seen all of the movies.
It's awesome because it really instills imagination in peoples hearts.
It really does, it makes people think more creatively and imaginitive.
What is your favorite spell from the movie?
Fortuna Major, because it has basically become a meme, and people laugh when you say it randomly.
My favorite spell is Wingardium Leviosa, it just sticks out in my head, plus its a cool spell.
Yeah I remember that one too, Hermione Granger says it.
