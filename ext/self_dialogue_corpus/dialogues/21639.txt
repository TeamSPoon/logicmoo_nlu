Your favorite romance movie?
Hmm, I'm not too familiar with romance films but probably Titanic
It is a classic
Yea, and its based on real events
Those types of movies are always fun to watch
I liked leonardo dicaprios character
I think my favorite character was the ship itself
Yea, or the iceberg!!
It was fun even though we knew the overall ending
Yea, which is why the actors were so important for this type of movie
I also like The Notebook
That was a good movie too
It had classic scenes in it
I thought Ryan Glosing played better roles in other movies though
He was not bad in The Notebook though
Yea, but it felt a bit dry to me
How did you feel about Rachel McAdams?
She played her part very well, it was really believable
I think romance movies are underrated
We just need more good ones.
