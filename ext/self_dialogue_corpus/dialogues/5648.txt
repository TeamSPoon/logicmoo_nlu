peter pan was kind of messed up
how so?
i mean, i get that peter was eternally a kid or whatever...
but?
BUT, he was actually just an old man dressing as a kid to steal other kids. if you think about it
okay, that is kind of messed up. where do you come up with this stuff?
i'm just saying!
maybe captain hook was trying to get the lost boys back home. that's why they had so much beef
maybe! you never know
either way...that is officially the most messed up disney movie
