I just watched the new Beauty and the Beast!
It was so good, right?
Little Chip was so adorable!
He is the cutest. Gaston is horrible though!
When he was trying to kill the Beast I was like NOOOOO.
Me too! And then the Beast didn't kill him and let him go!
He is such a good guy. And he loved Belle so much.
He let her go because he loved her!
But she came back to save him!
Cutest movie ever.
