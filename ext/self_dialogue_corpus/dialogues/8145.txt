What do you think of all these kid stars becoming pop stars?
I think some of them have some real talent.
And the others?
Some others confuse me as to why any one would want o listen to them.
I feel that way about Miley Cyrus.
I can not fathom why people enjoy her songs.
Her Dead Pets album was free, but really not worth the space.
I just think all of her songs sound off key.
Like her rendition of Joelene, not great.
I did not like her song, Party in the USA, it was just dumb.
