What is your favorite movie?
I'm not really a big movie fan.
What? Why not?
Well,I rather play or listen to music.
Really?
Yeah,I feel that there is too much money going to actors and the cost of movies.
That's is true, but what about suspend belief.
Sorry,I just don't see it.
Do you like moves with musicians in it?
I have not seen any.
How many movies have you seen in your life.
Maybe about 10.
Your joking, right.
No.
What's wrong with you.
Nothing,I rather play music. Do you like music.
I'm more of a movie guy.
You funny.
I'm taking you to a movie.
Is that a date?
