Do you think it was worth the money for the Dodgers to pay 70 million for puige?
I don't any player should get that money.
Why do you say that?
It just seems like all these players are getting money and a lot of money to play baseball.
True, but I don't thing baseball would be the same if not for the money.
I think it would be better.
No. You have it wrong.
How?
That's how players would get paid off.
Paid off?
Yeah baseball games could be bought out to win or lose.
So that's why you say pay more?
I'm not saying that. It's just harder for player to get paid off.
You may have a point.
Pete rose is a perfect example.
Oh yes, the rose.
He did tarnish him self.
He was good.
That's why players get paid a lot.
Good point.
