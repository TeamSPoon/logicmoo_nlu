I was thinking about rock bands from the 80's today. Were you ever a Rush fan?
Are you kidding? That was my favorite band in high school.
That's what I was thinking. I liked their musicianship, but now that I'm older I realize that their lyrics were awesome.
Freewill was way ahead of its time.
Yeah, Red Barchetta was kind of corny, but they made it work. I still think about the lyrics.
I haven't heard anything about them in a while. They've got to be pretty old now.
Geddy Lee turns 64 this July. But they still jam.
Haven't they been doing that "Time Machine" tour for a while?
I heard something about it like 10 years ago.
I think they did their last tour last year, if I'm not mistaken.
