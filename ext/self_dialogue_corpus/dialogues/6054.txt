Do you remember the movie The Shaggy D.A. ?
No.
Really, It's a comedy about a dog.
No, who's in it?
Well, it's an old Disney movie from the 70's. No newer actors.
No wonder I don't know it.
Tim Conway is in. Do you remember that actor?
No, can't say that I do.
Okay, well then I guess it don't matter.
Sorry.
