Are you ready for some football?
I always am.
Did you hear about the Colts general manager.
Well kind of.
The colts fired him and replaced him.
What team did he end up going to?
He ended up going to the Cleveland Browns
Hopefully he does better there.
Yeah I agree. Maybe he was just not a good fit for the colts.
Who replaced him?
He was replaced by Chris Ballard.
Did they take alot of interviews.
I think he was fired and Chris Ballard took his place in a week or a little after that.
Wow that was fast.
Ryan Grigson did not get hired as the general manager for the Browns though.
Oh really what did he get hired to do?
He was hired by the Cleveland Browns as a Senior Personnel Executive.
Oh wow that is different than I thought.
Maybe it will be better for him.
I hope so because the Colts did not go anywhere.
