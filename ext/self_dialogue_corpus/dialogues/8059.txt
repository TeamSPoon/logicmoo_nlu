Michael Jacson has to be the best pop performer ever.
Yeah Thriller was such a great song
Not just that he has all those albums.
Thriller specifically though was so good
The video he made for it was awesome
And this was in the early 80s!
Yeah so he was transcendent.
The video matched up perfectly with the music.
He also had some other hits
Yeah but thats probably the one everyone remembers.
