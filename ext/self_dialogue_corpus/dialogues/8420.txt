Hey do you listen to pop music?
Sure.
Who is your favorite artist?
Well, I really like Katy Perry.  I think she's really fun.
Yeah, she's okay.  I'm not a big fan of her music though.  I prefer Selena Gomez.
Oh yeah, she's great!  She had that one song last summer, what was it?
It was called Good For You.
Yeah, that's it!  She's a great artist.  I'm glad she was able to have a music career after Disney.
Definitely, some great pop artists started in Disney, like Britney Spears.
Oh yeah, her too!  They're both great.
