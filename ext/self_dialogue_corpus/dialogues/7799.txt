I watched the whole Harry Potter series again this weekend.
Again? What is that, like four times this year?
I can't help that I love them! Harry, Hermione, and Ron are like friends to me.
What's your favorite part of the series?
The third movie used to be my favorite one because I love the time traveling aspect of it, but now I think I like Half-Blood Prince more.
Why the  sixth one?
I like that Dumbledore starts to tell Harry the things he needs to defeat Voldemort.
That's definitely the most intricate and interesting part of the series.
Exactly! There's so many different details that have to happen to make it all work.
I'm sure you'll watch it again soon!
