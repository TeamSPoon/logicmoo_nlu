How do you feel about the new Star Wars movies?
They're alright, I guess. Although I've only seen the Force Awakens and not Rogue One.
How'd you like the Force Awakens?
It was ok. I am more of a fan of the very first Star Wars trilogy.
Did you like the characters and the new storyline at all?
It was interesting to see what happens after Darth Vader was killed and how there's pretty much another Darth Vader in training.
Yea, it was such a surprise when I found out Kylo Ren was Han and Leia's kid.
Yea, I would have never guessed that.
I felt like that actor did a good job though of playing that part.
Yea, I was kind of skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed his performance.
