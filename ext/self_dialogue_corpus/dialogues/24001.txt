Hey, did you hear Shaun of the Dead is playing again?
You mean in theaters?
Yea, a local theater is planning a special screening of it.
That is awesome, are you going?
I was going to see if you were interested at all.
Seeing how it is one of my favorite movies, I would love to go!
It is playing tonight at 5pm, can you make it.
It will be tight but I should be able to.
Want me to get you a ticket?
Yes please, worst case I will just pay you back if I cannot make it.
Sounds good, hopefully I will see you then!
I hope so, speaking of Edgar Wright, have you seen Baby Driver yet?
No I have not.
Would you want to go see that sometime as well?
Of course, I had been planning on seeing that this weekend.
Mind if I join you?
I would love it, lets say Saturday tentatively?
Sounds good to me, 2 movies in a week!
Yea!  I haven't done that in a while.
It should be a lot of fun.
