Have you seen Jurassic World?
No, is it good?
I loved it.
I havent even seen the originals.
I saw one of the original Jurassic Parks when I was a kid, but thats it.
Was it anything like World?
I dont remember. All I remember was the scene with the raptors in the kitchen.
Oh yeah! Thats an iconic scene and I havent even seen it.
You should watch World, though. Really good.
Whats so great about it
The effects, the story, dinosaurs in the present age.
Yeah, Ill give it a shot. Is it scary?
Nope, not at all.
Ok, good. I hate scary movies.
I mean, some would be scared of the T-rex and the jumpy scenes, but only kids.
I hate jumpy scenes.
There arent many. Just watch it.
I will, I will.
Chris Pratt is great in it.
I forgot he was even in it.
