Man, i'm excited about the new Wonder Woman movie.
Yeah, me too! I thought the introduction during Batman VS Superman was awesome.
Yeah I think they try to gradually put in their characters into their films to segway that character into its own movie.
You mean Marvel? Yeah, like they even combine Iron Man and Spiderman into Spiderman's upcoming movie.
Yeah kinda like Iron Man and Captain America too.
Yep, so far I've watched all three of them.
You mean Captain America series? Yep me too
Wonder what the next, I mean the fourth one will be.
Man there are so many other Marvel stuff too...
Yeah you're right...Aquaman and Flash for instance.
Definitely Flash. I've watched the original TV series many years ago.
Yep he was also in the latest Marvel movie too for just a couple minutes.
Oh yeah the one where Bruce Wayne tried to throw something at him and The Flash avoided it.
Yeah. I thought that was cool.
I'd say many things are possible now because of the technology like CGI.
Yep otherwise we won't be able to see all the Superhero fights and all.
I almost forgot..another thing is Justice League, that's going to be great also
Yeah it would be great to see all the superheroes in one movie like the Avengers.
Except it's a DC Comics not Marvel.
True, although it's still very cool in my opinion.
