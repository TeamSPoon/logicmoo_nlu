If you could play any position in football what would you choose.
I would be a quarterback.
Yeah, that would be exciting.
I'd be in control of all the action.
Everyone would be cheering you on.
It must be high pressure too.
That would be intimidating.
Yes, but I'd have such confidence it would be cool.
Who would you like to pass to?
I would pass to Smith or Huff.
Wow, can you imagine?
That would be so cool!
What team would you want to beat the most?
I'd want to beat the Patriots.
They would be my team to beat too.
How often do they practice?
They are always working out, planning out plays, and smashing their bodies.
It is hard work!
I'd love to have football muscles, though.
Me too.
