Are there any upcoming movies you're excited about?
Yes, definitely. Maybe this is unexpected, but I'm ready to see War for the Planet of the Apes.
Oh, I hadn't even thought about that one.
I don't think most people have. It's a series that has sort of flown under the radar.
What's exciting about this one?
Well, it really develops the story in new ways and fills it in. Plus, Woody Harrelson is entering the story and that's exciting.
That's really neat.
Yeah, I'm excited for it. How about you?
I'm waiting for Dunkirk.
You're a history buff?
Usually I'm not. But I was recently reading a novel that references Dunkirk, and it has got me interested.
Is there anything in particular about the historical aspect that you like?
Well, Dunkirk in particular was such an improbable and heroic event. It lends well to treatment in a movie.
I suppose it does. It was particularly scary for the British, wasn't it?
It was. That, plus I think the historical genre has gotten far better in recent years, with movies like The Founder, Jackie, and Free State of Jones.
Those were certainly interesting movies, whether or not they had financial success.
They were interesting, but unfortunately you're correct that they weren't always so successful.
Why do you think that is?
I couldn't say. People seem to lose interest in these stories.
I guess so. Thank you for the chat.
