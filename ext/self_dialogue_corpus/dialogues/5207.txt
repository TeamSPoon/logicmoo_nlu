Did you ever get around to watching The Emperors New Groove?
Yes it was so funny I loved it!
I know! Who was your favorite character?
Oh Kronk he was so rediculous.
Yea I loved when he was cooking in the restaurant.
Oh that was great. Who was your favorite character?
Well outside of Kronk I think it was Yzma.
Oh really, why is that?
She reminds me of my mom. I know that sounds bad, they just sound alike.
Oh I kinda thought the same thing.
