Do you think movies based on books are better than those from original screenplays?
Mostly I do why?
I saw this one movie and wondered about the book.
Which book?
Gone Girl.  It was all over the bookstores.
Yeah I saw that.  How was the movie?
Excellent and a little upsetting.
I heard the book was good, gripping.
That sounds about right.
And I guess the actors did a good job.
Yeah, one was scary.
How was Ben Affleck?
Solid, guilty.
He was right for that role.
I felt bad for him.
Why?
I think he split from his wife at that time and you could tell.
What do you mean?
He did the remorse expression and body language really well.
That's sad to hear about.
