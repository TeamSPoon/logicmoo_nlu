have you seen The Departed?
Is that the movie with Leo Dicaprio?
Yeah, he is in it.
That's my favorite movie with him! He is so real and I want to root for him to bad
I wish he got an Oscar for it! He should have won!
He played a good good guy and good bad guy too!
Oh yeah, he's a double agent right?
Yeah, he in the police force but has to become a gang member
is he the only double agent?
No, there's a mobster who is trying to be a cop!
