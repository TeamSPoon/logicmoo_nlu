Have you ever seen this French movie call Joyeux Noel?
Yeah, actually I have.  Hardly anyone else as seen that.
It was an amazing movie.
Yes, during the World War One Christmas Truce.
Yes, it was just so emotional and deep.  About stopping fighting to celebrate Christmas.
It was also cool how they had it in so many different languages.
Yeah it was, it made it not only seem more real, but it took the good guy bad buy out of it.
They made every one of them seem a little more human.
I like how they did that.  There was no "main group" and it was just humans surviving.
I liked how they took some time to get out into no man's land and clean up and take the dead.
Yeah, showing humanity in the worse situation.
They played soccer too.
I also love how it was based on a true story.
Sometimes those make the best movies.
I just wish more people had see it.  I try to get people to watch it but it's tough.
It's like people are afraid of subtitles.
And there's a lot of them in that movie.
That's true, but after a while you don't notice.
I agree, you just need to pay close attention.
Yeah, not a movie you can talk through.
