Did you watch the latest remake of Beauty and the Beast?
No, I really dislike Emma Watson.
Me too! Plus the animated Disney version is much more fun.
It is. It's a nice little story about love conquering demons, right?
I guess so. Love taming the best within.
Everyone could probably use a bit more love then.
You've got that right. We're all beasts at heart.
I just want to have talking tableware.
Yes! The singing teapot is amazing.
A singing teapot would certainly make mornings better.
