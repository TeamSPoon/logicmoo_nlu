Looks like it's going to be the Warriors vs the Cavs in the finals
Yeah just like most people thought
I was really hoping for something different but oh well
Yeah me too. Who do you think wins it all?
I think the Warriors win in six games.
I say the Warriors win in seven games
I just think the Warriors have too much firepower
Yeah, especially with the addition of Kevin Durant to their lineup
Yeah that has made them even more potent
It just going to be hard to overcome all of that talent
Yeah I think the Warriors are just too good
In the end they will wear down Lebron James
Yeah I think Kevin Love needs to have a huge series in order for them to have a chance
I agree and their bench needs to play well also
That's the only way they have a shot at this
If Lebron pulls this off I think it puts him a little closer to Jordan
I believe that as well. This is a huge challenge to take on
Probably the biggest challenge that he has ever had
We are talking about beating a potentially all-time team
Yeah that would be an amazing accomplishment
