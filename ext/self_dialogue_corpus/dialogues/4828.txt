How about those Astros?
I know, first place! I can't believe it!
Those young guys finally playing well.
I agree, Correa, Springer, Altuve.
It's a really bright future.
The manager finally seems to have control of the team too.
I think the Veterans added to the team help a lot.
Certainly, you can't overlook the veteran players added to the team.
Do you think they will go all the way?
It's impossible to predict, I'd just enjoy it while it lasts.
Definitely, not every day you get to support a first place team.
Exactly, they certainly have the talent to continue winning games.
Did you see them play the Yankees?
Yeah, I was surprise with how much better they proved to be.
You know what could stop them? A trade.
They are not trading anyone I imagine, why fix what isn't broken?
I mean if another team gets better by trade, like the Yankees.
Ah yeah, that would suck. I still think though the Astros are very good.
Certainly, I hope we will see them in the World Series.
Yeah, that would be a dream come true.
