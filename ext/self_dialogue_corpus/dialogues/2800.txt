I'm sorry to say I'm a fan of the Cleveland Browns.
What's wrong with being a fan of the Browns?
Nothing I guess, it's just they have a bad record.
This year or consistently?
Consistently. They were 3–13 year before last.
Wow, that is bad. And didn't they have the worst record this year as well?
Yes, they were 1–15.
At least they drafted first.
Yeah, that's one positive.
Yes, yes it is.
Who did they choose with that draft pick?
They drafted Myles Garrett.
Is he a quarterback?
No, he's a defensive end.
At least he probably won't go bust like a lot of picks do.
A lot of quarterbacks do do that.
What happened to their first-round pick last year?
Corey Coleman?
Yes, if he was the pick.
He broke his hand and was out for most of the season.
