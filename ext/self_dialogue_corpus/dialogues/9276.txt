i think no limit had the greatest run in rap history
im more on the side of cash money
cash money was good but nobody came close to no limit
and no limit was good but cash money is still running
true but nobody sold an album every week that went gold or platinum
cash money still selling gold or platinum
they definitely had one of the best rosters ever
yeah they did have a nice roster
i wish we could have got collabs from both labels
i know i would love to see an abulm with them together
