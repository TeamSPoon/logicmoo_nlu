What is your favorite Lady Gaga song.
I love Alejandro. You?
My favorite is probably Bad Romance.
I went to one of her concerts last year it was amazing when she sang that.
No way that's cool! What does she call her fans again?
They are called her 'monsters'.
Haha that's cute I like that.
I hope they make a live concert movie for the theaters of Lady Gaga one day.
They did that for One Direction right?
Yes exactly like that!
