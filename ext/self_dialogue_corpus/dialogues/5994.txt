Back when I was an ESL teacher, I used to use clips from Disney movies to help the kids learn English.
That sounds like a lot of fun! How would you do it.
Well, I'd find a clip that related to the lesson somehow. Or we'd talk about the lyrics in a song.
What movies did you use?
I only had copies of Beauty and the Beast and Hercules, so mostly those two.
I bet the kids would've liked something newer!
Probably! But they still got a kick out of roleplaying.
You had them act out the scenes?
Yeah, right after watching them. It was fun!
I bet!
