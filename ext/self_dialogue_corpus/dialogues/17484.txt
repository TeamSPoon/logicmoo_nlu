Do you know about Lynyrd Skynyrd?
I have heard about them but I do not know their lyrics.
You have heard about them for a reason.
That could be true, what reason is that?
They have one song I especially like.
What is the name?
Free Bird is a true jam.
Ok I will have to listen to it.
The lyrics are truly special.
What is special about them.
Well the song is about being a free bird or free spirit.
Ok that is interesting.
Yes it is really subtly giving life advice.
That is an interesting thought.
The slow voice singing of the song also relaxes the mind.
I like to hear that.
It is an emotional song, he tells a great story with his lyrics.
I appreciate that.
Most importantly, the song really songs great, that makes them an awesome band.
Ok great, thank you for the recommendation.
