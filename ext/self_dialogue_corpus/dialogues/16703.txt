Do you listen to Coldplay? They are my favorite band of all time!
I think I've heard a couple of their songs...Do you have any you could show me?
Yeah I have their CD from a few years ago, it's called "X&Y" from 2005. I'll lend it to you.
Ok that would be great! What is their sound like?
Well, it's ballad type songs, and a sort of pop-like sound. But better then standard pop.
Oh, I might like that. Do they have real talent?
I think so, although, Coldplay got in trouble several years ago for plagiarism.
What? what does that mean, what did they do?
Well they apparently stole music from other musicians who weren't very well known. And even admitted to it..
Wow, that's not cool. How'd they get away with that?
They took music from really low level musicians who weren't well known and didn't have their music out there. So know one knew.
Oh, I just googled it. Yeah, apparently Coldplay changed the songs just enough, so know one noticed for a long time.
Yeah, I don't approve of what they did, but, I am ashamed to admit I still like their music.
Haha, well that's ok. I can't wait to hear some, I guess I won't focus on the plagiarism.
Honestly, I listened to a Coldplay song and then I listened to the song they supposedly plagiarized. Coldplay sounded so much better.
Well I guess they do have some talent then!
They do, and I hope the lead singer Chris Martin has since turned from his ways. I doubt he still plagiarizes, it would be too risky at this point.
oh yeah, Chris Martin, wasn't he married to Gwyneth Paltrow?
Yes, but they got divorced and now he's dating, I think Jennifer Lawrence.
Must be nice to be Chris Martin lol.
