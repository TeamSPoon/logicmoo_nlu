Hey have you seen any good movies lately?
No, I've been busy. How about you?
Yeah I've seen a bunch of good movies recently.
Oh yeah? Tell me about them.
Well I recently watched a documentary called Dear Zachary.
What was it about?
It was about a guy who made a documentary for a child whose father had recently died.
That sounds interesting.
Yeah the dad had a relationship with a woman who killed him then while in jail she found out she was pregnant.
Oh my. That's really interesting.
Yeah it gets way crazier too. You really should watch it.
I'll give it a try. Any other good documentaries you'd recommend?
Yes! There was another one called Tickled.
Tickled? What was that one about?
It was the craziest thing I have seen in a long time. It was about a tickling competition.
A tickling competition? That sounds weird...
Yeah, that's really the only way to describe it without going too far into it.
Was there a lot of twists and turns?
Like you wouldn't believe. Don't read anything about it, just watch it.
I think that's the first thing I'll do when I go home.
