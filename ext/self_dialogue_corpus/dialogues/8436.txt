Katy Perry has a new album out called Witness that hit the top of the charts when it came out.
I heard she was coming out with the new album, but didn't know how good it would be.
Apparently the fans have been really supportive of her. She's had 3 songs that hit diamond status for selling over 10 million.
She does have very supportive fans. Women love her feminist songs, and liberals loved her for supporting Hilary.
She's popular all over. The Witness album was at the top of the charts in China, where they call her Ms. Fruit.
Why do they call her that?
Because she wears fruit covered outfits. They even had a special fruit and album deal in China.
Fruit and album? What kind of deal was that?
They gave away a fruit package to everyone buying the album, and called it "Buy an album and get a fruit."
Well, it must have been a good advertising program if she hit the top of the charts there!
