Have you ever seen Fight Club?
Yes. That's one of the greatest movies ever.
I agree. No matter how many times I've seen it, I can always watch it again.
The concept for that movie was so ahead of it's time.
Right? I was so confused by the ending the first time I saw it.
I never expected the split personalities either.
I researched the movie online, and there were certain hints that gave it away early.
I've seen that, too. The characters swapping places for like a split second.
It would be really hard to catch unless you slowed it down.
Definitely. It was a really cool creative decision, though.
