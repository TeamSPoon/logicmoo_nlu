I watched The Strangers again last night. Couldn't fall asleep for two hours afterward.
Again? I thought that movie terrifies you.
It does, but I love it. I love the whole genre.
I haven't watched The Strangers yet. Should I?
It's one of the most terrifying movies, in my opinion.
Really? What makes it so scary?
Because of how realistic it is. I don't have to worry about supernatural forces killing me, but I should worry about home invasions.
That's a good point. Any other similar movies I should check out?
Funny Games is similar.
I have seen that one. Makes you want to not be nice to strangers who show up at your door.
