So have you seen that last Harry Potter movie yet?
Yes I finally saw it a couple of weeks ago. A friend of mine has the set and let me borrow it.
So what did you think? Was it the ending you were expecting?
Well, the good guys won. That's always a plus. And it was interesting how they got there.
Yeah, the dream scene with Dumbledore was good. Harry was really scared to meet Voldemort until he talked to him and got a better understanding of the events.
It was really unexpected to see some of the people who turned out to be allies in the end. Malfoy's mother really could have changed the whole ending if she had told Voldemort the truth about Harry.
I know it seems like that family is always surprising people when it comes to the side they are really on. When it comes down to it, I think they are on their own side.
I couldn't agree more. The ending when Malfoy and Harry saw each other at the train station when they were sending their children off to Hogwart's. They gave a little nod to each other. That kind of said it all.
I guess it really did. Maybe a you stay on your side and I'll stay on mine.
Maybe. Or maybe a hey, how are you after all these years?
