So how excited are you for the new Star Wars movie the Last Jedi?
On a scale of one to ten I'm a twenty five!
Lol me too. I really want to see more from Luke Skywalker.
Exactly, and how and why Rey has the force and why she is so strong with it.
I have a theory about that.
And what is that?
Ok, Rey is actually Luke's long lost daughter!!
Yes! That makes so much sense on why she is so strong with the force.
I can't wait too see if that's true or not.
Same here. And I'm curious how they are going to spin the story as well.
