I really like pop music. do you listen to Rihanna?
OMG yes! Have you seen the video for "Bitch better have my money"
Hilarious! and the elevater sceen where the rich woman ends up in the trunk!
I know I laughed like a fool.
I liked that little dog too!
Yeah he was really cute
I thought it was kinda funny at the end when she was sitting in the trunk with all that money!
I wouldn't mind have all that money.
Me either, but I can't sing! LOL
Well Rihanna sure can. Man I love her music!
