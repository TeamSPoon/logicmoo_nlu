Who is your favorite rap group of all time?
It's most def the Wu Tang Clan. Whats your's?
Thats a good one! I like Outkast and D12 but I can not decide.
Yeah that is a tough one! I'd say Outkast just because Eminem basically carried D12 and they did not make too many albums.
Yeah you have a good point there! I guess I would say Outkast then.
Well whats your favorite song from Outkast?
I would say "Back of the Bus". Whats your favorite Wu tang song?
There are so many good ones its hard to say but If I had to guess off the top of my head it would be C.R.E.A.M.
Now that is a striaght classic!
Yes sir, cash rules every thing around me! Cream get the money, dollar dollar bills yall!
