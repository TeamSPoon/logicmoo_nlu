What was the name of Adele's first album?
Uh... it was her age at the time or something like that, right?
Oh yeah, she did do that. I think it was 22?
No, that's Taylor Swift's song. I think it was 21.
21? That seems like really late to release your first album.
Okay, I looked it up and 21 is her second album, and her first was 19.
Has she named all her tracks like that?
Yeah, her third one was 25.
Haha, she's going to regret that when she gets older.
Yeah, I imagine it'll get boring fast.
Her set of pipes sure aren't, though, so I say she gets away with it.
True enough. Rolling in the Deep was my jam back in the day.
And everyone was all over her single "Hello."
That's from her most recent album, right?
Pretty sure. It was in election parodies, right?
Oh yeah! I remember the Thanksgiving one.
That one was so funny; I loved it.
Adele brings people together, man.
What are some other tracks from that album?
I think "Send My Love" is another popular one. There were a lot of break up songs on the album.
