so what did you think about the live action remake of the beauty and the beast?
I think it was great...simply phenomenal. How about you?
oh i am a huge fan of Emma Watson, i had to go see it in the first week of its release, movie was awesome
yeah and i loved the special effects and the songs.
oh and the acting and direction too, they did a good job!
i feel that they should start bringing to life more of the old disney classic animated movies.
yeah that seems like the trend. I think it all started with the live action movie of cinderella, then came the jungle book.
ya and they were great too. i am really looking forward to them coming out with a live action alladin movie.
oh yeah that would be cool, with the genie and all. oh how i love all disney movies!
yeah me too!
