Did you see the Yankees vs Redsox game?
Yea, what a great game!
I cant believe it went into extra innings.
Yea, the bullpens pitched great though.
Chris Sale pitched a great game.
Ya, he was on all night.
He had 12 strikeouts in 8 innings.
Ya, the only blemish was the two run homerun by sanchez
Yep, He hung that one slider
One bad pitch is all it takes sometimes.
Tanaka was masterful too
Yes, not as many strikeouts, but he held them to one run in 7 innings
The Redsox hitters couldnt square up any of his pitches
I know, he changed speeds and locations very well, avoiding hard contact
The Defense was great on both sides, especially the Jackie Bradley Jr catch
Yes, hes a great center fielder.  Ellsbury also made a nice play in center.
The umpires were very fair as well.
Ya, i like his strikezone.  it was very consistent
When is game 6?
Tomorrow night at 7:05pm
