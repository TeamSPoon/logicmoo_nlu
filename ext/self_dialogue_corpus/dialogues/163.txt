What is your favorite Avenger movie?
Probably the first one.
That was probably the best, but what about Civil War?
That was more of a Captain America movie.
I'd have to disagree. They had most of the Avengers.
True.
And Spider Man.
Oh, yeah! He was so great!
Can't wait for the new Spidey flick.
Me neither!
