Have you seen the last Star War?
you mean the one that came out in 2015?
You mean The Force Awakening?

I remember that movie as if it just came out yesterday, it's been such a long time
indeed, and I'm so glad they're making so many more, we're blessed!
you know there is one coming out this year?
about time! It's been 2 years, I want to see it badly.
Yes, I want to see Luke Skywalker back on the field
