Do you remember Tupac?
The rapper from the 90s?
Yes that one.
He was shot right?
Sadly yes.
Did you hear they did a holographic concert of him awhile back?
Really?  How?
Well I guess some of the old rappers got together with this idea and managed to make it happen.
Did it look ridiculous?
Not at all, it looked just like him.
That's awesome.
I thought so too.
I can't believe I didn't know that I love Tupac.
A friend told me awhile back.
Do you have access to a video of it?
I do, do you want to see it?
I do,  i'll get beers so we can watch it.
Sounds like a plan.
Will be like old times.
I look forward to it.
