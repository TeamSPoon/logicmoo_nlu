Jaws is a really cool movie to watch during the summer.
Oh yea, because then you are afraid to go in the water.
That was one of the best Steven SPielberg movies.
It was excellent!
It took place on Martha's Vineyard off of Cape Cod.
Yea, it is a very touristy summer beach spot , a great place for a shark.
It starred Richard Dreyfuss.
And don't forget Roy Schieder.
That's right.
The shark was a big mechanical shark.
Yea but boy did it look real.
Remember when it bit a chunk out of the boat?
Yea someone got swallowed by it in that scene as well.
That would be really scary.
Roy Scheider was the police chief Martin Brody.
Wasn't Richard Dreyfuss a boat captain or something?
No he was an oceanographer.
I heard it was the highest grossing film ever until Star Trek.
It was!
That was a great summer movie!! I still watch it today.
