What's your favorite movie in the Harry Potter series.
Mine is part 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban.
Oh I loved that one. My favorite though is The Goblet of Fire.
Oh really? I've seen them all and I've read the books.
Have you? Did you cry when Dumbledore did.
Yes I did, also when Dobby died. That was really sad.
Who's your favorite character in the movies?
I'd have to say Hermione. I love her cleverness and how well she fits in with the boys.
My favorite would have to be Hagrid. He's so sweet and funny.
Yeah I love how well he takes care of the magical beasts too.
