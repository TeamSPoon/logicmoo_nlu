Who's your favorite football team?
My favorite is the Seahawks?
How did you choose them, when you live on the East coast?
I liked their colors when I was little.
Funny, I used to choose teams the same way.
Did you?
Yeah, I liked the Vikings purple and yellow outfits and went with them.
Of course, you had to go with the local team too right?
Sometimes, but once we got cable I was able to see more Vikings games.
Yeah, having cable helps a lot in watching my favorites.
Did you play football as a kid?
No, but my brother did.
Was he any good?
He was fast, but small.
You have to be big and muscular to get ahead in football.
Usually, but some guys are smaller.
The running backs have to have speed.
They can be smaller, but it must be scary being tackled by someone 400 pounds.
It can be intimidating, but the players work hard to get their place on the team.
I agree.
