Greatest  Disney movie of all time for me would be Cinderella! What would be your favorite?
I would have to say my favorite Disney movie of all is The Lion King, the story line itself was classic . Broke my heart when Simba lost his father.
Yeah Lion King was great Disney  classic, It's rated the seventh- highest-grossing animated film of all time.
If I am not mistaken Cinderella was acknowledged as the 9th greatest  film in the animation genre.
Disney has managed to evolve very well, even their new Movies in 2017 are spectacular, like Moana .
Moana is so cute and a great story line , I mean a dangerous teen out to sea exploring, all but to save her people!
Yes I surely agree flawless, what about her dad trying to teach her about her duties as this young queen, but withhold  her family secret.
Wondrous ending with her newly found friend and side kick Maui (Dwayne Johnson).
We can Agree Disney corporation  has made some really good movies, and turned into classics through out time.
Definitely agreed !
