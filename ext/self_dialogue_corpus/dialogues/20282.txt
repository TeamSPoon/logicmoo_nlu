Did you ever see that movie called The Imitation Game?
No I haven't, though I've heard a bit about it.
It's really good, you should see it sometime.
What's it about again?
It's about a quirky guy back in World War I who is really smart.
What makes him so smart?
He's kind of odd, but he's really good with codes and basically invents the first computer.
Oh wow! That's a very good movie idea!
Yes I think it is too. The actor they chose is really good too.
Who did they pick?
Benedict Cumberbatch plays the main guy, and does a great job seeming like the weird genius of the group.
Interesting, I like the other movies that he's been in.
Yeah, he's a good actor from the stuff I've seen.
The move itself though is very cleverly directed, and has a lot of LGBT elements to it.
Really? I had no idea.
Yeah, the main guy is actually gay.
What? That's very cool.
Yeah the movie's gotten a lot of praise for including that element.
Is the movie based on a true story?
It is actually, though I don't know if he was gay in real life but I'm sure that part was true.
