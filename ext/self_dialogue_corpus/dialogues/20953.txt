I went to see the new Wonder Woman movie.
Yeah?  Did you like it?
I thought it was awesome! Have you seen it yet?
No, I was thinking of taking my kid to see it but I didn't know if it would be an age appropriate movie.
There was some dialog that bordered on inappropriate but it wasn't any worse that what they would hear on TV.
What was your favorite thing about the movie?
The fight scenes were amazing!
I heard they were cool.  How was Gal Gadot as Woman?
She was perfect and Robin Wright Penn was a fierce warrior.
Oh, I didn't realize she was in the movie.
She played the Amazon queen's sister, Diana's aunt, who trains Diana to fight.
How was Chris Pine in the movie?
He was great.  He provided a little bit of comic relief but didn't detract at all from it being Wonder Woman's story.
I heard it was the best of all the DC comics movies.
I agree.  It was smart, exciting, and appealing to a wide audience. I haven't seen anything like it from DC.
I do think Gal Gadot's scenes in Batman Vs. Superman were the best things about that movie.
Definitely.  I wanted to see more of her after Batman vs Superman and I still want to see her in another solo Wonder Woman movie.
Do you think Wonder Woman will have a sequel?
I think they would be crazy not to make another movie.  It is wildly popular, well reviewed, and has made them a ton of money.
I am going to have to go see it.  It sounds like it's a movie not to be missed.
