Was the original Star Wars called A New Hope?
Not at first, but later on yes.
You mean he added it after he released it?
Yes. It originally was just Star Wars
I prefer that actually
Many people do
When did he rename it?
I think before the second one came out. But, I'm not sure.
I wonder if there are many other things he changed.
Oh, where do I start?
