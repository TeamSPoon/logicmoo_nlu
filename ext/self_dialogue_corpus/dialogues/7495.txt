So my wife want's to watch Harry Potter tonight but I feel i'm too old to watch the movies what do you think?
No way those movies are actually just as good for adults
Really?  I thought it looked pretty lame on the trailers
No there is a lot of cool magic and visual effects
I guess I can give them a try
Just keep an open mind, even though kids are doing the magic there are also teachers that are adults and some pretty notable actors are in the series
Like who?
Gary Oldman is in at least 3 or 4 of them
Really, he's a great actor, you may have sold me on him alone
there you go, now go and enjoy the movies with your wife
