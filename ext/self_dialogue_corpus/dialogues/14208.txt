What do you think of Lady Gaga's newest music?
I am not a huge fan of her newer stuff but I enjoyed some of her older stuff.
Why did you like her older stuff?
I think that her older music was more catchy, it was one of those things that i didn't care for at first but found myself singing through out the day.
Oh, I understand that. What about her half time show?
I think that when she is preforming she is entertaining even if i don't like the particular song she is singing.
She is an amazing performer, that jump during the half time show was amazing.
That was amazing. I think that her willingness to go 100 percent into her shows is why she has so many fans of such different backgrounds.
What do you mean?
I think that the fact that she always give 100 percent to her singing, wardrobe, and performance makes her interesting to people of all ages and backgrounds to some extent.
