Have you been to any concerts lately?
No, I've kind of grown out of concert going - what about you?
I was thinking about going to the Oregon Jamboree. They've got a bunch of country artists.
I like country music too, just not the whole concert scene. I'm not too crazy about some of the new artists though. I like the older stuff.  Although I do like Chris Stapleton, Eric Church, Brothers Osborn and some Keith Urban.
Sounds to me like you like a lot of current country!  I like those too. I also like Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.
I guess I like them too. I miss some of the oldies like Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and Brooks & Dunn.
Have you been to many country concerts?
A few - my all time favorite was Chris Ledoux. There was no one like him.
Oh, I love Chris Ledoux - he is truly missed. He was an original.  Johnson County War is my favorite CL song.
That's a great one. The funniest is Yukon Rose - Copenhagen is a good one too.
I miss the 90's bands like Blackhawk and Little Texas.
Those were great - they had so many great songs.
Who else have you seen in concert?
Well, they aren't country, but my very first concert was 10,000 Maniacs. I also saw Sawyer Brown, Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.
Wow!  Those are some big names!  Sawyer Brown would have been fun - they have so many good songs.
I actually got to see them twice!  So much fun!  I saw Toby Keith before he was a big star. Same with Tim McGraw.
I also love some of the older rock groups like Aerosmith and Tom Petty.
Love those too!  Steven Tyler is my favorite. Nobody can hit the high notes like Steven.
And I can't forget Prince - what a talent.
Such a shame to have lost him - Little Red Corvette and Raspberry Beret are the songs of my youth!
