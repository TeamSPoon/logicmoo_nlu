Which did you like better, the live action Jungle Book or the original animated version?
I would say the original animated version, but I did enjoy the live action as well.
I thought Bill Murray was hysterial as Baloo.
Agree, he was the perfect choice.  All the real animals were amazing.
I read that the boy who played Mowgli was never actually with the animals.
It mush have been tricky for him to film his scenes, but it makes sense.  It would have been pretty dangerous.
I thought it was neat how the live action movie gave more information about how it was the Mowgli ended up in the jungle.
Yes, that wasn't something I had expected.
I wonder if Disney will make more of the animated classics into live action films.
There are quite a few that would be good candidates, I think.
