What is your favorite purse designer?
Right now I like Michael Kors, how about you?
I am a big Louie V fan.
What store do you shop at the most?
I prefer Macy's, you?
I enjoy Nordstroms.  I really love the Ivanka line.
I do too!  I love everything Vera Wang.
I need to go to Toomey soon and get some new bags.
Yes, I just bought some from DVF.
I love her.  Where do you get your shoes?
I just go and look at DSW.  How about you?
I just bought some Audrina Pappil shoes from Macy's, they're gorg.
Oh, sounds nice.  I've had some Vincent Camuto shoes from there.
Those are great too, they last forever.
I have to be honest, target even has some great clothes.
Oh I know!  I love shopping for clothes at Target and Kohls.
It's just such a great deal you can't pass it up.
You're totally right.
Have a great day!
You too!
