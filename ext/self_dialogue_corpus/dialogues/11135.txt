What do you think will be the hottest trend of the summer?
Who knows it seems like fashion nowadays is singled out
How so?
People pick their own fashion, they dont look to the stars anymore
I think with the birth of the internet you might be right
Sites like pinterest take all of the motions out of it
I agree to an extent
Do you like to pick your own fashion?
I will be honest I prefer it to be told to me
You are in the minority, go to Forever 21
Oh i know they have a ton of styles
Yeah so you can pick your own look
And they make them cheaply dont they
I dont know about that but how many years do you wear stuff?
Usually about once.
Exactly so why pay more
I guess thats the direction they are going
I think so and thats where itll stay
I dont agree I think its just the trend we are in
No people are more  conscious with spending now
