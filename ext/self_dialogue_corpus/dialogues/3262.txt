Did you know that Johnny Depp was in the first Freddy Kreuger movie?
What?  This is news to me!
Yeah, I think it was one of his first ever movie roles.
This had to be during his 21 Jump Street years, right?
I think so.  It sounds about right.
That's so weird, I don't remember him in that movie at all.
Well, spoiler alert he actually dies in it.
Oh, maybe that's why I don't remember him.
Still, he had a pretty big role in the movie.
I think I should rewatch it to see him.
