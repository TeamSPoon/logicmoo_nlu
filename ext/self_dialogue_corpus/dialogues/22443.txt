Have you ever seen a Roman Polanski movie?
That's the guy who's banned from the US for raping a teenager?
Yes, him.
No, I would never! I think it's terrible what he's done and as a protest I refuse to ever watch any of his films.
Oh. Have you ever seen The Pianist?
Of course! That movie was amazing
Roman Polanski produced and directed that.
Oh really? I never knew that. I have to admit it was a good film.
He is a great international filmmaker. He frequently has shows at Cannes and those popular film festivals.
I went to a film festival here in NYC last year. It was called the Tribeca Film Festival.
How was it?
It was really nice. It was affordable and showed very many different films.
Were there in English?
Not all of them. But if not, they had clear subtitles on the screen so it was fine.
How many films showed?
Dozens. Maybe even a hundred. Not all were full length - many were short-films.
How short do you mean?
For example, I saw one film that lasted only 20 minutes. Thats about one hundred minutes shorter than a regular full length feature.
Sounds very interesting. I wish you told me about it.
I'll be sure to let you know if I'm going again this year!
