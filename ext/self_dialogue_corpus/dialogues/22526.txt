Have you heard about Top Gun 2?
What? They made a sequel?
Apparently they have signed on and it will be in production soon.
Wow, I never thought I'd see that happen.
I know. I'm afraid it will be horrible.
That's definitely a movie that doesn't really need a sequel.
Yeah the first was so good and with Goose gone, the chemistry won't be there.
Maybe they will say Meg Ryan was pregnant and Goose's kid will be all grown up now.
That would be interesting!
Have they said who is going to be in it?
Well Tom Cruise is for sure signed on.
Anyone else?
I saw Val Kilmer tweet about it yesterday.
Is he doing it for sure?
It didn't sound like he knew much about it, but he said he was ready to reprise his role.
He would kind of have to be there wouldn't he?
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm unsure how I feel about it all.
I'm the same way. I will see it if it's made though.
I will too.
