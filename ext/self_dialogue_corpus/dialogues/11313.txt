I am so happy!
Why's that?
The Beatles music is now on most of the major streaming services.
Wow! That's excellent news.
I know, it has been annoying since I've gotten so dependent on Spotify, that I would always have to find my old CDs.
Yeah, streaming is the future of music and not having The Beatles music on there was limiting access to a younger generation.
For sure. I've actually been listening to a lot of their really early stuff on Spotify that I've never listened to.
Like what?
The album Please Please Me. It has a few songs I know, like I Saw Her Standing There, Twist and Shout, and Love Me Do, but most of it is unfamiliar.
That's really cool. I'm in a similar place, I haven't listened to it either.
