I'm not sure I can get into Japanese music.
Do you prefer rock or pop music, though?
I prefer pop music. But I haven't found anything I like from Japan.
You should start with the basics. Do you know Utada Hikaru?
I can't say that I do. I did check out this girl Lea Dizon, though.
Lea didn't really do much. Utada is more prolific.
Who would you compare her to in the States?
She's kind of the closest you get to a Madonna.
That's sounds good. Are her records good?
Deep River is my absolute favorite. But there's a lot to discover.
I have been able to find quite a bit of Chinese music that I like.
More traditional or pop?
Both actually. Have you heard of Bai Bing Bing?
No, I can't say that I have.
She does more traditional type music, but I absolutely love the way she sings.
Japan has a similar traditional style of music called Enka.
If it's anything like the traditional pop music in China, I'll have to check it out.
You really should look into Jero.
Who is Jero?
Jero is a new Enka artist, as crazy as that sounds.
