Have you heard any good music lately?
I have, I've been listening to a lot of 8-bit music.
What's that like?
It takes a lot of the old sounds from like Nintendo video games and makes music out of it.
Oh, that's really cool! What are some of the better artists that do 8-bit?
I like Dubmood a lot, but Bitshifter is also really good.
Those are some interesting names. What do they sound like?
Dubmood does everything from classic 8-bit video game sounding stuff to club sounding songs.
What does Bitshifter sound like?
They mainly do classic video game things, but in an interesting way.
What's interesting about it?
They do it in a way where they make modern sounding music with only the older noises.
That's interesting. Is it expensive to get into 8-bit music?
It can be as expensive as you want, you can use software and a keyboard though.
What would be expensive about it?
Some artists go the extra mile and get original game systems that have those sounds in them and reprogram them to be instruments.
Whoa, that must take a lot of dedication.
Yeah, especially since those machines aren't made anymore and are hard to find in good condition.
I bet, I haven't seen any game machines older than a Nintendo DS in a long time.
Me too, though some people still hang on to them and know that people in 8-bit music could use them.
