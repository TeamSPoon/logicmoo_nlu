My goodness, I cannot wait to see the Packers this season.
Will they win it all this year?
The Super Bowl? Rogers is in his prime, no on else in the NFC can come close to them.
What about the Cowboys?
The Packers beat the Cowboys last year.
I do remember that, yes.
What was the final score of that game?
It was 34 to 31. The kicker hit a last-second field goal to win the game.
Was that after the timeout.
Yes, yes it was.
That must have hurt Cowboys fans, to come to close and lose.
Yes, it probably did. That's what happens in football.
Absolutely. One team wins, the other loses.
That's what happened there.
Yes, the Packers moved on and the Cowboys did not.
That is an accurate assessment of the situation. Of course the Packers lost next week too.
Yes, they lost to the Falcons.
Who then lost to the Patriots in the Super Bowl.
That is what happened, yes.
Such is the life of the NFL. I don't think any sport is better.
