I am trying to get in shape after seeing Warrior.
I saw a little of it.
It's great. The actors got in great shape.
Really. That's nice.
Yeah. They did MMA style workouts.
That's intense.
They have huge muscles.
Who is the actor?
I think James Hardy.
He's good.
Yep. He's British but sounds American in the movie.
A sign of a great actor.
The movies about brothers in a fighting competition.
Do they win?
The older brother does.
Is he a better fighter?
No, the main character is way better.
Then how does he win?
The main brother is injured.
Oh okay.
