What about the Disney movie Milan?
I think Milan was a good movie.
Do you think Disney will do a remake of the movie or a live version?
A remake would be interesting and a live version would rake in a lot of money.
I think a live version would seem to heavy for a lot of viewers.
Yeah, there is a lot of violence in that movie, maybe too much for a Disney live film.
Disney will probably need to take a few graphic scenes out.
Yes, or the make the movie suited for people 13 and up.
Most Disney films have some violence but it's not graphic.
True, the films have cartoon violence and it looks cute.
