When are you going to get your tickets to the Bills game?
We are going tomorrow.  Should we get the tailgating pass too?
Yes, the midfield tickets with tailgating is the best deal.
Have you been following Coach McDermott this offseason?
Yeah, I'm really pumped but I think he has his hands full.
Do you think he is going to stick with Tyrod Taylor all year?
I think he has to given the contract he just signed.
What if they start out like 0-4
If they have that kind of start, he's going to need to considering benching him.
What are options do you they have?
Well, they always have Yates
Oh god.  Do you think we have any chance getting Garrapolo from the Pats?
I doubt they would ever trade him within the division
I think we would have to give up lot for them to even consider it
Weren't they asking for four first rounders?
Yes - and we ca't afford to mortgage our future on one guy.
But a quarterback is the most important position
I agree, I want to see another year of Tyrod - especially with a new head coach
Lets give the new guy an opportunity to show us what he has
I'm hopeful that we are playoff bound in 2 years tops
