You know the genre of movies I can't stand watching? Musicals! How about you?
I enjoy a musical from time to time. My least favorite are black and white movies.
Yeah, they are pretty terrible.
I agree. What movies are your favorites?
I like obscure movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse and Doom Generation. Ever heard of them?
No, but Welcome to the Dollhouse sounds scary, is it?
It's not a scary movie, it's about an unattractive 11 year old girl whose parents ignore her and her little sister gets everything.
Oh goodness that sounds like real life! What else?
Dawn, the 11 year old girl, meets a boy after detention and he threatens to rape her.
Yikes! Does he go to jail?
No, they end up being close and even dating. It is a great movie.
I like Kevin Smith movies, that reminds me of a Smith flick. Ever see any?
Um, only Chasing Amy and Mallrats.
I love Mallrats! Jason Lee is so good in that movie, also Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes are awesome.
Yeah they play Jay and Silent Bob in that movie. They're a great pair.
They are so funny in all the Jay and Silent Bob movies. I especially like when Bob can't see the 3D picture.
That is very funny. Who else is in Mallrats?
I believe Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck and Ethan Suplee if I remember correctly.
Joey Lauren Adams was one of my favorite movie stars in the 1990s, she was great in Chasing Amy too.
She was also great in Clerks.
