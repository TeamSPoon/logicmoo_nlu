I just heard startling news about the NFL.
What was it?
80% of players go broke after the first 5 years.
I've heard something similar.
They're thinking of starting financial programs for the players.
That'd be a great idea.
I think it's needed.
Especially for new players and draft picks.
Right.
They should've rolled this out years ago.
I agree.
If I was in the NFL, I'd welcome the classes.
It definitely couldn't hurt.
I wonder if it's helpful yet.
They're implementing it now.
I'm anxious to see the new statistics.
I'm sure it will help most players.
As long as they don't splurge too much.
It'd be cool to have ex players teach the class.
That's a great idea!
