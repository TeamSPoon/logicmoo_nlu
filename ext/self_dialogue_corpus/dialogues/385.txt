How do you think The Incredible Hulk ended up on that planet in the new Thor movie?
Oh, Ragnarok? Yeah, this is going to be a weird movie.
It seems pretty silly.
It'll have problems of being a standalone movie when Marvel is off-the-charts involved.
I think he got kidnapped.
Why? And how? He's huge and unstoppable.
Well, the witch broke Thor's hammer. So, she probably was able to trap him.
They mentioned he's a "candidate" - what do you think that means?
Probably a candidate to rule a huge part of the galaxy.
I just hope it's not "Gladiator, but with friends".
