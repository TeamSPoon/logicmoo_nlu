What do you prefer dramatic or comedy movies?
I say Drama is an overall stronger category of movie.
I agree. But one cannot discount comedy.
I have actually heard it can be harder to do comedy well than a dramatic role.
Well dramatic situation usually have so much emotion involved, leads to a good moving performance.
Ya it plays on people's emotion like sympathy.
Yep. Where to be good in a comedy, you really have to be on in your timing and delivery.
True, Timing is everything in comedies.
Sometimes I feel good comedic timing is a skill you are born with or not.
I think it can be learnt.
Maybe but some have it naturally.
I think it is more of an instinct in actors than a skill per say.
Fair enough, but an actor like Goldie Hawn to me is just born a comedic genius.
I do think she is great. A natural clown to some degree.
I heard she was in a fairly dramatic stage role and yet the audience laughed at her.
I had heard that as well. That was when she realized she was funny.
Ya just something natural in her delivery and timing is pure comedic genius.
Have you seen her new film with amy schumer?
I have not yet seen it , but plan to soon.
I haven't seen it yet, heard not great reviews.
