Did you ever see the Halloween movies?
I've seen them.  Not a big fan though.
Oh, I thought Michael Myers was awesome.
I wouldn't want to meet him in the street, but there are scarier movies.
He is iconic though, right?
Definately.  And the Halloween theme is downright awesome.
Oh yeah, the song is totally creepy.
Wasn't it a low budget film?
I think it actually was.  Maybe independent when it came out.
Well, for being low budget, it didn't do bad.
