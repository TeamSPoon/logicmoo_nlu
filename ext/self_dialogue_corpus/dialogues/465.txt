This fall is the new NFL season are you ready?
Yes, I am so excited !
Who are your favorite teams?
My favorite teams are the Eagles and the Packers.
Mine too ! I think the Packers have a great shot at winning again/.
Tom Brady was awesome last year ! but we need new winners.
It would be awesome to see the eagles step it up this year.
Jason Peters looks like he might have a good year.
I am not too sure about him I like Evan Mathis.
Yeah he is good but what about Demarco Murray?
He has had some awesome touch downs in the past.
I have been watching him. I am not sure how far he can take them this year though.
He has a forty million dollar deal on his plate he should do well.
Fletcher Cox is in his fourth season this year he is due.
He is a great defensive lineman but can he really deliver?
I would really love to see them win something it feels like a long time now.
Yes, they need to get back to there roots and take one home.
What about graham that dude is in top notch shape now.
He could be another to watch this season.
I am so excited.  I can't wait for the season to begin.
