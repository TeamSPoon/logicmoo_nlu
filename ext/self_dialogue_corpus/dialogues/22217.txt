Hey man, do you want to go see that new Alien movie with me?
I actually saw it this past weekend.
Oh yeah? What did you think?
I didn't love it. I keep waiting for that franchise to get good again.
Ah man, that's disappointing. I love those first two movies.
Me too. 'Aliens' is probably in my top five movies ever.
What's your number one?
I don't know, I kind of just have a general top five. Maybe Saving Private Ryan?
That is a good one. Can't go wrong with Tom Hanks
Dude has been in some classics. What's your favorite movie of his?
Wow, tough question. I have a soft spot for 'Big', believe it or not.
That's a bold choice.
I know, not exactly a classic, but my brother and I used to watch that movie all the time when we were kids.
I hear you. For my sister and me that movie was 'Back to the Future'.
I LOVE 'Back to the Future'.
Who doesn't? That may be a perfect movie.
It holds up so well even today. I've probably seen it 50 times.
Same here man. I miss young Michael J. Fox so much.
Did you know that he was actually in his 20's when they made that first movie?
I didn't, but that doesn't surprise me.
