I think The White Album was the Beatles best record
Why do you think that?
While my guitar gently weeps was so good.
I think that was a phenomenal song but there were betters.
Like what?
Obli di Obla da for one is better.
No way that was basic.
OK then, Helter Skelter was great.
Man what a diverse album.
All of them are just like that.
