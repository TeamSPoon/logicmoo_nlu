Uhhh, this looks like a bad band, actually.
Wait, why?
Because I just realized that this band doesn't have that many remixes!
Ohhh, yeah, I agree.
How so? You don't know any music!
True, true. All I hear is the new stuff, like Trap, and some EDM remixes here and there.
Well, have you ever heard of Baroque music?
No, what is Baroque?
Well, basically it's some old music type of stuff, so it's a little classic.
Oh, that makes sense.
I actually listened to a bunch of music genres, especially Jazz, Blues, Disco, etc.
Oh, speaking of which, when did Disco come out?
Pretty early in the 60s and 70s.
Oh, wow, I think my girlfriend is acutually interested in it!
How so?
She has to do a project on the history of disco, and other things.
Like what?
Hmmmm, not sure.
Does she have to perform some disco moves?
Yeah, and she has to do it in a crystal fox fur coat, too!
