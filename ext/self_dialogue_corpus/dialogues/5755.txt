Have you seen the new Moana movie yet?
Yes, it was awesome that The Rock did the voice of the demi-god!
The songs in that movie were very catchy.
My kids loved the "Your welcome" song and sing it all the time.
It's one movie that we watch again and again.
It's on reply at our house too.
I loved the cultural side of the movie also.
It was fun to learn how they think creation started.
I liked how they portrayed the family unit in the culture.
Yes, where grandparents and parents help raise the children along with the village.
