Let's get into the great pop wars of our time, where you team Britney or Christina?
See, this was very tough for me.  I liked Britney's showmanship, but I think Christina was more talented.
I agree, but if you had to pick one who would it be?
Britney, I guess.  I was so sad when she went crazy.
I feel like Christina never got the promotion she needed from her record company.  She could be a bigger star than she is now.
Yep, I definitely agree with this.
Alright, were you team BSB or NSYNC?
Oh, NSYNC hands down!  Justin Timberlake was going to be my husband back then.
I agree with you on this one, except he was going to be MY husband.
He was so cute back then.  He's okayish now.
Yeah.  Getting older is not a good look on him.  What were your thoughts on Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson?
I was team Jessica until Newlyweds came on and I found out how dumb she was.
Yeah, but Mandy seems like she thinks she's better than everyone.
Yes, I get the vibe that she is fake.
We'll call it a draw.  Did you like Limp Bizkit or Korn?
Oh, to this day I still rock both on bad days!  They are my guilty pleasure, but I would have to go with Korn.
See, I had a think for the LB guitarist so I have to go with them.
Wes Borland?  OMG, that is hysterical.  He was so weird!
Nah, he was just artistic.  You just didn't understand him.
HAHA, okay then.  We will agree to disagree!
