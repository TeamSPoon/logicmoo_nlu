Have you heard Let it be… Naked?
Yeah, I'm so glad they put out that album.
I think it's way better than the original Let it Be.
I was thrilled that they included Don't Let Me Down.
Yes! That's one of my favorite Beatles songs ever.
The single version never had the same feel as the version they recorded on the Apple Corps rooftop.
The new version sounds so much better. The album is worth purchasing for that song alone.
I agree. I also really like the new version of Across the Universe.
Yeah, but there are so many different versions of that song.
I think the Let it Be… Naked version is my favorite of them all.
