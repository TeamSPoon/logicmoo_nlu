Did you see the Phillies game yesterday?
Yes, it was terrific.
Wow, what happened?
The pitcher threw a no-hitter.
Wow, that's so cool!
How did he manage to do that?
He was throwing over 100 miles an hour on some pitches.
He must be great!
He sure is.
Was he a veteran?
No, what is amazing is that he is a rookie.
That's unheard of.
Yes, he was terrific in college and the minors.
He must have put on a show!
Yea, the crowd was going wild.
Even the greatest Cubs players couldn't get a hit?
Yep, their top hitter was struck out.
Wow, that is so cool.
I wish the Phillies keep up on this winning streak.
Me too!
