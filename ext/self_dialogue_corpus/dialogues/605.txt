Are you excited about the new Falcon's stadium next season?
I don't know a lot about it. Is it called Mercedes Dome or something like that?
To tell you the truth, I know it is Mercedes something. But I'm not sure what exactly.
Is it going to be bigger than the Georgia Dome?
Oh yeah, a good bit. And it is very innovative.
How so?
It has a retractable roof that is different from any other current stadium.
That sounds interesting. Do you think the Falcons will have a good season?
I sure hope so. Especially that devistating lose in the SuperBowl last year.
Yeah, that was a big disspointment.
It sure was. I really hated that they lost, but I think it is unfair how bad people talk about New England.
Oh I agree with you. Love them or hate them, they never gave up and earned that victory.
For sure. That said, I hope the Falcons meet the Patriots again in the SuperBowl next year to get some revenge.
Do you think they would win?
I really think it depends on the coaching staff. I think they have just been too soft.
I've heard people say that. They do have unbelievable players.
Some of the best in the NFL! I just don't think the coaching staff has taught them the right discipline to finish a game.
That sure is what happened in the SuperBowl!
For sure. Hopefully next season is the year they take it all!
Hopefully! And in a new stadium, that would be epic!
