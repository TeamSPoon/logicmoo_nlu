The only thing I don't like about summer, no NFL.
I agree. So what team will you go with after Oakland moves to Vegas?
That's going to be really horrible. I've been an Oakland fan my whole life. I guess a Vegas Raiders fan.
Is that the name they will be using?
I'm not sure. I don't think they have released the name details yet, but they usually keep the team name and just change the city.
True. When are they actually supposed to start playing there?
Not until 2020. It takes awhile to build a stadium.
That's really not that long though considering all of the work.
I'm curious how they plan to play in that heat.
I assume they will have an enclosed dome like the Arizona Cardinals do.
You're probably right. No one could play in that heat without having serious problems.
It would give them a great home advantage like Minnesota has for weather though.
That and Green Bay. I don't know how they stand to be in that cold weather anymore than the heat.
They get used to it like Denver player do with the thinner air because of altitude.
I don't think I would want to go all the way to Vegas to see games though.
It's not that far away is it?
It's a pretty good trip by car but there are short flights from Los Angeles to Vegas all day that aren't too expensive.
There were so many teams in California though that it's probably better for the team that they got out.
True, and they will be the only team in Nevada so hopefully they will get a better fan following.
Derek Carr made out better by staying with them because his taxes on his pay will be much lower.
