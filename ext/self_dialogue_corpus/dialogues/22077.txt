Hi there how are you today?
I am well thanks.  What's up?
I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tonight with me?
Sure, I have nothing else going on.  What do you have in mind?
Well, I wanted to go see the movie The Great Wall, with Matt Damon in it.  Have you seen the previews for it?
I haven't seen that yet, but it looks good.  It has creatures in it , right, and the China wall?
Yes, I think it looks entertaining.
I think Matt Damon plays the one that turns his life around and helps defend the Great Wall and people against those creatures.
Yes, how about 7pm showing at the Mall?
I think 9:30pm would be better, I have to run some errands first.
Ok, I will pick you up at 9 then!
Thanks so much! Was there any other movie we could watch just in case that one is full?
Alien Covenant will be on around that time too.  Have you seen it?
I haven't seen that one either.  Sci Fi too.
Yes, I would see that as well.
Alien Covenant has better ratings than the other movie.
Do you want to go to Alien covenant instead?
Yeah, let's go to Alien Covenant instead, and see the show at 9:30pm.
Alright, sounds good.  See you at 9pm then.
See you!
