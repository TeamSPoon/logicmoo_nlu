So what, for you, is the best decade for rock music?
Well, it's a hard question, because so much has been out there... but I probably say the 1970s.
The '70s? Really?
Yeah, well, people tend to think of it in terms of disco and some of the cliche classic rock bands, but a lot of cool stuff was going on.
Well, if your broaden your scale to include Germany, you get their experimental rock scene and the birth of electronic music.
Not necessarily the "birth," I'd take issue with that, but yes, techno music as we know it, electronic dance music, for sure.
You have Giorgio Moroder doing that stuff with Sparks by the end of the decade. That's a great album.
Oh yeah, and that's my point, because if you look at rock music in 1970, it's all a bit sludgy and turgid blues-rock.
Sure, and then progressive rock and punk rock came along to wake up everyone.
Yeah, the 1970s are a story of artistic revitalization and rebirth, and that's what appeals to me about them so strongly!
