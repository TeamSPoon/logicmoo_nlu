Of all the Disney films, which has the best songs?
Are we talking animated or what?
Just animated, none of the live action stuff.
I would have to go with Mulan.
Really?
Yes, "I'll Make a Man Out of You", is one of the best songs Disney ever made.
I like the one Christina Aguleria sung, when Mulan was looking in the water.
The Reflection song?
Yes, that seemed to play well into the plot.
The plot of a girl saving her country.
