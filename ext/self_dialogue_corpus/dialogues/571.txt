How do you think the Patriots are going to do this year?
I think they will dominate the NFC east again.
Do you think Brady will play much longer?
I think the way he is going he has another five maybe ten years left before he retires
Wow he'll almost be old enough for Social Security by then won't he.
Maybe... like he would need it.
You got to love the guy
Yeah I'm jealous!
What's not to envy five rings and a supermodel for a wife.
The only thing I have over him is my wife lets me eat junk food
We all have to have one fault.
I don't know if I could do his diet and life style but it sure works for him
Yeah he's in better shape than when he was in his twenties.
Yeah and you won;t see him doing Papa John's commercials.
But you know Peyton Manning made a lot of money shilling pizzas and he owns a couple of those Papa John's franchises in Denver
They were great competitors and I always loved watching them play against each other.
I was happy that Peyton won his last game.
Yeah a Super Bowl win what a way to go out and retire.
Class... they both had class.
And they both spoke highly of each other.  That's the way it's supposed to be.
