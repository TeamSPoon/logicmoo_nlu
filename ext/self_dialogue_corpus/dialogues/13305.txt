You know what bugged me in The Force Awakens?
Is it something silly?
You tell me. It was Kanjiklub.
What's wrong with them?
It's the name. It sounds like kaiju club.
Like a club for Japanese monster fans?
Yes! And they were even after Han Solu due to unpaye debts.
So? What's that have to do with monsters?
He was smuggling literal monsters, rathtars, across the galaxy. It makes me think that Kanjiklub is an organization of black market monster dealers.
When you put it like that, it seriously does sound silly.
