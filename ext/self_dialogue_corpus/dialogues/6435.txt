I rewatched the movie Wall-E last night.
Oh that is such a great movie.
I know, I can't believe it's been almost ten years since it came out.
That long?  Wow.
And the first 30 minutes are so good.
I remember.  There is like no dialogue in it.
It is crazy.  No dialogue but it holds your attention the whole time.
And WALL-E was so cute.
Adorable.  I wanted to have a pet WALL-E.
Me too!  I'll have to rewatch it tonight.
