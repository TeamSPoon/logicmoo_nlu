What's your favorite NFL team?
I have always been a big Steelers fan.
That's awesome. I like the Steelers, too.
I also really enjoy the Giants.
The Giants are fun to watch with Odell Beckham Jr.
Yeah, he has to be one of the best wide receivers in the entire league.
I agree there. I think he might be the strongest player on the team.
Yeah, it's a shame the rest of their team doesn't play on his level.
He also accepts a pretty low amount of money to play for them.
I saw that. He doesn't get comparable pay to other receivers of his caliber.
Which is strange because, like you sad, he's probably one of the best in the league.
I really only think he's beaten out by Antonio Brown.
Antonio brown is inhuman. The Steelers are going to be strong this year.
Yeah, I'm really excited about that.
Me too. It would be good to see them go far into the playoffs.
I would be buying some game tickets if that happened.
You're telling me. Another good receiver I was thinking of is Julio Jones.
I forgot about him. He's really impressive, also.
I'd say he's right up there with Odell Beckham Jr.
I agree. He might even prove to be better this year.
