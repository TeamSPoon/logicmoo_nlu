Did you watch the game last night?
Which game?
The Warriors and the Spurs.
Oh.  No, I didn't catch it.  Who won?
The Warriors, 120 to 108.
Nice.  They're really slaying the Spurs this year.
Yeah.  This is game 3, and they're undefeated this conference.
Well, the Spurs weren't fantastic this year.
What?  The Spurs had a great season!  That's how they made it to the conference.
I admit they've been okay, but they haven't been great this year.  They're not the Celtics or anything like that.
Fine, they're not the Celtics.  But the Spurs have had a good season!
I'm just not feeling that.  I think they got into the Western Conference on a fluke.
They're second in their division!  They beat the Rockets, Clippers..
Yeah, but they didn't beat the Warriors, did they?
Fine. They didn't beat the Warriors, yet.  We've still got a couple of games to go.
Yeah, fine.  When's the next game?
Monday, the 22nd.  It's in Oakland.
They'd better win it, otherwise their season is going to end early.
Yeah.  We'll see what happens.
That we will.
