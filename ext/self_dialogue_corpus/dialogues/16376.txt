What do you think of opera, Mr. PhD-in-Music?
I hate it an insane amount.
What, why?
Well, it's the height of music. It's THE genre you'd write in the 19th century to be a serious composer.
So, what's so bad about it?
Once we got to Richard Wagner, it became impossible to listen to.
Why?
Well, he believes in never-ending music. There is no repeating music whatsoever.
Why is that bad?
Well, know how you can always remember the refrain? You can always hear the melody after the song is over?
Yeah.
Well, not with Wagner. Nothing repeats. Nothing can be remembered.
That sounds awful.
It is. Even with the score I'm lost.
What about other opera composers?
Well, they're not as bad.
But still, you hate them?
Yeah, they're far too long and always in a language I don't understand.
Don't they provide subtitles or text?
Yes, some do, but it's impossible to watch the lyrics and the action.
