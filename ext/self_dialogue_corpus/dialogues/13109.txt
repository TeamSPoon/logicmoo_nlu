Do you have a favorite Star Wars scene?
Oh my, I have many. The first one that comes to mind is from The Empire Strikes Back.
Hmm, the Luke storyline with Yoda, or the Leia/Han storyline?
Leia and Han. That scene in the cockpit when Han corners Leia and makes her all uncomfortable.
That was a great scene. I loved it when she called him a scoundrel, and he took it as a compliment.
Isn't that just like a charming scoundrel?
And right when things were getting interesting, here comes Threepio to interrupt.
After Han realized Leia had slipped away, I thought Han was going to strangle "Goldenrod" right then and there.
Threepio has such a way of...getting in the way.
Anthony Daniels played him perfectly.
