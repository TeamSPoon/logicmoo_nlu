What do you think are some of the worst movie remakes?
I think one of the worst was Ben Hur.
Oh that really bombed. It didn't even earn back the production cost.
I loved the original Fantastic Four, but couldn't stand the remake.
One I saw that was a waste of time was Footloose.
What didn't you like about it?
It was too much like the original. I expected something different.
I heard the remake of Conan the Barbarian was pretty bed.
You just don't mess with Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.
I didn't see the remake to Clash of the Titans, but a friend of mine did and thought it was pretty bad.
I think some movies are classics and shouldn't be messed with.
There is a remake coming out, though that I think will be good.
What movie is that?
Jumanji..
I really liked that one, although I don't think the sequel was that good.
I hope they do something different enough to make it interesting.
Yes or otherwise it will end up like all of the over remake flops.
I already know part of the storyline is different.
I guess we'll find out when it gets released.
I guess so.
