What do you think happened to Tupac?
I don't think he was killed.  I think he went into the witness protection program.
Do you think he is still alive?
I don't know, maybe he is.
If he weren't killed I don't know how he kept coming out with new music.
True.  It is odd that there was new songs of his coming out after his death.
Maybe he had a vault like prince did.
That could be.  Or maybe he is in hiding.
He was into a lot of stuff and I'm sure he had lots of enemies.
I'm sure of that.
