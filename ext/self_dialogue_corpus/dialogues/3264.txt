What's your favorite horror movie?
Of all time? Probably 'The Shining'.
Oh, good one. That's scary because it's kind of 'real life' terror.
Exactly - I'm not scared by monsters and zombies and stuff.
'The Exorcist' is another great one like that.
Exactly! I like when scary stuff just happens to normal people.
I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' in cinemas and that freaked me out so bad.
Before anyone knew it wasn't real? Oh, me too. I was so scared.
I saw the original 'Jaws' in a cinema too, and that is so much scarier on a big screen.
People don't think of 'Jaws' as a horror movie but it's terrifying!
