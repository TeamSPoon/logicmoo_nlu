What rap have you been hearing lately?
I have been listening to the song called Count Contessa.
Oh cool, who raps that?
Azealia Banks.
What style is she?
She is rap but is a fusion too of garage music.
Sounds interesting.
Take a listen next time you are at it.
I definitely will.
It has a beachy club feel to it.
