Did you ever watch the movie called Identity with John Cusack?
Was that the one where they are all stuck in a Motel?
That's it.
I only saw the first half maybe.
Why, didn't you like it?
Well it looked good, but our show Justified was on.
Okay. Thought maybe you just didn't like it.
It looked good and maybe someday I'll get to see it all.
Well you should, very good movie.
Ray Liotta is in it too, right?
Yes, there's a few good actors.
Was it a good ending?
A surprising ending. Not what I thought.
Who was it John Cusack?
Sort of and sort of not.
Well that helps.
I'm not going to ruin the ending for you.
Okay, you're right.
You know I am. Really though watch it.
I will.
