I had a fun evening yesterday with my husband. He did the DJ for me.
Wow, that sounds fun! What did he play?
Oh, a mix of genres. We love to do that. He's a bit of a music savant, actually.
So, what did he start with?
A bit of classic rock. He loves his old 80's rock.
And do you like it?
Meh... Some things I like. But I prefer the new wave from the 80's.
Like Depeche Mode and Tears for Fear?
Exactly! But I also like some good funk from the 80's and 90's.
Oh funk is always great! Although I have a fondness for more recent funk, like Brooklyn Funk Essentials.
Oh, I love those guys!
"The revolution was postponed because of the rain." That' genius!
I know! And of course, I love some classic hip hop.
What is classic for you in hip hop?
Guru, 50 Cents, Nas, Eminem.
Oh yes, classic. What about Tupac?
I don't know him much at all actually, I have to listen to some of what he did.
You know what I like? Gorillaz. I love their mix of genres.
Oh I love those guys. Plastic Beach is one of my favorite albums of all times.
"Lady You're a Winner." It's so good!
