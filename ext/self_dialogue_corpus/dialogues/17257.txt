What kind of music did you listen to when you were younger?
It's so embarassing, but I was really into New Kids on the Block.
That is hilaious! I was more into Aerosmith.
When we were younger? You listened to Aerosmith?
Oh yeah, I was about 8 when Permanent Vacation came out, I was obsessed.
That's a weird album for an 8 year old to be obsessed with.
Is it? I also really liked Bon Jovi, and any kind of Hair Metal.
You were eight. I was listening to Olivia Newton John and Dolly Parton.
They were ok. I was just really into Poison, Motley Crue, and Def Leppard.
Wow. That's pretty strange for a little kid.
Is it? I just really loved MTV, I watched it all the time.
Yeah, it used to be so great when it played mostly music.
There's MTV classic now, it's pretty good, but not quite the same.
Who else did you listen to? Iron Maiden?
Sometimes. I was really into Prince for awhile.
Prince? How old were you then?
About twelve? I liked him before that, but I really into his music after Diamonds & Pearls.
By then I was listening to Salt n Peppa.
Salt n Peppa was great, but weren't you a little young for their songs.
Are you messing with me?
