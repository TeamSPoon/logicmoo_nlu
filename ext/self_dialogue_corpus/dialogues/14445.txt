I was really upset at game 1.
Yeah I know. Leonard was having a great game.
I bet the Spurs would be winning the series if he played.
Yeah, it sucks when a bad player from the other team does something like that.
Bruce Bowen used to do it all the time.
Yeah, so it's funny that it would happen to Popovich.
At least Popovich gets to experience what the Suns did many years ago.
Yeah, we went through all of that.
Remember when Stoudemire was suspended for walking on the court?
Yes, that was terrible.
I like the Cavaliers chances.
Anybody but the Warriors.
I know. I can't stand the Warriors.
That Green guy has such an arrogant attitude and there's no sense in it.
Right, cause it's not like hockey where you will get punched for having an attitude like that.
I'd like to see the Spurs Celtics in the finals
That won't happen.
I think it would be funny if the top two teams lost.
Maybe next year the Suns will be good
No chance
