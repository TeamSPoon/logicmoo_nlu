You know what kind of music I'm getting into now?
No but I know you are going to tell me and please don't say Disco.
User 1 takes out his phone and hit play.  The instrumental version of "Don't Cha" by the Pussycat Dolls  can be heard.
I love Disco but what I like even better are instrumental remake of Disco,Pop and Rnb hits.
Have you heard Boney James version of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature?"
No but the instrumental version of Quincy Jones's "Secret Garden" is off the chain.
Come to think of it, I recently heard an instrumental of Bruno Mars 25,000 carat song.
I bet that's hot. I got Beyonce's "Crazy In Love" on my playlist as we speak. You want to hear it ?
What is it you don't like to hear singers sing anymore?
I love to hear them sing but I love what a saxaphone or Spanish guitar can do to a song too.
I know YouTube has alot of the Funk Brothers instrumental Motown tracks.
I wonder does YouTube have an instrumental version of "My Girl" by the Temptations?
I'm sure they do because all the Supremes songs are on there as instrumentals too.
See you talking Old School now. I wish I could get my hands on "Dancing In The Streets" instrumental by Martha and Vandellas.
I bet you YouTube has it. I kinda like acappella songs you know like Boys To Men.
I think I've heard "The End Of Our Road" acapella recently but it wasn't on YouTube though.
You think we can purchase that kind of music online?
I'm sure. If Amazon doesn't have it, I'm sure Apple Tunes does.
You remember Paul McCarthy's "Band On The Run?"
Yeah and I think I still have the album in storage. That's eighties music you know.
