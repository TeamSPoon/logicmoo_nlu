I think i might rent a movie.
I've been watching a lot lately with all this heat.
Was the new Star Wars movie good?
I don't know, I didn't see it.
I've never seen one.
You're not missing that much. I have tried, but i just can't get into it.
You didn't like any of them?
Not really. I thought Princess Lea was cool, though.
Yeah, I kind of want to see Carrie Fisher.
You should watch it and tell me how it is.
