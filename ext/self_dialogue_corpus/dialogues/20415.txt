Pulp Fiction is on HBO so I just decided to watch it.
Oh, yeah, I do that with Pulp Fiction too. If I am looking at the guide and I see it's on I watch it.
It's a good enough movie you are still entertained each time you watch it.
Yeah, i know what happens and still enjoy it. But honestly i like the Jules and Vincent story the best.
Yeah, it's the best when they are in the apartment and the guy shoots and misses each of them.
I LOVE the look on Samuel L. Jackson's face when he realizes they have been missed by the bullets.
I'll admit, the first time I saw it I didn't like it.
I did, why didn't you like it?
Because it's confusing.
Ok, I get that. The story being told out of order is a bit confusing.
It's more than a bit confusing when new characters pop up unrelated to the story you were just watching.
Yes, it is. I am smiling and shaking my head over here.
I also don't like the Mia story because I didn't know why she overdosed for years.
Oh, I knew what was happening so it was clear to me.
I didn't understand if they were supposed to be in the 50's, or the 70,s or present day.
Instead of the 90's I get that.
I honestly didn't understand the movie the first time I watched it.
It takes multiple viewing to catch everything.
But after the second time I knew it was a good movie.
A masterpiece is more like it!
