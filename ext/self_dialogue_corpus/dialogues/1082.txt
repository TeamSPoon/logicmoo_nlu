What do you think of the Cowboy's chances this year?
I think they are turing the corner.
Yes, Dak Prescott has changed this time.
Yes he's much better than Romo.
Oh Romo wasn't bad, but he ain't a world beater.
Romo wasn't bad?
Hey even Trent Dilfer won a Super Bowl.
Well, I suppose you're right.
But Dak Prescott is much better.
Elliott is a beast too.
Where did Prescott go to college?
Somewhere in the SEC i think.
Was it Arkansas?
No, I think it was Mississippi St.
Ah yes, the Bulldogs!
Surprised they didn't win more.
Well, it's still Mississippi St.
Only fans that envy Ole Miss.
Ha Ha, you know that.
I can't wait for the Cowboys season!
