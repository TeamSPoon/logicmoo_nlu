What is your favorite Disney movie?
I love Mulan.
I do too! How good is Eddie Murphy in it?
He is too funny!
And I love that there is so much female empowerment in the film.
Yes, women really can do anything.
Speaking of female empowerment, what did you think about Moana?
It was phenomenal, especially the music!
Oh yeah, the songs were fantastic.
I also love her grandmother. She is a hilarious free spirit!
