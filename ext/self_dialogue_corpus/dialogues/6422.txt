Did you see that movie Big Hero 6?
Yeah, I loved it!
I just saw it last night and thought it was great!
I really like the technology Hero comes up with.  Do you think someone will invent that some day?
Absolutely!  Don't you think they're already working on it?
I'm not sure.  I think those movies are just made up.
Oh, I think there's a kernel of truth in what they imagine.  I bet someone is already working on it.  Technology moves so fast these days!
Really?  I don't know mind controlled bots that can create anything you think of? Don't you think that's a little far fetched?
No way!  You can control the internet with glasses, bots are next!
Maybe.  Still seems a little out there to me.
