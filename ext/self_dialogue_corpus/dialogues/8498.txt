What do you think about Taylor Swift?
While I'm not a fan of the drama that surrounds her, I have to admit that I love her sound.
I like her music too.  It's just so catchy.
Exactly.  I think she has really great producers and writers, and she is a tremendous performer.
What was your favorite album by her?
'1989' had so many fun songs.  'Shake it Off' and 'Bad Blood' were so good.
Not only were they good pop songs, but their music videos were great too.
Yup.  Combined, they have over 3 billion views on YouTube.
That is so many views.  I wonder when her next album will come out.
Me too, though in a Rolling Stone interview last year, even Taylor said she has no idea what's next for her.
