The Shining was on last night.  Man, that movie is scary.
I know.  All work and no play makes Johnny a frightening character.
Every time it comes on, I have to watch, yet I always regret it.  I have trouble sleeping after I do.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  It really messes with your mind.
It's cool, though, how it's become part of popular culture now.  You see references to it in a lot of other shows.
Really, like what?
Well, there's one South Park that totally parallels it.  One of the character buys a Blockbuster, so that's kind of like the hotel.
Oh yeah, I remember that one.  You're right; it is connected.
And, I think The Simpsons did a parody actually called The Shining for one of their Halloween specials.
Cool!  I'll have to check that one out!
