Did you see the Dodgers beat the Marlins last night?
Yes! It had a little bit of everything going on.
Are you serious? You knnow i missed it, that's why I am asking.
Alex Wood extending his scoreless streak, balls leaving the yard and players clearing the benches.
That sounds exciting, give me more!
Dodgers reliever Ross Stripling and bench coach Bob Geren, along with Marlins manager Don Mattingly were all ejected after benches and bullpens emptied in the top of the ninth.
How was Cody Bellinger?
Cody Bellinger hit a two-run homer.
Talk about Wood!
Wood, who made his first three appearances of the season out of the bullpen, extended his scoreless innings streak to 20 1/3 innings - spanning three-plus starts.
Was strike out epic?
yeah, He has struck out 29, walked four and allowed 13 hits during that stretch.
Yes! continue.
The left-hander also lowered his ERA to 1.88, best in the National League.
Were the coaches upset?
Mattingly and Geren exchanged heated words during the benches-emptying ninth and had to be restrained from each other.
Anything else interesting happen?
Taylor, 26, finished a triple shy of the cycle. The home run gave him a career-high five.
I must say, that sounded like a fun game.
It was. It sure was.
