Have you seen flatliners?
The film with julia roberts ?
Yes, that is the one.
Ya a long time ago now. I think  it was pretty scary to me when I was younger.
Do you know they are remaking flatliners?
No, I really hadn't thought of this film in forever.
Ya I think the remake looks like it could be better than the original.
Really? The original creeped me out.
Well the new trailer is out and it looks even creepier to me.
I will have to check it out.
