I didn't really like Katy Perry until I saw The Interview.
What changed your mind?
Well, most of the movie is set up to be ridiculous.
It is Seth Rogan and James Franco.
Right. So there's a scene midway through where they talk about Firework.
Who is 'they'?
James Franco's character and Kim Jong-il.
Ah. That's a weird pairing.
And then it's played in the background at the end of the movie.
Pop music can be perfect like that sometimes.
