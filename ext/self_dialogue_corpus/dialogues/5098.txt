Have you ever been to a live major league baseball game?
No, I think baseball is so boring.
I bet you wouldn't think it was so boring if you saw a game in person.
Why do you say that?
At a live baseball game, you're more engaged, it's more exciting.
There are too many commercials in televised baseball games! It makes the games last a ridiculously long period of time.
That's why live major league baseball games are exciting: there aren't any commercial breaks.
What else do you think makes live baseball so much better?
There's sort of a sense of community. Even if you don't normally follow a team, it's fun to get caught up in rooting for one of the teams.
I have to admit that when the crowd is involved with cheers or doing the wave, it does look fun.
And you get to see the super-fans up close, the guys who paint their faces and dye their hair to match the teams' colors.
Do you think the players really notice that?
I do. I think the players draw on the energy of the crowd and the excitement of the fans.
It's a shame that major league games have become so expensive.
I know. It costs more for a family of 4 to go to a game, park, get hot dogs and sodas and maybe a ball cap or t-shirt,  than it cost me to attend a semester at college!
Going to a game can cost as much as a used car! It makes the experience out of reach for so many ordinary people. That may be why baseball has become less popular over the years.
Why do you think the games have become so expensive to attend?
I think it's because they pay the players so much more than they used to. Athletes are paid as much as rockstars, and the fans ultimately pay the price.
So do you think you'd like to go to a major league game sometime.
Sure, I just need to win the lottery first!
