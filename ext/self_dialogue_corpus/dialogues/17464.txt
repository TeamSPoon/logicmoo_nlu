Can we talk about the evolution of rap? It's such an interesting topic.
Of course we can. I am going to love rap forever.
You know rap is territorial. Each direction has ruled rap at a time.
Yes, that's true. It started in the East. There is no debate about that.
New York is the birthplace of rap. It evolved to include all Hip Hop.
It was a powerful movement. So many were affected by the genre.
It started in the mid seventies. The pioneers of rap are mostly still alive.
It the baby genre. Forty years is not a lot of time.
The impact is dense though. It permeated all different types of music after that.
Yes. Remember "Walk This Way" by Run-DMC? They used Aerosmith.
That was an amazing blend. It really made an impact.
It opened the eyes of many others who would never would have been exposed. Amazing journey.
Oh yes. Little rockers all over the States had to take notice. It was an incredible time.
Wasn't it? It made people feel good. I don't know if it went to number one, but it was close.
I don't remember either if it went to number one on the Billboard charts. That would be interesting to know.
Let's research it. Was that the most successful crossover hit?
I think it was the first. I don't think it was the last.
Steven and Joe from Aerosmith was really cool to be in the video. They earned lots of points.
Was that the Golden Age of Rap? It was everywhere.
I think you're calling it too close. How could a baby be in it's Golden era?
