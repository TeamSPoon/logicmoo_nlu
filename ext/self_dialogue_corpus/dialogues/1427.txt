It's not racism, right?
Of course not. Blacks make up, what, 13% of America? They make up 70% of the NFL.
That is NOT racism.
But there is a difference in the positions they gravitate towards.
Running backs are 86% black
And wide receivers are 91% black
And, the corners. cornerbacks are 96% black
And the safeties are 90% black.
Maybe It has to do with genes.
Probably, and since much of physical movements needed in NFL are biomechanically analyzable, we can even quantify the traits.
Kinesiology
Yep and there are experts in NFL who specialize in Kinesiology
They probably have the meaurements down to a science, like the leg length, arm length, muscle strength, speed. etc
The reason black sprinters dominate the Olympics because they have long legs and higher center of gravity
How does that help?
Well, running isn't just applying muscle power, Running is turning potential eneergy in your body into kinetic energy..
So.. how does that help?
it helps because higher center of gravity means more mass on top to store as potential energy
Oh... So more potential energy, more... kinetic energy?
Which means they're faster.
