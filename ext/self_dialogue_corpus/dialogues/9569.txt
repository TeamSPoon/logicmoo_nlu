Did you get a chance to hear the new Kendrick Lamar?
Yes I did, I thought it was mediocre.
I dont feel that way to be honest with you.
What was the best parts of it then?
I thought the songs really were varied.
As far as lyrics?
His lyrics are always just like that but I loved his use of genres of music.
He is a crossover artist in my opinion
I liked how he used one word for every album title.
To me that was just a bit corny.
