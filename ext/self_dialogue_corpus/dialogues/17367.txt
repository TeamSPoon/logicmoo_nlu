Okay. So Lemonade. Thoughts?
Oh man I've got a lot of thoughts on that one.
Yeah? You like the album?
Definitely. It's like a solid wall of sound.
That's awesome. Did you catch the videos?
No, I don't have HBO.
You should check it out too. It's pretty lit.
Yeah? Did you see it then?
Yup. And there's already been a bunch of references to it already.
I guess it's a big deal.
No doubt.
It's like the whole thing is about female empowerment.
I'm all for that.
Plus it helps that all the tracks are pretty solid.
I really liked Formation.
Yeah, that got a lot of radio play.
Plus the super bowl.
Oh man, I forgot about that!
Yeah, Beyonce is blowing up the world.
True that.
