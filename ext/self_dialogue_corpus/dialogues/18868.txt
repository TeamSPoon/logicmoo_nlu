What are you doing today?
Not much just listening to some music.
Cool, what are you listening to?
I have AC/DC going at the moment.
I used to love them back in the day!
I still do, Dirty Deeds is one of my favirote songs of all time.
I saw them in concert many years ago.
I bet that was awesome!
It sure was, me and my brother went together.
I love their song Highway To Hell also.
That is a classic. I always work out to that song.
What other bands do you like?
Poison has always been one of my favirote groups.
Are they the ones that sing Every Rose Has Its Thorn?
Yes! That track never getd old to me.
Me either! That is one of those songs that is truly timeless.
I agree, have you ever listened to Journey?
I sure have; Faithfully is such a great song.
I know I used to listen to it over and over.
A great song delivered by a great band!
