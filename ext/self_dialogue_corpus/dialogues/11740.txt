I bet you don’t know the female Rnb group the Beatles performed with?
Was it the group they they stole I mean copied a hit song from?
What are you talking about? The group was a girl group from Motown Records.
There was a girl group from Detroit that had a hit song and the Beatles rerecorded it.
But did that group perform with the Beatles?
The group I’m thinking of was named the Marvellets and they had several hit records.
That’s not who I am thinking about but what was the name of the song?
“Please Mr. Postman was the name of the song. I’m sure they performed it together.
I’m not sure if the Beatles ever performed with the Marvellettes  but the Supremes sure did.
That's right and they made an album called "Live In Liverpool."
