You know what was a good movie?  The Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, probably the best of the Star Wars movies.
I wouldn't argue that a bit.  Vader was just amazing in the second film.
Yeah, that force choke was taking people out left and right.
Of course Han and Leia were a good side story too.
Yeah, like when she said that she loves him right before being sent into the carbonite.
Of course his classic response, "I know."
One of the best parts of the franchise.
Of course I'd be remiss if we didn't say that best line of the Franchise, and maybe of movie history.
No!  I am your father.
