Are you ready for football?
Yes!
It is my favorite season of the year.
Mine too.
It seems like it takes forever.
I really want to go to an NFL game.
Me too.
We should see if they have any tickets.
We probably have to go to the NFL site and order them.
I want to see all the new players the COlts have.
I want to see them all.
TY Hilton is my favorite.
He is good.
He has broken many records.
I want to get his autograph.
I wish I could see Peyton Manning.
Maybe one day you will.
I hope so.
His brother still plays.
Yes for the Giants.
