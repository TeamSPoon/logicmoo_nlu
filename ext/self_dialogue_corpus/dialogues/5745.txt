Did you see The Rookie?
Was that the baseball movie?
Yeah and it starred Dennis Quaid.
I think it was too unbelievable.
Yeah it was a bit preposterous but arent most Disney films?
I loved the concept of an older guy getting a final crack at the bigs, but this was odd
I dont know how great of a job was done with the movie.
I think that we could say this film was a bust for the studio.
Quaid did a convincing job I will give you that.
Yes I agree but I was not into the whole make the big leagues after so long.
