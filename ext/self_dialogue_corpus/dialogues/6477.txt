How well do you remember the Mulan movie?
Oh, it was one of my favorite Disney movies!
Huh, why is that?
Well, duh, Mulan, the female lead character is represented as a very strong person.
Okay, let me test your knowledge then. Which actor played Mulan?
I've got this. The actor for Mulan's speaking voice is Ming-Na Wen and Lea Salonga did Mulan's singing voice.
Hmmm. I can't verify that without using Google, but you seem confident. I believe you.
What do you think of the movie?
It wasn't my favorite Disney movie, but I definitely got a kick out of Eddie Murphy as Mushu.
You can't beat Eddie Murphy for comic relief.
