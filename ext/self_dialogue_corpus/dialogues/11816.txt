Why is Paul so popular amongst the Beatles?
Disproportionately? I mean, he was a main songwriter in the band.
Maybe not disproportionately. I just wonder if there are reasons other than that.
Well, he's really a pretty underrated bassist, for one thing.
Hmm. How so?
His lines would be off on their own, not following the guitar with root notes.
That's true if I think about it. Lucy in the Sky seems comes to mind.
He's arguably underrated by this metric, since people falsely think technical skill is a great way to rate a musician.
Yeah. It's not like he's shredding all over the place. They're just memorable.
And imaginative. You have to remember that especially in their early days, this is when much of rock n' roll was really laying the blues ripoff thing thick.
