What's your favorite movie?
Sound of Music, hands down.
Wow there's an oldie but a goodie!
Yes and I lived in Munich for a while. Used to take my visiting family to Salzburg. We'd sing all the songs on the train.
Haha Lonely Goat Herd must have gone over big with the commuters.
Yeah, I kind of hid under my seat for that one. My father is funny and bolder than I am.
So much great music in that film. Was it Rodgers and Hammerstein?
Yes! They did so many great film scores.
Carousel and South Pacific!
King and I and Oklahoma!
But you always ridicule "show tunes"...
Yes, I don't know why, but there is a certain pageantry about Broadway shows that turns me off.
Yeah, it's so, "trained", so theater school.
Yes. The old movies, the musicals, they have more of a real feel.
Yes, because it's "real" to be walking down the street and break into song?
Haha you know what I meant. Can't explain it. Music Man Robert Preston yes, Music Man in front of Macy's parade no.
Hahaha I get that. School play lands somewhere in between.
Definitely. We had a smashing production of Brigadoon at my school when I was a kid.
Ahh another great movie version - Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse!
The Heather on the Hill is a fave!
