T minus 2 months until the 2017 NFL season begins. I can't wait!
You know, Minneapolis is having the Superbowl here this year. Or is it next year?
I think this season's Superbowl will actually be played in 2018.
They are already busy making preparations for it and have since the Superbowl this year.
What are they doing?
Asking for volunteers to do all sorts of thing to represent the city and put us in the best possible light.
Cool, are you going to do it?
No. I was involved in the 1991 Superbowl when it was held here.
What did you do?
I worked at a TV station so was on the field the whole time/
That is so cool! Did you get any autographs or photos?
No. I always laugh and say the gig was wasted on me since I don't know a thing about the game or it's players.
Someone else would have appreciated the gig much more.
MUCH more.
Didn't you like it at all?
Some. I saw Prince and Madonna in the audience. And i met the half time performer, Gloria Estefan.
That must have been nice.
It was. But for the life of me I have no idea who played the actual game.
This really was lost on you.
Yes, it was.
