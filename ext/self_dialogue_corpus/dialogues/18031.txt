Do you remember salt and peppa?
Like the Blues Clues characters?
No like the singers.
I don't think so.
They did that song Pushit.
Wasn't that from like before we were born.
Yeah, it's from the 80s, but it was really popular when we were kids.
Oh.
Well anyway, they've started doing new songs and touring again.
That's cool I guess.
Well I won tickets to see them in concert, I was wondering if you wanted to go.
I guess that could be cool.
Wow, very enthusiastic.
Well I don't really know their music.
I'm sure you do. They did other songs too.
Like what?
They did Let's talk about sex, and shake yo thang, and shoop.
Oh, I guess I've heard of those.
I told you you knew them.
Yeah, I guess it would be pretty cool to see them in concert.
