Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was a much better in the old version if you ask me.
Really, how come you think this?
Well, Gene Wilder was a better Wonka I think then Jonny Deppp was in the new one.
I like Johnny Depp, I thought he was good.
I like the older version with those characters.
The new one is just newer.
It was darker then the original.
The original was also scarey.
Scarey and darker seem different.
What?
Scarey does not have to always be dark, but dark is just dark even if it is never scarey.
The oompha loomphas were also better in the original.
The characters were just better because they were weird not dark like the new one.
You would never have taken a kid to see the new one.
Unless you were trying to traumitize them.
Solid scaring.
Remember Violet?
The one that blows up?
Yup the one who turns into the blueberry gum.
Th.at is what you get for whining
