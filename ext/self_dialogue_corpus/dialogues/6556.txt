If you could have one pet from a disney movie what would it be?
Baloo from the jungle book.
Good choice but I don't think you could have Baloo as a pet he's too much of a free spirit.
That's true, I mostly just want to be his friend and have him teach me how to itch by back on trees.
I can see where you're coming from. I loved the Bear-Necessities as a kid. I would drive my mom crazy singing it.
Yea, I used to sing "Be Like You" all the time. King Louie was pretty cool too.
Yea he was really funny. I always thought that place with all the monkeys seemed kind of fun.
Except in the new version with the giant King Louie. It looked more threatening to me.
Oh yea definitely. I would just want to live with the wolves the whole time.
Oh the wolf parents were so cute!
