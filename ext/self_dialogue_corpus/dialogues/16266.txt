What kind of music is your favorite?
Really, not too much appeals to me in our generation. I kind of like country I guess.
Well then what kind of music from any generation appeals to you?
I guess I like the 40's through the early 60's. It is pretty pure and innocent.
I guess I do get tired of how raunchy everything is getting these days.
Exactly, that is why I like older music.
Who is your favorite artist?
Well I really like a lot of different people, but I guess Frank Sinatra  best describes them.
So you like crooner music?
Yes, I guess you could say that. I like that style, but I also like big band without lyrics.
Hey, I like big band too!
You don't find many people our age who like big band music.
What is your favorite song?
Oh gosh, tough choice! I guess I would have to say In The Mood.
That is a good one.
What about you?
Well, I am not sure that it 100% qualifies as big band since it has lyrics, but I really like Chattanooga Choo-Choo.
That is such a catchy song. I wish more people appreciated music like that these days.
So do I. At least Michael Buble brings back some popularity to crooner type music.
I do enjoy listening to Michael Buble's covers and original.
