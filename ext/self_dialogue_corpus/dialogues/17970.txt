Isn't it weird that David Lynch makes music?
Yeah, his stuff is pretty weird.
I recently listened to a song he did with Lykki Li and it is pretty cool.
Yeah, I guess ithas a certain charm to it, but it feels overplayed to me.
Then I know you aren't impressed by the music on the new season of Twin Peaks so far.
Is it that obvious?
Chromatics played at the end of the first episode.
It's cheesy.
I think his son is in one of the bands that was featured in an episode.
I heard that too. Do you think he auditioned fairly?
Either way, the music has been pretty adherent to the theme.
I agree, although the music on episode 7 was a bit strange.
Do you mean when the dwarf picks up the picture, and it plays that pop song?
Yeah, it seemed out of place.
What did you think about Nine Inch Nails?
I haven't seen that episode yet. What was it like?
It resembled his older music.
I am looking forward to seeing it then.
You will enjoy it if you are a Nine Inch Nails fan.
That's great.
