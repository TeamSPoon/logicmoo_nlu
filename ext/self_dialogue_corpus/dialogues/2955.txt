So are you excited for this year's fantasy football season?
Yeah man. I can't get enough fantasy football!
Who would you take number 1 overall this year?
Standard or PPR scoring?
Standard. I'm old school.
Haha, I'm not giving away any secrets man!
Well, if he's your number one overall, there really isn't a way I can steal him from you! Plus there's only like 4 people it can actually be.
Hmmmm. Okay I'll tell you. I really like Le'Veon Bell. He's been a beast and won me the championship last year!
Yeah he's great. So explosive and a true bellcow. Bellcows dont even exist anymore which makes him so much more valuable.
Plus he's in a great offense... and the Steelers' lackluster defense kinda helps them by getting into high scoring games.
Yeah you can't go wrong with Bell, but I'm going to go with David Johnson if I get the chance.
David Johnson. Oh whoa whoa whoa. Yeah he's great and doesn't have the injury history that Bell has I guess.
Yeah, and nothing against Bell, but Johnson also just seems like an awesome dude. Like I could hang out with him and fit in.
Haha, well he might have some humble beginnings coming from Northern Iowa.
Hmm yeah youre right. So it sounds like we are both feeling RBs early this year and not WRs or QBs?
Well its not smart to take QBs early ever. There's so much value to be found in the later rounds.
But WRs? I think last year the first 3 or 4 picks were often WRs.
Yeah but I think last year peole almost undervalued RBs too much and now we're returning to the mean.
Perhaps, but I don't think we're back in the 2001-2008 days where RBs were king!
Ha no way. We're a long ways from the days of Priest Holmes, Jamaal Lewis, Clinton Portis, and Ahman Green!
