What is your favorite action movie?
I am a big fan of XXX.
Is that the one with Vin Diesel.
Yes it is.
I am a fan of that movie as well.
What is your favorite scene?
I think I enjoy when he is being chased down the mountain on a snowmobile.
That is a great part of the movie.
What is your favorite scene?
I like the end when he is chasing the bomb along the river.
Oh yes, very good scene as well.
Have you watched any of the other movies in the series.
I have.
I have as well but I do not care for them as much as I did the first one.
I agree with you.
That is a pretty common problem with movies.
Yeah, usually the first one can't be beat.
That is how it goes.
Maybe someday they will make another one that is comparable.
Possibly.
