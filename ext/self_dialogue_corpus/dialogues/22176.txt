Have you seen the planet of the apes?
Which one?
Any of them?
Yes, I believe that I've seen all of them.
How did you like the last one?
What was the name of the last one?
I believe it was called Kong Island.
Oh yea, that one was great.
I agree, I like the way that Kong was so dominate in the movie.
What do you mean when you say dominate?
I just think that he was a focal point in the movie.
Yup, he really took care of business in this one.
What other movies do you like?
I like comedy movies.
What type of comedy movies?
More so stand up comedies.
I like the Kevin Hart stand up.
I do too, that last one was awesome.
Yes, I also liked Dave Chappels stand up.
That one was even better than Kevin Harts.
