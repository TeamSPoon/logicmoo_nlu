I wonder why Katy worked with Migos on Bon Appetit.
I'm guessing that was a label obligation.
What did you think of it?
I thought they did a really good job with their verse.
I was left wanting a bit more.
Well not everybody can be as good as Kanye.
Kanye needs to come back too. I miss his music.
I feel like it's getting harder for him to get radio airplay.
He doesn't need it. He's already got the cred.
That's true. He'll go down as a legend no matter what.
