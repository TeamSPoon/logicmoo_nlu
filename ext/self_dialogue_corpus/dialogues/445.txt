Are you gonna go to the Steelers game next week?
Yes. What day is it ?
Next Saturday I think.
What team are they playing against?
The Tennessee Titans
Oh only one of the worst teams ever.
Why do you say that ?
Because they had a very big losing streak last year.
Your right, and when was the last time the Titans went to the playoffs?
I don't know school me.
Well, it's been a while. And they have only appeared in the Super Bowl once, but never won one superbowl
Wow. It makes you wonder how they stay in the league
They just keep switching coaches and hoping that the next one will do a better job
But they never do.
Well Im going to the game because I am from Tennessee
Oh is that why you continue to follow them
Exactly. You never know. They might improve over time
Yeah in like a 100 years
Ha ha ha ha  So your gonna go with me
Yeah I think I will watch them get the stuffing knocked outta them its alway fun.
