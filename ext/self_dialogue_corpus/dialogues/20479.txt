So, I watched Good Will Hunting again last night.
Did you like it?
On the whole, yeah. I mean, the cast gives a great performance.
Robin Williams and Matt Damon are both great in it.
They are! But there's this one thing that bothers me.
What is it?
Well, you know the scene, where Matt Damon goes up to the window and asks "Do you like apples."
Yeah, I remember that. It's a very iconic scene.
Well, it goes well in the movie, but it didn't feel very believable.
Because it's too outlandish.
Well, it is silly, but my problem comes when I think about what would have happened if he had said "I don't like apples."
Oh. It'd turn awkward really quickly. But most people like apples.
I guess. But it bothered me. It brought me out of the movie.
Were you able to enjoy it anyway.
Yeah, I was. The plot is just so magnetic.
The ending is also very satisfying.
It is. I really feel for the characters.
It's tough to make a movie like that come full circle.
If it wasn't for the great acting, it couldn't have happened.
Thankfully it did!
