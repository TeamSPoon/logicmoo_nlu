Who do you think is the current Queen of Pop?
Hmm, that's a good question....
It definetely used to be Brittney Spears.
Yes, I agree with that, her old music is a classic.
I think the new Queen of Pop is Beyonce, though.
Oh yeah, her music is on another level with anyone else.
What's your favorite song of hers?
That's hard, but I really like Formation right now.
Yeah, it's so good!
But I like all her music, honestly.
