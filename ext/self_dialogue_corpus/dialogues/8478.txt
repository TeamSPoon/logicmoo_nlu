What pop artists have you been listening to?
I have been listening to Hailee Steinfeld.
Oh cool. I have not really listened to her much.
You should give her a shot. She is talented.
I bet she is.
I like the song Hell Nos and Headphones.
I will check out that song.
I heard her live too and she was very good.
Nice, I will maybe buy some songs.
Buy the album too.
