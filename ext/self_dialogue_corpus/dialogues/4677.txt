Tribe play tonight?
nah, they were off
good, they could use the break
yeah, hitting's been a little off, even as the pitching's getting better
bullpen's been great though
oh yeah, maybe best in the league, definitely is the best in the division
you think they're still good?
man listen, the twins ain't hanging around much longer
tigers neither, I really think by the end of june, they'll be just battling for home field
yep, me too
hopefully the fans start showing up a little more now that the weather's getting better
they've never really shown up though
well, in the 90's...
and early 2000's sure, but that was a different era
different team, different fans?
nah, same fans, just different priorities
yeah probably, any way, I had these off days
yeah, nothing to do at 7pm!
I actually went to buy tickets last night and realized they were leaving for the road trip
boo! next time
