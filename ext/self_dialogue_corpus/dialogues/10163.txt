That was horrible! What happened to action films?
I know. The last one I really loved was Tomb Raider.
Tomb Raider, really? The one based on the game?
Exactly that one. Angelina Jolie was great in it.
I remember the sequel, too, The Cradle of Life.
There was supposed to be a third one, I think, but it got cancelled.
I loved that U2 song that they used for the theme.
That whole film was great. Did you know Angelina did most her own stunts?
That's insane! She must be really dedicated.
Oh, yeah, I'm a big fan!
