Have you seen the last Star Wars movie, Rogue One?
Yes, I did.
What did you think of it?
I was shocked that the entire cast died!  Wow, don't get too attached to any characters, right?
Yeah, but it did answer a huge issue from before.
You mean about the two meter opening that would allow the Death Star to be blown up?
That's the one.  That always seemed to be a plot hole to me.  In fact, it's often made fun of....
Yeah, I get that.
I mean, you make a giant moon-sized death ship and leave a single port open to destroy it?  Really?
Agreed.  But this did explain the reason -- that the architect forced to make this machine did not believe in it and DID want it destroyed.
Yes.  And it did humanize things a bit.
I did like a female protagonist.
Yes, until now Star Wars always had kind of limited female roles.
But like prior Star Wars movies, the characters still felt a little flat, 2-dimensional.
Until the end of the movie, I agree that the characters were a bit non-descriptive.  However, I also liked that the male/female leads went from enemies to friends ...
And that at the end of the movie, there was the idea that they might have been something more?
Yes.  But, wow, to have all of the characters die -- one after the other.
They really believed in the cause.
And, of course, Kari Fisher's cameo....
Her second-to-last for the franchise.  Very sad.
