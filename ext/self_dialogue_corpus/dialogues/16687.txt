Did you ever take a music cruise?
Oh yeah, through Cayamo. There's others, too.
You like that country stuff though, right?
Yes, I like good music.
Oh, no offense. I like some country too. Just not the twangy stuff.
I like it all. Especially the twangy stuff.
Uh, that makes it easy.
And taking the cruise makes it easier. You dont have to park, or worry about driving, you know?
Or worry about radicals I guess.
Yeah, that's important these days.
Also, you sometimes actually get to talk to the performers, they say.
Not all of them. But the ones that are building their fan base, yeah.
And you're not in nosebleed seats either, I guess.
Nope, you're right up close. And in the middle of the beautiful blue sea.
Do you visit ports?
You can if you want to. Some people don't bother.
Is it expensive, though?
Not really. I mean, you're gonna take a vacation anyway, right?
And plenty of music.
And you never get dragged through a museum, or a big old church, either.
