What do you think of the newest Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?
I was enjoying it up to the point where Han's own son murdered him. I was outta there after that.
Well, aren't they trying to do Darth Vader 2.0? He has to be really evil.
I don't care. There's very little reason for me to watch the rest of the series anymore, without Han.
C'mon, characgers die. There's still Luke, he looks pretty cool with that beard and stuff.
If Harrison wanted out of the franchise, there were SO many more satisfying ways to do it than to get offed by his son.
But this was the worst way, and that's probably why they did it.
Fine, you can have evil Han Jr. I'll go watch the original trilogy again and be much happier.
But...Leia. Carrie Fisher's last film. You have to see that.
I suppose I will, eventually, when it comes out on DVD. So I can scan to the Leia scenes and wish Carrie well.
