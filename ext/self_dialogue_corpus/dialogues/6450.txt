Hey I went to see Cars 3 last night.
Really, was it any good?
Brilliant, so funny and cute.
Did it have the same cast as Cars 2?
Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy were the main guys again.
I love Owen Wilson in that role.
You planning on going to see it?
Well I would like to, but I got a lot on at the moment.
The soundtrack is super cool, you can probably find it on YouTube, or at least a trailer for the movie.
Good idea, I'm going to have a look right now.
