What is your favorite horror movie?
I love the classics.  Can't go wrong with Friday the Thirteen or Nightmare on Elm Street.
I love the classics too, but I really love the original Halloween movie.
I like that one too.  I wish they would stop trying to remake the original though.
I know.  Me too.  You know another movie that I really like?  Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The new ones were crazy!
I agree.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time!
I hear the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies are based on true events.
No way!  That makes the movies even scarier!
Know another one that's based on true events?  The Strangers.  That movie kept me up for days!
I agree!  Definitely one of the scariest movies I've seen!
