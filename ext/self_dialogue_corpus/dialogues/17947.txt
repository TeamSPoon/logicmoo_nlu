"Music - is a gift from God". Interesting quote.
Where did you read that?
It was in the book "Bible Music" by Lulu Rumsey Wiley
"Bible Music" ...How can one term be related to the other?
When you read the Bible there are lots of examples of music involved
Like, for example, in the book of Genesis?
Do you want to read Genesis chapeter 4 verse 21 in your copy of the Bible?
OK, it reads " His brother's name was Jubal, the first musician -- the inventor of the harp...and flute"? Wow!
What do you think of that?
Awesome! So it suggests here that music can be as ancient as mankind iself.
It's remarkable that some archaeological diggings have brought out instruments like that.
And they look so basic .. but, me , I haven't trained to play neither one or the other! Ha!
I can play "chinese chopsticks" on the piano.
Heh heh, I would love to hear that someday. Are there any other examples of Bible music?
The first book of Chronicles shows there was a permanent staff of musicians in the temple of Jerusalem.
How many was that ? Like 50, or 60, like a big modern orchestra?
let's look at the 23rd chapter and the 5th verse, and you can feel the melody.
The last sentence says, "Four thousand will praise the Lord with the musical instruments I have made". Four...thousand!!!!
And their job is said to be as important as one of the work supervisors , construction officers and temple guards mentioned in that chapter.
Cool! I suddenly like this subject of Bible music. Let's look for some more examples, please!
