Do you like any action movies?
I like the ones that are good.
Haha, yeah there are a lot of bad action movies.
I think one of the best ones is probably The Matrix.
Oh that one was great! I love all the kung fu type stuff.
Me too! They did a really good job with all the fight scenes.
My dad loves that movie, especially he loves it to test out his speaker systems.
Yeah that one scene where they're fighting in the dojo has really cool music and sound effects.
The whole movie is really cool, it's just so stylish.
It's a shame that the other Matrix movies weren't as good.
Yeah I'm pretty upset about that too.
The first one was kind of a one hit wonder I guess.
I think so too, but I could definitely watch it over and over again.
Same here, it's still a good movie when compared to some of the modern ones that have come out recently.
Yes it still holds its own for sure.
I think it's probably one of Keanu Reeve's best movies too.
Oh I think it's definitely his best, though he isn't the best actor around.
You think so? I think he was great in The Matrix.
Yeah he did a good job there, but he's kind of flat in his other movies.
You'll have to let me borrow some of his other movies then since I haven't seen many of them.
