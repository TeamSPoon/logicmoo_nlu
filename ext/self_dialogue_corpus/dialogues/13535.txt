What's your favorite comedic moment in Star Wars?
Kylo Ren throwing temper tantrums was pretty sweet.
Yeah, I loved the storm troopers walking away. And the general reporting him had the "crap, we have to fix that, again" like it's common.
You?
Finn and Han.
Which scene.
The whole audience cracked up. See if you can finish it.
Okay...
"I'm going to use the force!"
"... THAT'S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS!" hahahah I loved it.
