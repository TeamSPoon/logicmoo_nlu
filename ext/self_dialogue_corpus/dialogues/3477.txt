Have you seen It follows?
Yes , I enjoyed it a lot. Really liked the beach and pool scenes.
Very creepy scenes. I was watching the new face off tv show, have you seen it?
Ya I like that show why?
Well the oldest contestant was actually a make up artist on this film, thought that was pretty neat.
That is cool, makes me want to route for him now that I know.
Ya I like to support indie films like It follows. Know any of any other good indie horrors?
I don't know if the witch is indie or not, but it was so well done.
It was amazing, one of the scariest concepts to me. The last scene images stayed with me a while. creepy to say the least.
I had read the stephen king loved this film and felt it was truly horrifying as well.
