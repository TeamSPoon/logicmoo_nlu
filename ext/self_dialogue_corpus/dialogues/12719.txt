How do you feel about the Star Wars prequel trilogy?
When they were new I didn't care for them very much but over time I've come to appreciate them a bit more.
Which of the Star Wars prequels is your favorite movie?
Probably Revenge of the Sith. That's a pretty common opinion but I agree, it was the best out of the three.
Which prequel was your least favorite. Let me guess, Attack of the Clones?
That's right. I don't dislike everything about that movie but of the three, it probably has the worst dialogue and characters.
But in Attack of the Clones, it was cool seeing a young Boba Fett right?
I actually didn't like that part. What was good about Boba Fett was that he was this mysterious character and showing him as a kid takes away from that mystique.
What was the worst thing about the prequels generally?
It's a tossup between the overuse of CGI and the wooden dialogue. There's so much CGI in the prequels that they are almost cartoons.
