Did you see the Royals and Orioles game yesterday?
Yes, it was exciting the Orioles almost came back and won.
I just can't believe the Royals were losing 5-0 in the bottom of the 4th inning and then ended up tying by the end of the inning.
Really, they scored 5 runs in one inning?
Yes, it was exciting to see especially the Moustakas homerun.
Wow! That is amazing, what is that number 9 so far this year.
Yeah I believe so, its either number 9 or 10.
I am really surprised the Orioles didn't come back to win it.
What do you mean, the Royals were winning for the most part after the 4th inning.
Yeah, but in the top of the 9th the Orioles started to rally.
Ohhh you were talking about the 9th inning I thought you were talking about the rest of the game.
No, I was talking about the 9th, It seams that the Royals were playing strong until the 9th.
Yeah, I am not too confident in the Royals bullpen after about inning number 7.
Yeah, I have to agree it seams that the bullpen starts to fall apart.
Sometimes it get frustrating as the Royals will have the lead most of the game and then their bullpen will blow it.
Yeah, your telling me.  They should have won all games last series, but their bullpen messed it up.
It also doesn't help that the bats for the Royals haven't been that strong.
It seams their offense is in a little bit of a slump, hopefully it ends soon.
Yeah I think it will.
Usually around the all star- break is when teams really start to pick it up as it is time for playoffs.
