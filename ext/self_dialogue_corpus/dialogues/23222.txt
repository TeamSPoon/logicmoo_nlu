So, have you heard about the next Jurassic movie they're working on?
What about it?
Well, apparently they're doing Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Guess who's in it?
Jeff Goldblum?
Exactly! They announced that he has joined the project!
Sweet! I loved him in the first two movies.
Jurassic Park was epic. I really don't think there will ever be another movie like that.
It was the favorite movie for an entire generation of kids.
Jeff Goldblum is famous for so many lines from that movie.
"Life, uh, finds away".
So what did you think of Lost World?
I have to admit, it really wasn't as good as the first one.
A lot of people felt that way, actually.
I'm glad I'm not the only one.
I actually thought there were some really good scenes in Lost World, though.
Oh, really? Like what?
Like when the RV gets pushed over the cliff.
That's true. That was actually a good scene.
The part with the long grass was pretty scary, too.
That's true. I see your point.
