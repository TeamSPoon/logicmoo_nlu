Hey, do you want to go with me to the Outlaw Festival July 16th?
Maybe. Who is playing there?
It's Willie Nelson's festival but there are a few others playing as well.
Do you know who else is going to be there?
I think its Sheryl Crow, My Morning Jacket and one other band.
I don't know if I really like Sheryl Crow and I don't know much about My Morning Jacket.
Some of her songs were overplayed like "Soak Up the Sun" and "All I Wanna Do" but I like the song "My Favorite Mistake".
Yeah, none of those songs are really my style, but I can say she looks great for 55.
Anyway, My Morning Jacket isn't really country as far as I know. I would recommend the song, "Off the Record".
Okay, I will look into it. Did you remember the fourth band yet?
I think it was Margo Price. The line up changes every date.
I heard that the Avett Brothers and Jason Isbell were going to be on this tour.
Yeah, they are on different dates but for some reason our date only has like 4 bands total.
So is it really worth paying full price when half the line up is missing?
Well, there is a Groupon so we can get tickets to the show for $20.
Why didn't you start out by saying that? I'll go if its only $20.
Okay, so you want me to buy your ticket for you?
Just send me the link for tickets and I'll buy my own.
Okay. Can you think of anyone else that would be interested in seeing Willie Nelson.
My brother is a big Willie Nelson fan but I think he might have already bought tickets at full price.
