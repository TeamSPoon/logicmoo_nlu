Man, being a Detroit Lions fan is hard.
Why is that?
We haven't won a Super Bowl yet!
Oh really? Why not?
Well, we've had pretty good teams before, but there's a big culture of losing in Detroit.
You think that impacts their ability to win?
Yeah, I do. They're so used to losing that they can't win, even with good teams.
Well, they play in a tough division too, don't they?
Yeah, that's true. We have the Packers.
And the Vikings too. They've been tough in the last few years.
Fair enough. But the Lions have had good teams too.
But they don't have a running game at all. Stafford just throws the ball down the field.
I think they're running game would improve if their offensive line was any good.
But they have a solid defense, right?
Yes, though it hasn't been as good since Suh left.
Well, I don't think they're as bad as you say. Playoff football is so tough.
It is. One loss and you're done.
Right, so it doesn't really matter how good your team is. It's just one bad game and you're finished.
So maybe they just haven't played a good playoff game yet.
Maybe. I suppose.
