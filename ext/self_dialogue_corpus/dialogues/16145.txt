You've been a professional musician for a while, right?
Sort of. I have been in the classical music scene my whole life but I teach theory.
Do you go to concerts?
Not as much as I'd like. I want to go to one or two per week, but it ends up being per month.
Who do you usually hear?
Either student recitals, or the wind symphony.
Ever hear someone really badly mess up?
Of course! These are undergrads, for the most part.
What's the worst mistake you've heard?
One of my friends had a graduate recital a few years ago. She was interrupted.
Interrupted? Someone stopped it?
One of her friends brought an infant. It started crying, loudly.
Oh, no. Did she take it out?
No. She lost her concentration completely.
She stopped, or just messed up as she played it?
She had to re-start one of the movements since she couldn't remember where she was in the music.
Hope you kicked the family out.
Yeah, I wish I did too.
How'd she react to it?
She finished the movement, then GLARED at the mother. It was funny, in a depressing way.
