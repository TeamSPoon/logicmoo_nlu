Did you hear the diss song about Nicki Minaj ?
Yes Remy Ma went really hard on her.
Nicki Minaj made a song about Remy ma do you know who was on the track with her?
I think it was Drake and Lil Wayne.
I think it was good but she needed help from them.
Yeah Remy ma didn't need any help she went hard by herself.
I think Remy ma's song was the best diss song in a long time.
Yes I do too she wasn't playing no games.
I think Remy handled herself  like a real boss.
I think without help from Lil Wayne and Drake No frauds would have been a loss.
