Do you like going to the movies?
Not really,I don't like the crowds.
I know what you mean.
Yeah, there are too many people there.
Yup,I like going.
Why?
I love the sounds.
Why don't you have a home system then.
I do, but it's not the same.
Your right.
I often think of its safe.
You have to think of that now a days.
I always have knife in me.
Me too. You never know.
I could see why you don't like going.
That's not the only reason.
Why else?
The ticket prices.
It's not that bad.
Oh yes it is.
