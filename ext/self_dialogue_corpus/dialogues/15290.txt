Who do you feel made the biggest impact on music?
That is a question that could be answered in many ways. Do you mean in development like way back beginning of man?
I had not meant that far, more like on modern day music. Say elvis vs michael jackson.
Oh I see. I would have to say michael Jackson because he really was the king of pop.
But what about elvis king of rock? Would there have even been a king of pop without the king of rock?
This is almost like the chicken or egg question, which came first?
Except here we know elvis and the rock and roll style was born far before pop came into the world.
Fair enough, but I still feel jackson because the current music is pop mainly and so many of the artist now were directly influenced by him.
I suppose many are, I think of bruno mars and just how much he has bored or been influenced.
Ya I mean bruno mars is a great example or even beyonce. Look at some of their costumes or dance moves even sound.
I think Bruno mars started out as an elvis impersonator funnily enough.
Well that may be true but he has much more of michael jackson's style than elvis.
I agree to some degree. But then I wonder was michael not influenced by elvis himself?
How so , there music sounds so different.
But think of some of the dance moves, I see similarity in some leg shakes and hip gyrations.
I do know elvis was considered very scandalous at first with his hip thrusts.
Funny how times have changed. Now we have twerking.
I don't know who wants credit for that. certainly no either king.
Probably not. I will stick with the moon walk thanks.
Ya  me too, maybe one or two crotch grabs for good measure.
