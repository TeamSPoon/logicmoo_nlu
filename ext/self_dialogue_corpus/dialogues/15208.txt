I will! I'm not a big fan of alternative indie-pop.
Really? What are you a fan of?
Well, I guess I like Indie in general.
Who's your favorite artist?
I love Regina Spektor.
I've heard of her. She does the intro song for Orange is the New Black right?
Yup! All of her albums are amazing.
I only know a few songs.
Well what other kind of music do you like?
I listen to a lot of Jazz.
Oh really? That's cool.
Yeah, I love instrumentals.
That's awesome. My father is a big jazz guy.
Who did he listen to?
He really loves Miles Davis.
Oh yeah, he really knows how to work a trumpet.
I agree! He's a legend.
You can't forget about Duke Ellington. He's another legend.
Yes! My grandma has all of his work on vinyl.
Wow, she's really a fan.
