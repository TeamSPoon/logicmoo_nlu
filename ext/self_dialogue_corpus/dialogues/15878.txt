Hey, do you like Tom Petty?
No, I can't stand his music!  He has always been popular but I never saw the appeal.
Me either!  To me he sounds whiny and his music is bland.
Yeah, it really is.  Free Fallin' really gets on my nerves.
I know.  And that Last Dance with MaryJane song is downright creepy if you watch the video.
Yeah, I agree.  I can't believe he was so big back in the day.
I have no idea.  There are a lot of bad artists that get popular, though.
Yeah, that's true.  I could name many.
Like Eminem?
Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about hip-hop artists but if you include them the list gets longer.
Well, I guess variety is good.  Different people have different tastes.
I love Tim McGraw.  He has always had great songs.
Yeah, and Kenney Chesney.
Yes.  They're both great country artists.
I didn't know you listen to country music.
I just recently started.  My husband is the one who introduced me to it.
Well there's a lot of good country out there.  You'll have to check out Blake Shelton.
Well of course I already have.  He's one of my favorites.
Yeah he has great music and great videos, too.
I love it when there's a good video to go along with the song.
