I loved the new Star Wars movie!
Me too! I cant wait for the next one.
Too bad Han Solo wont be in it.
Yeah but they are making a spin off of young Han Solo!
Will chewy be in it also?
Yes of course! it will tell the story of how they met.
That's awesome! what about Darth Vader?
I'm sure he will be its around the time he was in power.
Seeing Darth Vader in action again will be amazing!
Yes! i love Star Wars!
