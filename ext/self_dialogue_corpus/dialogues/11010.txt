I'm so excited about the Stanley Cup playoffs!
Me too, I think the Penguins will win this year.
No way, the Kings are going to be on top.
The Penguins are better.
No they aren't. Besides, Sidney Crosby will probably get hurt again.
Crosby isn't the Penguins only player you know.
I know, but he is by far the best player on the team.
Who do the Kings have who is so good?
The Kings have a complete team. The Penguins are just basically Crosby.
The goal tender wouldn't like to hear that.
If he was better I wouldn't say it. Besides, the Kings have a better won/lost record.
All you have to do is get into the playoffs, then your record doesn't matter. It's just who wins.
The Penguins can't beat the Kings four times.
I think they can. I don't even think the Kings are the best team in their conferecne.
You're nuts. The Kings are by far the best. They will win the cup easily.
That's what you said about the Capitols last year, and they were out in the first round.
The Capitols had too many injuries. The Kings are healthy.
The Kings are healthy until someone gets hurt in the first game.
Whatever. We'll see what happens when the tournament starts.
You've got that right.
