Do you like to listen to music?
Yes, I love listening to music!
What your favorite genre?
I like most everything - pop, rock, classic rock, alternative rock, country, oldies. Basically anything except rap and heavy metal.
So you listen to a wide variety.
Definitely! I may spend a day listening to Springsteen and Bon Jovi, then the next day I'll be listening to Adele and Lady Gaga. I'm all over the place.
Do you have a favorite artist?
I'd have to say probably Bruce Springsteen.
I know a few Bruce songs.  He's ok.
Oh come on! He's more than ok! You need to listen to more than just the few songs that get played all the time.
Well, I know Born to Run, Born in the USA, Dancing in the Dark, and probably a few others.
That's excactly what I mean. Those are good songs, but in my opinion not even his best even though they are played the most.
What's your favorite song?
Badlands for sure. With Promised Land and Prove it All Night in a close second and third.
Oh, I've definitely heard Bandlands. Not the other two though.
They are all on his Darkness on the Edge of Town album.
So I'm guessing that's your favorite of his.
You guessed right.
Maybe I should try to branch out and listen to more of his music.
I'd definitely recommend it.
