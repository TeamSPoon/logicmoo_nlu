Do you like John Waters movies?
I don't know if I've seen any.
He did the original Hairspray movie from the 80s.
Oh yeah! I love that movie.
Me too! Way better than the remake.
Yeah I think the original was much better.
Did you know it's a broadway play?
I did not! Is it good?
I saw it years ago, I loved it.
That's awesome I'll have to go see it.
He's got a lot of other great cult movies as well.
Which one is your favorite?
I really like the movie Pink Flamingos.
That sounds interesting.
Interesting is a good way to describe the movie.
Is it bizarre?
It is, but in a good way. I think you'd lilke it.
When did it come out?
In the early 70's.
Very cool. I'll have to check it out.
