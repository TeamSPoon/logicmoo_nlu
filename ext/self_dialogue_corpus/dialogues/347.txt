I hate how the movies are so rushed
What do you mean by rushed
What does the word mean
It means it was not done thoughtfully
Well that is what i mean
Why do you feel that way
Comic book movies with superheros are always rushed
Not always some are pretty good
That is the exception not the rule to be honest
Gotta give some of them a chance.
