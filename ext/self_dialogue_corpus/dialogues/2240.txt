I can't wait for football season to start!
When is week one?
The first game is September 7th.
Who is playing opening night?
New England is playing Kansas City I believe.
Oh man, the Patriots are going to dominate this year.
Yeah, they are even better than last year.
I can't believe they got rid of Blount after all he did for them.
I think that anybody could thrive in that offense.
Even that bum on Jacksonville?
Who are you talking about? Yeldon?
Yeah, he has been such a disappointment.
I still like him though, but he is no Marshawn Lynch.
Marshawn! I am excited to see him get back at it.
Yeah, he is such a beast! Such a dynamic playmaker.
Beast mode in the bay area! I'm happy he got to play where he wanted to.
Oakland is going to be nice this year.
Yeah they are. Carr developing and a veteran back to help him out.
It's too bad the Patriots will win again this year.
Yeah, another ring for the dark lord. Oh well.
