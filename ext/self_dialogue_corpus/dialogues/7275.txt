Annie is such a classic movie, It made me wish I had a daddy warbucks
same here! but to get to him you would have to like as an orphan
that is true and they had it pretty bad
I know they had to clean all day it was bad
and eat awful food and wear rags for clothes
Annie deserved what happened in the end
she did I hope the other girls had better lives
so do I , I hope that they did not stay there
I bet they all got placed somewhere else
probably, after the authorities found out that they had been neglected
