Remember the end of the STAR WARS original movie.
Like when they were trying to destroy the DEATH STAR?
Yes, that's it. It was intense.
It was crazy with all the space ships flying all around.
And they would get shot and burn up.
Darth Vader's space ship looked different.
Yeah, it looked mean like him.
And then Luke used the FORCE!
I don't think he could have shot into that hole without the FORCE.
Bye, bye DEATH STAR.
