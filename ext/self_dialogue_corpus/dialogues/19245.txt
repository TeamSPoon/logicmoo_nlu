I really love Kendrick Lamar
His first album Good Kid maad city was on point.
His new stuff is great though
I got chills watching him perform at the grammys
Oh god me too.
Have you listened to Humble yet?
From his new album?
Yes, it's pretty great.
I haven't gotten around to it.
Do yourself a favor and get to it.
I will. I didn't like Frank Ocean's new album that much
Oh me either. It was kind of a dissapointment.
I still listen to channel orange monthly.
Migos has a great new album as well
I havent heard it.
Check that out. and Sampha
I will. Is migos from atlanta?
They are!
SZA's control is also a good new album
I like her so much
