What is your favorite baseball team in the MLB?
I like the Brewers.
I am also a Brewers fan, have you ever been to Miller park?
Yes, I have been to the park but only once.  I wish they were doing better this year.
Me too.  I think they could still turn it around though.
I don't know if they will be able to, they are off to a rough start.
No kidding.  I am going to a game in the middle of June, can't wait.
That is cool.  Where are your seats?
We are sitting in the lowest section down the first base line.
Nice.  I have heard there is not a bad seat anywhere in the park.
I can confirm that.  I have sat in several locations and always enjoyed the game.
How many games have you been to?
I try to make it to five or six every year.
I wish I could go that often.  Who is your favorite player?
My favorite current player is Ryan Braun, but I was always a Prince Fielder fan.
My favorite player is Braun as well.
He does a great job at the plate and solid defense.
I was there when he hit a home run.
I have seen him hit a couple as well.
We should try to catch a game together sometime.
