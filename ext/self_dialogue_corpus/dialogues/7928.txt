Do you think Janet Jackson was as good as her brother?
Yes. She had so many good pop songs.
She did. I remember my friend dancing every time she came on.
Which song?
Nasty.
That's funny. All girls loved that song.
Her album Control had a few hits.
What Have You Done For Me Lately was on that, right?
Yes. My friend had the cassette.
That's old. A cassette.
