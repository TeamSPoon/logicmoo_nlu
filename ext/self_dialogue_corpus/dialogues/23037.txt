I just saw Breathless.
The original or the American version?
The original.
Who directed that?
Jean-Luc Godard.
I forget, was it in color or black and white?
Black and white.
Who was the hot chick in that?
Jean Seberg.
Was she French?
No, born in Iowa!
Cool.  Wasn't she in another movie based on a French novel?
Bonjour Tristesse.
Right, a pretty cool movie.  Who's the hero in Breathless?
Jean Paul Belmondo.
Yes, he's pretty cool.  Did Seberg do a good job?
I thought she did.
Some critics panned her.
They did that for Bonjour Tristesse too.
Can't please them all.
