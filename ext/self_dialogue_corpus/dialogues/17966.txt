What do you think of 1980's music?
I like some of it.
What genre of 80's music do you like best?
I would say probably British New Wave and the California Punk music like the Minutemen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, etc.
Cool.  I like both of those genres, too.  I also liked the D.C. punk scene from that time.
What bands came out of that?
Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Dag Nasty.
I love Bad Brains.  I've seen them a couple of times.
Me, too.  I Against I is my favorite Bad Brains album.
That's a great album.  What do you think of the Manchester music scene in England?
I love it.  So many great bands came out of Manchester.
Yes, the top bands being Joy Division/ New Order and the Smiths.
Yep, but a lot of others, too, like The Stone Roses, 808 State, Simply Red...
Wow.  Who else?
Swing Out Sister, The Chemical Brothers...even going back to the 60's, Herman's Hermits came from Manchester.
There must have always been a cool scene there.
Yeah, the city is so working class, a lot of good art and music can come out of hardship.
True.  The Smiths are probably my favorite band.
If you had to choose, would you say you prefer Morrissey or Johnny Marr?
Oh, they're both talented and couldn't have been the Smiths without either one, but as a friend, I'd probably say Johnny Marr.
