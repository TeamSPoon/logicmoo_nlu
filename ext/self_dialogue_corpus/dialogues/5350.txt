I saw Disney's The BFG, did you?
No but I heard about it. How did you like it?
It was pretty amazing in its animation.
The previews looked great!
And the story was great too.
What happened in it?
An orphan girl meets giants, is kidnapped, meets the Queen, and saves the country.
That sounds like a long story.
Yeah the movie was long. Funny too.
I'll take a look at the original book.
