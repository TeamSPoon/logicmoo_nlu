What is a good girl band?
The Bangles
I have not heard of them
I grew up listening to them
So they must be old
I'm not that old
So what do they sing?
Eternal Flame
Is that a good song?
It's a love song and it is amazing
Let's listen to it
Sure. Maybe I will like them
There are tons of good girl bands
There aren't many around nowadays.
I know. It is kind of strange
I miss the days of the girl bands
Were there many in the 90's?
We had the Spice Girls
Oh I love them
Me too! I bought their album
