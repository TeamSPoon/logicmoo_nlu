Do yo remember some of the all time NFL greats?
Oh yea, I remember all of the old Dallas Cowboys of the 1990's.
Those teams from the 90's era NFL were great.
The player I miss watching the most was Troy Aikman.
Yea, Troy was great he had so much heart and he put so much of himself into those teams he was awesome.
I think he was a real field general back then.
I also like the cowboys offensive line, remember Larry Allen?
Yea, Larry Allen was also a beast he was a new breed.
All these linemen now owe him a thanks he changed the game.
He sure did and he was a game changer in a big way.
I hope the cowboys make a push this season.
I think they will, Dak is an amazing QB it's going to be awesome.
Dak is good and so is Zeke Elliot, those two are going to change the league for awhile.
I agree I have my hopes on them this season.
I like the Patriots but they win enough.
I do to but they have to pass the torch at some point.
I felt bad for the falcons in that superbowl but wow.
Yea Tom Brady wanted it more for sure.
Who is winning it all this year?
I would say the Dallas Cowboys, they are due for a big year.
