Do you remember when Disney made the Hercules movie?
The cartoon?  Yeah.
Did you like it?
I actually never saw the movie, but I loved the animated series.
Oh, I forgot they had the series.
Yeah, I watched it every day after school.
Didn't that come out in the late 90s?
Yeah.  I was in high school and watching it if that's what you mean.
Well, I guess Disney does have a universal appeal.
It was a good cartoon!
