Have you ever seen Deep Blue Sea?
The one with Samuel L Jackson?
Yea and L.L. Cool J.
Yea! That was a fun movie.
It sure was. You can't go wrong with super intelligent sharks.
Yea, what was your favorite scene?
Definitely when Samuel L Jackson get's eaten after his speech!
Yea mine too!
That totally took me by surprise.
I know, I thought for sure he was going to be the only survivor.
