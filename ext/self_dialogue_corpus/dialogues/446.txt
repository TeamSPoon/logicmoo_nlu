I can't stand the Seahawks.
You sound bitter.
Not bitter, but they strike me as a bunch of cocky jerks.
They play with a lot of confidence for sure.
Their whole defense makes me want to punch something.
Why is that?
Because they are always talking trash.
But they also always back it up.
They've got some good players like Sherman, but even he's having issues with the org.
I know they were trying to trade him this offseason.
Earl Thomas will be back this year.
Yep, wonder how well he'll perform.
He's not as cocky as some others, but I still despise him.
I think he might lose a step, but still the best FS in the NFL.
The person I hate the most is Kam Chancellor.
Dude is a beast though.
Great player, don't get me wrong, but a total knucklehead.
He's got ample amounts of swagger.
You call it swagger, I think he's just a thug and not talented.
He hits like a tons of bricks.  Sorry that disappoints you.
