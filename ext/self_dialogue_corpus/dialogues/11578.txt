Have you seen Paul McCartney lately?
No honestly not since I was looking through my dad's old Beatles albums
Does he still have a bunch?
Yeah I think he has pretty much all of them, The one with Abbey Road is my favorite
I enjoyed the whole drug period they went through
Absolutely, Yellow Submarine is my favorite all time Beatles song
Have you heard "A Day in the Life"?
I think so that one is a little weird
Once again drug period lol
haha true they were pretty messed up at the point in there career.
