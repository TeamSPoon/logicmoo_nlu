Have you seen Moana yet?
No, what is it about?
What? Its about a hawaiian princess!
Does she have a prince.
No she really doesn't, but there is a demi-god she searches after named Maui.
Does she find him?
Yes she does, he seems very arrogant when she meets him!
What a jerk!
Yes, but he eventually seems to learn some compassion.
Thats good, sounds like a great movie
