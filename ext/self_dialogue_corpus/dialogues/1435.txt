What's your favorite NFL team?
Mine? Oh, I don't know.
How can you not know? You watch football every Sunday, Monday, Thursday, and Saturday!
Saturday is college football.  That doesn't count.
Whatever. Why do you watch every Sunday if you have no favorite team?
I have favorites.  But not just one...I have many!
How does that work?
Perfectly!  In every game, I chose a favorite, and then as I cheer, every game has meaning.
But what happens when your favorite teams play each other next week?
That's easy.  I cheer for the one least likely to win.
What?  You cheer for the likeliest looser?
That's right!
That means you lose most of the time!
Only if you are obsessed with scores.
THis is football!  Of course you are obsessed with scores!
Not me.
If you don't care about scores, then you don't care about winning!
Not true.
How can you win if you ignore the scores?
I win each and every time I support my teams.  And cheering for them helps make up for the fact that I bet against them.
