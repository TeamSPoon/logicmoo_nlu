What was the first concert you ever went to?
It was an Alan Jackson concert!  He was absolutely incredible live!
Oh I bet he was!  Alan Jackson is amazing.
I know, he's definitely an all time best country singer.
Yeah he is.  He has so many great songs.
I haven't heard anything new lately, is he still making new music?
That's a good question.  I haven't heard anything either.
I kinda doubt it because he's getting a little old.
Well that's a little harsh, but yeah he has been around quite a long time.
Yeah, when I saw him live it was in the nineties.
So which of his songs do you like best?
I like Chattahoochee!  That song makes you wanna just get up and dance.
Yeah, and you find yourself singing it later don't you.
It's a real toe tapper.  Which one do you like best?
That's a tough decision.  I don't know, I really like all of them.
I'd say he's one of the two best country singers of our time.
Who's the other one?
Garth Brooks of course.
Oh yeah, they're both in a league of their own.  I agree.
I'd love to see him in concert one day.
