Do you think NFL football is too violent?
Well, hard contact is what appeals to many fans--that's the game.
But what about the concussion issue?
Very serious, obviously.
And the concern for injury is trickling down.
I read that high school fooball participation is down.
Yes, over a million high schoolers still play, but there seems to be a downward trend.
That has to concern the NFL.
For sure--that's where the future players and fans come from.
Is the NFL doing anything about it?
Well, as you know there have been rule changes.
Yes, specifically penalizing the helmet to helmet hit on defenseless players.
And protecting the quarterback.
Can they do anything about the helmets?
Well, yes, there has been a lot of research to develop safer helmets.
But it's still a violent game--if you limit the violence, can the NFL survive?
I think a less violent game would deter many fans.
Yeah, what would be the attendance for a flag football game?
It's a tough situation.
It will be interesting to see how it plays out.
