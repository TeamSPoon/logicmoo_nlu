So what is your favorite hobby?
I would have to say playing sports and listening to music.
I love listening to music when I have had a rough day
I am the same way, it really helps me to relax.
Yea any time that I am stressed out, nothing helps out better than music.
What type of music helps you chill out more than any other?
I love different types of music; though for relaxation I want country music!
I like some country myself, but rap is what I relate to the most.
Cool, who is your favorite rapper?
I would have to say that T.I is my favorite rapper at the moment.
I am not to familiar with him, what are a few of his songs?
My favorites from him are Whatever You Like and Live Your Life.
Those songs actually seem kind of familiar. When were they released?
They were both off of his Paper Trail album and it came out in 2008.
I have probably heard them both on the radio a time or two.
So, what type of country music do you like?
I have always been a huge Dierks Bentley fan. I have all of his CD's and have been to a few of his concerts.
My mom likes him actually. Which of his songs do you like listening to?
I love his songs Different For Girls and Drunk On A Plane.
Those songs are not that bad actually.
