I LIKED THE BEATLES FIRST RECORDINGS WHEN THEY SANG OUR OLD ROCK AND ROLL HITS
I SAW THE BEATLES IN CLEVELAND
THE COPS STOPPED THE SHOW AND THEN THEY LET IT CONTINUE
I THINK THE BEATLES WERE TOO INTO DRUGS AND EASTERN PHILOSOPHY
NOBODY LIKED YOKO ONO
THEY SAY SHE BROKE UP THE GROUP
TOO BAD GEORGE AND JOHN ARE GONE
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE RINGO AND PAUL
PAUL"S SECOND WIFE WAS A GREEDY GOLDDIGGER
LUCKILY THE BEATLE'S MUSIC WILL LAST FOREVER
