Did you see the game last night?
Yeah.
Who would of known that both teams would have a no hitter.
I wanted shilling  to get his first. You?
I wanted arias to get his first.
That would of been a good one for him since he is so young.
Did you know this is his second season?
Yeah and he's only 22.
No way,I thought he was 26/27.
No man, he's 22 and he came from Mexico at the age of 21.
Wow, and he got his first no hitter last night.
I know, what a good career started for him.
I hope they don't trade him.
Me too, but you know how management is.
I know, they don't long at long term.
What ever happened to the days when a player would stay with a team thief whole career.
How do you thing shilling felt after his loss to that kid?
I wouldn't think he would be upset, but it's so hard to get that far with no hits.
Either way, it was a good game.
You watching tonight?
