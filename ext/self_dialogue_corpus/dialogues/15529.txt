I'm looking for something new to listen to, have you heard anything good lately?
Yes quite a few things actually. Anything in particular that you are looking for?
Well it's finally starting to get warm so I thought I'd make a new summer playlist.
On Spotify?
Yes, that's my go-to nowadays.
Well I heard a great song the other day by this new Japanese band called BiSH, have you heard of them?
No, are they a metal band like Babymetal? You know I don't like that stuff.
No they are more pop punky.
Hmmm go on then.
Well they've got a new album out with this song called Summertime on it, you'll love it.
But are they singing in Japanese? Makes it hard to sing along to.
Well yes they do usually, but this song is sung entirely in English.
How odd, is it a cover?
No, one of the members of the band wrote it. Although I have to say that her grasp of English is ... inventive.
That just means it's terrible, don't try and fool me!
No no, it's perfectly understandable, it just feels like it's been run through Google Translate once. It's cute!
And what is it like musically?
Like I said it sounds like a punk pop classic, like a long lost Buzzcocks b-side.
Well OK I'll give it a shot.
All their stuff went up on Spotify last week, if you like it they have three albums of stuff to explore.
