I like Peter Gabriel too.
Wasn't he in another rock band?
He was in Genesis.
That's right. He and Phil Collins were in Genesis.
Sledgehammer was a really creative video.
That came out when MTV first started.
Sledgehammer was on Peter Gabriel's "So" album.
Funny how albums are in the dust bin of history now.
Well that album should definitely live on in the rock genre.
"So" came out in 1985.
