Are you excited about this upcoming football season?

I am excited to watch the giants.
I love the giants.
They are fun to watch with the players the got.
Yea, Manning and Beckham.
Yea, its a great duo.
I wonder how many fines will be handed to him this year.
I think they cut down on that.
Hope so, the players should be able to celebrate a little more.
I agree.
Its like they dont want to see a guy get excited about the sport.
Plus it is good for fans.
Yea they like it.
Watch out for the patriots though.
Of course, they are good every year.
Yup, so is Tom Brady.
He will never age.
He will have like 10 rings when its over.
