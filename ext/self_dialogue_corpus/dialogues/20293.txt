Have you ever seen 47 Meters Down?
No I haven't , it looks great.
I think it was released June 2017, it is a newer movie.
I think that Johannes Roberts is the director on this movie.
In this movie two sisters go on vacation to Mexico, and they decide to take their chances with diving.
Do sharks attack them?
I believe so, I haven't seen it yet but it looks like that is the case in the previews on tv.
Who are the main actors in this one?
Mandy Moore, Claire Holt, Matthew Modine, and Yani Gellman are in this thriller.
Do you know who produced it?
Mark Lane and James Harris produced this one.
It sounds like a cool summer flick!
So far in the first week it has gotten decent reviews.
Would you like to go see this afternoon?
Sure, that sounds great. Do you want to go to dinner too?
I have to stop by the mall, so we can hit something there, and then head for the movies.
There is a restaurant there I like too at the mall.
That sounds great.  So I will pick you up around 6pm
Ok, sounds good!  I can't wait.
See you then!
