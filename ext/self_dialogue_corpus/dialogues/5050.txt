Did you ever play little league baseball?
Indeed, I did. I played until I was 15 or so.
Why did you stop? Were you awful?
No, I was a great hitter. I stopped because I'd have had to be on the high school team and I hated every one of those jerk jocks.
What's your favorite memory of little league?
That's a tie of two things. First, I hit a grand slam in a field with no fences!
Why does that matter, the fences part?
Well, they can play me as deep as they want. That's one thing I hated about little league - I had dozens of homers over the years robbed because there were no fences.
Maybe if you lost weight you could have ran out the homeruns easier.
That wasn't nice...but it's true. Where was I?
The second best memory of little league?
Oh, now I don't want to tell you because you'll make another fat joke.
I won't.
Well, I played first base and was always the big kid. Once I had my foot on the bag but this kid ran through even though he was very out, and he hit my hip.
What happened?
Well, his gut hit me in the hip, and that knocked the air out of him and he was on the ground for a few minutes.
Seriously?
Yeah, I didn't even budge.
Is it because you're f..
fat? Yes. But it's funny either way.
