I love all types of music. How about you?
I'm not a big fan of hip hop.
I understand, but that genre is really changing rapidly.
What do you mean? It's my least favorite type of music!
You should take a second look.
You have some examples?
Absolutely! Have you heard trip hop?
No, what's that genre of music like?
It's a form of hip hop that's more approachable.
Who are some famous trip hop artists?
Well, the most famous is Massive Attack.
Who's in that music group?
The lineup has changed over the years. It did, however, once include Liz Fraser.
Oh, I love her! I'm a hug Cocteau Twins fan.
Me too! Elizabeth is amazing in Cocteau Twins. But, she's also really good in Massive Attack.
Really? Can you let me hear one of their tracks?
Definitely! There's the theme from House. You know, that TV show?
She's the singer in that? Wow, I didn't know. I want to hear more trip hop then.
You should next try Portisthead. They incorporate a lot of experimental work into their form of trip hop.
Wow! That sounds really interesting. I apologize for being so close minded about music.
