So do you have a favorite rap album?
I'd definitely have to go with "All Eyez on Me".
The Tupac album, right?
Yes indeed. That album's a classic, and it still holds up to this day.
Great choice. I'll have to go with Nas' "Illmatic" myself.
That's not a bad choice either.
Both of these albums are great representatives of East and West, too.
That's very true. Didn't notice that before.
I feel like we should definitely bring Biggie into this topic as well.
Agreed. "Ready to Die" was an incredible album.
