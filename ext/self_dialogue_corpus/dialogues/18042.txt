Have you ever heard of Rob Zombie?
I have not, and that name is very strange.
Yeah, he's kind of a strange guy.
Is it just one guy?
Yes, but it's also the name of the band.
What's their music like?
They have a very particular style of music that is much like industrial metal.
Oh, that's definitely an interesting genre.
Yeah, and a lot of their songs have interesting things in them too.
Like what?
They like to use a lot of recordings of people's voices in songs.
That's interesting, it's always nice to hear that in music.
I think so too.
What are some of the best songs?
Most people know the song Dragula, which has been used in a couple movies.
Any movies that you can think of that has that song in it?
The Matrix uses that song in a club scene.
Oh ok, I think I might know how that song goes then.
I'm sure you'd recognize it, it's very popular and most people have heard it.
I'm not sure I am remembering them sounding like club music, but I'll have to look them up to see what they sound like for myself.
