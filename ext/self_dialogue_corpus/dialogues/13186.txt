What did you think of Queen Amidala in Star Wars?
Loved her! She was a wonderful female character.
I thought so too.
Great to think a culture would vote in a young woman like that, to be a queen.
Their whole society was really beautiful and fantastic.
Yeah I loved the artwork they used to represent their capital city.
I think those must have been paintings.
First class art.  What did you think of Natalie Portman's costumes?
Crazy beautiful right?  I totally loved them.
Me too.  Some of those headresses made my jaw drop.
