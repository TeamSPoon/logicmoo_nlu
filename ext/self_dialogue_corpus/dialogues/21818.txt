Do you like Seth Rogan movies?
I like a few. Sausage Party was pretty good.
Yeah I liked Sausage Party, but it will never top Superbad.
Superbad? Which movie was that one?
It's about a group of friends trying to buy beer and get laid.
Who stars in it?
Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. But Seth Rogan makes an appearance too.
Oh, I think I've heard of that one.
It's one of my favorite movies. Have you seen Knocked Up?
Yeah, and I really had a good time at that movie.
Then you'll really like Superbad! It has the same humor
I'll have to check out Superbad then. I like anything Jonah Hill is in.
You won't be disappointed!
Have you seen Pineapple Express?
Yeah, I think James Franco was great in it.
It's one of Seth Rogan's best movies personally speaking.
Yeah it's good. But not as good as Superbad.
I wouldn't know, since I haven't seen it yet.
You should check it out. It's just as good, if not better, than Sausage Party
It sounds like a good movie
