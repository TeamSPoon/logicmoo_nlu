Do you like Fifth Harmony?
Kind of. Their music is okay.
I love their songs. They have such good voices.
I guess that's true. I think they are trying to be like The Pussycat Dolls
Yeah. You are right.
They are too young for that though!
I like their cover of Impossible.
It's really beautiful.
I wish they would make new songs.
Me too!
