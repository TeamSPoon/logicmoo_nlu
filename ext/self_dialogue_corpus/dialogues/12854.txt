Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
Kind of, I watched them all with my husband before The Force Awakens came out.
What do you mean kind of?
Well, he found some version of the prequels online that were supposed to be better.  They cut out a lot of the stuff he told me was stupid.
Man, people really seem to not like the prequels.  I didn't think they were that bad.
What I saw wasn't bad but I don't know how different they were.  I don't like Hayden Christensen though.
I don't either.  He's not a good actor.  That was a poor choice to play Anakin.  Even Natalie Portman didn't do a great job.
I know, normally she's a great actress.  It can't have been the material though because I thought the story line was pretty good.
A lot of people say that it's too complicated with the whole thing with the Trade Federation and Senate and all that.
I didn't think so.  I understood all of that.  My favorite part was actually the fall of the Jedi Temple in the third film.
