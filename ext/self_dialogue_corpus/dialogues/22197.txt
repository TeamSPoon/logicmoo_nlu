Do you realize Hugo Weaving is in just about every movie you ever liked?
Who?
He's Agent Smith in all three of the Matrix movies.
Oh yeah, that guy.
He's in all 3 Lord of the Rings movies and both Hobbit movies.
I had forgotten that.
He's in all 3 Transformers movies.
Yes, but only as the voice of Megatron.
He's in V for Vendetta.
I loved that movie.
He's in the first Captain America movie.
The First Avenger?
Yep, that's the one.
It's that voice.
Yep, he has the perfect bad guy voice.
Or elf lord.
Well, that too.
That guys has got to have made millions and millions on those movies.
Not as a secondary character, or a voice.
That's true, they don't get paid the big bucks.
