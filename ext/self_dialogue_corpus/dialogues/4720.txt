I think that steroids in baseball were the greatest thing to happen.
What, wait? Why?
Well, there were a ton of home runs, all mammoth.
You think home runs are the best play in baseball?
Of course! No one wants to watch a 1-0 strikeout fest.
Well, some old people do. But they're old, so what do they know?
That was unnecessary. Anyway, they also got attendance to skyrocket.
Yeah, I've noticed that too, and that it's gone down since steroids were made illegal.
People like seeing home runs, and catching them. They love the home run derby.
True. But what about them being role models?
They aren't role models unless they declare themselves to be.
But kids will blindly follow people they look up to.
That's a result of bad parenting. It's their job to say "Don't take steroids."
You've clearly never been a parent.
That's ... apparent, ha! So what do you think should happen to those who use steroids in MLB?
They should be suspended.
Why, it's their bodies! They can do what they want.
Because it gives them a CLEAR advantage that others cannot have.
Yeah, but they shouldn't be illegal in the first place.
We'll have to disagree on this.
