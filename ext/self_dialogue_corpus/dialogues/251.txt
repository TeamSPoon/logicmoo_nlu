I can't wait to see Justice League now that i have seen Wonder Woman.
Me too. I hope Gal Gadot plays a bigger role in Justice League.
Was that Robin's suit in Batman v Superman?
Yeah. The Joker supposedly killed him.
The more i watch Man Of Steel the more i like it.
I really love the fight between Superman and Zod.
I think Cyclops is still alive in X-Men 3, because we never saw him die.
I dont know. It looks like he got killed off.
Unbreakable takes the superhero genre to a whole another level.
Its a very underrated film.
