Do you think that the new main three of the Star Wars sequel trilogy fits into the main three of the Star Wars original trilogies roles?
Yes and no.
Please explain!
Rey is obviously fitting into Luke Skywalker's roll, since she is going to be a jedi.
Yes, that's true!
I think Poe Dameron will fit into Han Solo's roll since they both pilot aircrafts.
What about Finn?
Well the only person left is Princess Leia's role.
They don't seem similar at all.
I know, but I think Finn is also going to use the force.
