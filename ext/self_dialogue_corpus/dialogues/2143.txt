So are you thrilled about the upcoming NFL season or what?
I'm getting there!
Who are you rooting for these days?
Being that I live in North Carolina now, it's hard not to root for the Panthers.
I understand.  I've loved the Broncos for as long as I can remember!
I know.  My friends call me a turncoat but I can't help it.
You used to be a Dallas fan, correct?
Yes, but that was a long time ago!
I gotcha.  I wonder how the Broncos will do this year.
I bet that will do well.  I can tell you that Panthers fans here are rabid!
Really?  How bad is it?
It's everywhere!  Tee shirts, caps, bumperstickers...
That seems to be everywhere though!
It's even worse here, I promise.
So will you be going to any games?
I might.  It really depends on my finances.
That makes sense.  When was it that the Panthers went to the Superbowl?
It was in 2003 but I didn't live here then.
They must really hate the Patriots there.
You got that right!
