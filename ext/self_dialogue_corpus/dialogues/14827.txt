Do you like 'The Big Lebowski'?
Who doesn't?! It's a classic comedy.
Agreed, but I guess it isn't some people's humor.
Yeah, the Coen brothers definitely do their own thing. Did you see 'Burn After Reading'?
Did that have Brad Pitt in?
Yeah, and it was by the Coen brothers. So funny.
I remember how utterly ridiculous some parts of that movie were, in the best way.
I know exactly what part you're talking about and it was so unexpected I bust out laughing.
John Malkovich is hilarious in 'Burn After Reading'.
I always knew him as a serious actor so it cracked me up to see him be so funny.
