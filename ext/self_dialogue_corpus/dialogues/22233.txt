Have you seen the new anime movie Your Name yet?
No I haven't, I don't like anime you know that.
What makes an anime movie any different than the other animated movies you like?
I just don't like the aesthetics and style decisions anime chooses to take.
But Your Name doesn't share any of those qualities.
You're telling me Your Name isn't an anime movie then?
No it is but you're thinking about the fan service type quirks anime typically have, right?
Yeah and I'd be willing to guarantee Your Name has them.
You haven't seen it how can you possibly know this?
Okay maybe I'm wrong, but knowing I don't like anime what makes you think I'll like it?
It's a beautiful story, it's beautifully animated, great score.
So you're saying if I watch it to just regard it as any other animated movie?
You should do that for all anime films honestly, there are tons of good ones.
This could be a turning point for me I suppose.
The fact that you haven't seen any Miyazaki movies blows my mind.
I'm sorry man, I just don't like anime.
But Miyazaki films are magical, true cinema masterpieces.
Hyperbole like that doesn't help the case.
Watch Howl's Moving Castle and then get back to me on the hyperbole.
Are you sure you want this to happen?
