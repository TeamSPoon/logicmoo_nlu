Do you feel The Beatles are overrated?
Absolutely not, they are essential in my mind.
I just don't see it, I mean they are catchy enough, but many consider them the best band ever.
I'm one of those people, there's never been a better final album than Let it Be and it wasn't even one of their stronger overall.
What tracks would you recommend, perhaps I should give them another chance.
Listen to a day in the life, strawberry fields forever and come together, see what you think.
I'll check them out, still don't think I'll like them better than The Stones.
Stones as in Rolling Stones? C'mon now great band in their own right, but they can't hold a candle to The Beatles.
We can agree to disagee, although who knows maybe I'll notice something with The Beatles this time.
You wouldn't be the first, sometimes it takes more than one listen. By the way Yesterday, listen to that one as well.
