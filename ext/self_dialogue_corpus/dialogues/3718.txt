Hi! What kind of movies do you like?
I guess I like thriller movies best.
Hey, me too! What's your favorite?
I really like The Sixth Sense.
You mean the one with the kid who could see dead people? With Bruce Willis?
Yes, I love Bruce Willis in that movie. And it gets better every time I watch it.
M. Night Shamalan is a great director. You can watch that movie over and over and see how careful a director he is.
The Sixth Sense is his best, though. I didn't like Signs as much.
No, me neither; it's a little cheesy. Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor, though.
I think so too!
