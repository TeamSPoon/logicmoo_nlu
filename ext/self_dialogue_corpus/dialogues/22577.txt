So I seen this movie last night was pretty good
Yeah what movie did you see
Hangout you know the one with the three brothers
Wait the one with three brothers that's not caught Hank out isn't that get out
Now you thinking about a totally different movie you talking about the one with three brothers and mom that got killed
So what kind of movie was hang out
I really funny comedy movie I was cracking up the whole time
I got to see that was a good who plays in it
It's a lot of people play in it the main one was that guy off of 40 Year Old Virgin
Oh see now that was my movie 40 year old virgin
Yeah that movie was pretty funny and I didn't like it that much though
Why not a movie is great
Just all that ephesus is on the 40 year old virgin thing wasn't all that funny
I remember the first time I seen it I was cracking up though
Yeah it's not one of those movies you can watch over and over again
Well maybe if you smoke some weed with it you can watch it again
Yeah I'm not really a weed smoker maybe you should watch that show Friday
