Monday night
Damn. That's a shame, I'll have to TiVo the game.
Why?
Son has a PTA meeting that night--as well as a little league scrim.
That's a bummer, dude. It's supposedly the game of the year.
I know.
Rangers vs. Senators, round 3.
Dude.
A best of 3 series that settles the number one question.
Jim. You need to chill.
The papers will be full of spoilers, Don.
I can go a day without the morning paper.
How about your fantasy league? Can you avoid ESPN as well, Jim?
Damn straight I can.
I'll wish you luck, dude. You're a braver man than most.
Oh--I know.
If I were you, I'd make up some excuse.
Like what?
Do you have any experience faking death?
I need new friends.
