Do you like the National Lampoon movies?
Yeah, Chevy Chase is a comedy icon!
Which one's your favorite?
Probably Christmas Vacation, just because it's a classic. You?
I always really loved National Lampoon's Vacation.
Is that the one with Wally World?
Yes! Where they take the road trip to California.
So funny. Have you seen Animal House?
With John Belushi? No I haven't, it's one of the only National Lampoon's I haven't seen.
Me neither, I've heard it's great though.
