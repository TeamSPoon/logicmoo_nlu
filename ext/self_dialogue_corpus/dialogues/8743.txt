Are you a 311 fan?
I have heard a few of their songs and as best I recall I liked them.
You probably remember Amber on the radio. Most people do especially girls.
yes you are right that is a song I remember.
Their song India Ink from their last album that came out was one of my favorites. They just put out a new album Called Mosaic
I don't know much but the ones on the radio from years ago
You should check out India Ink and see what you think
I might. They do remind me of  other bands I like.
Yes they have a reggae sound at times.
who is that band I am thinking of.....oh well can't recall ...oh wait it's Sublime
