What is the deal with the Pirates this year?
Their owner is cheap and won't spend money to win
But they had such a promising core
Yeah, but they didn't put the best pieces around them
The pitching staff has been solid though
Yeah, it was supposed to be the weak point
Can they build off of that?
Not really, because the offense is so bad
Right, but you couldn't see the Marte situation coming
No, but you should have had a better backup plan than John Jaso
No team could survive a loss like Marte though.
Sure they could. Teams that commit to winning can survive
What happens to Cutch?
He'll be gone in July
You think? He's the face of the franchise
Not any more. They'll deal him for a bucket of balls
What's next?
They'll blow up the team and sell the future to fans
Haven't we been down this road before?
Over and over again.
