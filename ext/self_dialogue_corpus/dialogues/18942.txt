Do you listen to hardcore punk?
Back in the day I listened to a bit, but not too much.
Who did you listen to?
I loved Minor Threat.
I don't know that band.
Really? They were one of the most famous hardcore bands.
I am just starting to learn about it.
Well, they were from Washington D.C. and they started their own record label called Dischord.
Why did they stand out to you?
They were a straight edge band with energetic and somewhat positive songs.
What is straight edge?
Basically, it means no living a clean life without drugs and alcohol.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Minor Threat fans used to draw an "X" on their hand to symbolize being straight edge.
Why an "X"?
Not exactly sure. If I remember correctly, it had something to due with the marks given to kids under 21 at all ages concerts.
Oh. Okay. What album do you recommend?
I recommend the album Out of Step. If you like them, check out Fugazi. It's the lead singer's other band. It's far more melodic. They are one of my favorite bands of that era.
Do they have multiple albums? Which one do you recommend?
Their self-titled debut is amazing. Get that!
