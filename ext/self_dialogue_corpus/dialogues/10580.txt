what do you think about Fast & Furious?
Well, I think it's fast and furious
haha, you're funny, but it's kinda true, the movie series has been fast and furious
indeed. All the car fans must be having an orgasm when watching the movies
I don't consider myself a car fan, but I'm visually stunned by those crazy effects
you remember the one where Paul Walker driving across a lifted draw bridge?
oh yeah, I remembe that one so vividly even today, I was watching that scene on my TV
me too, it's sad to see Paul Walker away, now we won't be able to see him again
at least now he rests in heaven now, God bless him
God bless him
