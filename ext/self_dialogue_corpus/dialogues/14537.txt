NBA playoffs are unreal this year. Are you watching it?
Yes I am. I can't believe all that has happened so far.
The only problem is that all the top seeds are winning. Exciting games but boring results on paper.
I'm actually not a fan of upsets.
Are you serious? Don't you find this stuff boring when no under dogs win?
From what I see, under dogs winning makes for exciting first couple of rounds. But boring in the finals.
Good point. At least the games are exciting. Game winning shots, big players stepping up.
Did you see John Wall hit that three last night?
I know! He isn't even a three point shooter!
That shot, with the game on the line is amazing. The guy has ice water in his veins.
Have you ever hit a game winning shot in a basketball game?
No. When I was in high school I took a shot at the end of a game to win, but I missed it.
Heart breaker! What position did you play in basketball.
I was shooting guard.
Were you a good shooter?
Not really. I wasn't a very good dribbler so I couldn't be a point guard. But I also wasn't tall, so I couldn't be a power forward or center.
I played center. I was tall but not very coordinated.
I still like to play basketball. I just don't have as much time.
Same with me. I try to watch the NBA whenever I can though.
I sure hope it is the warriors and cavs in the finals.
