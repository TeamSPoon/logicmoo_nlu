Where do you see the movie industry heading in the next five years?
As far as?
The types of films being made.
Do you mean like documentaries?
Any kind.
I think biopics and reenactment type films will be all the rage,
Some of those movies seem like there is manufactured drama in them.
Of course there will be some stuff added in.
But I want an actual truthful take or film about a real life event.
Maybe some of the stories are too boring
Then dont bother making it a movie.
If they do that Mark Wahlberg might not have any jobs.
Well he acted his way out of stuff after the latest Transformers.
you didnt like it?
Probably my bias for wanting Shia LaBeouf in it
He did a great job as Sam.
Ultimately he should have been brought back
I could see moving on.
Then they should end the franchise.
I believe they are very soon
