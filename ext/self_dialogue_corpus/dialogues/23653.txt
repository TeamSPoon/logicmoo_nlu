There are so many remaking of movies lately.
Yes, its as if they stopped being creative
Or,maybe all the stories have already been told
Perhaps this is true - as we have explored aliens, clowns, purges,and super heroes.
Yes, maybe you are right.
It is all quite entertaining though to see what movie will come out next
Has the Love Boat movie remake come out yet?
I don't think so and that doesn't sound like anything I would want to see
Perhaps there could be a twist on the movie
Like what?
Add snakes or make it more R-rated
Now you are pushing it too far
If we were in the theaters watching snakes and birds attack people, then my idea is not far fetched
Which movie is out like that now?
Alien, Bay Watch, and Wonder Woman area few
Just as stated: remakes and doing it all again
It is entertainment
Yeds, I agree.
Which movie are you going to see.
I will go see Alien - hope its more original
