In Harry Potter, I really like the sport they play.
Quidditch?
Yes! Especially in the first one, did you like it?
When Gryffindor won the House Cup in the first movie. I will never forget how happy they were, even the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws were cheering for them too.
It was really important, it showed that the kids really had some one to cheer for.
Well, Harry was a famous person.
A famous baby. He did not really do anything until he hit school.
But, he was the reason Voldermort was underground, so a legend.
Maybe that is why all the other houses cheered him on.
Or they just really did not like Slytherin.
