What do you think of the Cowboys this year?
Great team as usual
Who is their star quarterback?
Tony Romo is not with them since becoming a free agent
They were trying to keep Kellen Moore as backup I think
Yeah Moore is just a little bit youger !
Maybe he will replace Tony Romo.
We will see.
Did the Cowboys have good stats in 2016
Yes, they have only a few losses
Your right, they lost twice to the Giants and once to the Eagles
That's pretty good, guess Romo gets the work done
Definitely, Dallas lost a really good player
Is he a free agent yet or no ?
Yes, I think he is switching to the Texans
Another Texan team huh?
Yeah. They will be lucky to get him
I think that, he's trying to make up his mind
Interesting to see what happens with that
I think Romo will be with the Texans
