I just watched the movie 'Seven' the other day.
How did you like it?
It was pretty tense and brutal.
I agree with you, but I loved it.
I'm not sure how I feel yet, because I'm still quite shaken by some of the violence in it.
Yes, they really depicted some graphic stuff, and really went for gruesome reality.
I think the plot and story was dependent on being gritty like that.
Yes, because in the end we are supposed to question our society and the nature of ourselves.
Whatever the message was, I thought Morgan Freeman was very good in it.
He was the voice of reason, and his character calmed me down a lot.
