Did you see the move "The Interview?"
No, have you?
Yes!  I loved it!
Isn't that movie only successful because of the controversy surrounding it?
That's what I was expecting which is why I avoided seeing it at first.
But you didn't think that was the case?
Not at all.  It was a hilarious, stand-alone comedy.  It didn't need all the hype.
Who's in that movie again?
Seth Rogen and James Franco.
I know Franco is one of you all-time favorites, but I thought you hated all Rogen films.
I usually do but this movie wasn't "cheesy" like the other films he's in.
Wasn't Franco just in another film that came out more recently?
Yeah, it was called "Why Him."
Have you seen it?
Yes.  I had lower expectations for that one too but it was great.
It wasn't one of those movies where they show all the funny parts in the previews?
No, that's what I was expecting but it was much better than that.
I'll have to check it out.
I ended up buying both of them so you could borrow them if you want.
Cool, thanks!
