Have you seen the movie, Gremlins?
No, why do you ask?
You haven't seen Gremlins?! You would probably love it.
Well, What is it about?
It's about these cute little pets called furbies.
Furbies? So why is the movie called Gremlins?
Well basically, if they drink water or get fed past a certain time, they turn evil.
Evil? Like a rabid animal?
No, evil as in they transform into a miniature demon looking thing.
Wow, sounds kinda scary.
It's actually not too scary its more just cool and unique.
I see, Maybe I'll check it out.
You would really like it, I'm sure.
You think it would be a good movie to watch with the kids?
Well, it depends how old they are.
My youngest is 7 and the other is 10.
I would say they could probably handle watching it with you.
Okay well I'll definitely watch it with them soon then.
I hope they like it!
I'm sure we all will, thanks for the recommendation!
