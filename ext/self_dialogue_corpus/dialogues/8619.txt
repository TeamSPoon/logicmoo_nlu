Do you like newer or older rock bands?
I like some of both.
Me too.
I think I like listening to ACDC the most.
I am a big fan of that band.
Their music is somewhat timeless, they have been rocking forever.
I agree.  It seems like people of all ages like their music.
What is your favorite album?
Back in Black.
That is mine too!
