Why didn't they call that icing?
The team is on penalty.
So icing is permitted.
While they are on penalty.
That is so confusing.
It makes sense though.
Why does it make sense?
You are giving them one tool to fight back.
Why do they need to fight back?
They are short at least one player.
Penalty is over now.
Yes it is. Icing is back.
Why didn't they call that icing then?
There was no icing.
Yes there was!
Well, no one else saw it.
He hit it from way over there.
It has to cross the white line to be icing.
Oh, that is so confusing.
Just enjoy your drink.
