Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy yet?
Not yet, was it any good?
I loved it, especially the parts with groot and rocket racoon.
Okay this sounds awesome can we watch it tonight?
It's a sci-fi superhero movie, these superheroes form to create the Guardians of the Galaxy.
It sounds so epic.
It is and there is a second one now too maybe we can watch that one soon too.
Count me in.
Do you know much about the movie?
No, i've heard some things though.
