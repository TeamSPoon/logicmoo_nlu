I am expecting interesting season regardless who wins or looses.
Who will be the opening start for this game?
I believe the starter will be Mccown this time.
Do you think we will witness any injuries in this game?
I really hope that everyone will stay safe and act emotional.
We want drama free game and not like the one with Pugh and Wilkerson.
Pugh is really good in what he does but he jumps way too fast and too strong.
Do you think I still have a chance in getting a ticket?
I am not sure. You know how many people are expecting this game.
Everyone is anticipating Jenkis game and the final results.
The results will be positive for the team.
