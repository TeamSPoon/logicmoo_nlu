Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
oh yes I did! It was absolutely amazing, and the songs and the special effects were awesome.
Yes, I thought so too! I saw it in the theater when it first came out.
I think I will buy the DVD now that it's out. I really liked the part where Lumiere was singing "Be Our Guest".
Yes! That part of the movie was my absolute favorite also.
Belle's dress was beautiful too. If I ever have a little girl I would totally do a Beauty and the Beast theme nursery.
That would be nice. You could always do a Beauty and the Beast theme wedding?!
Hey good point, I never thought of that. That would make a really nice classy theme, I love everything about that Disney movie.
Okay, well when we meet the man of our dreams, lets have a double wedding. A Beauty and the Beast theme, in front of the Disney Castle.
I'd go for that. Yes I saw they do weddings now in front of the Disney Castle in Florida, and Beauty and the Beast would be a perfect theme!
