Do you think LeBron retires this season?
No way, if he does I would be shocked.
What happens to Cleveland after that?
They suck forever.
Relative to that, do you think Curry ever leaves Golden State?
In today's NBA, you never know
They have so many superstars that could weather it.
Yeah but nothing transcendant like him.
I think Draymond Green could hold a team together.
We havent seen that yet.
Klay Thompson could be huge but he plays a different role.
He is probably the first to leave.
Yeah I cant see him playing second fiddle much longer.
But some players want to just win.
That would be the only argument that would run counter to what you are saying.
I think hes ripe to be a superstar.
He already is.
Yeah what about Kevin Durant.
I dont know about him, he pissed me off by leaving OKC.
Yeah he shouldnt have done that. But he clearly wants to win.
