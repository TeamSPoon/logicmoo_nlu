Do you like Ed Sheeran?
I love him! Shape of You is my favorite song of 2017.
I think he is good, but I still think that John Mayer is much better.
Really? Ed Sheeran is a way better lyricist. Whether it be his more faster tempo songs like Don't or his slower songs like Thinking Out Loud, they are all beautifully written.
I would contend that John Mayer's faster tempo songs like No Such Thing or his slower songs like Daughters are superior to your mentioned Ed Sheeran songs.
Agree to disagree. Maybe it's a generational thing.
I don't know, I really like Shawn Mendes.
I don't. I find songs like Treats You Better to sound way too cliche.
I love the pop guitar influence on that song. Moreover, his slower songs like Mercy are beautiful.
I don't know, I would prefer someone like Nick Jonas to Shawn Mendes.
My problem with Nick Jonas is that aside from Jealous, all of his music is terrible.
Really? You didn't like his song with Tove Lo, Close?
Not at all. I found it way too slow and boring. I do like Tove Lo.
I think Tove Lo is great. Talking Body was the most underrated song of 2015 in my opinion.
That was a good song. However, I'd argue that Ellie Goulding's On My Mind was the most underrated song of 2015.
That song was fun. Did you believe the rumor that the song was about Ed Sheeran?
I've never heard that rumor before. It does sound like a response to Don't now that I think about it, so it's very possible.
Yeah. However, I prefer Ellie Goulding's song with Calvin Harris, Outside.
Also a great song. Calvin Harris is super talented.
Agreed. I also really liked his collaboration with Haim, Pray to God.
