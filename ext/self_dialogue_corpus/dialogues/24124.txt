Did yo ever see the Lion King?
I think so.
It was a great film.
Did you see it in the theater?
I did actually.
Why?
It was all hyped up at the time so I went.
Is it about lions?
Yes, it really is about relationships and lies though.
Oh a disney movie with a background foundation.
The begining is very sad.
Why what happens?
The father is killed in a stampede and the young son is there.
Does he see it?
I do not remember whether he sees him killed or just the after fact.
Are they alone?
The kid blames himself and his uncle lets him.
Ah, the evil uncle.
He has him run off.
Let me guess and steals all the family inheritance?
