What is that movie you're watching with Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock?
"Demolition Man", another of my guilty pleasures. It's so funny!!
It looks pretty seriously violent to me! Who's that as the bad guy?
Wesley Snipes. He's pretty amazing in this, but that's not why I like it.
So tell me why it's funny - does Stallone do comedy?!
Oh, yeah. My favorite bit is, "He doesn't know how to use the shells!"
I don't get it. What's the plot?
This really tough police officer gets frozen to deal with a super-villain in the future. he gets unfrozen when the future society can't deal with the villain, and hilarity ensues.
You still haven't sold it for me. Try again.
Imagine a future society that idolizes things like old commercial jingles, actually playing them on the radio. Rock music has been outlawed, and swearing out loud results in your getting a ticket.
That sounds freaky. What else?
They don't use toilet paper anymore. Instead they use three scallop shells, which they never explain.
This sounds a little juvenile.
Well, it is! That's the charm of it. Stallone's character acts like you and me, expressing his horror at the changes in society which have made people so pliable and innocent that they don't even have real sex anymore.
No sex?1 What do they do?They put on these helmets, and they telepathically have sex.
That reminds me a lot of that Woody Allen movie, "Sleeper".
Well, yes, you're absolutely right. It's "Sleeper" and "Cops" all rolled into one.
I'm not sure I could sit through it, Sandra Bullock as a future cop? That's just creepy.
That's exactly what you're meant to think. But her character really is fun.
Okay, I'll watch it with you. "My baloney has a first name!" now that's funny.
