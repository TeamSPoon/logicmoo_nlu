What are students wearing now when it comes to interviews?
Well, a lot of students go for the typical business suit but are being told they need something to make themselves stand out.
Ah! How are they making themselves stand out?
How are they making themselves stand out and still look professional?
Yes, of course!
They do things like wear a gray suit and match their button up shirt and shoes perfectly. The shoe color is a conversation starter but it doesn't make them stand out in a bad way.
What is something that guys can do specfically?
Guys tend to match their socks to their tie or bow tie. There's a company called Happy Socks that has a variety of socks.
So are socks a conversation starter?
Most definitely! Designed socks are a huge trend. I've seen them at all types of formal events.
What formal events have you seen them at?
Well a big one is weddings. The groom and groomsmen all wear different socks. Sometimes within the wedding color scheme and sometimes something as fun as superheros.
Where else?
Prom. Company formal events. I'm even willing to bet if we checked all the guy's socks on the red carpet we'd find something fun.
That's interesting. So back to interview attire. For the student who doesn't want to wear a suit or can't afford one, how do they stay "in?"
For guys I think a suit is a non-negotiable. It doesn't necessarily have to be a matching suit set though. You can probably get away with something like gray pants, a white shirt, red tie and blue jacket.
If they can't afford a suit how would they get that combination?
Thrifting or borrowing pieces from friends. Thrifting is a HUGE "it" thing right now!
Thrifting? could you tell me more about that?
Well fashion comes in cycles so when something retro is back in what better place to find it than a thrift store? That way you truly have the original style.
