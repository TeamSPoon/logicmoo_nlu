Hey, do you want to go and see that wimpy kid movie with me?
Wimpy kid? Oh you mean Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul?
Yes, it looks like it will be a riot.
I went to see two night ago.
You did? How was it?
This is one of the worst movies of 2017. And it's only May.
That's brutal. What was wrong with it?
It is a less-funny, remake -another one, I mean, of- National Lampoon's Vacation.
National Lampoon's Vacation. Now that is a classic.
Yes it is and this movie is not even in the same ball field.
It seems like  Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul" is the common type of road trip movie, the one where everything that can go wrong does go wrong.
It'll have the grownups asking the kids: "Are we there yet?"
Maybe you were expecting too much from the movie.
I just wanted a good laugh for my money. This movie did not deliver.
I'm sure, Wimpy Kid fans will embrace the movie and its jokes.
You'll never know how good the first three Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies were until you're forced to see the fourth one.
I think the  appeal of a Wimpy Kid movie is in seeing that kid play off against those who aren't so wimpy.
Almost worth it for the "Psycho" shower scene send-up. Almost.
Don't spoil it for me.
You're going to wish I had.
