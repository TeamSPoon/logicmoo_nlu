Are you into movies about space?
You mean like sci fi? Yeah I am.
Whats your favorite sci fi movie?
I would say mine is Interstellar.
I have never seen that, what is it about?
It's about a team of astronauts who try to find a new inhabitable planet for human beings to live on.
Why did they want to find a new planet?
Because earth became so dried up that plants and animals started dying off and food was short.
Wow, that sounds intense.
Yeah, it really is drastic times for earth.
What actor plays the main character?
The main character is played by Matthew McConaughey.
He's a really good actor, I loved him in Wolf of Wallstreet.
Yeah, and there's another good actor in Interstellar.
Well who might that be?
Matt Damon is also in the movie.
Matt Damon? What role does he play?
He plays the role of another astronaut who already left earth years before and is alive on another planet.
Wow, that's pretty crazy to think about.
Yeah it is, and he actually tries to betray the rescue team and he ends up killing himself.
