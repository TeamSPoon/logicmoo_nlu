Yes! Oh my god, the jokes are endless.
The trailers I’ve seen were hilarious!
It will be even funnier when you see the full thing!

Yes, but only a couple of episodes here and there.
Which do you like better, the original television show or the movie?
Of course I have to choose the movie!

The acting and the jokes made the movie great!
Speaking of actors, I heard there were cameos by actors from the original.
Yes there were!

It was David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson.

Not really but the screen time they did have was funny.
I can’t wait to see the movie!
