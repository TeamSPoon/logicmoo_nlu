Hey, girl! I wanted to see if you wanted to go see Matchbox 20 and the Counting Crows in concert with me?
Wow, those are two great band from our younger days! I would love to go, when is it?
They are coming to Nashville on August 12th. I think we should go ahead and get tickets now, so we can get good seats.
Absolutely, how much are the tickets?
Well, depends on how close you want to be. I know I would like to get great seats.
Me too! So, near the stage, how much?
I thought that would be what you wanted too, so I already checked. They will be about 125.00 each, but we will be almost close enough to touch them!
Okay, sounds good to me! Two great bands, so we can't beat it.
What is your favorite song that Matchbox 20 sings? I have a couple.
I love 3 AM, it really brings back memories. But, I also really love If You're gone.
Those are my two top favorites too! I guess they were so popular back in those days.
Yes, but we can go back a little bit in time when we go see them. What about the Counting Crows, do you like them too?
Oh, yes! Not as much as Matchbox 20, but they are pretty close.
I really like their song, A long December. It's one of their best.
It is, but I think Mr. Jones is their best. It is so upbeat and lively.
Oh, you're right! I had forgotten they sang it but it's awesome.
So, you want me to go ahead and grab the tickets while there are still some good seats?
Yes, we better or we will be stuck so far back we won't know who is playing!
Girl, I'm excited, I can't wait for August to get here!
Me either! We can make a day of it, go shopping, eat a nice meal and finish it off with an awesome concert!
