So do you think Denver comes back this year?
Nope. No quarterback worth talking about...
What about Siemien? I thought he was good...
I have no confidence in him man, none at all
Come on man...don't be so negative
Can't help it, passing game was a piece a crap
WOW...coldblooded
They are wasting a good defense with this crap.
I think that Siemian was pretty decent though
It's OK for you think that...I don't
Who is his backup?
Lynch. Even worse...
Oh man, are you negative.
Shrug...if he was any good he'd be starting, right?
Right...
Ok, then.
I still think Denver will be good though
As good as their defense takes them
So wildcard spot, then?
Yep. One and done in the playoffs
