Do you think we need a good sports comedy?
You mean like?
MR 3000 or Little Giants.
Wow those are 2 movies from opposite ends of the spectrum
Mr 3000 wasnt that good.
OK but Little Giants was.
Yeah for kids maybe.
OK, so Major League?
Now that was a great franchise.
I thought it was perfect.
They were but the third one started going off the rails.
I agree with you but that usually happens all the time.
Charlie Sheen was pretty good in them.
So was most of the cast, Tom Berenger included.
I thought Coach Lou was such a likable guy.
The lovable loser plot line they ran worked perfectly for the plot.
I dont think they can do another film like that cause itll always be compared to the original.
Dont do a remake just do a new version.
Thats almost the same thing.
Hollywood loves that formula, dont overthink it.
