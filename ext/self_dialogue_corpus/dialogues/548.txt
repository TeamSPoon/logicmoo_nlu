Who is your favorite NFL \team?
I tend to go for the team who wins.  I used to be a Saints fan but the Seahawks are my number one.
I like the Eagles but, the torture/
Who likes the Eagles dude and why?   Pick a team who wins.
Carson Wentz will win for the Eagles, Count on that.
Well, maybe but to go to a game in Philly only to see the other team win>
The NFL is just another time and patience situation for Philly fans so I know that Howie Roseman gets what he is doing as the GM.
I always wanted to be lucky enough to attend a game in various stadiums, any interest in picking a city or two this season?
Sure but can we avoid the GIants and Cowboys?
Sure, but can we go to the Patriots?  Brady is the man and what an awesome environment is looks like there.
I remember so clearly the year that Brady and the Patriots beat my Seahaws in the Super Bowl.
I actually respect the Patriots and Brady even if they have broken both of our ghearts.
Lets go look online for the NFL schedule.
We could go to a preseason game to start this season off, how about the GIants versus Jets
THe Meadowlands are awesome but you drive.  I think the Jets might be good some year
Todd Bowles is an awesome coach.  Former Temple and Eagles coach.
The Ravens might be good again this season.  Joe Flacco is a guy that most in sports appreciate, not the typical spoiled baby qv.
So Patirots vs Baltimore?
Awesome. I love football and I love the antiction of fall and the sport
Go Patriots!
