I can't wait for the new NFL season
My either, who is your favorite team?
I always grew up watching the Chicago Bears
They are fun to watch and that's a great city, but it seems like they lose a lot.
You are right they do
So why do you like to watch them so much?
I have watched them my entire life so it's a bit of a tradition
That makes you a true fan
What's your favorite team?
I like the miami dolphins
How come you like that team?
I was born in florida and lived there for 20 years
That sounds like paradise
It was, I loved it everyday
Unfortunately the Dolphins have also been no good
Yeah they have a lot of issues including their offense
I'd say their defense and special teams are horrible too
I have to totally agree
I don't see either of our teams winning the superbowl
I agree, we are both losers haha
