Have you been listening to rap music lately?
Yeah I have been listening to Tyga.
What song?
Ice Cream man.
Oh interesting.
Have you heard of it.
Yeah I heard it but I really do not like that song. It isn't my cup of tea.
That is understandable.
The only song I like by him is the one he did with Kylie.
That song is catchy as well.
