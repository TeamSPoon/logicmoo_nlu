Do you like pop music?
Some artist I do.  I am a fan of Ed Sheeren and others
Is that really pop music?
Hell, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
I also like Meghan Trainer, Lady gaga, and Rihanna.
I like them as well.
Meaghan Trainers whole album was awesome.
I downloaded it a few months ago.  Every song sounds good.
That girl can really sing.
You can say that again.  She doesn't need all that auto tune bullshit.
