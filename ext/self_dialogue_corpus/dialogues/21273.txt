Have you seen the new Jurassic Park movie?
The one with Chris Pratt?
Yeah, that one. What did you think of it?
I thought it was great. The CGI in it was awesome.
It was definitely cool to see some Jurassic Park CGI from this era.
Yeah, but I missed some of the cheesiness of the older movies.
The first one is my favorite, so I understand.
That scene with the Jeep and the T-rex is iconic.
Seriously though. I've seen a lot of dissection of it on the Internet.
What was your favorite part of the new movie?
I really liked that the T-rex saved the day.
Yeah, it was cool to see him get in an epic fight with the mutant dinosaur.
It was interesting that they played with the concept of "playing God" like all the other movies do.
I don't know if it was as well done though.
Yeah, I miss the old man in the first movies. He was so misguided but had amazing ideas.
What about the raptor training? That was pretty cool.
Yeah, it was interesting to see Chris Pratt being a raptor trainer.
And they ended up saving the day.
People love the raptors.
They're the best part!
