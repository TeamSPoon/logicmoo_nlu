How Rex Ryan getting the boot again.
Yea,I know.
I think he's done as a head coach.
I do too.
I,always thought he was overrated.
Even as a defensive coordinator?
Yes because he had some players with Baltimore.
I can't argue with that.
So will the Bills be better without him?
I think they have to be.
You mean addition by subtraction?
That's what I mean.
They hired Sean McDermott right?
Yes they did.
He's gets to lead a rebuilding team.
That he does.
I,don't think they're in full rebuild mode.
No not full but close.
Outside of New England the afc east is weak.
Yes,I agree with that.
