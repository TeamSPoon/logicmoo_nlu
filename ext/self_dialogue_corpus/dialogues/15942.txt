Do you like Phil Collins?
I guess I can take him or leave him.
What do you mean by that?
I really liked him when he was with Genesis.
Yea they were good.
He took Peter Gabriel's place right?
Yes he did.
His solo music is ok.
Some of it bland?
I think your right. More pop than rock.
Exactly true. I have to agree.
Outstanding drummer though.
Wow was he ever.
I saw genesis live once.
How were they?
They absolutely rocked.
I'm sure they did.
Phil Collins started out in front singing.
Oh he wasn't on drums?
No,but then after a few songs he jumped on the drums and man did it get loud and,rock!
