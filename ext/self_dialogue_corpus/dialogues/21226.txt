Some of these movies are not even real Disney movies, I don't think.
Why do you say that?
Just because the story lines are lame, and the animation is really bad, it just looks like it was all generated by computers from China or something. And the movements are all choppy.
Where did you buy it? In China? On vacation?
Yes.
Yes. they're fakes.
Oh great.
They do have fantastic rips though. You won't be able to tell the difference between the real dvd and their rips. But they might be hard to find. I dunno.
Whatever, you know what's weird?
What?
Netflix and chill.
Um. Howzat weird?
It's weird because 1. it's become synonymous with "let's hook up". 2. Netflix is Ok with it.
Netflix and chill wasn't, at one point, synonymous with "let's hook up." So when and how it became that way, is that your question?
Yes, and how come netflix is ok with it? they're a streaming platform, and they shouldn't want to be associated with such things.
Well, as they say, there is no such thing as a bad publicity.
I guess not.
As for why it became a booty call, i think it began on twitter. All the twittards were using it and then it just became a thing some time in the last 3, 4 years.
Did you just make up twittards?
What? twitter retards, twittards. It's only apt.
