I am excited about NFL football returning!
I am too, Pre-season is just around the corner.
Who is your favorite team in the NFL.
One of my favorite teams in the NFL is the Denver Bronchos.
They won the super bowl recently didn't they.
Yes, in 2015 the Bronchos won the Super Bowl.
That was a special season wasn't it.
Yes it was, not only was it the first great season since the Elway era, but a legend played his final year.
Manning was the quarterback for the Bronchos then right?
Yes, and Manning mimmiced the great Elway.
How are Manning and Elway similar?
Manning won the super bowl for the Bronchos on his final year of playing in the NFL before he retired.
Did Elway win a superbowl?
Yes, and John Elway won the super bowl in 1998  on his last year of playing as well.
Wow, so Elway and Manning are legends!
Yes, and they both played and won super bowls during their last season with the Bronchos.
Who is the quarterback now for the bronchos?
Who knows who the quarterback will be for the Bronchos this season.
That is interesting, Manning will be difficult to replace.
Yes he will, just look at the Colts and what they have done since he left.
