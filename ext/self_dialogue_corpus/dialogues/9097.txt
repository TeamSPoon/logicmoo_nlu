So, what do you think of David Bowie?
I think he was amazing. Very underrated, in a way.
Underrated? What do you mean?
Well, when Bowie died, there were lots of tributes to him, calling him brilliant and all that.
And I remember thinking "wow, everyone's a huge Bowie fan all of a sudden?"
Yeah, those trendy celebrities. But no, I feel like musically, he contributed a lot.
People might not realize it if they only buy his albums because they're hip and cool.
Yes, Bowie is a case where a compelling image is just the surface.
He went through so many phases and changes, not just in fashion...
Yeah, but in music, too. He truly reinvented himself with each album and was a true original.
