Hi! So I want to see if you could recommend me any good international movies?
Of course there are so many, What genre of movie would you like to see?
I was thinking of comedy, I really want to have a good laugh.
Oh I definitely know which one. You have too see the one called Don´t blame the kid.
Perfect, thank you very much. Do you know where I can rent it or watch it?
I think it might be on Netflix. If not, let me know I have it, you can borrow it.
Thanks!, So I´m curious, what is the movie about?
Oh my gosh, you will laugh from begging to end. This girl gets drunk in a party and accidentally gets pregnant.
Oh that sounds awful, how could it be a comedy?
Believe me, it´s funny the way they put it, the guy is so much younger than she and he falls in love with her.
I´ll give it a try then. Any famous actors on the movie?
Yes, the main character her real name is Karla Souza, I believe she is a famous Mexican actress.
Oh I recognize her name. She is also in the series of How to get away with Murder?
Really? I didn't know, I know she has another good movie called Everybody loves somebody, but I haven´t seen it yet.
That reminds me, there are some good comedies right now on theaters.
Which ones? We should go see them.
The Boss baby, Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
The Boss Baby? Isn't that one like for kids?
It is, but I heard that is still very funny.
Ok we should see it, but also Guardians of the Galaxy 2, because the first one was very funny.
