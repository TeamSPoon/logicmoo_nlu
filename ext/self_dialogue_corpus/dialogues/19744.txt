Can you guess who  I've really grown to like as a singer and musician?
No, who?
Miley Cyrus
You mean that kid who played Hannah Montana?
Well yes, but that was a long time ago. She's come a long way since then.
Wasn't she a judge on The Voice last season?
Right, she was,and that's when I realized how great she was.
What do you mean?
Well, she is a true musician-not just a singer-songwriter. She knows her stuff.
How old is she now?
She's about 24 I think, but wise beyond her years as far as coaching singers and music goes.
I heard her sing Jolene once and it was excellent.
I like her cover of that song. Did you know Dolly Parton is her godmother?
No, talented family.
Do you remember all the grief she was getting for Wrecking Ball?
Oh yeah, like Madonna and Taylor Swift and every other young female singer didn't go through a finding themselves period too
That's what I thought too and I'm glad we were right. She's matured a lot vocally.
I think she can do just about any kind of music now. She's got the chops and the feel and the understanding of music.
That's what I was thinking too and her new song proves it. She's maturing and doesn't need to stay locked into one type of  music.
Do you mean the song Malibu? Love that song. It's different and mature.
