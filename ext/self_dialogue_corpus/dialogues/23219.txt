Did you ever take your kids to see the Lego Batman movie?
I took my toddler to see the most recent one in the theaters.
I thought it was okay. Not as good as I had hoped.
Maybe so, but you have to remember it was made for kids though.
You're right. I like the concept of Lego movies though.
Yes they're pretty cute.
I agree. Especially Robin.
I thought he was cute but I didn't like the design of his eyes.
I agree. Maybe they were trying to make him look younger.
Probably, they were trying to make him look more like an orphan that Batman rescued.
Yes that was pretty cute.
Yes. I think they did a good job with the Joker lego man.
Yes and the other villians too.
I liked the Harley Quinn character.
Yes her and the Joker always work well together.
Evil partners in crime.
What did you think of Alfred?
I think they did a good job with the lego version.
I love his character.
I would watch it again probably.
