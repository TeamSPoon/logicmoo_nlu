I like a few songs by the Weeknd, do you know who that is?
I think so, doesn't he have kind of weird hair.
Yes he does! Looks like dreads but standing up.
Oh okay then yes I know that guy. Pretty good music!
I kind of like the song "Starboy."
I really like that one too! Too much cursing so I can't listen to it around my kids though.
Yea you're right. It was a great song though.
He has a very good voice, I enjoy it.
I really do also!
I would say the Weeknd's music is a top fave.
