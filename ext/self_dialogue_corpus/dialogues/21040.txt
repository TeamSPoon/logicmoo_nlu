I can't wait to see Thor: Ragnarok when it hits theaters.
It does look good.
In Marvel Studiosâ€™ Thor: Ragnarok, Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe.
Without his Mighty Hammer, right?
Of course. How else can they imprison the thunder god?
Of course.
He finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok.
What's Ragnarok?
The destruction of his home world and the end of Asgardian civilization.
Isn't some female behind that?
Yeah, the ruthless Hela.
She is supposed to be an all-powerful new threat.
I saw in the promos she destroys his hammer.
She crushed it with one hand.
And only Thor is supposed to be able to wield that thing.
Yep. She has got to be a force to be dealt with.
You see how Thor has to survive a gladiator contest.
That part looks like it will be good.
He's got to fight against The Hulk. Who do you think will win?
I'm routing for The Hulk but you know this is a Thor movie.
