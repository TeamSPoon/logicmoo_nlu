What do football players do after they finish their career?
Some go into business.
I've seen others announcing.
They have to have something planned, because average careers aren't often long.
Yeah, even someone with a great career in football is done by age 40 at the latest.
A kicker might stay longer, but most are finished by 40.
Wow, you really have to plan for the rest of your life.
Well, they have some money if they make it that far.
Some do, some spend it.
You have to plan no matter what career you choose.
You never know in life where it will take you.
That's for sure.
I've heard of some players opening restaurants.
Wow, that's quite a change.
Some go into coaching or general management.
I bet they make excellent coaches.
I'm sure with all that experience and talent they can mentor a lot of people.
That's true.
Sometimes players form a foundation or charity for a special cause.
I think that is incredible.
