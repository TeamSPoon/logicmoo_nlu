What's your favorite genre of music?
I would have to say soul or funk.
Ah really, people are still making that kind of music?
Yes, I would say it's just as strong and alive as ever.
Incredible!  What bands should I start with?
Well, a great place to dive in would be Soulive.
Soulive, eh?  What's that about?
It's a well assembled group of top-shelf soulful musicians.
What kind of instrumentation?
There's two guitars of course, a bass, a keyboardist and brass.
That's a lot of action on stage.
Yeah, and they have guests that are featured all of the time.
Guest musicians?
They feature vocalists, additional brass and much more.
How's the vibe of the show?
At points, it is sweet and soulful.  But for the most part, it's a party.
A party eh?  Like super wild?
It's wild but refined.  Check out Bowlive videos to dive in.
Bowlive?  Now what the heck it that?
It's Soulive at the Brooklyn Bowl.  It's an annual 8 day residency.
