Do you remember 80's movies?
I sure do, back when movies were great.
I was thinking about short circuit the other day.
Oh man I loved short circuit, that robot was adorable!
Yea, did you know that the indian guy in short circuit was actually white?
No way! I had no idea. I was paying too much attention to how funny Steve Guttenburg was.
Yea that guy was hilarious, I wonder what happened to him?
Well, he made a lot of money back then, he's probably just retired.
Yea that's true, he did all the Police Academy movies, after all.
Yea, and Three Men and a Baby.
I feel like he was in a lot of other ones, but I can't quite remember.
Me neither. I do remember that movie Flight of the Navigator though.
Yea that was another classic. I miss adventure movies like that.
Yea I used to wish I was the kid in that movie.
I used to wish I was the kid from Never Ending Story.
I did the same, I would wait for it to rain outside so that I could get an apple and read a book in our attic.
They'll never make a movie like that again.
No, today they'd be in side a virtual world killing zombies.
I guess with technology comes different kinds of story telling.
Yea movies have changed forever.
