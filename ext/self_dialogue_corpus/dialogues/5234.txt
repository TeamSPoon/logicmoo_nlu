I showed my daughter The Little Mermaid for the first time!
Cute, did she like it?
Yeah, she was singing by the end of it!
I loved singing "A Whole New World" when I was little!
Same, it was my favorite movie.
My mom thought that I would burn out the vhs tape watching it so often!
I loved Prince Eric, but was super scared of Ursula.
My daughter was when she watched it too!
It's so cool to have them watch the movies we did when we were younger.
Disney movies never get old!
