Do you like 90's music?
It's what I grew up on so I like it. Mostly 90's pop.
Me too. Who is your favorite boy band?
Definitly NSync. You?
I liked 98 degrees better but Nsync was good too.
Do either of them still tour together?
Probably not NSync, Justin Timberlake is pretty big on his own.
That's true. I think Nick Lachey is still doing something in entertainment too.
I still listen to them both on Google Music from time to time.
It makes me nostalgic so I can only listen to it when I want to feel that way.
Did you like Backstreet boys?
They were alright. I think I danced to a Backstreet boys song for a talent show once.
They had a lot of good beats.
I agree, their songs were catchy.
If they were to go on tour now I might even get a ticket.
Me too, it would be fun to relive childhood for a night.
If only it could take us back to childhood!
Music can do a lot but it can't do that.
Yes, but at least we can fantasize while listening to boy bands.
Yes.
