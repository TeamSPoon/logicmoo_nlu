She did all her new songs off of her album and alot of songs, she even had jayz come out to perform with her
Thats great! Im not really a fan of rap music, but i do like some of kayne west songs

My favorite song was his workout song, i used to play that all the time at the gym as motivation
Thats funny! Another artist i really like is rihanna

Yes i love every album she has i can listen to each song on repeat
Yes she is really a great performer not so much singer but i still love her music
