I tried watching Star Trek Beyond the other day.
And?
I wasn't able to finish it
Really? How come?
I don't know. The story line wasn't really good and I couldn't get into it.
That's too bad. I thought it was pretty good.
A bit too far fetched for me.
Well it is a sci fi movie.
Yeah, but for some reason I enjoyed the other ones more.
Oh the ones that came out before this one?
Yeah, they had better writing and/or directing.
Yes, I agree
I really liked the first reboot one.
Yeah, that was pretty good.
Nice and fresh and fun.
Yeah, they did a really good job with that one.
Wasn't it JJ Abrams that did that?
Yes, I believe you're correct
Generally I like JJ Abrams work
Yeah, me too.
