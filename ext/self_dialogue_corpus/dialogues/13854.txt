Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
She is alright I think.
Do you like any of her songs?
I like the one called Alejandro, do you?
I do. And Bad Romance too.
I have heard some of her older stuff, like Telphone.
That was on The Fame Monster Album.
I think she was better then.
I think she is better now, she has grown a lot.
Her older stuff was better for dancing.
