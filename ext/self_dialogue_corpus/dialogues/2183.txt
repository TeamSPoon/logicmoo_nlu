Do you like football?
Kind of, but I'm more of a basketball fan.
Oh ok. My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys
Do you watch the games every season?
Yes I do, buy the gear and everything.
Oh that's cool. I guess I like the Pittsburgh Steelers the best.
Oh that's one of our rivals!
I know. Do you like football movies?
I like Remember the Titans.
I like The Replacements.
Oh yeah that's a funny movie.
What other football related things do you like to do?
I'm in a fantasy football league.
Oh really? Do you win money with that?
No it's more like bragging rights.
Oh ok so do you ever win?
I won a lot this past year. I was pretty lucky.
Oh that's cool. My brother played high school football. He was an all star.
Oh that's great, I played too.
I bet you miss it.
