Did you see Pirates of the Carribean?
Yes that movie was awesome all around.
Orlando Bloom played a good hero.
And of course Geoffrey Rush was good as Captain Barbosa.
But Johnny Depp stole the show.
Captain Jack Sparrow cracked me up.
He sure liked his rum.
I thought the monkey was funny too.
Of course, we will remember this as the time we almost caught...
Captain Jack Sparrow.
