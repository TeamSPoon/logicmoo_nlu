So what do you think about the Cleveland Browns this year?
I think they will be improved this year.
I think so too! I think their defense will be much improved.
Yah, especially since they did so well drafting some good defensive players.
I thin they will be improved offensively as well.
Well, that can't be much worse than last year.
Haha, you got that right. Maybe they will even finish with more than 4 wins this year.
We'll see. Who else do you think will be improved this year?
Well I would have to say the Cowboys will be even better again this year.
I thought for sure they would be in the Superbowl last year.
Perhaps this will be the year for that.
Especially since those good rookies from last year have a year under their belt.
I think it may help them to get a better coach soon.
Agreed, their coach is decent, but man he never wins in the playoffs.
Any idea who you think will win the Superbowl this year.
Just like every year I would have to go with the Patriots.
Until they lose Tom Brady you almost have to favor them.
For sure! He is probably the best quarterback ever.
My guess is Patriots over the Cowboys this year
That is a pretty good guess in my opinion.
