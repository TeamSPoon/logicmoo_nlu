Have you seen Katy Perry's new hairstyle?
Yes! She looks so different from when she first started her career.
I know. It doesn't even look like her.
I will always remember Katy Perry for how she looked in her California Gurls music video.
Oh yeah. She was so pretty in that video and that song is so catchy.
My favorite song by her is probably Firework.
Firework is really catchy, too. I like some of her lesser known songs like Pearl and Circle the Drain.
Sometimes it seems like the best songs that artists have are the less popular ones.
I agree. Kesha has such a beautiful voice, but I don't like any of her songs that always play on the radio.
I haven't listened to Kesha much. I'll have to check out some of her songs.
