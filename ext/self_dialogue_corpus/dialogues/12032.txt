How much do you think luke skywalker will be in the new star wars movie?
I hope a lot. I love seeing the original characters back.
He was looking pretty rough and old.
I wonder how much that is the character choice and how much is due to mark hamil not aging well.
Probably a mix. But it makes sense for the character to look haggard.
I suppose it would make sense. Do you think the last jedi refers to rae or him being the last?
I have been pondering the same question. It really could be either of them.
I am looking forward to finding out. I also wonder what they will do about carrie fischer.
Ya her passing away was so sad. Too young for sure.
Yes too young, the world still needed princess lea but at least we had her at all. No other actress would have done it so well.
