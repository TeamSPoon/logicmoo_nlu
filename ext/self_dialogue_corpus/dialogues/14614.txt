James Harden has disappointed me this playoffs.
I could see that.
I was hoping the Rockets would roll on to the Western Conference Finals behind him.
Yeah it would have been really fun to watch.
The problem is I think he finally got tired.
It sure looks that way.
I can't really blame him though.
Yeah his usage is through the roof.
Only Westbrook makes him look like he is underutilized.
Yeah and that man is a psycho.
Yeah a psycho I do not enjoy watching play.
Yeah his game is too him-centric for me.
Me too.
At least with Harden he is getting others involved.
Yeah his assist numbers don't even adequately show how much he helps that offense.
Yeah he is the spoon that stirs the drink for that team.
Yeah which is why I think it is disappointing that he isnt shining more.
Yeah plus everyone is ready to jump all over him when the team struggles.
Yeah hopefully they turn it around.
Yeah lets hope so.
