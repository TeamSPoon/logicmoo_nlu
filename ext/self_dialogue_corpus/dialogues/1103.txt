So, have you done anything fun in the past few months?
Not really, although this past November I went to a New York Jets game finally.
Cool! Was that the first one that you have went to before?
It sure was; living so far away from there makes it really difficult to go to the games in person.
I am sure your work schedule makes it tough as well, right?
No doubt about it, I am a true fan though, so I always make time to watch their games on television.
What do you think their chances are for this upcoming season?
I am really excited with the direction the Jets are headed right now actually.
That is a different tone than most Jet fans that I talk to. I am impressed!
Well I think the coaching staff has been vastly improved over what it used to be.
Does that mean that you were not a fan of Rex Ryan?
Not really; I thought he should have done a lot better than what he did.
He did take them to two straight AFC championship games in a row with Mark Sanchez.
I know, but it was all down hill from there. Let's just say, I was glad when he was let go.
How do you feel about Todd Bowles?
Well he got off to a great start, winning ten games in his first season.  The next year was not so great though.
Are you still optimistic about him?
I really am! I feel that he will have a great season this upcoming year. Plus, we have a new offensive coordinator that I am excited about.
I did not know that, who is the new coordinator?
His name is John Morton and I think he will be really successful.
