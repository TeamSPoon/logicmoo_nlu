I hope the Bears win this year.
So do I, but I think this year is going to be a rebuilding year.
We've got the best team in the country!
I wish that was true, but if you really look at the team, you know that's not true.
How can you say that.
Tom Brady is a powerhouse all by himself, and no team has a chance against that.
Yeah, but da Bears!
Haven't been a winning team since the 1970's/
Last year we almost made it to the playoffs.
AS a wild card.
Yeah, but we have the biggest and the best fans in the country.
Biggest maybe, but fans don't make the team.
I guess you're right.
Maybe we'll make it to the playoffs this year.
Your really think so?
No, but I hope we do.
So who do you think is going to win.
Either the Seahawks or the Patriots.
I'd really hate to see Tom Brady win again.
He is getting old.
