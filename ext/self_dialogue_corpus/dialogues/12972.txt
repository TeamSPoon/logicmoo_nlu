Okay, so, Star Wars or Star Trek?
Star Wars. I just couldn't get into the original Star Trek.
Why not?
The special effects were terrible, for one. The plots seemed kind of silly, too.
Yeah, but it was all about science and discovery and exploring issues of ethics.
That's another thing, they kept "dropping anvils", telling people what to think.
Some anvils still need to be dropped. Anyway, how aren't there any lessons to be learned from Star Wars?
Star Wars is your basic good versus evil. Simple as.
Or is it? Think about it.
Whatever!
