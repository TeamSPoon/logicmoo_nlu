Do you know of any good movies coming out soon?
I really want to see Sofia Coppola's new movie.
I don't think I've heard of that. What is it called?
It's called The Beguiled.
Who's in it?
Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Farrell are the main stars.
Oh, neat. What is it about?
It's a civil war drama.
Do you know if it's gotten good reviews?
I think they've been pretty good. Sofia won an award for Best Director for it at Cannes this year.
Cool. I feel like her films can be sort of hit or miss, but I think I'll give this film a try.
It's also interesting because apparently Colin Farrell is the only male actor in the film really.
Oh that is interesting. I love how Sofia's films always have such strong and prominent roles for women.
Me too. It's way too rare in Hollywood to have films with good female characters.
How many times have she and Kirsten Dunst worked together now?
That's a good question. I'm not really sure.
They also worked together on The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette so at least three times now.
They make a really good team.
I agree. Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning are wonderful as well.
Yeah, it should be a really great film I think.
