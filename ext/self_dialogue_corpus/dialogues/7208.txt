Snow White always used to freak me out as a kid.
Why's that, it's one of my favorites.
Well the scene where the Huntsman attempts to kill her is disturbing.
Oh very true, the animation was very fluid and realistic.
Yup that's what would do me in, it was a really tense scene for a kid.
I thought for sure you were going to say the dwarves scared you.
Oh they did, I can't leave them out.
But they're all so adorable.
Not really, a bunch of little men living in the woods like that give me the willies.
You're something else my friend.
