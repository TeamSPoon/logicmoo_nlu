Do you like Beach Boys music?
Oh, my gosh, yes. I used to listen to them all the time.
Yeah, they were my favorite group when I was growing up.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
Many times! I loved how the fans hit around beach balls before the concert started.
Oh, that's cool.
What is your favorite song?
Oh, probably  Surfin' USA. I used to pretend to surf, ha ha.
I used to listen to In My Room over and over and over.
I also like California Girls and Fun, Fun, Fun.
Yeah, and Kokomo and Good Vibrations. There are so many...
Is Brian still touring with the group?
No, I don't think so. He's been working on his own music for years. I think he's put out several albums.
Didn't he have some psychological problems?
To put it mildly...I think he had a complete mental breakdown and was in therapy for years.
Oh, I almost forgot! I saw them in D.C. at the Washington Monument one July 4th.
How was that?
Crowded!! But the music was great, and the fireworks were spectacular.
I'd love to listen to Surfer Girl right now...
I could go for Help Me, Rhonda.
