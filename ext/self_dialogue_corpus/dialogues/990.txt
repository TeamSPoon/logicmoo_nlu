Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
What team are you cheering for.
I'm hoping hte Bears can improve.
Me too, but they probably won't do much without Manning.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
That's an away game.
Yeah, it is. However, Manning doesn't falter at home or away.
Who's starting while Mannings out?
I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
How long as their current coach been in Chicago.
He started in 2011.
I think he's doing alright, but the Bears are quick to get rid of coaches.
All of the NFL is quick to get rid of coaches.
Yeah, that's true. However, five years is a record for a Bears coach.
They aren't as bad as the Rams.
What did the Rams have three coaches in five years.
The Rams had four coaches in five seasons.
That sounds about right.
