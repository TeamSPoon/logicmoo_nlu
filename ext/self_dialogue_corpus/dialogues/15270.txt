Have you heard of Cloakroom?
I haven't. What music do they play?
They sound like atmospheric sludge.
Woah. Sounds interesting.
They're awesome. They have a new album coming out in August.
Is it online yet?
Yeah, they just released a music video for it on YouTube.
I'll have to go check it out. How many albums do they have?
Two so far. They're both on Spotify.
Awesome. I need to listen to them.
Tell me what you think. Do you like that sort of genre?
I don't know if I've heard of that.
It's kind of like post rock with a touch of drone.
Is it slow?
It's actually pretty progressive.
Like prog-rock?
Sort of. Maybe prog-rock stoner metal.
This all sounds very interesting.
It is. Spotify has a huge selection of it.
I know what I'll be doing with the rest of my day.
