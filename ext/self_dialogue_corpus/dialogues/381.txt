What did you think of the Watchmen?
The weird take on superhero movie? With the blue mind guy?
Yes, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan.
I think it did a good job of showing another side to the DC and Marvel counterparts.
I think the film really showed another side to genre, that not all heroes are super or even always heroes.
I think it made just enough fun of people like Batman, that it made the characters seem real.
It really opened a lot up. A very gritty and almost fourth wall breaking film.
Sort of like how Deadpool breaks the fourthwall.
Not so much, but yes. Something that left me thinking.
I liked how the ending was left open, there was no real closure to see what happen to bird man.
