Are you a John mellencamp fan?
Yes I am.
He's got a new album out.
I heard he did.
It's called sad clowns and hillbillies.
Oh,it's country?
Country flavor maybe.
Any good songs?
Grand view.
That's the nam?
Yes it is.
I'll check it out.
Carlene carter did the album with him.
That's pretty cool.
She sings on a lot of the songs.
Didn't she tour with him before.
I believe she did last year.
That's what I thought.
I guess musically they hit it off.
Good to hear him do new music.
