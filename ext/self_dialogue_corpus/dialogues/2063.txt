the eagles fell apart last season.
what you mean?
i think them dudes was like 5-0 when they played the packers last season.
naw i don't think so.
what you mean?
they played the packers the eleventh game of the season.
wow, i was way off.
they still fell apart though.
yeah, they actually started off 3-0 and was 5-5 when they played the packers.
and then the packers went bonkers.
what you mean?
after the packers beat philly, they didn't lose again until in the playoffs.
that's right. who did they lose to in the playoffs?
the falcons.
yeah that's right. i think the packers might do something this season.
well every season they have rogers they have a chance.
i know that's right.
