Do you think the Seahawks will make a run this year.
They always find ways to win games.
Yes they do.
Their offensive line could have used a little help in the offseason.
Yes,they are a little thin on the line.
Interesting to,see,if Eddie lacy will stay in shape.
I think his contract is loaded with reasons for him to slow down eating.
Haha,that was smart on Seattles part.
Russell Wilson could be entering his prime.
They need to keep Richard sherman motivated.
Yes they do.
Hard to believe they need to be motivated.
They get paid enough.
That's for sure.
They are tough to beat at home.
The hometown fans are something.
I think their defense will be good enough again.
I agree with you.
I'm not a Pete Carroll fan though.
No,but he motivates.
