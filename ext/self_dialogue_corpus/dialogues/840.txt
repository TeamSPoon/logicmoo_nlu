Hey how do you think the Seahawks will do this season?
I don't know man, their team is seeming weaker than in seasons past.
Yeah, I agree.
They didn't really seem like they picked anyone up from free agency in the off-season.
Yeah their draft didn't seem very strong either.
Who knows though, they've made some good picks in past drafts.
Yeah, Russell Wilson turned out pretty well, and he wasn't drafted until the later rounds.
I just wonder if they'll ever be able to overcome that devastating loss in the super bowl a few seasons back.
The one where they threw the pick on the goal line?
Yep, against the New England Patriots.
Yeah, that was such a stupid play call.
No doubt. Why would you throw the ball when you still have a time out, and its only second down?
Yeah, and you have Beast Mode in the backfield. Ridiculous.
They should have won that game. All they had to do was hand the ball off.
Yeah, even if he doesn't make it in, you still have the time out, and 3rd and 4th down to try again.
Yeah, I can't believe all the people trying to say that was the right call to throw it there.
Oh well, I guess the Patriots just have a knack for getting gifted super bowls, the same thing happened this year too!
Yeah I saw that, what a pathetic choke job by the Falcons.
Yeah, all they had to do was run some clock and kick a field goal to put the game away.
Man, I hate the Patriots and Tom Brady.
