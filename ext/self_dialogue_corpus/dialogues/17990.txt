What does music mean to you?
That is a tough question.
Why do you think that?
Because music is exceptionally hard to describe.
No it is easy. Music is a sound that produces harmony.
At it's basic levels yes that is exactly what it is.
But you see more?
Absolutely! Music is an emotion, a heartbeat, a sensation. Music, although not flesh and blood, lives, breaths and has life.
I can see where music can make you feel something but what do you mean that it has life?
Have you ever listened to a song that made you happy or sad, laugh or cry?
I have had a song that made me happy but laugh no I don't think so?
So you didn't find "Grandma got run over by a reindeer" funny?
Ok I will give you that one... it is pretty funny.
Think about the songs that make your feet tap or the ones you find yourself singing or humming in you mind.
Ok there are quite a few that effect me like that.
Those are emotions, sensations. Have you ever heard a song that touched you to the point where you cried or at the very least teared up?
I can't think of one off hand.
Well when you find one that when you listen to it the emotions will come to the surface like a bold powerful wave.
I am going to start paying more attention.
Don't just listen to the sounds but listen to the words, the tone of the singer's voice, the way the words ebb and flow and see how you feel.
