Is Pixar still working with Disney? I haven't seen much from them in a while.
They're doing Cars 3, they're still together.
They're still on that?
Yep.
They also did Coco.
What's Coco?
The one about the Mexican kid and the guitar.
You mean the one with the kids who grow up and become romantic rivals and something about the Day of the Dead?
No, you're thinking of Book of Life. That wasn't Disney.
Ah, right.
