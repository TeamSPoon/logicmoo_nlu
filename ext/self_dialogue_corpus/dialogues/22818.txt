If you had to pick a movie that you did not mind watching again and again what would that be?
That's an interesting question because I don't really like to rewatch movies too often.
I do on occasion, depends on the movie.
I would have to agree with you there.
So what do you think?
I'm going to have to say "Get Out."
That was such a crazy movie!
I watched it with my husband and then with family.
Were you confused at all?
A little bit the first time I watched it.
Me too but it didn't take too long to catch on.
I really thought that the girlfriend was not in on it.
I didn't either! I thought her family forced her to be apart of their scheme.
The grandma and grandpa threw me for a loop towards the end.
I know that was really crazy!
He shouldn't have stopped the car.
No way. He could have escaped a lot easier.
Thankfully his friend came to help him.
I know. I was afraid it was the cops.
I was relieved it wasn't.
