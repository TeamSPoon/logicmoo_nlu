Did you see the reboot of the Mummy?
Tom Cruse's new movie?
Yes that one. The start of the Dark universe.
No I haven't. Was it any good?
Overall?.....No. It was not good at all.
What was wrong with it?
The story itself was very weak. Poorly developed.
Really? What about the acting?
Tom Cruse except for a few movies is the same in everything he does. No different here. Russell Crow though was as good as always.
I didn't know he was in it.
Yeah. And I wish they would have focused more on him. I think the other movies if they ever get done will have more of him.
What about the effects? Trailers made those look pretty good.
Some were. Some weren't. There was nothing that really blowed me away. It is stuff you have basically seen before.
What about the Mummy?
She looked pretty cool and I like the actress who played her. But like Crow I felt they didn't use her enough.
Wow for a movie called the Mummy you think they would have.
And maybe they did. They just didn't do it right. There were moments.
So should I see it or not?
If you really want to see it on the big screen then go ahead but catch a cheap showing. Otherwise wait.
Cool! Thanks.
