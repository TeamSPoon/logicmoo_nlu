Tom Brady's had several concussions, do you think he's still going to be any good?
I don't think he'll have any effects from the concussions, but he is getting old.
Think he should throw in the towel and retire?
No, not after he just won one of the most amazing Super Bowl comebacks ever.
It was a pretty impressive comeback. I felt bad for the Falcons.
Yeah, I felt sorry for Matt Ryan. He seems like a good guy.
What about Matt Stafford? Is he ever going to do anything with the Lions?
I don't know, the Lions need another receiver like Megatron.
Who is Megatron?  Must be a nickname.
Calvin Johnson, one of the best wide receivers ever.
Okay, I remember him. Didn't he retire early?
Kind of early, but he was having a lot of trouble with his knees.
I can't imagine playing in the cold weather is very easy on somebody with bad knees.
I wonder if that's why Barry Sanders retired from the Lions so early.
I don't know, I bet either one of them would have stuck it out for another year if they thought the Lions had a chance of winning a Super Bowl.
I've seen some pretty cold games between the Packers and the Bears. They've been to a few super Bowls.
I think the Bears have only won one Super Bowl. 1985, and that had more to do with their defense.
I imagine cold-weather teams are better off with a good defense. It must be hard to catch a ball when your fingers are cold.
Probably true. I wonder why Green Bay has never built an indoor stadium.
Probably because of the mystique surrounding Lambeau Field. A new stadium wouldn't have the same appeal.
