Did you see the movie Hardcore Henry?
No, what is a like?
It's a POV action film about the charcter of Henry.
SO, what is going on.
Well, Henry wakes up in a lab, having be revived with cybernetic parts after being brutally killed.
Okay, kind of inspired by Universal Solider.
Maybe a little, but the chief scientist is Estelle, a woman who claims she is Henry's wife.
Hot?
Very, but before she finish things, such as restoring Henry's voice, it all goes wrong.
In what way?
The lab is invaded by Akan, owner of the comapny Estelle works for and who wants her technology to build an army.
Akan, weird sounding name.
Well, he's Russian, but his name not the only odd thing about him. He has telekinetic powers and can move things with his mind.
Move things with his mind.
Yep, he levitates one of the lab worker and guts him with a butterfly knife.
Ouch! SO what does Henry do?
He and Estelle escape the lab, but she is capture by Akan's mercs and Henry is beat up and thrown off an overpass. There he meets a guy named Jimmy who helps him.
So, Henry goes after Akan to get Estelle back.
Yeah, with plenty of violence, gratitious nudity, and plot twists to boot.
All right, sopund like my kind of movie. I will definitely watch this film.
