I'm really excited for the concerts at Fenway this year.
I know it's fun to go there and watch a show.
Will you be seeing anybody there this summer?
I'm headed to the Jimmy Buffet show.
I really like Jimmy Buffett he is a great entertainer.
I do too and I end up knowing all of the songs.
Margaritaville is his most popular song, but I like some of the less popular ones.
I agree I like Changes in Latitude.
His music makes me want to be on vacation.
I know I just want to go to an island when I hear his music.
Also at his concerts you see some great outfits.
I know everybody gets really creative with their get ups.
I also like the song He Went to Paris.
I don't think I've ever heard that one.
You should download it, it's very different for him.
I will check it out.
I may have an extra ticket, if so you are welcome to join me.
That would be great thanks.
I'm also trying to get Springsteen tickets at Fenway.
That would be a great show, I"m sure they are super expensive.
