Who is your team?
Miami Dolphins, unfortunately
Why do you say that?
Ryan Tannehill. Tired of waiting for him
He doesn't have anybody to throw to. Landry only had 4 tds last year
But didn't they beat Pittsburgh last year?
Yeah, but the Steeler mopped them in the playoffs
Yeah, I remember that. It was awful
Yup I turned it off in the first quarter
It shuold have been worse.
It would have if Pittsburgh hadn't took it's foot off the gas
Yeah...let's not talk about that game anymore
They won ten games last year...
That's about three games more than they should have won last year
Maybe, but they did win..
Defense got some help
What do you mean?
Harris and McMillan  as linebacker
The definitely need some help there
They need help everywhere
