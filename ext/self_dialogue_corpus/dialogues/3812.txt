Have you seen the Prestige?
Yeah, awesome movie.  Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were awesome.
Yeah, kept you guessing the whole time.
I know, turns out it was just a trick from Bale's character.
But Hugh Jackman took it so far and did strange things.
Yeah, and the clues of course were always there.
Yeah, just like you see at the end.
I also liked how they had that long standing rivalry.
Yeah, and how they talked about the importance of showmanship.
Yeah, that was pretty cool.  I wish I knew some good magic tricks.
