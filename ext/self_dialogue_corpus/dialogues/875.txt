Which NFL team do you like to root for, despite not needing to?
Not needing to?
You know, like not rooting for a regional team, or someone you grew up a fan of, or someone you know.
Oh, like rooting for the Giants like you do, despite being from Chicago.
Right.
You're silly. And, probably the Packers.
Why them?
They have an insanely-long waiting list for season tickets, meaning every game is a sellout.
Right, that's true.
But the best part is the city.
How so?
Green Bay is tiny, especially compared to other football cities.
Isn't it the smallest?
Yup, by far.
Right, I forgot.
So they have the best fans, I think, due to population and attendance.
Does it matter that they've been winning recently?
Nope, I always admired their fan base.
Big fan of Aaron Rogers?
You know it. Great guy.
