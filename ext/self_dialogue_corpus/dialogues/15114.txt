What are your thoughts on Old School?
Classic!  I liked Will Ferrell in it so much
One of his best movies!  And an early apperance by the guy who plays Howard on the Big Bang Theory.
I like Luke Wilson in it too.
One of his rare moments of being funny.
I am so glad they didn't make a sequel.
I agree.  Bad sequels are the worst.
Oh, and Vince Vaughn is great in that movie.
Yeah, an early gem for him.
One of my favorite actors.
