Do you listen to Nirvana much?
I love NIrvana!
Me too! The song Smells Like Teen Spirit is awesome.
I hear it a lot on the radio.
Yeah it can be overplayed sometimes.
Have you heard their cover of Lake of Fire?
That one is really well done.
You can hear the amount of soul in Kurts voice.
Did you like Courtney Love much?
I thought she was okay.
I thought it was strange how they were together.
They seemed to be really in love.
It still sucks that Kurt died.
It does. He would have been such a great musician.
He already was a great musician.
I can agree with that.
What do you think he would be doing now?
Probably still playing and there would be no Food Fighters.
That's right! Dane Grohl would probably still be with Nirvana.
No doubt about it.
