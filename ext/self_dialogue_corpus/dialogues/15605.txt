What is your favorite genre of music?
I have two. It is a tie between country and hip-hop.
Wow! Those two types of music are so drastically different from one another.
I know they are but sometimes I am just in the mood for different things.
I get that. When I am in the car I like to listen to slower songs and relaxing songs.
I am the same way.
So when do you listen to country music?
I like to listen to country music when I am having people over and we are just grilling in the back yard.
Ok. When do you like to listen to hip-hop music?
Mostly when I am out with friends at a bar or a club. Hip-hop music gets me in the mood to dance.
I love to dance to hip-hop. What about rap?
I like rap but don't listen to it that much.
Why not?
Because I cannot understand what they are saying most of the time.
Yeah. Sometimes it is very hard to understand rap music.
Same goes for heavy metal music. I can never understand what they are saying.
True! They scream so loud in their songs it gives me a headache.
Oh me too. I think I hate heavy metal music more than any other genre.
Me too. I don't know one heavy metal bad because I never listen to it.
I know of the band Metallica but I never listen to them.
