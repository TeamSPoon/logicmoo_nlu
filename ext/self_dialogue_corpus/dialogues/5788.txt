Which is your favorite Disney Movie?
It´s called a Goffy Movie.
Really? I have not heard about it. What is is about?
It´s about Goofy´s son in his teen years.
Oh wow! That sounds interesting. What happens in the movie.
He falls in love and is trying to impress a girl.
Why is it called a Goofy Movie?
Because Goofy is still Goofy and he sometimes messes his son life.
But does it have a happy ending?
It does! I recommend it, it has a touchy moment with his dad and he gets the girl.
