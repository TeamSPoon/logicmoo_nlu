How did you like the last Superbowl?
Not crazy about it as I am not a Patriot fan.
You have to admit it was exciting right?
Absolutely but, the wrong team won.
Why do you say that?
Brady is a cry baby and Belecheck is a cheater.
What two teams do you think are the best franchises in the NFL?
I would say Green Bay and Pittsburg.
Why do you pick so two?
They have been around for many, many years and are steeped in tradition.
Which one of the two is your favorite?
Green Bay.
Why did you pick Green Bay?
I am from Wisconsin and have been following them for many, many years.
How do you think they will do this year?
If Rodgers stays healthy, I would guess 12-4 and a deep run in the playoffs.
Who is the most famous Green Bay Packer.
I would say Bart Starr.
Why Bart Starr?
Because of the touchdown he scored in the "ice bowl" to beat Dallas.
