What do you think will happen in episode eight?
I know the Kylo Ren is coming back.
Is general Leia going to be in it since Carrie Fisher died?
Yeah.  I think I remember reading how she finished all her parts before she died.
Do you think we'll find more information about her family?
Yeah.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter.
Luke seemed really depressed in the new trailer for episode eight.
I know.  It's weird that he wants the Jedi to end.
I wonder if Luke is going to be moving around a lot.
Yeah.  He definitely is showing his age.
