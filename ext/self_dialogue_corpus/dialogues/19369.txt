You a melodic death metal fan?
I'm a fan of normal death metal. What's melodic death metal?
It's death metal with more melodic guitar riffs and choruses.
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
You should really give it a listen. The instrumental work is always a treat to listen to.
Are the vocals the same?
Generally, yes. They can actually very between deep growls, mid range, and high pitched screams, too.
Okay, that sounds promising. Who should I check out?
I take it you're a bigger fan of lower range death growls?
That's about right. Why?
Alright then. I'd say you should start with Amon Amarth.
Tell me some more about them.
Their music's lyrics focus heavily on Norse mythology. Their guitar work is very melodic also.
And their vocals?
The vocalist uses mostly low range growls, with the occasional scream.
That sounds like familiar territory to me.
Exactly why I recommended them. I figure you should like them.
Any particular songs you'd like to recommend.
Just one, and that's Twilight of the Thunder God.Listen to it as soon as you can.
I'll look it up right now.
