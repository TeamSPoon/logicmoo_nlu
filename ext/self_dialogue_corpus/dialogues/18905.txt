Do you like live music?
Like a concert or at a bar?
Any live music at all.
Well yes of course, I love listening to people play the guitar.
That is true for me too, I like going to bars and listening to local bands play.
Do you play any instruments?
I  played the flute when i was a kid, and I play guitar, but not very well.
I started to learn to play the guitar too, it is really hard!
I find switching chords is hard for my fingers to adjust to.
Same here, but I pick up on new chords very easily.
That is why I like watching people play the guitar, I can watch their hands.
I do the same thing, makes it easier for me.
Can you read music?
Not quite, I just like to play by ear, That is how I learn.
I can't read much music either, but I did learn what the strings on the guitar are.
I can read guitar tabs pretty easily for some reason.
I can do the same, but not very well.
It does take some getting used to.
They have some great videos on youtube that teach you the tabs though.
Yes, that is how I learned!
