Do you like Angel Haze?
Yeah I think they're a really talented actor and singer.
Yeah it's really cool too that they're out as trans.
Yeah and I can relate to their music about being a survivor.
Do you have a favorite song?
I like Battle Cry a lot.
Oh that's a good one! I like Black Dahlia.
Nice choice! That ones really meaningful.
Yeah I like how she talks about the complications of having an abusive mother.
Yeah she does a really good job talking about how complicated loving someone who has hurt you can be.
