Wow Indidnt think I'd like this fight club movie
Yeah what do you think the best part of the movie is
I like how he gets the woman's fat for his soup he sells
That's gross
Yeah I know but that's what makes the movie funny
I saw a movie that will really creep you out
Which one?
It's the garbage pail kids
That movie was so dumb. I had to turn it off about a quarter of the way through
I'm in love with the tinker bell series
I like the part where she makes her ship fly
How about the part where she gets mad
Yeah her face turns a very bright red
What is the name of the movie where Steve Martin was a crook
I think the movie was dirty rotten scoundrels
They were such con artists in that one
Did ounknow that Liam Nelson brother is the guy who played thor
No I didnt
Hmm I've got a very boring movie for you
Is it let me guess Independece Day. Everybody knows ou hate that film
