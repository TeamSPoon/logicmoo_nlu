Have you seen the trailer for the new Reese Witherspoon movie, Home Again?
I did! Doesn't it look great? I still can't get over her in Big Little Lies.
She's represented herself so well throughout her whole career.
From Legally Blonde to Walk the Line to now? She can do it all.
She's as relatable as an actress can be. So in Home Again, her character lives with three guys?
And it looks like her ex-husband comes back for a bit? That's a set-up for some complications!
More and more, movies are showing women without the perfect lives.
We don't have to have it all. It's okay if women make mistakes, if we make a mess of things.
Right. Finally we're admitting that as a society--and Hollywood is catching on.
How do you think the character lives with three men at once?
It looks like she's kinda playing Mom to them. Even if there's romance involved.
What do you think that says about being 40? Women have to play the Mom role?
I don't think so--I think it's just saying moms get used to being moms.
But she also breaks out of that a bit. Going crazy on her birthday?
You can't only be a mom, silly!
I hope I have crazy birthdays until I'm 80, not just until I have kids.
Reese Witherspoon's character would probably say the same.
You can be a mom and a person! Home Again seems to explore that idea.
I definitely want to see it. Not just because I love Reese Witherspoon.
She can do no wrong!
