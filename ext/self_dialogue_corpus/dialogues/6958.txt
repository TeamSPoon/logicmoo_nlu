Did you ever hear of the movie Chicken Little that Disney did?
I remember Chicken Little! I didn't realize that was a Disney film.
It sure was. I loved that movie.
Didn't they have all kinds of other neat characters in it?
Yep. There was the Ugly Duckling, Foxy Loxy and a bunch of others.
I seem to remember that movie kind of running on and getting a little random.
Yes. It opened really well at the box office, yet it did get a few less-than-stellar reviews.
What did critics say about it?
Well, some critics basically said that the storyline could have been developed better.
It was still a fun movie, though. I remember Patrick Stewart was in it, too!
