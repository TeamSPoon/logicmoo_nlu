I think Jar Jar Binks has got to be the worst character in the Star Wars franchise.
Ugh, totally.  The character itself could have been really interesting but the way they had him talk was just so annoying.
I know! He came from an interesting world, an interesting culture and you don't care one thing about him because you just can't stand to hear him talk.
The worst, the absolute worst was when Padme puts him in charge of being a senator for Naboo while she's away in Attack of the Clones.
Agreed! It's like, "Who's the dumbest guy I know from planet? Oh OK, I'll put him in charge while I'm busy!"
It just just so dumb.  Who would listen to him?
Their planet is at risk, their whole republic is at risk and she puts a guy you couldn't trust to make a takeout order in charge of everything.
And he's such a coward! He just gave up and surrendered in the big battle against the droid army in Phantom Menace.
I don't blame the other Gungams for kicking him out.
Me either, he probably would have flipped the switch that flooded the whole city thinking he was turning the lights on.
