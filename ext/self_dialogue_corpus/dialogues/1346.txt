Are you excited about the NFL season being so close?
I am very excited about that actually!
What team are you the most excited about?
Well, being from Los Angeles, I am really excited about the Rams!
Are you glad that LA is now a hot spot for pro football once again?
Yes, I am super thrilled to have the NFL back in my hometown!
Do you think the Rams will have a good year this upcoming season?
I hope so! I feel like there is some pretty decent talent to build around for a great future.
What player excites you the most on the current roster?
I would have to go with Todd Gurley. He is an outstanding running back.
He played his college ball at Georgia, right?
Yea, he was great for them just like he has been for us.
How do you feel about the quarterback position?
I think Jared Goff has a lot of potential. Hopefully he is getting the right coaching to go with it.
I remember him playing at California, he ha a super strong arm.
Yea all the physical tools are there for him to be a special NFL quarterback.
Are you going to stick to being a Rams fan? Or will you think about switching to the Chargers, since they are now in LA as well?
No, I am a Rams fan for life.
No love for La's newest team huh?
I will support them when I can, but I love the Rams first and foremost.
