I cant wait until next season start, my Pelicans are going to be great!
I dont know, they have really struggled for a very long time.
Those days are over, the future is very bright in New Orleans.
You may be right, what makes you think they are going to turn the corner?
They got Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis!
That is true, but there is only so much they can on their own.
That is true, but having the two best big men in the league is a great start!
Are they going to get a new coach?
No, they are going to keep Alvin Gentry.
Wow, do you still have confidence in him?
I do, but he really needs to show us fans something this year!
What are your expectations for next year to be a success.
I feel that we should not only be in the payoffs next year, but at least a top 5 seed.
That would be a major step in the right direction for sure.
I feel Cousins and Davis are going to be unstoppable as a unit!
Do you think they will make any more moves in free agency?
I hope so we really need some quality shooters!
Yea, with Davis and Cousins guys should be open all the time.
I would love to get a guy like Kyle Korver, he is a great shooter.
Yea, I dont think the cavs will be letting him go anytime soon.
