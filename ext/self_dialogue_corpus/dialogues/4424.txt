Have you seen this movie Wait Until Dark?
No, I've never heard of it.
I hadn't either until last night when it was on TCM.
Was it good?
It was outstanding!
Really?  Who was in it?
Audrey Hepburn was the lead.  She played a blind woman being terrorized by some men looking for a doll filled with drugs.
Wow! That does sound interesting.
I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes and it had like a 95% positive rating.
Maybe I should check it out sometime.
