I like the original Spider Man movie.
It was good at the time.
I liked how he was a nerd but transformed.
He did put on some muscle.
He had to learn how to use his powers.
I liked him learning about his web slinging.
He had amazing senses.
I liked when he beat Flash.
It was cool to see.
We should  watch it again.
