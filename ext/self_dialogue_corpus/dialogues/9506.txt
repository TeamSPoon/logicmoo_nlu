Would you ever listen to the new Jessie James?
I dont even know that rapper
Yeah hes on a minor label.
What does he sound like?
Yelawolf and Eminem combined.
Wasnt Yelawolf on Shady Records?
Yeah Eminem loves his white rapper
I dont know if hes making those decisions
He definitely is since he puts his name on it.
Did he even produce a cd? I heard from him but never heard a sound from him
