well well most of this music these days are pure garbage, i stick to some particular artist.
artist like?
say weekend, future,t-pain
t-pain? never knew you were a t-pain fan, cos i am as well
oh really ? i love his songs,my all time best is still "bartender"
of course bartender was a big it but "sprung" gave him the limelight.
true that was the song Akon heard that made him signed t-pain to konvict music.
talking about Akon whats up with him , haven't dropped any music of late
that's right,i think the last time i heard him on an interview he said he was taking a break off music.
wow really? he such a good singer and i still bump to "belly dancer".
"belly dancer" wasn't really my favourite akon's song , i would rather say "so beautiful"  is.
hehe so beautiful is a classic tune i also love as well.
i loved kardinal official part on the song.
i think all three actually did justice to that song.
in between where about is Kardinal Official?
really don't know much about his recent activities though he is no longer with Konvict music.
yeah that was long ago before he even dropped "shake it".
oh "shake it" that song just didn't sound right  for me.
yeah true,it was a poor effort, didn't even make top 100 on billboard.
he's lost his touch i suppose.
