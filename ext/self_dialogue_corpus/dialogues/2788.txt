Have you been following the Cowboys this offseason?
I have been a little whats going on?
Man, they  have lost 4 due to being arrested or suspended!
THe most recent is Wilson!  He was at a 4th tailgate party and tried to run over a lady.
Yea I heard about that!  And he pulled his shotgun on some guy?
Thats what I heard too!  That could lead to some serious issues.
I also heard that Dak was using a machine to sign all his memorbilia.
Really? So, what, he is not signing himself or what?
Yea so they are saying it is an autopen and maybe he didn't know it was going on? So I guess representatives were doing it and he didn't know it was going on.
That is crazy!  I am sure he pays someone to watch out for stuff like that!
I can not wait to see him and Zeke at camp this year!
I think this is gonna be our year!
I think if we can get through all these troubles we stand a good chance.
I think if we can get thru the Eagles and the entire East we will kill those North guys.
The Patriots still showing to be on top.
Nah, they have an older team at this point.  Past their prime.
Its gonna be a fun season thats for sure.
We got alot of new blood in the draft that is for sure.
I hope we can have a smoother summer and get these Cowboys on the right track.
Jones will get them in shape quickly!
