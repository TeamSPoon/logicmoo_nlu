Have you listened to (Gaga's new-ish album) Joanne yet?
No, but I like the singles I've heard so far. Anything that takes us away from the memory of Artpopâ€¦
Oh my goodness, I know, right? She even had the sense to keep it out of that halftime show.
Yeah, I hope she's realized its best to leave all of that era in the past. She went full Art School Kid and it was bad.
Very very cringey. This Joanne phase seems to be a lot more grounded. I'm not sure I understand the hats but I I ever understand her hats?
Ha, fair point. At least she's stopped referring to hats as vital organs. "asking me to remove my hat is like asking me to remove my liver" Oh please.
Back to the music, cause if we stick with the fashion, we'll just be confused, I like the genre shift in Joanne and Cheek To Cheek to less dancehall and more, everything else. She's best with a simple backing.
Yes yes yes. Keep it simple! She's got the voice and the talent. Not everything has to be remixed with 12 guests and a yak.
A yaaaaaaaak! She would. You know that's gonna be the midlife crisis Madonna phase: yak music.
And yet, it will sell and we'll all dance to it. Gaga is a witch.
