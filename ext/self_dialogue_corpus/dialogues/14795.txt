Hey, so what's your favorite Jim Carey movie?
Hmm, I don't know. Probably The Mask?
The Mask? Not Ace Ventura Pet Detective?
I mean, is Jim Carey even making movies anymore? Why not ask about Steve Carrell?
Well, at least I didn't say Adam Sandler.
Yeah, I would have nothing to say to that!
So what's your favorite Steven Carell movie?
Oddly enough, probably Bruce Almighty, which was Carell's breakout hit - AND, it was a Jim Carey movie.
Me too, but really I liked him best in The Office.
Oh dude, for sure. Show wasn't the same when he left...
