What are your favorite bands from the early 2000's?
Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Red Hot Chili Peppers.
I like all them. Do you like all american rejects?!
Oh, yeah, of course.
I have been listening to them again lately.
So many memories with them!
Move along is probably their most known song, right?
Either that or Dirty Little Secret.
Yeah, those were both huge.
Bands back then were so much better than today.
True. But that's what everyone says when they get older.
I think its actually true, though. There aren't many well known bands now.
I definitely don't listen to any, nor could I name any new ones. Maybe you're right.
I wonder if AAR still makes music?
They are. I read they've written 10 new songs as of this month.
Really? A new album, maybe?
Doesn't look like it.
What will they do with the songs?
No idea. Maybe they will release an album, but there's no announcement.
I hope they do.
