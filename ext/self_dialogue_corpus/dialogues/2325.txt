Doesn't it seem like football just ended and the NFL is already almost back?
Yeah, but I can't wait for training camp.
Oh same, just saying it went so quickly.
Yeah, well, now it seems like the season is year-round with the draft and free agency.
It definitely has changed. Who do you like this year.
I like the Cowboys to take another step forward this year.
Yeah, if Dak and Zeke stay healthy, it's possible.
Only thing that concerns me is their aging o-line, but I still like them.
Do you think they'll miss Romo's leadership?
Not sure, honestly.
I did think it was best for him to retire.
Yeah, he shouldn't risk long-term injury.
Agreed, I look forward to seeing him as an announcer.
Well, anyone will be better than Phil Simms.
Oh for sure. He was terrible at announcing games.
Yep, I think NBS is the best to watch games.
Yeah, Collinsworth is good. I love when my Giants are on NBC.
You like the Giants!?
Yeah, what's wrong with the Giants?
Eh, I just don't like Eli Manning.
