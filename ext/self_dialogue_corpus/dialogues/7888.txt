Did you like Deathly Hollows part one or two better, in the Harry Potter franchise?
Part two, for sure.
Why is that?
The music was haunting and the scenes were quite somber, with the dementors surrounding Hogwarts and Snape silently watching the students in their marching formation
It really set a tone for the whole movie.
It showed the state of the Wizarding world at the time.
So desperate, that kids were the first and last line of defense.
I think it was a really good abstract of coming of age.
For more than just Harry too.
Right. For the whole magic world, the coming to terms with the fact they were not as capable as they thought.
