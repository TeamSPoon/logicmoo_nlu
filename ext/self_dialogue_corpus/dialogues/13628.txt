What did you think about the new take on the Star Wars universe presented in the Force Awakens?
It was done well, but it was a bit too similar to New hope in many ways.
How do you mean? How were they similar?
Rey is on a desert planet very similar to Tatooine and a lot of other things are very similar between the two movies.
I can see that. But I really enjoyed how they personified a storm trooper this time.
Yeah that was very unique. I didn't expect to see a storm trooper using their own will.
Do you think Finn has some Force sensitivity?
There haven't been special indications of it, but there is always a possibility.
Would you like to see his story line progress further?
It could be interesting but I'm always more interested in the mystical part of the Force and the characters most affected with it.
