Let's talk about music
That sounds good to me
Do you like music
Yes I love it, you?
I listen to it all the timer
Same here
I like to listen to older songs
Like what?
On direct tv, I always have the y2k music playing
They did have better music then
And I like a variety
Me too
I dont like hearing the same new songs 20 times in an hour
Yea that gets pretty old
And it makes it to where you don't even like the song anymore
I know exactly what you mean
They play it so much you grt sick of it
It is really annoying.
Yea, that's why I prefer those stations
I'll check them out
