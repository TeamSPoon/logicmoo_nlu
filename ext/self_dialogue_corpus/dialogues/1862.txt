Who's your favorite NFL team?
I like The Denver Broncos.
Cool. I bet you were excited when they won Super Bowl 50.
It was awesome seeing them win their third Super Bowl.
It was also sentimental since it was Peyton Manning's last game.
Peyton Manning is one of the greatest quaterbacks and I'm glad he got to play for The Broncos.
It's not hard to argue that Peyton's a great player. So is his brother Eli.
Eli still plays for The New York Giants, right?
Yes, he's been with them since 2004.
How many Super Bowls did Eli play in?
He played in two Super Bowls. Both times The Giants beat The Patriots.
Wow! That's amazing that they beat The Patriots.
It is, considering The Patriots are one of the top teams in the NFL.
With 5 Super Bowl wins, how can you not say The Patriots are a good team.
A lot of their success is due to their coach Bill Belichick.
That's true. He's been coaching since 1979 and worked with various teams.
Really? What other teams did he coach for?
He worked with The New York Giants early in his career.
I never knew he was a coach for The Giants.
He was with them for 11 years before he became coach for The Cleveland Browns.
