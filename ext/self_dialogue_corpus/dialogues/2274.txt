Are you excited about the upcoming Packers games?
Yes, I'm a huge fan.
I think they had some great draft picks off-season.
I was not impressed by the draft choices.
Why do you say that about the draft choices?
Because the packers need a running back, and they did not spend a high pick on one.
I suppose that is true.
It is definitely true, and now they are stuck with depending solely on Rogers.
That's not all bad because Rogers is great.
Yes, he is the best quarterback in the league.
I agree, and he is still as strong as ever.
But his receivers are a joke this year.
That is true, and the packers don't seem concerned about it.
They have all 30 or older receivers, and that will hurt them.
What about the two young receivers they drafted?
It will take a couple years before the new receivers can contribute.
Yes, the NFL is a tough place to come up quickly.
There is a good chance that all their offensive picks this year will be wash outs.
But I am still hopeful that the packers could win it all.
I guess I am hopeful as well for the packers.
