Hey, did you see the latest trailer for Spider-Man Homecoming?
I did! It looks awesome, and I am really excited to see it!
Oh, me too! I am so happy that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now.
Oh, totally! I was worried that he would only appear in Captain America: Civil War, but it looks like, at least for now, he is here to stay.
I know! It is so great! Having Spider-Man being able to interact with characters like Captain America and Iron Man is just so awesome!
You are completely right! Spidey is such an iconic part of the Marvel Universe, and the MCU just seems so much more real and alive with him in it.
I couldn't agree more! And I am really happy that he is going up against a classic villain like The Vulture.
So true. It is really great that they were able to include such a traditional Spidey villain without re-hashing a character that has already been done, like Green Goblin or Venom.
For sure! Here's hoping they might be able to squeeze in some cool cameos as well.
Oh, I hope so! I can't wait to see this movie!
