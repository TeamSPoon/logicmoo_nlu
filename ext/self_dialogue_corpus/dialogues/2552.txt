Do you remember Steve Young?
The football player?
Yeah, the quarterback.
Oh, yeah.  He was awesome when he played for the 49er.
Yeah, they had a great team back then.
Steve Young and Jerry Rice were awesome.
They won a couple of superbowls, right?
They were really good in the 90s, but I think they only won one.
Oh, wow.  I guess that's not surprising though.
Yeah, they might have had a better record and still not won that one game.
Yeah.  Did Steve Young play for any other teams after the 49ers?
I'm not sure, but he didn't play for any after the 49ers.
Wow, and he played for them for a while.
Yeah, he was with them for over ten years.
At least ten.  Probably close to fifteen.
He's in the Hall of Fame, isn't he?
Oh, I'm sure he is.  He is in the collegiate hall of fame for sure.
Where did he go to college?
Brigham Young University.
Oh, that's the one in Utah.
