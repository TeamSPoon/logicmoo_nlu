Hey, what do you like about Star Wars?
I like the aspect of some magic being thrown in with a bit of science.
Yeah, that's pretty neat, I've never really thought of the force as magic.
I can't imagine how else to think of it. Space Wizards, really, with their own ideas.
True. That could explain force sensitive people, they can feel the magic, but can't use it.
Yeah, like Princess Leia. She could always feel it, but wasn't exactly like her brother.
You know, that makes me curious, what if she could but was never really trained?
Well, she was a Princess so that makes sense. She was still pretty badass.
I do like the female characters being strong on their own.
They don't need anyone to save them, they aren't going to give in. Real role models.
