Who are your  favorite  pop artists of all time?
Oh man that's tough, can it be from anywhere in the world?
Yes, anywhere.
Ok then, number one is Mflow. I love all their songs.
Nice choice, I like them too.
Next would be Taylor Swift. She's had so many hits.
Another good choice, I was just listening to her last night.
Then I choose Michael Jackson, if we are allowed to choose dead people.
Yea dead people still cound.
Ok, then I would have to say Rhianna, she's killing the game right now.
Yea, Rhianna is amazing.
After Rhianna, I choose Justin Timberlake.
Yea I wish he would make more music, all his songs are great.
Yea, I guess he's busy with his family and movies and what not.
Ok, who's next?
Next I choose Justin Beiber, while he is annoying, his music has been on point lately.
Fair enough, but I hate Justin Beiber.
Yea, well I'm running low on people to choose from.
What about Madonna?
I was just going to say Madonna.
