What type of music do you like?
Rap and country.
I thought you hated rap?
I know. When I went to rehab, though, everyone listened to rap and it grew on me.
That's crazy.
Yeah, haha. When I was using I couldn't stand rap music! Now I can't get enough of it!
What made you change your views?
I guess listening to the lyrics.
Like what?
Oh, just the ones about shit I can relate to. Mainly the drug songs. Or just songs with good beats.
