Are you ready for NFL this fall?
Yes! I've been waiting since the Super Bowl in February.
What's the team you follow?
The Dallas Cowboys are my team of choice.
Who are your favorite players?
Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott make a great team.
What school did Elliot come from?
The Ohio State University.
Oh yeah.  Will they make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I certainly hope so, because they were so close last year.
Well, I'll be waiting for the underdogs to make it this year.
Who do you mean? Detroit?
No, the Cleveland Browns.
Wow! That would be a miracle.
We need some different teams to make it all the way.
