What is your favorite black and white movie?
I loved the original father of the bride
Isn't that from the 90's?
No, that's the remake, the original was made in 1950
Who did it star?
Spencer Tracey and Elizabeth Taylor
Wow I've never seen that version
It's very fun! But a lot more simpler than the Steve Martin one
How so?
Well first of all its a lot more real and true to life
Wow, I have to check that out.
Actually the second one isn't that bad either
Is it like the steve martin remake? The wife getting pregnant along with the daughter?
Actually that doesn't happen at all in the original
Well then whats the plot?
The dad's reaction to the daughter having a baby. There is no pregnancy with the mother figure.
Wow, that is quite different
I do prefer the old one to the 90's versions though
Well to each their own
you should check out the 50's one
