Are you going to get season tickets for the Bengals this year?
No, I don't think they are going to do that well this year.
I agree, they lack the depth ofr roster I am looking.
I will be watching how the Raiders do moving down to Las Vegas then.
Yeah I wonder how the season tickets there must be.
From what I heard they are pretty reasonable.
Do you think the Raiders will do well being in the new stadium?
I don't know, I'm sure that will affect them.
Yeah, but that might get them more exciting to turn things around.
The fans also will be some of the same but many new ones, so they ought to play well to get those new fans.
They really need to be looking for a franchise player.
Yeah,  I can't remember the last Raider franchise player since Charles.
Teams like the Colts, or the Giants, or the Patriots have just had such consistency in their franchise players.
That's true, they have had the chance to build the team around those guys.
Maybe Oakland could get it through a trade, but really they just need to have another good draft year.
I can't remember who they got the past few years, but that probably tells you something about the quality.
Yeah, the drafts have not been too good recently.
I'm hoping there will be some more star players to begin replacing some of the older guys in the league.
I totally agree, I feel like we have had Brady, Manning and Roethlisberger for forever.
Yeah, maybe this will be the year when the younger talents pick up the torch.
