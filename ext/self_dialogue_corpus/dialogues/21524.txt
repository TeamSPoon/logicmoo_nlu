Have you seen any of the new superhero movies?
Yes, I have seen most of them.
Which was your favorite so far?
I love the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
I seen that a few weeks ago too.
What was your favorite aspect of it?
Baby Groot of course.
Really? That is your favorite aspect of the movie?
Well, Groot did play a major part in the film, but I mostly like everything about the movie.
How did you like this twist at the end?
I was shocked. I loved that it told the backstory of the characters.
Me too. I loved how some of the bad guys had redeeming moments.
What did you think about Mantis?
I loved her dry sense of humor.
I also though Kurt Russel did an amazing job.
I did as well. The first movie I have seen him in, in awhile.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him in much either.
Maybe this is a turning point in his career.
It could be. He did a great job, so maybe
I think there are big things to come for the entire cast.
