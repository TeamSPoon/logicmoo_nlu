Hey, did you hear that Garth Brooks is coming to town?
I'm sorry, no I didn't, I don't even know who Garth Brooks is.
What?!?! He's only the greatest country music star ever.
I doubt it if I have never heard of him
You have never heard the song, " Friends in Low Places"? Or "The Thunder Rolls?"
Well Yeah I've heard those songs, they are classics, but I didn't know who sang them.
That is Garh Brooks!!
oh, I see.
He may be an older country star, but he is still amazing
I really don't think hes bigger than some of the country stars today though.
He is the biggest selling American solo artist of all time. He has sold more albums than Elvis. So I think you are wrong
He's sold more albums than Elvis? That's ridiculous
he has sold over 148 million albums. that is more than Elvis. The only band that has outsold him is the beatles. look at his wikipedia
Wow, I really must be out of touch on my country music
Its ok. Stick With me and I will educate you
I guess so. When is this concert?
Its in October, We need to get tickets quickly though
Yeah I guess we probably do
I will buy them and you can pay me back, deal?
Sounds good.
