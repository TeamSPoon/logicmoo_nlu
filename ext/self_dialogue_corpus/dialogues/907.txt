What do you think about Cam Newton?
He is good but he needs protection.
I agree.
ANdrew Luck also needs protection.
hopefully these teams get their quarterbacks protection.
I agree they could get hurt.
andrew luck has already had multiple surgeries.
He had a recent one too
Hopefully he is ready for the season.
I hope so.
I think Cam will do better if he just gets some lines to help him.
Me too he is good at footballa nd has a great heart.
Yeah he gives all hsi balls to the kids.
That is a dedicated player.
Makes for more dedicated fans.
I am one of them.
I like him alot.
Me too.
I like the colts and what they did for chuck pagano
me too it shows there is more to the NFL than just football it is about family.
