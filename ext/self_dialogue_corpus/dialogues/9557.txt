Do you like Wu Tang Clan?
Of course, what true hip-hop fan doesn't love them!
Do you have a favorite Wu Tang artist?
I have a couple but i would have to say Method Man.
He had to be their first shining star out of the bunch.
He was just so charismatic and demanded the spot light instantly.
I was a big ODB fan in the beginning myself.
Are you kidding me? ODB changed the entire game with his style and delivery.
Yeah he was the wildcard of the crew for sure.
Brooklyn Zoo is still a classic this very day. Rest in peace ODB.
