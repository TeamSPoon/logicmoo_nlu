Have you ever seen One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest?
That is my all time favorite movie.
My all time favorite too.
What an all star cast.
So many of them went on to star in many movies and many tv shows as well.
How about Danny Devito in Taxi.
Christopher Lloyd in taxi too.
Yes,and he starred in Back To The Future.
William Redfield who played Harding was Felix Ungers brother in the Odd Couple tv show.
That's right,I forgot.
Will Sampson as the chief was great!
Yes he was. Sadly he passed away years ago.
I've seen the guy who played Billy Bibbit in Criminal Minds before.
Yes he was. His name was Brad Dourif.
Wow,good one. You set a fan of the movie.
I told you I was.
How about Scatman Carothers as Turkle.
He was great. He was in The Shining too with Jack Nicholson.
Yes he was.
Told you it's my favorite movie.
