Do you think Han Solo would be a fan of his solo movie?
I think he would think it was silly.
Why is that?
He was just sort of boring before the original trilogy.
Maybe it will show him and Jabba the Hut.
Maybe why he was in trouble with him.
What did you think when Vader put Solo in the Carbonite?
That was actual not originally part of the plot.
What do you mean?
They did that because Harrison Ford was not sure he wanted to do another movie, so they needed an easy out.
