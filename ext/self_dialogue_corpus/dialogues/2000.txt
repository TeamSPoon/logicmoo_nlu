What's your favorite position in the NFL?
I think quarterbacks are overrated, but otherwise I kind of like receivers
Wide receivers only, or receivers in general?
I think in general, since a lot of positions receive passes pretty regularly
Some of my favorite plays are running backs receiving passes when no one expects it
Yeah, I remember a 49ers game several years back where Alex Smith passed to Frank Gore and he was wide open
Sometimes the smaller guys can slip through the cracks and make big plays
I think that's how Darren Sproles has been so successful over the years despite being below average size
Anyone under six feet is considered small in the NFL
Even Russell Wilson is called short, and yet it aids his elusiveness on the field
It's hard to think of someone so agile like that as just a quarterback
That's what makes me conflicted about quarterbacks, since in the past they've generally been more one-dimensional
Tight ends are another position that require versatility, since they both block and receive passes
Rob Gronkowski is a beast of a player as a tight end, and he's huge so blocking isn't much of an issue
The only downside is that his size makes him slower on the field
Slower, but not necessarily easier to stop when you see him dragging defenders several yards like they're nothing
Now I'd like to see more tight ends like that, although Travis Kelce and Martellus Bennett make a good case for themselves
Definitely, and so does Jason Witten, another guy who isn't super fast but who always knows how to get open
So the position isn't quite as important as defying expectations after all
Oh yes, hybrid players have been all the rage on defense, and I can't wait to see who surprises us next
