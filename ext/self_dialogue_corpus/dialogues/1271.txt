I think the Cowboys are going to be underwhelming this year. What do you think?
Yeah, I agree. I think once some teams have expectations, they seem to fold under the pressure.
Exactly. I think Dak Prescott is going to be a one year wonder.
I wouldn't go that far. But they did over achieve last year.
I think so because other teams will now know how to prepar for him.
But if he's good, does it matter?
I think it does since he's not really anything new that the NFL has never seen before.
I personally think he's pretty good. He has good speed and knows how to operate from the pocket.
I think that's because the Cowboys have an elite offensive line. Without that line, Prescott would be in trouble.
Well, he's still going to have that line.
I think that other teams are going to figure out how to exploit that line and get to Dak Prescott.
On the flip side, you also have to think that he's going to figure things out better in his second year as the starting quarterback.
Maybe. I just think that the pressure is going to get to him.
That's definitely something we can see from a quarterback entering his second year.
I also think some of the Cowboys players have had some trouble with the law, right?
I think I heard that. But I'm not too sure.
Yeah, I don't think any of them were significant role players on the team.
They mustn't have been considering I would have see articles about it online.
But it does seem like a case of the Cowboys acting like the Cowboys again when it comes to getting in trouble with the law.
Yeah, that's never a good thing when your team has expectations now.
