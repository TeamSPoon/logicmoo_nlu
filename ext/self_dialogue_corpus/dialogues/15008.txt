What is a good movie about airplanes?
I would suggest the movie Soul Plane.
Soul Plane sounds great. Is it a drama?
Nope. It is a comedy starring Snoop Dogg.
Snoop Dogg on a plane? That sounds like a disaster!
It is. There are plenty of bad things that happen but it is a funny movie.
Would you suggest that I watch this with my kids?
I wouldn't there are some dirty scenes.
That is too bad. I will check it out with my wife late at night though.
You should. There are many unforgettable scenes you have to say.
