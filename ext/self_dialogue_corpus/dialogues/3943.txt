Hi.
Hello.
Do you enjoy thriller movies?
Yeah I do like them.  Do you?
Yeah I enjoy them quite a bit.
What is a good one that you saw recently?
I saw Oldboy for the first time recently.
I'm not familiar with that one.
It's a foreign film with a lot of action and a crazy plot.
Sounds like something I might like!
