I need some new albums, I've played out all my current music. I'm bored.
I've got Melodrama by Lorde on repeat. I mean, it's Lorde, everything she does is magical.
I love her! I'll definitely pick that one up.
Have you heard the new Radiohead?
There's new Radiohead?
Yes! There's another for your list.
Thanks. What about Haim, I thought I heard something about them releasing a new album this summer.
Of course! Something to Tell You, the songs they've released so far are amazing!
I'll definitely have to listen to that when it comes out. I love Haim.
Did you see them on SNL, they played two of their new songs.
I didn't. I always miss that show.
I think Calvin Harris has something new coming out.
I'm not a big Calvin Harris fan, my favourite song of his was that one with Rihanna. I just liked Rihanna, not Calvin.
That's fair, he's not my favourite either.
Oh, what about Lana Del Rey?
Yeah, she had that single that came out, Lust for Life, with The Weeknd. That was good.
I loved it! Fleet Foxes also released an album recently.
I'm kind of bored with them. I listened to all their stuff so much awhile back that I'm just done.
You know what was surprisingly good? The American Gods soundtrack.
Really? I love that show, I'll have to listen to that one.
