Did anyone see Power Rangers yet?
The latest one that came out in March?  I haven't seen it yet.
I think it did fairly well, it got $140 million dollars for it.
Wow, that is amazing.
It's very good for a teen movie!
Yes, not bad for doubling their money!
Do you know who directed it?
Dean Israelite directed the movie.
I think the production company was Lionsgate.
Lionsgate has come up with some great movies.
The Power Rangers usually protect the world from danger, this one also goes with that theme.
Who stars in it?
Naomi Scott, Dacre Montgomery, Elizabeth Banks, Ludi Lin, and Becky G star in this film.
They are all new to me!
Yes, it is a teen film, so most are all very young in this movie.
Did the critics give it good marks?
They gave it good marks 6 out of 10.
I suspect my nephews would like to go see it.
Yes, I don't think I will go see it .
I will tell my family of the film, the children will go.
