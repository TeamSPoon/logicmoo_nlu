i wonder what the worst traveling violation is, then
Define worst.
The longest travel.
I think you mean the most steps took. It's more common nowadays because the NBA changed the rules. They allow traveling as long as it results ina cool play
Ok fine, then whatever. What's the most number of steps taken during a play that should've been called traveling.
Um the most I've seen is 7 with Carmello.Anthony.
What happened with that?
It wasn't called. He just walked with the ball in his right hand for like 7 steps. And the end play wasn't all that cool either.
That's not fair that they're not consistent with play calls.
Well, it is pretty cool when they do break away and go down the court to make a nice play.
Like what?
Like Corey Brewer. He takes the ball away and travels clear across the court, and about mid court, he takes the ball and proceeds to dunk
Did he make it?
Yep
and he was traveling?
Really really badly. He was practically carrying the ball for half the court almost.
See, that's not fair if you ask me
Well, the play was cool. It was his ball. He took it away.
But that doesn't mean we should allow players to break the rules.
Often dribbling causes players to lose the ball. At least this exception rule, we get to see cool plays and they still count towards the game.
