do you think the Seahawks will win their division this year?
I do.  I don't think that they will have too much trouble.
You don't think that Arizona will challenge them?
No, though I think they will do better then San Francisco will
Yeah, probably.  What about the Rams?
They have improved but I think they still need a piece or two before they are a challenge.
Where do you think they need to improve?
At quarterback and Defense.
Yeah, they are pretty strong now with their offensive line and running back.
Right.  But I think Seattle will have no problem beating all them.
Do you see any challenges in the rest of the NFC for Seattle?
There will be a couple I think.  Like Carolina and the Lions.
Can't forget about Green bay. They are always there.
That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there.
What about the NFC East.  They are usually pretty tough.
I know.  I think that the Giants may be there and who know's about Dallas.
Yeah, it's hard to say which Cowboy team will show up.
Or if any will now that they are all getting suspended or arrested.
Right.  Well, don't count out their new quarterback.
I don't think it will be an issue for the Hawks this year.
