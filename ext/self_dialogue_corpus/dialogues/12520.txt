What is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
Episode I.  That was awful.
Oh come on.  I agree it was the weakest but awful?
Ok it had it's high points.
Yeah like seeing the start of Darth Vader as an innocent kid.
Yeah, or revealing he has more raw power than anyone.
We also learned a lot about Jedi, even if it wasn't perfect.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Plus Darth Maul had the best fight scene.
Yeah, that was amazing.  Too bad they killed him off.
