What were your favorite Disney movies as a kid?
I didn't really watch a lot of Disney movies. What were your favorites?
I loved Pocahontas and The Lion King.
Oh the Lion King is still one of my favorite movies.
Yeah, Lion King is great. I also liked Tarzan.
I have never seen Tarzan. How is it?
It is good. It also has a lot of animals in it.
I will have to watch it sometime.
You definitively should.  Emperor's New Groove is also good.
Oh, I loved  Emperor's New Groove as well.
