Which is your favorite football team.
I love the Patriots
You mean the cheaters
Only losers complain about the other side cheating.
I hate the Patriots they don't play fair
You either love the Patriots or you're a member of the Hate-riots
Yeah what about videogatge huh?
You know if it was baseball and you were scouting the other team you'd go and watch them and take notes
Yeah...so...
Well Bellecheck sent his scouts to watch other teams.
But he cheated when he did it.
No he used modern technology... instead of taking notes he videoed their practice.
That's cheating!
No that's genius
You guys don' play fair
The Patriots don't complain when they loose.
You guys almost never lose
That's why I love them
Where are you from anyway\
New England of course where the winners live.
