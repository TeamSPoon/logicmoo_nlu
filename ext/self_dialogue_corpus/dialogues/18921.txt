I just got a new album for a band I really like called Chevelle.
I've heard of them and I think I have one of their albums.
I just got their new one titled The North Corridor.
I don't have that one, is it any good.
It's alright, but mostly the album prompted me to look up their old material.
I think the album I have is This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In).
I have that one as well, but I'm really enjoying their first album Point #1.
I don't have that one.
I think it's their best material that I've heard.
Why do you like it so much?
I think it has a less refined sound and a more simplistic approach.  I can see why someone would offer them a record deal.
What do you mean by simplistic approach.
I mean that the songs tend to follow the same rhythm with varying intensity and there aren't a lot of guitar solos.
That's nice, it really annoys me when a song is filled with three minutes of random guitar shredding.
To be honest, that's turned me off on a lot of music, but this Chevelle album is totally not like that.
I might have to check it out.
If you do, be sure to listen to the song Blank Earth.
You think I'll like it?
Probably.  But it's actually just a great example of what you can expect from the album.
I'll be sure to remember that.
