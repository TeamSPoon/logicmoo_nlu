Is there anyone cooler than Butch Walker?
That's a random question but probably, yes.
No no, that was rhetorical you weren't supposed to answer.
Oh okay, then no yeah Butch Walker is the coolest.
His latest album Stay Gold has such a coolness factor to it.
You're going to have to explain what that means, man.
Each song drips with this East coast, New Jersey flavor and swagger.
I can see what you mean but plenty of artists do that.
Yeah but how many actually feel authentic?
I guess not many, lots of people try and nail that sound and it comes off disingenuous.
