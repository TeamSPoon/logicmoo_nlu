Do you like the superbowl?
Yes i love it
Me too
It makes me a little sad because it means football season is coming to an end
Thats true
But its so excitinf
I agree
Everything about the superbowl is exciting
Even the commercials
Only the superbowl could make commercials exciting
Exactly
And my family always makes too much food
I know what you mean
Its pretty great though
I love all the food
And being around family and friends is great
Yes it is
I love the whole experience
I wish it happened more than once a year
Me too
