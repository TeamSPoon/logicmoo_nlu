The Departed is my favorite movie about Boston.
Oh, that movie is kind of dark, right?
It is! But the setting and the accents and the whole vibe is really great.
Isn't Matt Damon in it?
Yeah, he plays a bad cop. It's kind of complicated.
That's right. It's about the crime world in South Boston.
It is. I think it provides a good feel for the culture of the city though.
Did they actually shoot it there?
I believe so. There are some landmarks in it anyway.
Was Ben Affleck in it? He does a lot of Boston movies, right?
He's not in this one. I think you might be thinking of The Town.
Oh ok. Yeah, there's that one along with Gone Baby Gone.
I guess Ben is a Boston boy at heart. He loves that city.
And don't forget about Good Will Hunting.
Oh yeah. That's the one he did with Matt Damon.
The two of them wrote the screenplay for it.
I haven't seen that movie in a while. It came out in the 90's right?
Definitely. It's almost a classic at this point.
I should catch up on it. We should have a Boston movie marathon!
Of course! There are so many to choose from.
