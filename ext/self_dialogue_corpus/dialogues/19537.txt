Do you enjoy the eagles?
I do very much enjoy that band.
What is your favorite song by the eagles?
Hotel California. I loved the guitar so much.
It does have a very nice guitar intro, I think I love the lyrics more though.
The lyrics are great because it is like a story unfolding.
Very true you go on the journey to the hotel with them.
I certainly would love to live it up with them there.
Ha, i think everyone would, It seems dreamy and amazing.
Agreed, so what is your favorite track?
I like witchy woman.
That is not one of my favorites.
You got to be kidding?
No,it is okay just not a top song for me.
I love it, I also love halloween and always play it a ton around october.
That is a good choice for a halloween party playlist.
I feel like you could put on eagles greatest hits and have a very good party soundtrack.
i think that depends on the party theme and guests. I like to switch up artist on playlists at parties.
Me too but they have so many good ones I could see it working.
I may try this theory out next party.
