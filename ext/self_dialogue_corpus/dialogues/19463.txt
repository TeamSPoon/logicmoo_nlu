Even though it's been over a year I'm still listening to Beyoncé's Lemonade like it was the first time.
I believe it. That, and the visual album was one of the best things I've ever seen.
What's your favorite song off the album?
Woah, that's a tough one. You know what, strictly because I can dance to it, Hold Up.
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you. Classic lyrics and I really good beat.
You know the story behind that song?
No, but I assume it has something to do with Jay-Z.
Haha I don't know about that. But do you know that song Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs?
Oh yeah how does it go ..... 'wait, they don't love you like I love you.' Wow did she steal the lyrics?
Not at all. I think in around 2011, that kid from Vampire Weekend, Ezra Koenig tweeted something like, "hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
Oh, so instead of wait, hold up. That's funny.
And yeah apparently he was working on a song and everything but it never really came through.
Okay, so he sold it to Beyoncé?
Exactly, and I think she put her own spin on it and changed the lyrics a bit. And credited the Yeah Yeah Yeahs of course.
That's so amazing the way things come full circle like that.
It really is. Anyway what's your favorite song off of the album?
Hold Up is one of them, but also Sorry.
Oh Sorry for sure! It's such a breakup bop.
Truly, and you know what else makes me tear up just a little bit, Sandcastles.
Don't even get me started! Sandcastles and All Night will have me crying .... all night!
