I can't believe how wonderful Moana was!
Me too! My favorite song was "How Far I'll Go", it was absolutely amazing!
I can't wait for the live-action of Mulan!
I can't either. I feel it's such an empowering movie.
Who's your favorite disney character?
I have so many but Rapunzel is definitely one of my favorites.
Which castle would you choose to live in?
It's a toss up between Arendelle castle and the castle from Tangled.
Which villian do you think is the "best"?
Oh, by far I would say it's Maleficent.
