Did you see Carpool Karaoke with Harry Styles?
I think I did.    Who is the host of that show?
That is the show with the British guy, James Corden.
Yes, I saw that.      He left that group, right?
Yes, I think One Direction broke up, although I am not sure.
That doesn't bother me much, I never liked their style.
Yes, they were definitely created and marketed for pre-teen girls.
So what about that new song of Harry Styles solo?
Yes, I saw him doing that.     Catchy and pretty surprising.
Yes, I never really thought any of them could actually play guitar!
