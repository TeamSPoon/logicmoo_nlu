What do you think of 80s bands like New Order?
I've only heard a few of their songs, I haven't really heard much.
They're actually still performing, and going to the Hollywood Bowl this September.
Really, maybe we should get tickets.
Yeah, it would be cool to see them peform some of their best songs from the 80s.
What do you think are some of their best songs?
My favorite one of all is called "Vanishing Point".
i don't know if I've heard that one.
It's on their album 'Technique' which was released in 1989.
Sing part of the lyrics, maybe I've heard of it.
The chorus starts off, "My life ain't no holiday, I've been through the point of no return..."
That sounds vaguely familiar.
"...I've seen what the man can do, I've seen all the hate of the woman, too..."
I think I have heard that song.
And then it has the most awesome, catchy instrumentals.
I think I'll go check it out to see if it's the one I'm thinking it is.
It is so easy to zone out listening to that song, man I love it!
Yeah, the songs I've heard by New Order are really good.
If I was on a deserted island, I would not be upset if all I had to listen to was New Order music.
Wow, you really do like them a lot.
