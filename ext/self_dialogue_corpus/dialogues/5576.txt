Do you know movie Lady and the Tramp?
Oh yes! It was one of my favorites growing up.
I had a mutt that looked like Tramp when I was a kid. We called him Scoundrel, almost the same meaning.
I liked Lady because of her curly haired ears and big eyes. I think she was based off of some kind of spaniel.
Do you remember the cats in that movie?
Si and Am? They were siamese... if you please! That song was awesome!
They were horribly sneaky weren't they?
Aren't most cats?
Yes but these two gave new meaning to sneaky.
I don't think they ever got the deserved recognition as a Disney villain that they deserved.
