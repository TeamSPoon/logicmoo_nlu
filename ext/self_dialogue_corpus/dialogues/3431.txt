Have you seen The Evil Dead?
The original one or the rebooted version?
The original of course. The new one was good but I don't really count it.
Yes I love Evil Dead but I liked part II better.
Part II was definitely better with the inanimate objects coming to life and taunting Ash.
Oh that was hilarious and frightening at the same time. Is that your favorite scene?
No my favorite scene is when he had to saw off his hand to get the demon out of it.
Oh that was horrifying! I don't know if I could have brought myself to do that!
I know I couldn't have. That was very brave of him.
He put in so much physicality throughout that entire movie. That's why Bruce Campbell is a cult legend to this day.
