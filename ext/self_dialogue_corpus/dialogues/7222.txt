They are remaking so many Disney movies and turning them into live action ones.
I thought Beauty and The Beast was good, as well as Cinderella.  So I am feeling pretty optimistic about it.
I wasn't too in to The Jungle Book though, it was kind of dark for a children's movie.
The way Sher Kan killed the wolf pack leader caught me off guard. And I'm not even a kid.
Yeah that surprised me too.  But I think they made some positive changes in other movies.
I loved how they changed Le Fou in Beauty and the Beast.
I read that they kind of had to, because in the cartoon he got beat up a lot but in a cartoonish way that did't translate to real life.
It definitely improved his character in my opinion to have him switch sides.
I agree, he had more depth and he was more relatable.
I almost liked Gaston in the beginning, he seemed pretty sincere.  But then halfway through he went back to the Gaston that I am used to.
