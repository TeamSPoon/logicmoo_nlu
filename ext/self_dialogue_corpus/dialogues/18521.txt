I finally got a music app.
Which one did you get?
Google Play.  I am not a fan of apple.
That's cool.  What kind of music are you downloading?
I've been playing a lot of Florence and the Machine.
I am a huge Lana Del Rey fan.
Oh yeah, she is great.
Her music makes me feel so mellow. I love her voice.
I love Dark Paradise.
Yep one of my favorites.  She is so talented.
What do you think of Katy Perry?
I think she is a little over rated.
Me too.  I am not a fan.
What about Lady GaGa?
She is all about getting attention.
She seems to do a lot for publicity.
The music isn't great either.
I wish we could get some artist who care more about the music.
Like Sia?
Exactly.  She was never about publicity. She didn't even want to show her face.
