What's goin' on, schmoopy?
What does it look like? I'm listening to my i-pod.
I-pod? Those are still around?
What can I say? I'm old school.
Ok, Old School. Whatta listening to?
Kiki Dee's Greatest Hits.
Did she do that "Chuck E.'s in Love" song?
That was Rickie Jones. Did you know that she was related to Davy Jones? Distant cousin.
If she's a distant cousin then it isn't likely that her last name would be the same so I think that's b.s.
It wasn't originally. It was Birkowitz. Rickie Birkowitz. She changed it when Mr. Davy became the man.
Right. So, did Kiki Dee actually have any hits?
She did that song with Elton John. You remember--"Don't Go Brokin' My Heart".
I hate that song. Anything else?
I don't have a copy of this but I think she did a duet with Tom Petty called something like "Even Losers Can Get Laid."
I'm a little suspicious of your sources. Where did you hear that?
Tiger Beat magazine.
Tiger Beat is still around? I thought it collapsed after Sean Cassidy was caught in that compromising position. Remember? When he had that clown costume on.
Nope, they still here and still tapped into the youth of the nation.
Anyway, back to Kiki Dee....
Oh, I'm off her now.
