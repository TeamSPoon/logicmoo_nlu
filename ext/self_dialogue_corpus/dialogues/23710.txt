What kinds of movies do you like?
I like comedies and romance. You?
I like comedies, action, foreign films and horror.
Do you like the movie, "Legally Blonde"?
Not really. I think it's a little stupid. But I do like Reese Witherspoon.
Yes, she's a great actress. What about "Cruel Intentions"
Oh that is a good movie. Besides Reese, who else is in that?
Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Selma Blair....
I hated when Sebastian died at the end. I was so angry about it.
Same here. But they really got Kathryn in the end with his journal.
Yeah the ending was awesome. Such revenge.
Did you see Reese Witherspoon when she filmed "Fear"?
I remember that movie! With Mark Wahlberg, right?
Right. She was really young then.
Alyssa Milano was in that, too. That movie was creepy.
Mark Wahlberg's character was crazy. So obsessed with her.
One thing that bothered me was that the writers killed a dog in the movie.
Really?
I don't like when animals are killed in movies, even if it's not real.
I'm an animal lover too. I can see what you mean by that.
