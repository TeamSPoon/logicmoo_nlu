Atlanta Falcons
What about them?
11 and 5 last season, looks like they could do better this year.
You think?
Yeah, looks like the same team and coaches and a similar season layout this year.
Well, could be. Do you think they could take on New England?
Well, that's a heafty goal. New England is a Dynasty.
Yes but they can be beaten.
That's what Dallas and Oakland thought last year.
Haha, true.
Well, lets see how Atlanta does in Pre-Season.
Yeah, i think they can iron out the kinks in Pre-Season
I wouldnt worry too much about Dallas this season, they are in disarray.
Oakland isn't doing much better.
I can see Arizona doing some damage, They were unusually good last season.
Yeah, that was a shocker.
Well, Atlanta it looking real good.
I agree, can't wait for football season to start!
Me too, i'm already getting geared up.
So am i!
