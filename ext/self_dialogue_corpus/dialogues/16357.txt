Did you catch the season finale of The Voice?
Yeah I saw it the other night.
We stayed up late to see the end. What did you think?
I was really surprised by the winner.  He's doing well on iTunes.
Yeah I really didn't see that one coming.
Right?  He's got a great voice though.
I loved Chris Blues' duet with Usher.
I saw that one.  They were smooth.
Alicia Keys was so excited that Chris won.
I think she's only the second female coach on the show to win.
Christina Aguilera was the other one I think.  Nice!
Another good duet performance was Cee Lo and Jess.
I enjoyed that too.
Adam Levine was saying all season how much Jess reminds him of Cee Lo.
Well I guess he set things up then.
Seems like it.  Miley Cyrus came back for a song performance.
I like her.  Wish Christina came back too.
I know what you mean.  Maybe next time.
I can't wait until next season.
Let's see who they  bring in for Alicia.
