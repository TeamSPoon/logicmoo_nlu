You know how they say behind every great man, there's a good woman?
Yes, of course I've heard it, and it's usually true!
In the case of George Lucas, when he was making the first Star Wars, it was very true. His wife was a very talented film editor.
She worked on his film for him? Probably for free?
They had so little money to do the film with, they could only do a couple shots of each scene. She spent long hours late into the night pulling it all together.
He was very lucky to have her.
It took her eight weeks to make the Death Star space battle.
It's that kind of dedication to doing something that leads to success.
Unfortunately, Marcia and George divorced in 1983, and he later married a younger business woman in 2013.
That's one of the things missing from the good old days before the sixties, people don't stay married to the same person forever anymore.
