Hey, did you hear about Dexter Holland?
The singer from The Offspring?
Yup, that's the one.
No, what happened?
He finally got his Pd.D!
His what?!
PdD.
You're joking!
Nope, he earned his Ph.D in molecular biology, last week.
That's amazing! I had no idea.
It took him ages to earn, because he would take breaks to tour with The Offspring.
So being the lead singer/song writer for an internationally known, amazing, long running, punk band is just his hobby?
Pretty much. His passion, even before music, is science.
Wow.
That's why there'd be long breaks between albums, he was going to school and working on his education.
I guess he's a regular Jack of all trades.
He's also a licensed Airline Transport Pilot and a Certified Flight Instructor.
Now I know you're pulling my leg.
No, its totally true!
I can't believe how accomplished he is. That really is amazing.
