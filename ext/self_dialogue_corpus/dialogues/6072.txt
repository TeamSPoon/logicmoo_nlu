I really love the soundtrack to Lilo & Stitch.
I do too! I love all of the Elvis songs.
I keep forgetting that he had a major impact in Hawaii. Explains why Lilo is so fond of him.
The scene where she is in bed, with the record player is such an eighties thing.
It sure is! How many times did we do the same? Lay in bed, with the record player at arms length.
Reach over and grab the needle and replay it. Just like Lilo did.
So many classics in that one movie. So many things that are truly Hawaii.
The shaved ice.
The Hula lessons.
Each time I watch those scenes, I am inspired to take Hula lessons myself.
