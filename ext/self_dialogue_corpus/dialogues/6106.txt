Do you enjoy Disney movies?
Oh yes, I do for sure. My favorite is The Lion King.
I agree. The Lion King has to be one of my all time favorites too.
The movie sends such powerful messages to the audience, and it's followed my a fantastic soundtrack too.
Yeah, the songs are what really did it for me. "Can you feel the love tonight" gives me shivers every time I hear it.
My favorite was "Circle Of Life". The scene so beautifully portrays a new dawn and the beginning of a new life.
I loved that scene too. One of the most powerful ones in the movie for sure.
It is. It shows us how everything in nature and in life is so well connected.
It's a sad movie too though. It's one of the rare movies that drives me to tears.
Me too. No matter how many times I see it, I still cry at the scene of Mufasa's death.
