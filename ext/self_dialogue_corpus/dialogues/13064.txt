So, here's something interesting, I'm told there's some fans who are working on editing a re-release of the original Stars Wars movie.
Wait, you mean, A New Hope?
Yeah, but they're trying to get the version that was shown in theaters BEFORE it was retitled "Star Wars: A New Hope".  Reportedly, that subtitle was only added in later on.
But, didn't that film get release pretty much as is?
Not exactly, for instance, they had the Special Edition which added several scenes, including Han confronting Jabba and whatnot.
Oh, yeah, I remember watching that in the theaters.
Yeah, but a lot of fans prefer the original and they've been working on their own to get a cut of the film based on the original print.  I'm told it's a rather painstaking process.
Is that even legal, I wonder?
It's kind of a grey area... they're not doing it for profit, and it's not the first time a Star Wars film has been edited.  Consider, for example, the so-called Phantom Edit that came out around  in the year 2000.
Remember hearing about that... never did get to see it though.
