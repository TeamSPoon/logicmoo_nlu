Did you ever see the beatles perform live?
No too young, my parents did.
Mine too I think my dad still has his ticket stub.
I wonder if it would be worth any big money?
I doubt it, but we joke that if we ever get on antiques roadshow we may bring it and all his albums.
That is funny, but might profit. He has original albums or re releases?
My father has some of both, well all the re released everything but some originals still.
That is cool. i know the later stuff is suppose to sound better being remastered.
It is remastered but I still prefer the older original ones, I like a little crackle in the records.
Well to each there own. I like a clean sound myself but can see the charm of what you enjoy.
