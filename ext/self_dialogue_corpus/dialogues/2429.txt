Do you know what's going to happen to Brock Osweiler?
I don't think Cleveland has talked about what they are going to do yet, but I bet at camp there will be good competition.
I think so, I was just worried they might just cut Osweiler before the season even begins.
That wouldn't be very smart because he has good game experience and you never know with these young guys how they will do right out of college.
You're right, but I wouldn't be surprised if he is playing backup this year.
I'm not sure about that. Cody Kessler is not a starter caliber quarterback, it's too much for him.
Didn't they draft someone this year, fairly year on?
Yeah, they ended up with Deshone Kizer out of Notre Dame.
Oh yeah, now I remember that. He went in the second round, which I thought was a steal.
Only time will tell if it was a good pick, but they didn't reach for him and he's talented, so I guess we will see during the preseason.
It's always fun to watch the young quarterbacks be completely overwhelmed by the nfl level play.
It is, but Cleveland has been striking out at quarterback lately, so I think they are ready to win now.
Do you think Brock can help them do that? It seems he had trouble in Houston with winning.
Houston was not the right fit for him. It didn't fit his style of quarterbacking.
I think he was set up to fail in Houston because Bill O'Brien wasn't on board with his acquisition from day one.
That was definitely evident during the season. They had no chemistry whatsoever.
He had some good receivers there, but made such stupid mistakes. I can see why his coach was frustrated.
Denver was much better for him because Elway used his strengths.
Well, Elway had practice since Peyton really looked awful his last season, but found a way to win enough games.
Winning doesn't have to be pretty, teams just want that W!
