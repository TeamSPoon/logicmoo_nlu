Big Hero 6 was well done.
Yes I enjoyed it. Hero was a great character.
I loved Baymax. I bet he feels like a big blow up balloon.
It sure would be fun bouncing on him, ha ha. But seriously it was a good story.
Yes, it was sad when Hero's brother died. I was not expecting that.
It does seem like many characters get killed in Disney films.
It is meant to show resiliency in characters I guess.
Yes, I don't know how they would have made a good story about that without his brother's death.
Yes sometimes good characters die.
I cried when the original Baymax also "died". Glad he gave Hero his disk so he could rebuild him.
