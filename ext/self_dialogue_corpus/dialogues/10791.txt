Hey man what was your favorite Fast & Furious and why?
I'd have to say it was Fast 5.
Really? How come?
I liked the introduction of Dwayne Johnson's character. It really felt like he was a threat to the group.
Yeah his character was pretty aweosme. He did a great job on it.
In addition to that I really liked they way they paid respects to Paul Walker and his character. It was a real tear jerker in the theaters.
Yeah. I agree. It wasn't my favorite of the series but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't good.
What was your favorite?
I'd say Fast 7 was mine because of Jason Statham's character.
Nice choice.
