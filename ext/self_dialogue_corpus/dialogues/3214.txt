New Orleans Saints.
Yes, the unofficial rivals of the Bucs.
Yes. Did you know that this season is the last season of Drew Brees' contract?
No, i did'nt know that.
Well, it is. It made me wonder.
Wonder what?
Are they going to fight harder if it is Drew's lasy year?
An intreguing thought.
We have to play the saints twice this season.
Yes, that's what made me wonder. Is it going to be harder if they want to have a killer year.
Well, obviously so. The other question would be is how much life does Drew have left in him.
Or can the team carry him thru to the playoffs.
He could also be planning just renewing his contract and it will be business as usual.
That's a possibility as well.
I'll probably be watching the Saints in Pre-Season to see how they play.
That's a good idea, i will as well.
They have to face the Vikings and Patriots right out of the gate.
Thry also play us and the Falcons twice this season.
Interesting, i see a pattern where there is not a lot of mix in division playing this year.
Not with the Saints and Bucs it seems
