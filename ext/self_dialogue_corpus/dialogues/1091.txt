What's your favorite NFL team?
I'm a fan of the Buffalo Bills.
How do you think their new coach will do this year?
I think McDermott will really struggle this year.
Do you think he'll do better than Rex Ryan?
I think he's a better coach, but they still won't win much.
Really? I think that offense can be pretty good.
I just don't have much faith in Tyrod Taylor.
I think Taylor is pretty good. He doesn't turn the ball over.
That's because he doesn't take any risks even if he needs to.
That's true. Atleast you have LeSean Mccoy to watch.
Yeah, Mccoy carries the offensive load. If he gets hurt the season is done.
Injuries always seem to mess up a bunch of teams every year.
Well football is a pretty rough game.
I don't know what teams will do if the NFL adds more games to the season.
They're already allowed very little practice time. The quality of the games would get worse.
The NFL really needs a farm league.
I agree. It would really help the talent level grow.
Young quarterbacks would really benefit.
I don't know how much it would have helped the Bills. They always seem to pick terrible quarterbacks.
