any plans for the 4th of July?
I was planning on going to the Randy travis concert
Oh I love his song about america
"america will always stand"?
yes thats it, I am terrible with names
I thought it would be fitting for the 4th
where is the concert?
Its on the waterfront in Raleigh
Are they going to have fireworks?
Yes, I think it will be a great night, excellent music and fireworks over the water
Randy is amazing, Forever and ever amen is my favorite
Yes, his voice is so deep and clear
Do you listen to country most?
I do, but I love R and B and Pop as well
I secretly love Hunter Hayes because its country and pop combined
Yes, he sure does have an amazing voice
He is a cutie too, Scottie Mcreery is great too
we have the same taste
I think so, do you like any female singers
I do, but mostly prefer the deep male vocals
