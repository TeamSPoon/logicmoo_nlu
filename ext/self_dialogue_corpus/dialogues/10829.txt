Have you seen entire fast and furious series?
Oh yes! I just love that series!
Great. So tell me do you like brian's character?
Yes, he is good.
Okay. So do you like him more as a cop or as a street racer?
That's a tough question.
Still, you can pick one.
I think I like him more as street racer. It's more cool I think.
I agree. Being cop is boring.
Not always, but in this case I like him more as street racer.
