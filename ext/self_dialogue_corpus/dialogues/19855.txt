Do you remember the group that Justin Timberlake was in?
Yeah, NSync.
Oh, I couldn't remember the name.  When did they break up?
I think it was back in the early 2000's.
So, they were active in the late 90's right?
Yeah, I think so.
Who were the other guys in that group?
Um, there was Chris, Lance, Joey, and JC.
Oh, yeah.  Which one is the guy that hosts all those shows now?
Probably Joey.  I know I've seen him hosting a lot of shows lately.
Are any of them still involved in music?
I don't know.  Timberlake definately is, but I don't know about the other guys.
Wow, so they just broke up and went their separate ways?
That's what it seems like.
Besides Timberlake, none of them really seems to be in the public eye.
Well, like I said, Joey still does hosting gigs.  Lance had a radio show.
Yeah, but Justin still puts out music, acts, and does all kinds of stuff.
Yeah, that's true.
I wonder if they'll ever get back together.
I doubt that.  The closest that came was the MTV thing a few years ago.
