What is your favorite genre of music?
That is a tough question to answer.
Let's start with something easier: what are your top 3 genres of music?
I would say Alternative, Rap, and Reggae.
If you had to live without one of those genres which would it be?
It's hard to think about but I would say Rap. Mainly because it is just poetry over music.
So your two favorites are Alternative and Reggae?
Yes those are my two favorites.
I think we can limit this further. Would you choose Alternative over Reggae?
Yes because it encompasses more of the music I like. There is Alternative Rock, Alternative Dance, Alternative Hip Hop, etc.
Nice so we have limited it to one genre. What is your favorite Alternative artist?
I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers!
They are one of my favorites as well! What is your favorite song by them?
Scar Tissue is a great one.
Yes that is great but Can't Stop has always been one of my favorites by them.
I also like that song.
It is a really upbeat song I like to dance too.
Same here it is a really catchy song.
I'm glad we found a band that we both enjoy.
Same here it was nice talking to you!
