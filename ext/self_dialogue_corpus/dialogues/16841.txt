Do you like hilary duff?
I like her as an actress but not a singer.
she did have some bad songs I admit it.
How awful was the my generation cover she did?
It was pretty bad.
I think worst yet was the cover done with her sister.
I am not sure what song you mean?
The gogo song they covered, they destroyed it!
oh yes, our lips are sealed. It was very pop in their version.
It always felt pop like even in the original playful, but duff's was so overproduced.
I do think she struggles vocally some and they over work her stuff.
Yes she doesn't have a very big vocal range at all.
I like her still though.
I think she should stick to acting.
I know there is not much to her singing but I do enjoy it.
she had to turn down a big song because she could not hit the high notes.
Really? what song?
Kelly clarkson's  since you've been gone.
Oh wow, that was a huge hit. Too bad for hilary.
No, good for your ears more like it.
