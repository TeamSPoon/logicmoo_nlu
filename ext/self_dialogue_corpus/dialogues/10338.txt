Do you want to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
You know I do. I love an action packed Pirate movie!
Me too. I wonder how it will hold up to the other ones.
I think they've done really well so far. Each Pirates of the Caribbean movie seems better than the last.
I don't know, I'm still a fan of the first one. I doubt anything will top that.
That's true, I feel like that was the first time Johnny Depp realized that deep down he is a pirate.
A Captain at that! He has started to look more piratey over the years.
He really has. He plays the role so well, its easy to get immersed in the movie.
I agree. I don't think anyone could do a better job than him.
Who knows, maybe one day we'll be reading about Johnny Depp, commandeering a boat!
