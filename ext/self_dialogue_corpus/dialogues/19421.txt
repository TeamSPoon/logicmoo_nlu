Do you listen to Mipso?
No? Who are they?
They are a Indie Bluegrass band from North Carolina.
I've never listened to Bluegrass music. What's it like?
Bluegrass is kind of blend between country and folk music.
All right. That sounds interesting. Any songs you'd suggest?
I would suggest listening to "Marianne" or "Louise", those are their most popular songs.
What's your favorite album by them?
Definitely Dark Holler Pop -- it's a good introduction to Bluegrass and grassroots music in general.
Are they a famous band?
They were in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2015.
That's pretty neat! How long have they been around?
They're fairly new to the scene; they've only been around since 2013.
How did they meet as a band?
They all met each other while going to school at UNC Chapel in North Carolina.
That's a cool story. Are they on tour right now?
Yes! They actually are.
Really? Are they coming to any cities nearby?
Yep, they'll be in town next month if you want to catch the concert with me.
That sounds like a great idea. Thanks for letting me know.
