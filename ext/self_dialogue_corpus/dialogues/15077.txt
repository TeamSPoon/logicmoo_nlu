Okay, what movie do you put in when you're in a bad mood and need a laugh?
I think I've seen Caddyshack about 100 times.
So good! Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are amazing in that movie.
Haha, both of them were improvising a lot of their lines. That's a great formula for comedy gold, get funny people and let them do their thing.
It's like coaching a super talented basketball team, give them a little structure and get out of the way.
Another one from that era that I love is Airplane.
Another classic. I think Airplane might have better jokes, but the characters are better in Caddyshack.
I think that's a fair way to describe it. Although Kareem playing the pilot was pretty memorable and hilarious.
And Leslie Nielsen is going to make me laugh, no matter what movie it is.
Can't disagree with you there. Throw in the Naked Gun movies as other all time classics.
