Hey, which Disney movies have you seen lately?
I actually just watched, "Finding Dory" with my son.
That was an awesome movie. I didn't think I'd like it because of it being a sequal.
I get what you mean. Sequels usually aren't that good, but that one was awesome.
Yes it was! I love how they gave the backstory on Dory. She was one of my favorite Disney characters.
Me too! You have to love Ellen doing her voice.
She was a perfect fit for her! Disney did a good job choosing her as the voice.
What other Disney movies have you seen lately?
I saw Moana since Netflix has been streaming it.
That movie is amazing. Such a great role model for girls.
