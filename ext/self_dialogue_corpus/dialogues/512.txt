Can't wait for the upcoming NFL season.
I can't either. It will be here before you know it.
What are some memorable games from last season that really stand out for you?
Well, the Super Bowl certainly stands out for me.
It stands out in NFL history, that's for sure.
The Steelers Ravens game on Christmas really stands out.
That was a great game. Steelers looked down and out and Antonio Brown made that memorable play near the end zone.
He stretched out and clinched a playoff spot by inches. He doesn't get in there, game over, season over.
That Chiefs Broncos game really stands out for me.
The one on Thanksgiving night?
Yes, that one. It went back and forth and the Chiefs won in overtime.
Didn't that have some crazy thing happen at the end of that game?
I believe that's when the field goal banked in off the goal post.
I do remember something like that. Speaking of goal posts, remember the Arizona Seattle Sunday night game?
I wish I didn't remember.
Me either. But that was a strange game.
It ended in a tie, correct?
I believe it did. Something like 6-6 or 9-9.
There was some bad field goal kicking in that game.
Certainly was. I don't think there will be a game like that for a long time.
