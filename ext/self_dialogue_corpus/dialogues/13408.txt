Do you prefer older or newer Star Wars movies?
I prefer the older ones.
Me too. The empire strikes back was great.
Which of the characters are your favorites?
Carrie Fisher as Leia has always been my favorite. And yours?
Luke Skywalker, for everything that he represents in the movies.
What do you see as his main role in the movies?
He is the underdog with a courage to stand up against an overwhelming force.
Do you think he will be an important element in the newest upcoming Star Wars movie?
Yes, I believe so. He is the last Jedi and he's been trying to reestablish the Jedi order.
