Did you see the Giants extra inning game the other night?
Yeah, 17 innings, unbelievable!
Maybe, the Giants will get going now--it's been a rough start to the season.
What are they something like 12 and 24?
I think so--they are so bad I don't even look at the standings anymore.
I know I don't even know who is ahead in the division.  It's usually the Dodgers, but I don't think so this year.
Maybe Arizona, I'm not sure either.
It could be the Padres or Rockies as far as I know.
Anyway, back to the extra inning game--Posey winning it with a homer, that was something.
He was so tired after catching all those innings, he was more relieved than joyful.
And I can't believe the Giants relievers held the Reds down for all those innings.
Yeh, the pitching has been pretty bad all season and with Bumgarner out it is even worse.
But he hasn't even won a game this year.
Well he was pitching fine--not his fault we can't hit either.
We've gotten it going lately, some hitting, and I think we've won 6 out of seven games.
Something like that--won the Reds and Dodgers series, but now we're on the road.
Where are they going?
Chicago for one I think--Krukow and Keiper were talking about Wrigley Field being remodeled and complaining about the fact that it will be awhile before the announcers' booth is worked on.
Those guys are entertaining.
Well, I hope we can keep it going on the road.
