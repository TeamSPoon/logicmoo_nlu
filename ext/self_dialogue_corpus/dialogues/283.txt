the spiderman franchise sucks in my opinion.
what? why?
the plot is no good, thats why.
not all of it is bad though.
yes it is. they dont even keep consistent main actors!
that is true...
see? you dont even know what actor is the real one anymore!
why does it make you so mad?
because, a movie should have one consistent main character!
that is true.
