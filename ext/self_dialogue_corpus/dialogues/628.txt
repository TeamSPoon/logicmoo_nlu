I bet you are excited about watching the new NFL season starting in Sept.
Yea, I can't wait. I hope my team does better this year.
What's your favorite team?
The New York Giants.
They didn't do so good last season?
No, they didn't make the playoffs.
I thought they had good wide receivers including Odell Beckham.
Yea, he is great but they need a better running back.
Did they pick up one in the off season?
No,not really. I was hoping for that.
Eli Manning is quarterback for the Giants. Right?
Yea, but he is coming off a bad season.
Do you think they might need a new quarterback?
They did pick up a young quarterback.
Is he going to replace Eli?
No, not enough experience for that yet.
So do you think Eli still has it?
He is undefeated against the Patriots and Brady in the super bowl.
Well, hopefully the New York Giants will do better this season.
Yes, hopefully they will win the season!
