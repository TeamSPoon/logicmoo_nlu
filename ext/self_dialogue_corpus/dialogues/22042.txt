Did you catch any of the latest DC movies?
A few, Suicide Squad.
They really are bringing back so many of those characters in the movies.
Seems like they are trying to bring the whole of the dc universe into film.
Batman, Superman, suicide squad. Wonder Woman.
Even Batman vs. Superman. That was a really big movie
It was huge, the a real epic.
I could not believe they showed Superman dying in that film.
I am sure he will be alive in the sequel.
Did you think it was better than the old one?
The Reeves or the new, older, ones?
The Reeves movies.
No way, Reeves was a classic Superman.
The new movies are not?
No, the new films have their own take on superman, still cool, but not classic.
What about Batman in the film?
Daredevil, I mean Batman, was better in the film than expected.
That movie surprised me with how well it came out.
Not great, but I liked that they had a lot of action
I love any action with batman and Superman.
