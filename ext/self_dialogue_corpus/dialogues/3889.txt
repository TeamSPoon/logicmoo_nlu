What is your favorite thriller movie?
I have to say "Get Out" was exceptionally good.
Everyone loved that movie.
I can't deny it. It will be a welcome addition to my thriller collection.
What did you like most about it?
I really loved the idea of the sunken place.
I agree. That was a really cool concept.
I also really loved the focus they put on the fear that we express through our eyes.
The "deer in the headlights" look was a recurring theme in the movie, come to think of it.
Yeah, and they hit a deer in the beginning. It had awesome foreshadowing.
