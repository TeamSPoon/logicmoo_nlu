Are you excited for the new Star Wars?
The Last Jedi?
Yes, I can not wait.
I hope Luke has a bigger part in this one.
I think he will.
He only spoke like two words in the last one.
But, it still felt like he was part of the movie.
They did talk about him a lot.
I was excited when Ray found him.
I think that was one of the best parts of the movie.
