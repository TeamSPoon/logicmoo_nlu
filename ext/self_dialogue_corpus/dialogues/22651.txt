Do you care for Killing Daddy?
That was ok. That girl was something.
Torturing that guy that had a stroke.
Yes then blackmailing the lawyer that had the will.
I was hoping she would get caught.
Yes me too.
You see Mommy's Little Girl.
No.
That one was something.
Really. I will have to check it out.
Yes the little girl is evil.
Is she that bad?
She wrecks the whole family.
How about Mommy Dearest?
Yes now that is one evil mother.
She reminds me of a mother I know.
Are you serious.
Sure am. She was awful.
She must have taken notes while watching that movie.
I can't even watch that movie.
