Do you think anime movies will ever be treated seriously by the Academy Awards?
No way. Not only are they cartoons, they're foreign cartoons.
But Spirited Away won Best Picture the year it released.
And it's the only example. Nothing else has ever come close, and never will.
Jeez, that's sad.
Sorry, but animated films will never be taken seriously as a medium.
Well, why is that? I don't think they're any different than other movies?
You don't, but the Academy will always see cartoons as for kids, and won't even watch them.
What? They don't watch the movies they vote on?
In a lot of cases, no.
That's insane. A lot of great movies are animated.
I'm not disagreeing, but you shouldn't expect them to win any awards.
What about Pixar? They win awards.
But they'll never win Best Picture. They're exuded from that since they are in their own category for animated films.
I never thought about that. By having their own category those movies are excluded.
Yep, but awards aren't everything. As long as you enjoy the movie and recognize the beauty in it, that's all that matters.
I think you're right. Animated films especially are capable of capturing great beauty.
I agree. Heck, I'd say that even movies like Avatar which are live-action but use heavy CGI are animated.
James Cameron would never agree with that.
It doesn't mean he's right. If someone is creating images that don't exist whether by ink and pen, puppets, clay, or CGI, it's still animation.
