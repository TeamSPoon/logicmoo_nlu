I don't get what distinguishes heavy metal from hard rock.
You serious?
Yeah, I mean. They're both rock music, and they're both loud.
Okay, here's the main difference: the blues.
The blues?
Rock and roll is built on the blues, right? Hard rock, by extension, is heavily blues-based.
Okay, I'm listening.
Heavy metal, though -- its (very white) innovation is to take all the swing, all the blues out of hard rock.
How did they do that?
Look at the rhythm; there's no swing to it anymore. It's all mechanical, all square.
