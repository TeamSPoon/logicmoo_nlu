What's your favorite thriller movie?
Well I don't really have one, it's more a favorite writer.
Ok, who's that?
The only name that matters, Alfred Hitchcock.
I never saw any of his movies.
You have to of at least seen parts of them.
Not really, I don't really like old movies.
You're telling me you've never seen the shower scene from Psycho, or Jimmy Stewart looking out his Rear window?
Oh, I didn't know those were Hitchcock films.
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
