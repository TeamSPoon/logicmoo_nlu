So have you told your girls about the new Frozen movie?
Yes I told them at dinner last night.
What did they think about it?
They were excited. They can hardly wait to see it.
I told Marsha about it but she didn't seem tto thrilled.
Oh really, why?
She says she's getting too old for movies like that.
She's only eleven years old, how can she be too old.
I don't know, you know kids growup so fast these days.
Well my girls can't wait to see Ana and Elsa
