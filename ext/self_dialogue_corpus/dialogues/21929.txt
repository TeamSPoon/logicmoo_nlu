Tell me about this new live action Little Mermaid.
Well, it isn't at all like the Disney version. I think it centers around a mermaid at a circus.
Oh, so no prince and princess story.
Not that I know of. But I've heard Disney is coming out with a live action one based on their movie. Just not this year.
Disney is doing another Frozen movie too, right?
They are, but not until 2019.
That's so long! I feel like everyone will have forgotten by then.
I know. I really thought it should've been this upcoming winter.
I wish they would come up with more original movies rather than sequels and remakes.
Well, Moana came out this year and I think there's one in October related to the Mexican Day of the Dead.
Oh, I hadn't heard about that. It sounds interesting.
I looks really cute. Then again, most Disney Pixar movies are.
How many are there now?
I think there are 18 that are out and one upcoming this year, next year, and the year after.
Was Toy Story the first one?
Yes! It is confusing now though because Frozen and Moana are in the same animation style, but they are just Disney, not Pixar.
I guess I didn't realize that.
Yes so I get lost as to what is just Disney and what is actually Pixar.
I think my favorite Pixar movie is Brave.
I love that one!
