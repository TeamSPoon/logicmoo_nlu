What did you think of Revenge of the Sith.
Defintly the best of the prequels and a very good movie.
Yeah, I might even put it about Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, it had a great darkness to it you don't see a lot of.
Yes, and watching Anikan finally turn to the dark side was awesome.
And they had him full on Vader at the end.
Yes, the fight between him and Obi Wan was epic as well.
Not as epic as that fight between Yoda and the Emperor.
That was amazing.  They are both great dualist.
And have significant mastery of the Force.
