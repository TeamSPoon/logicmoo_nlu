Hey, what's that tattoo on your arm mean?
This?  It's lyrics from a Tom Waits song.
Tom Waits?  Never heard of him.  What kind of music is it?
He's like a growly bluesy mix.
Sounds like my cup of tea, what are some of his album names?
Small Change, Raindogs, Orphans - to name a few.
Awesome.  Got a favorite song I should listen to?
Well, Pasties and a G String is a pretty catchy tune.
What's it sound like?
Kind of a burlesque bouncing beat.
Really?
Yeah, it's definitely the kind of thing you could see a strip tease too.  Matter of fact, that's the theme of the song.
Cool.  And your tattoo - what's it say?
'And she made up her own language.'
What song is that from?
A song called Bone Chain.
Is that another one of your favorite song?
Sort of.  It was my mother's favorite!
So your whole family likes Tom Waits?
Pretty much!
