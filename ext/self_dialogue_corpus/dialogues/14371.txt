So I guess the finals will be Warriors vs Cavs again, huh?
I guess so. I can't believe how awful these conference finals have been!
Every game has been a blow out.
Not only that, the Spurs and Celtics both lost their best player.
Oh yeah, right. Spurs haven't had Kawhi since game 1, Celtics just lost IT for the rest of the play-offs.
I mean I'm sure the Warriors and Cavs were winning anyway, but these games aren't even competitive.
It sucks, but what can you do? Guys are resting all season but you can't stop in game injuries.
Exactly. And that whole resting thing needs to stop. Guys are going to get injured.
I just hope the finals aren't the same way. One major injury could be the deciding factor.
I agree. Both teams need to stay healthy so we can finally get a competitve series in this play-offs.
So who do you got anyway? Cavs or Warriors?
Oh, Warriors for sure. Kevin Love won't show up for the finals.
Wow, you think so? I thought he was decent last year. I'm more worried about Durant.
True, he did kind of disappear when OKC made the finals, but he's much more mature now.
I'm also interested in seeing if Draymond Green can keep his hot head under control.
No way. That guy is as animated as they come. I doubt he does anything for a suspension, but he WILL be loud every game.
So that's your only reason? Kevin Love? You don't think the Warriors are just better?
I just don't think LeBron can handle it all on his own. Kyrie will step up but they really need Kevin Love this year now that the Warriors are even more loaded.
I guess so. I still don't think anyone is stopping LeBron. He will average a triple double in the finals, I guarantee it.
We'll so about that.
