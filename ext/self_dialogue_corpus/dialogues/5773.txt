I want to rewatch all of the Pirates of the Caribbean.
They are amazing, we do need a new marathon now that there is another one out.
I don't think they could have picked a better actor for Captain Jack.
I agree, the entire movie series would be different had he been played by someone else.
Have you heard if Dead Men Tell No Lies will be the last?
I have, I hope it's one of those things where in a year or two we'll hear they are making another.
I guess the way the story plays out it could just be the beginning of the end. Meaning we'll get another couple movies at least.
That would be fantastic, I'm not ready to say goodbye to all of them yet.
As long as they don't start doing a bunch of weird spin offs, those are rarely ever good.
Oh I don't know, I'd love some spin offs of some shows I miss a lot, just to feel the story live a bit again.
