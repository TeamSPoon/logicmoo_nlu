Have you seen any good movies about gambling lately?
Well, I have heard of a few crappy ones.
Haha, like what?
Well, The Gambler was one I watched recently, but it was absolutely terrible.
Have you heard of the movie Casino?
No I haven't. Is it any good?
Yeah, I love it. I watch it all the time.
What is it about?
It's about guys from the mafia who take over a casino.
That sounds pretty interesting.
It definitely is, in many different ways.
Who is the main character in it?
The main character is Robert De Niro, along with Joe Pesci.
I love those guys, great actors.
Oh yeah? What movies did you see them in?
Well I saw them in Goodfellas.
That's a great movie.
Yeah, I also saw Robert De Niro in the movie Heat.
That's another great movie, if you liked that you will love Casino.
I'm definitely gonna have to check it out then.
