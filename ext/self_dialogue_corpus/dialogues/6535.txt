What was your favorite moment from Fantasia?
Cal me old fashioned but the Sorcerer's Apprentice part always gets me.
Is that the one with Mickey and all the brooms?
Yea, I think it's a classic.
Yea definitely. That part always stressed me out as a kid. I was always a big fan of the dancing hippos.
In the pink ballerina outfits? I loved them.
I cannot watch it and not laugh.
Yea they were hilarious. They were big but they could definitely move.
I wish I could stay on my tip toes like them.
Yea I never thought I'd wish to be as graceful as a hippo.
