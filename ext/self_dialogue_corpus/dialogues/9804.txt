Who is your favorite rapper from the past 5 years?
I'd have to say probably Mackelmore. I know he isn't like a super hardcore rapper, but I think his songs are really catchy.
Not to mention pretty funny...
Yea! His songs are hilarious.
My favorite song by him is "Downtown".
That song is too funny, the lyrics are hilarious. I mean it's a song about mopeds, it doesn't get better than that.
But funniness aside, Mackelmore is actually a really talented rapper.
Yea, I'd agree. And the stuff he raps about is really diverse...it's not just all about sex and girls and the "thug life".
Yea, he raps about thrift stores, mopeds, equality. I think those are things that people can relate to a little more.
For sure. His songs are so catchy too, they always get stuck in my head.
