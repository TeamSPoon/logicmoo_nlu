What do you think of the robots R2-D2 in the old trilogy?
He was alright.
Just alright he was a genius robot.
Yeah but the other one the gold human looking one was more of the brains of the operation.
R2-D2 didn't have voice capatability but he was smart.
Yes I suppose he was as smart as you could expect.
Do you think they were created in the same place or factory?
I doubt it they're too totally different models of robot.
That's a good point but still think it's possible?
Yeah anythings possible just unlikely.
