Trey, are you listening to Tears for Fears, man?
Yeah. Why do you ask?
I didn't know you liked that kind of music.
No offense, Larry but I grew up on these white boy songs!﻿
Shout by Tears for Fears is one of my all time favorite songs.
So did. I really miss the 80s!
YEAH! I Miss The 80's!
Music was so good then. Music had meaning.
This is the only kind of stuff MTV would play when it first came out, remember?  And Michael Jackson.﻿
Yep. Now they  are all about that reality TV mess.
This is one of those songs that you want to blast through your car speakers on the way down the interstate going about 75mph.﻿
I do that all of the time. I almost got a ticket last week for doing just that.
Seriously?
Yep. I was going down the interstate and this song came on the radio.
And before you knew it you were over the speed limit.
Exactly. A cop pulled me over but let me go with a warning.
Why didn't he give you a ticket?
This song was still playing. He was shocked that a black man was listening to this type of music.
You're kidding?
Nope. He said because he liked that song he would let me go with a warning.
