Do you like anime movies?
Not really, only Naruto when I was younger
What genres do you like nowdays?
I like mystery movies
Oh thats cool. What are some good ones?
I like The Usual Suspects
That's the one with Kevin Spacey?
Yeah. he's a really great actor in the movie
What else is good about The Usual Suspects?
It has the best movie ending of all time, by far!
Don't spoil it for me! I'll watch it soon!
You'll love it. Another good mystery kind of movie is Butterfly Effect
Whats that about?
It has Ashton Kutcher and he is wondering what effect his life has on the world
That's kind of deep. In 7 pounds the main character is thinking the same
I'll say that both movie are kind of similar
What does that mean?
You'll have to watch it to find out!
I am so curious now, I'll rent it tonight!
Watch it long before you go to bed, so you have time to think it over!
