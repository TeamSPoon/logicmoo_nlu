What's your favorite rock song of the 90's?
I think I'm going to have to go with, "One Headlight" by the Wallflowers.
Yeah, that's a great song though...But a bit depressing.
Name a happier rock song from the 90's, then.
Well, "Shine" by Collective Soul is a pretty good one.
That's true! I just thought of another one that puts me in a good mood. Remember, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by Deep Blue Something?
Oh yeah! I love that song! Are you aware of any rock bands from the 90's that are still around and releasing albums?
I know the rock band Soundgarden released one in 2011, but that is the most recent one I can think of.
I really miss rock music from the 90's. It had a touch that no other rock has.
I know exactly what you mean. It is my favorite era of rock music.
