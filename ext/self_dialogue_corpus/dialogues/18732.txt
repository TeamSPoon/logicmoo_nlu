Do you ever listen to classical?
Yes I do, it's relaxing and complex.
Sometimes I just need to hear something beautiful you know?
Yeah, I know what you mean.  It's pretty good.
Anyone you like?
I'm a Bheetoven fan.  All that power.
I'm a fan of the relaxing piano sonatas.
Nice, like Fur Alinse?
Yeah kind of.  I like Chopin too.
Talk about hard piano songs.
Yeah, Chopin was a beast.
You know who else?  Tchaikovsky.
Yes!  1812 Overture.
Yeah, every 4th of July that's one of the highlights.
I know, when the cannons go off it's great.
Yeah it is.  You know who I don't like?
Who?
Handel.  Besides Messiah it's just boring.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Not the best.
I'll give him a past though.  That was a long time ago.
