It has really been a long time since I've heard a good rap album.
Really? There's been tons of good rap albums.
Not for me. I stop listening to rap after Tupac died.
You've been missing out. There's been classics that have been released since then.
Name one good rap album that came after 1995.
2001, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City, To Pimp a Butterfly, I can go on.
I said just to name one!
I know, but I'm trying to prove to you that there's been a lot.
Maybe I'm just stuck in the past.
Maybe? You clearly are!
