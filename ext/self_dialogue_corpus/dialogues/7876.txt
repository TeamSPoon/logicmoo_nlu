Did you like Harry Potter the character in the movies?
Yes I think he is a very interesting character.
I like him because he's been through so much and so have I plus he never gives up on a task or a person.
No he doesn't he always persevere's to the end no matter the obstacles.
Wasn't his parents killed when he was a baby?
Yes they were protecting him from Voldemort.
That's right, not sure how I forgot about that.
I'm not sure either it's a big part of the story.
I love how he manages to always or most of the time come out of top no matter the circumstances.
Yep he's pretty clutch you could say.
