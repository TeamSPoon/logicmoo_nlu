Good! Just listening to some music.

The Flaming Lips
I've heard of them, they're great.
Yes, I'm a big fan. Do you have a favorite song.
I don't know enough of their music. What is your favorite?
I like "Do You Realize"
I don't think I have heard of that one before. Is it new?
No, it has been released for a few years.
I will have to check it out.
Do you have a favorite band?
I really like Imagine Dragons.
They're huge, one of the biggest rock bands in the world.
Yes, and they've only been around for a few years
How did they get so big?
They had lots of radio play and also several big placements in TV and movies,
I will have to listen to their most recent album.
You should! They have a song called "Warriors" that came out fairly recently and is catchy
