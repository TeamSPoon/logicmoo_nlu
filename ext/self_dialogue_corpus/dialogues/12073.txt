How did they build that base on Hoth?
Maybe it was an old empire outpost.
I doubt it. Maybe they mainly used natural caves.
That sounds very possible. They just brought a bunch of equipment to the existing caves.
It did seem a bit chaotic and disorganized there. Not like an true military base.
They probably couldn't have been there that long without being detected.
The Empire is always good at detecting things.
But not so good in finishing off the resistance.
True, they should have been able to crush them easily with the Jedi weakened.
But good always wins.
