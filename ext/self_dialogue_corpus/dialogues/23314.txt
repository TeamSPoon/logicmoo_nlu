What genre of movies do you like the best?
I would have to say, horror films.
Like the gory scary, or the suspense stuff?
I like both, all of them. All scary stuff.
Do you like the Blair Witch movies then?
I do. The paranormal films are always the most scary.
I like them. I have been trying to get more into horror films any recommendations?
You could start small, with something like, Rear Window. Very suspenseful, but nothing too much at the start.
What about a lot of action, like scary action?
I would go with the sort of teen thrillers. Like I know what you did last summer.
That one is scary?
It really is. There is the Freddy Krugar movies too. They are just frightful.
I have never even seen one of them. Any with a lot of scary paranormal stuff?
The Haunting in Conneticut. I almost could not finish it how scary it was.
I will check that one out. What about funny and scary.
For funny on purpose, I would say the Scary move franchise.
Is there a not funny one purpose type?
Oh yea, the ones that are so cheesy they are funny.
Like what?
A little known horror film called, Them. It is about demon spiders. Very dumb.
