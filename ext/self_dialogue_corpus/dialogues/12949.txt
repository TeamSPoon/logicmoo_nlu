Star Wars original trilogy soundtracks. Which is your favorite?
Oh man, that is such a hard question. I loved all three.
Me too. John Williams is one of my favorite movie composers.
I think it's more like, I have certain musical pieces in each film that are my favorites.
I love the jawa theme from the first film. The oboe melody is just great.
I really like the Darth Vader theme introduced in Empire Strikes Back. It is so military and creepy and powerful.
One of my absolute favorite musical sequences is in the original Star Wars, the scene where Luke watches the twin sunset on Tatooine.
Yes, that melody is Williams at his best. So sweeping and orchestral and emotionally evocative.
I got the complete soundtracks when they came out, and I listen to them often.
The music really holds up. It's a testament to Williams's talent that the scores are still so standout.
