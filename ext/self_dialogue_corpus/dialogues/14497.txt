Can you see the Nets  ever getting back to success?
In what respect?
Perennial playoff contenders.
Geez its tough to envision that right now.
Is Billy King the worst GM Ever?
I mean theyre trades really hampered them.
If losing the pick to the Celtics wasnt enough.
They lost next years pick too.
Thats what I am saying.
Not sure how you overcome that.
Its going to be a long rebuild for them.
Do you think theyll weather the storm?
No, theyll be bad for years to come
Over a decade?
Itll probably take that long.
Unless they can get free agents.
Yeah but thats not how the NBA works anymore
Sure it does.
No you have to draft some of your guys.
I dont think you have to
