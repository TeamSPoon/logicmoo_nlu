Did you ever see Zootopia?
That was such a cute movie! My kids love it too.
I was surprised by the social commentary I found underlying the message.
Oh it was definitely in your face. Secret Life of Pets was another good one too.
That reminded me a lot of Toy Story, the way they have their own separate lives from adults.
You know the bunny in Secret Life of Pets? Kevin Hart did the voice.
Oh I knew he sounded familiar. Have you seen BFG yet?
Oh that was surprisingly good, I loved it. The giant was so sweet.
Yes and Steven Spielberg directed it.
You can definitely tell, his hallmark lighting is all over it.
