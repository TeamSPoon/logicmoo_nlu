Man, just got back from the Pink Floyd concert.  It was Rockin'
Really, me too.  It was loud.  My ears are still ringing.
Mine too.  How'd you like that ending.  What a finally.
I know.  I didn't expect that third encore.
Me either.  We were starting to head out of the arena when they came back on.
Excellent.  Couldn't believe they played the entire Dark side of the Moon.
Blew my mind.  And they had the big pigs floating above too.
Yeah, too bad Roger wasn't with them though.
I know.  Would have loved to see them in the old days when they were all together.
I know.  Do you got their latest album?
I do.  I'd been waiting a long time for it.  I've got all their albums.
I heard they were going to put out a CD of this concert too.
I wouldn't doubt it.  I know they did for their Momentary Lapse of Reason album.
Yeah, I've seen that one before.
I went to that tour also.  Delicate sound of Thunder is the name of the tour. It was great.
Ain't no band out there like them.
Never was and never will be.  They got a sound all to their own.
That's for sure.  But I doubt they will put anything else out now.
If they do I'll be one of the first to pick it up.
In the mean time I'm gonna go listen to some WHO.  Later.
