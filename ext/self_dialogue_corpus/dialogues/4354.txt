What is your favorite thriller movie?
That is a tough one! I would narrow it down to either The Sixth Sense or National Treasure.
Interesting choices. Why do you choose The Sixth Sense?
I love that movie! Bruce Willis was amazing as the shrink. I never caught onto the fact that he was dead. It shocked me!
It shocked me too! What a good thriller.
Absolutely. National Treasure is a great thriller as well.
True. I that movie does always get my heart rate up.
I know! Watching them as they are being chased throughout America's most historic landmarks gets me so nervous!
I agree. They are constantly trying to outrun criminals, police, and time in that movie.
It is exhilarating to watch!
