What's your favorite movie genre?
I really like thrillers or horror movies.
Aren't those like the same thing?
Sort of. One is about killing and gore but the other is about suspense and mystery.
What's a good horror movie?
I really like It. A classic movie about clowns.
I think I know a good thriller movie, the Invitation.
I've heard of that, with the dinner party?
Yeah man, that movie was super suspenseful.
A nobody even dies for the first hour or so
That is why is was so suspenseful!
The whole movie was so mysterious!
I was on the edge of my seat for like the whole freaking movie!
Oh man, I get freaking goosebumps when I watched it!
What are some other good thrillers?
Creep was a really good too.
What's that about?
A guy gets a job to film a guy's life, and you start to learn the guy is pretty dang weird.
