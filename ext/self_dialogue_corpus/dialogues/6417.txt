Have you ever seen Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame?
No I must have missed that one
You should watch it. It's one of my favorites.
Oh yea? Why is that?
It's not your typical movie about a princess in love and distress.
So it's about a hunchback in love and distress.
Well, yes but it's much darker.
Darker than..LION KING?! BAMBI?!
Different kind of dark. Lust from a priest, corruption of the church...
Well that does sound different, I'll check it out!
