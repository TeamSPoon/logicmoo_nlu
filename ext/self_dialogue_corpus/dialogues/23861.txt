Have you ever watched the Godfather trilogy?
Of course it is one of my favorites.
Which of the three did you like the most?
I liked the first one. The first one. It has story and it had, you know, what-will-happen-next anticipation and yeah, but all three were good
Well, it's interesting, you're favorite is a trilogy, and my favorite is a trilogy too, and that's the Godfather trilogy, and my favorite is the second one.
Oh, you like the second one. That's surprising! Most people like the first one the best.
I like the first one a lot but I like the second one because DeNiro is in it and I like the story of Don Corleone in Sicily as well.
Ah, yeah, flashbacks!
Yeah, and I think that the real conflict in the story comes out in the second one. More so than in the first. I see the Godfather trilogy to be very similar to a Shakespearean kind of trilogy, tragic, I think that Michael Corleone is a tragic hero and I like Shakespearean trilogies to so perhaps that's why I like it.
Oh, that's a really good explanation
Did you ever watch the Romeo and Juliet movie?
No it was not something that interested me. You?
Yea I though it was different so I watched it, but it did not really compare with the classic Shakespeare movies.
Who is your favorite actor?
That is a tough question but I would say Anthony Hopkins.
I really liked him in Hannibal.
Yeah he did a great job in that franchise. Did you think the movie was scary?
No not really, I thought it was more of a drama than a horror movie.
Do you like horror movies?
No not at all, they are way to scary for me.
