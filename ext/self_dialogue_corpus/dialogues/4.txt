how long do you think the new Justice League will be?
I think itll come in at 3 hours.
That is insane.
Infinity Wars will be about the same.
But we dont know that much about the charactes.
I agree we dont but thats why itll be long.
I think we need an introduction to say an Aquaman.
He can be developed throughout the story
No I dont think they can do that with time restraints.
I dont know who you could consider a major villain either
