Have you seen the live action version of Beauty and the Beast?
No, but I really love Emma Watson.
Me too.  I think she will do a good job in the role.
She's come a long way from her Harry Potter days.
This is very true.  Have you seen the trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge?
Yes!  Did you see on the news where Johnny Depp went to Disneyland and dressed up like Capt. Jack Sparrow?
Yes!  I thought that was really cool.
Yeah, I wish I was there during that.
He's had some troubles lately, but I am still very much a fan.
I agree, I can't wait to see this movie!
