I used to collect Disney movies. I wish I had kept ahold of them.
Oh really? What was your favorite.
I think Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite.
Have you seen the new one yet.
Yes and it's ok, I just preferred the animated version. I'm old school I guess.
Yeah, we grew up in the era of Disney movies like Aladdin.
That was one of my favorites too! Robin Williams was awesome in that one.
I used to love one about a girl who got kidnapped and some mice who saved her....I can't remember the name.
Oh! The Rescuers!
Yes! That's it!
