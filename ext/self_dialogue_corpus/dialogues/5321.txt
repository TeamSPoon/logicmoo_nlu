I just saw The Lion King recently with my grandkids.
Oh, I like that one.
I don't like the scene where the father lion dies.
Poor Simba thinks it all his fault.
I know.  But then he meets Timon and Pumba.
And learns the best song - Hakuna Matata!
It means no worries!
We should all live like that - no worries!
I know.  But he meets Nala and they live happily ever after.
Like all Disney movies, right?
