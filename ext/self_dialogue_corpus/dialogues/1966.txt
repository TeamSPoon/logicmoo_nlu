I don't know why you root for the Pats
They're the home team, you gotta support the locals
Yeah but Belichick's a hack, Brady too
So?
So why root for dirty cheaters?
The franchise is bigger than a couple of guys, not all of the Patriots are cheaters
I still don't get it.
Well I've been a Pats fan my whole life, I'm not going to jump ship just because we have a few bad eggs on board right now.
Whatever, go Steelers!
Steelers?  Seriously?
What?
They're not even going to make the playoffs
You're the one who just lectured me about sticking with your team...
Yeah but you're not even from Pennsylvania
But my Dad is, and I grew in a Steelers house.
Fair enough.
But they could make the playoffs this year.
They wont
It could happen
A flying pig could happen too, but it wont.
