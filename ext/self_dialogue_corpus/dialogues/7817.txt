Did you ever have the thought that maybe Snape was a good guy?
I never once thought that. I was taken by surprise.
Me too. It made me kind of sad that he was given such a bad rap and he was helping the whole time.
I know and the fact that he'd been in love with Harry's  mother and was teased in school made you really feel for him.
I know that was sad. It explains how he felt towards Harry.
I agree. It doesn't excuse his attitude but he'd really been done bad.
I love Alan Rickman. Anytime I see him in any role I can only think of him as Snape.
Me too! I think he was born to play that role.
You're right about that. I would have actually loved to take his Defense Against the Dark Arts class.
It sounds like it would have been the most interesting of them all.
