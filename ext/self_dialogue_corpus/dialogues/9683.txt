So who do you think is the best in the game right now?
In my opinion, Kendrick Lamar easily.
Really? Which album do you think would be his masterpiece?
While Good Kid M.A.A.D City and "Damn." were great in their own lanes, I think To Pimp a Butterfly will stand the test of time.
True though, to be fair, I think it's a bit lazy to outright say Kendrick is the best.
Who else is possibly better?
Well there's J. Cole, Kanye West, Vic Mensa...the list goes on.
Yeah but I don't think they can touch the pedigree of Kendrick.
Well then why hasn't Kendrick dissed Drake yet?
Wow, that's a good point.
