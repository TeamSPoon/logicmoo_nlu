Do you know the song, 'Bad Things' by Machine Gun Kelly?
Yes, I've heard it.  It's quite catchy.
I agree.  It's been stuck in my head all month.
Did you know the chorus was actually sampled?
I had no clue.  What was the original song?
The original song was was 'Out of My Head,' by Fastball.
I don't know who that is.
They were a popular band during the nineties.  I'm a huge fan still.
What are some other songs by them that you would recommend?
I would listen to 'The Way' and 'You're an Ocean.'
