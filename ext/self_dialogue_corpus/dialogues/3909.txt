Did you watch the New Wolverine movie?
What is it called?
It called Logan.
Oh no but I want to.
It is really excellent.
Ok now I want to see it.
There are some really great scenes in that movie.
Wow that is somewhat surprising they can make a sequel that great.
It is one of the best sequels of all time.
Wow thank you for telling me.
