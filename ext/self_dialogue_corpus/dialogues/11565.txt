It's so hard to believe Beatle songs are more than 50 years old!
I know.  And I only ever bought one album - Rubber Soul.
I like how their music changed through the years.
Like Sgt. Pepper.  Those songs had deep meaning.
The songs bring back so many memories.
I can associate the songs with good times in my life.
The wrote such wonderful songs that hold meanings for so many people.
Yes. Their songs stand the test of time.
So sad they broke up.  But at least they continued solo careers.
So sad John and George are not here.  But their music lives on.
