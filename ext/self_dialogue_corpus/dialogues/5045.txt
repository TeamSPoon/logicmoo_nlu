That Bryce Harper extension was a shocker.
In what way?
The amount of money given to him.
Yeah but why not long term.
Makes you think they dont want him around?
Trout got a multiyear deal.
True, I guess they are treading water for now.
Yeah but its baseball without a cap, it makes no sense.
Well maybe they dont want to commit to him.
How many guys are like him?
He is a generational talent.
So why not make him your cornerstone.
This is true
I think thats going to hurt them in negotiations.
Yeah if I am Harper I might not sign back with the team.
Hes gotta be hurt in one respect
But on the other hand he just made some serious bank.
And if he has a bad year?
I think they look at it as an abberation
You could be right with that one
