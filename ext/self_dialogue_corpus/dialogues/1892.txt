So what do you think about the NFC North race this year?
I mean it's probably going to be the Packers?
I was just listening to a podcast and they had Minnesota as 1?
What? What did they think made Minnesota any better than last year?
I really don't know. They got to a fast start last year at 6-0, I think, but then completely collapsed.
Yeah, and I think that collapsed part of the season is more indicative of their real team.
Definitely. What's funny though, is I think the Teddy Bridgewater injury actualyl made them better?
Hmm interesting. Not a fan of Bridgewater?
Not at all. He had an incredibly weak arm and people assumed he was mobile, which he wasn't.
Well, we may never know if he was any good now. He may never play again.
In a way that kinda annoys me, because I kept on telling my friends about how I thought he was a lousy QB and they loved him.
Yeah I guess it'll have to be a truce now.
But not even, he's been lackluster in the games he's played so far. Saying he is good is like saying Brock Osweiler is elite.
Hahahaha. Okay how about this. Who would you rather have...Alex Smith or a healthy Teddy Bridgewater.
Oh my god. Definitely Alex Smith. Not even close.
Okay, well I agree with you on Alex Smith over Bridgewater. Let's be clear that Alex Smith is not elite.
Well, yeah I guess. But he can get the job done, he is just not agressive.
Fair enough. I think it is telling that the Chiefs traded up to take Mahomes this year.
Yeah that shows they are frustrated with how conservative Smith is.
Andy Reid does have a good record and feel for QBs. It will be fun to watch the Chiefs this preseason.
