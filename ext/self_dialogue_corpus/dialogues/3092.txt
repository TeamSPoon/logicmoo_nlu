Who do you think will win NFC North this year.
I'm not sure.
I'm thinking it will be the Lions.
Really?
Yeah, I think this is their year.
They have been pretty poor for a long time.
They have.  But I think they have built a pretty good team.
I'm not so sure about that.
Who would you pick?
I always think the Packers will be in the running.
They usually are.
They on the other hand have been good for many years now.
They have.
Ted Thompson does a great job building the team.
He does.
They seem to have an eye for young talent.
They do.
And they build their players well.
I think they give them great skills in practice.
That is exactly right.
