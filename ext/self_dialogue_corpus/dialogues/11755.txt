Hey Dad, remember when you used to tell me to "turn that garbage off" when I was listening to the Beatles?
Yeah, why do you ask?
Well, I just noticed you singing along to "Elenore Rigby" on the classic-rock radio.
So?
Well, "Elenore Rigby" is a Beatles song.
It is?
Yeah. It was in their movie Yellow Submarine, way back in the mid-sixtys. I was in high school then and you hated everything I listened to.
Well, it sounds so much better than anything else being played now, I guess I've kind of gotten used to it.
Come on Dad, admit it. You've more than just "gotten used to it." You've actually learned to like the song.
Okay, I'll admit it. Just don't tell your Mother. She still says no music worth listening to has been released since 1955.
