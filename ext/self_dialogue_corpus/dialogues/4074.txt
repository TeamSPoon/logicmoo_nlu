Hey  how are you today? Can I help you find a movie today?
You are so weird? You don't work in a video store any more!
How about a thriller to day? Whatever ait means to be a thriller today?
I like what people used to consider thrillers like Rear Window.
Have you seen the remake with Christopher Reeves? It was in 1998.
No I haven't. But how can you live up to the 1954 version with Jimmy Stewert .
I haven't seen the 1998 version. The Alfred Hitchcock version is just so good.
I love Christopher Reeves so that one might be good.
This is true. He was great as Superman,also in the movie Somewhere in Time, and  there's one other I can't think of at the moment
I think I will watch the 1998 version of Rear window.
