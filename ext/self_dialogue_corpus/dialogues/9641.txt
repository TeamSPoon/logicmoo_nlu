What's you're favorite rap group ever?
Mine would definitely be Lost Boys. Their song Renee just gets me every time.
Mine would have to be Mob Deep. I think they're the most influential one ever.
Mob Deeps cool too. I can't believe Prodigy is dead now.
I know right! Such an awesome rapper.
Still though Lost Boys are my favorite. Why can't rappers be like them anymore? I miss the stories these guys tell.
I know. I don't care how much money you lie about having, or about your gold necklace.
HAHA! Yeah, I'd rather be told a story and entertained. Not Hearing about your gold teeth.
Whatever happened? I don't get these guys now a days!
What I really don't understand is the people who keep buying this new garbage!
