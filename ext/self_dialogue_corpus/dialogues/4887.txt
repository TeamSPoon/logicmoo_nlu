Do you like baseball?
It's okay.  I'd rather play than watch, it just seems like there's a lot time with not much going on.
You think the games are boring?
Some parts.  If it could just be the highlights, that would be great, with ten minutes a game, all the best hits and catches and outs.
That's not the way it works.
No, but it should.  I mean, I've watched some of a no-hitter and sure, there's some tense moments, but mostly it's just a guy throwing to another guy.
Have you ever been to a game?  Not just watched one on TV?
Yeah, in Seattle.  The field was really green and I guess some of the stats were kind of interesting, but it got a little boring after a while.
I guess if there aren't many hits, it can be a little tedious.  So, do you have favorite position?
To watch or to play?
Either, both.
Well, I can't really pitch and my throw is little short for an outfielder, so maybe first base.  Watching, though, it changes a little depending on the caliber of the player.
So, you just like the really good players?
I like really good players, but what I mean is that some seem to have a little more flair a little more style when throwing or catching.
I guess I get that, some players seem to just have a little more presence.
Yeah, they seem to be the ones who make these amazing catches or throws.
How are you as a batter?
I'm okay. When I've played, I usually get a hit every other time at bat, though mostly singles.
I'm not really a great hitter, I can only ever get fast balls and the pitcher learns that pretty quick.  But I'm pretty damn good as a catcher.
I could see that.
