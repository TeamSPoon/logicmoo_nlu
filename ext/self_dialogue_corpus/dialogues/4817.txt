Hey whats chilling i am at the cubs game and it is pretty chill.
Your at a cubs game no way how?
I won some tickets and i have been dying to go to a game this season.
Yeah i am definitely jealous of you.
You should stop by  maybe get a ticket.
Nah i cannot afford that how is the game going currently
Currently the score is pretty intense
How intense is it.
Every oufield guy is picking it up like mines and giving them no time it is a riot.
I hate to miss that.
Yeah it is pretty good and their are still over 5 innings left.
Well at least they are doing well i planned to record the game tonight so i can watch it later.
That was my plan but i got this and i actually got a ball  that got hit into the stand
You gotta get Perez to sign it.
I did not think about that but that is an excellent idea.
You should also get Michaels to sign it too
Multiple signatures would be awesome
It would also make a good souvenir for the baseball collection.
I do need to get more memorbillia for baseball and this is a perfect start.
Exactly and it will be a unique item in your collection.
