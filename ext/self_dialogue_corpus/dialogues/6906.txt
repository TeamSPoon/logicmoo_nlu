Can you believe that Cars 3 is now out in theaters?
It's kind of hard to believe there is a Cars 3.
I guess they think people want more Lightning McQueen.
Maybe so. Have you seen any of them?
Yes, I've seen Cars and Cars 2. Have you?
I have. What did you think of them?
The original Cars was pretty good, but I didn't really care for Cars 2. Things got a little dark for me.
I know what you mean. I wish they would have just left it alone.
Mater, Doc, Sally, and all the rest of them are what made the first one so good.
I know. If they bring in a bunch of other characters it just won't be the same.
