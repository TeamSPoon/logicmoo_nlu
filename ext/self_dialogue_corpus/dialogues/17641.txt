Hey, a group of my friends and I were having a discussion on the best female pop singers of all time. Who would you put up there?
Well right off the bat you have to consider Beyonce. She was and still is one of the greatest.
Yeah she is okay but I was never really a fan of hers. I always preferred Mariah Carey more than Beyonce.
Yeah she was good to.
I just felt she could do a lot more things than Beyonce.
I would also have to put Taylor Swift up there in that category as well.
Taylor Swift? She is a country singer not a pop singer.
Well actually now she has become more of a pop singer.
I don't know. I just don't trust a country singer turned pop singer.
To be honest, she is probably a better pop singer than she was a country singer.
If we are talking about pop singers who are most popular now I would have to go with Katy Perry.
Oh I love her. She is a great artist.
Yes she is! What are some of your favorite songs of hers?
Well of course I would have to say Roar first of all. I also like Firework, Wide Awake, and California Girls.
Yeah those are some of her best. I would have to say Last Friday Night is my favorite.
Yeah I like that one a lot and I love to watch the video for it.
Yeah her videos are all really great and usually they have a funny side to them.
I think we should go and watch some of her videos now.
Definitely. Which one should be first?
Let's go with Last Friday Night!
