What do you think about rock music?
I love it! It is all that I listen too.
Me too, who are some of your favorites?
Well, being from NJ I would have to say that Bruce Springsteen is definitely one of them.
Yea, he is good. But I still prefer the bands like Credence Clearwater Revival, Marshall Tucker and the good old Southern Rock Bands.
Heard it in a Love Song was one of my favorite Marshall Tucker Songs.
Oh mine too! And Down on the corner by CCR.
Yea that had such great songs back then.
They sure did, that is why people are still listening to them today.
You are so right!
