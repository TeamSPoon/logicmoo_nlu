So football season is almost upon us once again.
Ugh.  Yeah I know.  Time to become a football widow again.
I kind of like watching sometimes.  I like the Steelers they have some great players.
The Steelers are the Cincinnati team right?
No, I think that's the Bengals.  The Steelers are from Pittsburgh.
Oh yeah that's right.  Wasn't there an ohio team who started in Cincinnati first and then moved?
Yeah I think it was the Cleveland Browns maybe?
I don't think the Browns are a very good team are they?
No I don't think they have won a game in like 30 years.
No surely it hasn't been that long!
No it's probably been more recent than that.  But they don't give up, they just keep going.
Yeah you have to admire their stamina despite almost always losing.
That's true.  They are truly the underdogs and when they finally do win the super bowl, or even get to go, it's going to be epic.
I don't see that ever happening. It might, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
It would be great to see a team that hardly ever wins go out there and win it all one season.
Yeah that would almost make me want to watch football.
I know right! All the predictability makes it almost boring to watch.  Like where is the fun with all the stats?  It's like you already know who is going to win.
It does take a little of the surprise out of it.
Wow, our husbands would love to hear us talking like this!
Yes but let's never tell them, then they will want us to watch the games with them.
