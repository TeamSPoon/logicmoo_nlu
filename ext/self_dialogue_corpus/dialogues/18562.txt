Man, I miss Biggie Smalls.
You? I miss him and Tupac.
What was you favorite Biggie joint?
Man, he had so many of them. I like all of his stuff.
Word. Me too.
But for real though, that Life After Death album was tight.
Man, he copied off of Tupac with that joint.
What you mean?
'Pac put out a double cd, then here come Biggie doing the same.
But 'Pac did it twice. He did All Eyez on Me and then he did R U Still Down.
R U Still Down came out after he was dead.
But that's because he had already recorded so many tracks it had to be a double cd.
Yeah. I like Ambitionz of a Rider from that All Eyez on Me joint.
Man I like that whole thing.
Then you got Biggie with Nasty and I got A story To Tell.
Man, both them dudes were the truth.
I know right.
Damn shame Both of them is gone.
Rap game ain't seen nothing like either one of them ever since.
And never will my dude.
