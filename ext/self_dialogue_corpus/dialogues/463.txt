Hey how do you think the Texans will do this year?
I think they are going to be pretty good since they got rid of Oswyler and drafted DeShawn Watson.
Yea, I think the defense will be better since JJ Watt is healthy.
Wade Phillips taking full control of the defense should definitely help.
Well what do you think it will take for the offense to get better?
If Fuller can just not drop so many passes and if Watson starts I think that would help.
Oh yea and if Lamar Miller can actually find a hole to run through!
Yea, since they upgraded the O-line this year.
What do you think about Oakland relocating out to Las Vegas?
I don't know, I wonder how being in Vegas will affect betting on the games.
Do you think Oakland will get another NFL team?
I don't think so since San Diego just went to LA so now there are 2 teams in that area.
So who do you think will end up in the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Patriots and the Falcons again.
So do you think the Falcons would choke again and blow a 2nd half lead?
No, I think they win this year because Matt Ryan is a more confident player now.
Yea, the Patriots did lose some good players and Brady is getting older.
Yep, and Atlanta picked up a lot of good players this year.
So what do you think the final score will be?
27-14 Atlanta!
