Hey, did you watch the latest Jason Bourne movie.
Yeah, I thought it was pretty dissapointing.
Why?
It just seemed boring.
Hmmm. Did you like the other ones.
Yeah, most of them.
Which was your favorite>
Probably the first one.
Yeah, I think that was the best one too.
I really like Clive Owen.
Was he in it?
Yeah, he was the main assasin after him.
Oh yeah, that guy is good.
He is.
Alright, second favorite.
I like the one with Hawkeye.
Oh yeah the guy from the Avengers.
Yup
What is his name?
I can't recall right now.
