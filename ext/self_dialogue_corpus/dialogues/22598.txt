What are some B grade movies that you like?
Gosh, long list.  Does that include deliberately bad like Sharknado?
Sure, Sharknado will do.
Okay then, my all timer would be Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
Mine would be a flick called The Stuff.
I think I've seen that one.
All of those old Flash Gordon movies they used to show on Friday nights.
Before my time I'm afraid.
I used to stay up late on Friday night as a kid, some of the horror was really bad.
Sure but some was good, did you ever see THEM?
About the radiated killer ants.  Oh yeah.
I can still picture the little girl holding her dolly.
Another one was The Blob.
Didn't that have Michael Landon in it?
One that's been remade several times is The Thing.
You know, I think the 1950s original is still my favorite.
Some of these movies are actually pretty good. How about Ishtar?
Yikes, so bad.
I think Road House with Patrick Swayze may be the worst.
I'll have to try to NOT see that. lol
