Do you have a favorite underground rapper?
Yeah, I have a bunch. One of my recent favorites is a dude called Despot.
What song should I listen to by him?
"House of Bricks" is his big single. It goes hard.
Dope. I'm gonna add it to my playlist, who else do you like?
My all time favorite underground rap artist is Deltron 3030. He does sci-fi themed hip-hop that is super great.
I've heard of him, he goes by some other names too right?
Yeah, Del the Funkee Homosapien.
Yeah, I recognize that. My favorite underground hip hop artist also has multiple names: MF Doom, Viktor Vaughn, Madvillain, et cetera.
I completely forgot about him. He's one of the most agile lyricists to ever live.
