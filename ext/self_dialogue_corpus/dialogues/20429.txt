Has anyone seen the Lego Batman movie yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
It came out in February of 2017, but  I have not seen it yet.
Who plays in it?
Will Arnet, Chris McKay, Zach Galifianakis, Rosario Dawson and Michael Cera play in this animated film.
That's a nice cast!
Yes, it is. The Director is Chris McKay.
Ah, he acted in it too! That's great!
Yes, the budget for the film was $80 million, and they blew that out of the water with $311 from box office.
Wow that is fantastic!
As far as critics go, they gave it 7 out of 10 stars overall.
I am sure the kids love seeing this movie.
They do, and it is amazingly smart and funny.
Do you think your husband would like to go see it?
Yes, if we can take the kids.  They would love it.
Perhaps, I can take mine and you can take yours on Saturday.
That sounds fun, if I tell the kids tonight they will not be able to contain themselves till then.
What time do you want to go see it?
How about 1pm Saturday?
Sounds like a plan, see all of you then!
