Do people even listen to the radio anymore?
I try to, every time I'm in the car. But I just end up turning off the radio, feeling frustrated and annoyed.
Why do you feel frustrated?
Because all the stations play the same songs over and over. I swear if I hear Adele sing, "Water Under the BREEDGE" one more time... Just say BRIDGE!
Very funny. Yeah she is very overrated. I mean she has a beautiful voice and all, but....
But the truth is her songs are boring as hell. She only really had two good ones, "Rolling in the Deep" and "Someone Like You".
But everything she releases seems to be a hit.
People don't know any better! That's all they hear, day in, day out. They're brainwashed by advertisers into thinking this is talent.
Hmmm.. that could be true.
And all the classic rock stations I listen too.. they play the same songs by the same bands over and over!
For example?
The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Journey and The Eagles. Oh and lately there's been a Def Leppard revival but only with their worst songs.
You should start your own radio show.
If I did, my playlists would be radically different. I'd teach people about classics that haven't been done to death.
So if you did do your own classic rock radio show, you wouldn't play any Stones or Led Zep?
I might, but I wouldn't be caught dead playing, "You Can't Always Get What You Want" or "Stairway To Heaven". And no Aerosmith either?
You wouldn't play any Aerosmith? They're one of the biggest bands in the world.
Unfortunately. I might play Dio's cover of "Dream On", which in my opinion is superior to the original.
Is it? I'll have to check that out.
You can find it on youtube, you'll see what I mean..... radio needs something new to keep it going into the new era...
