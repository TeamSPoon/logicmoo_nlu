What's your favorite ska song?
Oh that's tough. I'd have to say "old west" by Five Iron Frenzy.
What do you like about it?
I really like both the lyrics and the sound. It's a really serious important subject but it's done in such a fun, happy, upbeat way, and it's sarcastic, too.
I love sarcasm and how ska bands seem to love incorporating that into their songs.
Me too. I think a lot of people don't get it though.
I don't know how, I mean, a lot of times they're really obvious about it to the point of almost being corny.
Everything about ska is a little corny though.
Not everything!
But anyways that's why my sister won't let her kids listen to certain ska songs. She's afraid they won't get the sarcasm either and think they're promoting certain things.
Oh, I could understand that if it's kids who might not get it.
But still you'd think she could just explain it to them and let them come to their own conclusions.
Yeah, especially with the amount of sarcasm and satire that's in sk, they'd be missing out on so much great music!
Yeah! Who are some of your favourites?
Me? I like Less Than Jake, The Insyderz and Spring Heeled Jack.
You have good taste then.
I should hope you'd say that, you were the ones who introduced me to them!
Oh, so I was.
I'm really glad you did. Ska has become one of my favourite kinds of music.
Mine too.
