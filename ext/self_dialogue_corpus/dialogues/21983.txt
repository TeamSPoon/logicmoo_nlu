Have you seen "Get Out"?
Is it that horror movie that was recently released? No, not yet.
It's a masterpiece. You should really see it!
I'll check it out, then. What is it about?
Well I can't spoil the plot too much, but I can say it's more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie.
That's reassuring to hear.
And it has a underlying message about racial tensions in the US. It has many well-though analogies and metaphors.
Sounds great! Do you have other recommendations?
Well if you like thrillers, I'd also recommend the recent movie, "Split."
Oh I've seen that! The one about the guy with dissociative identity disorder, right?
Yes, that one. I went in with low expectations because it was directed by Shyamalan.
Me too. But it turned out to be much better than anyone expected.
I really like how they showed the psychiatrist's passion about dissociative identity disorder.
Yeah, that made the film much richer. It also made me want to learn more about this disorder.
Do you think Shyamalan has redeemed himself as a director, now?
I don't know. Lots of people were really disappointed with what he did with "Avatar: The Last Airbender."
That movie was quite a disappointment, especially for all the fans of the TV show.
Well, at least he's going in the right direction now.
Do you know if he's directing any films now?
I've heard he's directing a film called "Glass," that's being released in 2019.
