Why are people always making fun of the Stormtroopers in the movies?
What do you mean?
Like in the original movies, about them not being able to shoot and hit anyone.
Well, you have to admit, they destroy more walls than they actually hit anyone.
True, but you do have to remember that they were trying to capture Han, Leia and Luke.
They were?
Yes. They were trying to recapture them to get the plans back from them, and also to find out where the rebel base was.
Why would they want the plans back?
Because the trio hadn't delivered the plans to the rebels yet. Without the plans, there is no attack on the Deathstar.
Ok, so maybe the stormtroopers were better shots than people give them credit for.
