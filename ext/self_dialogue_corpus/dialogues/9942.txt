Is Eminem your favorite rapper?
He's not my favorite but one of my top ones.
Whats your favorite song of his?
Rap god.
Why that one?
Well it really shows his maturity as he's gotten older and his skill especially his speed.
He is so incredibly fast in that song I don't know how he does it.
He is above everyone else in my opinion.
He's a lyrical genius if I've ever seen one.
So few of those today.
