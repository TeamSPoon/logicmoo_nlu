What types of horror movies are your favorite?
I love the classics.
What do you consider classics?
You know the ones with Jason, Freddy and Michael Myers.
Oh yeah, those are cool. Who is your favorite killer?
I'd have to say Michael Myers, he was always so cool about it.
Yeah,  He had a silence that was creepy yet intriguing.   Who is your favorite?
I liked Freddy, mainly cause he was funny at the same time and deadly.
I see that,  He did crack a few jokes.
But of course Jason was always smooth for his kills, and no matter how fast they ran he caught up to them with his slow walk.
