Hey, I'm looking to go to Coachella. Do you want to join?
I would most definitively not like to join.
What... why?
Well, how many are going?
I have five so far.
Well, that's too many people in one van for a long trip to Nowhere, California.
Okay... but it'll be fun.
It's full of hipsters and obnoxious celebrities.
Well, it will cost a lot, but you've never gone to a music festival before.
So it's a rite of passage?
Yeah, that sounds about right. Plus Lady Gaga will be there, and you love her.
I do love her, but I'd rather watch her in a small venue.
Have you ever been to a festival?
Yes, to hear Meatloaf.
How was it?
Well, he sung great, but I hated the venue.
You just hate everything, don't you?
Pretty much. You know I don't like crowds, crowded areas, and hipsters.
Sorry for inviting you.
It's okay. I forgive you.
