I watched 101 Dalmations the other day.
The live-action version, or the original one?
The original one. I forgot how good it is!
Yeah, it's a really fun movie.
I like the style of animation it uses. It's kind of stylized, and it fits the setting.
And all the puppies are so cute!
I really like Cruella de Vil as a villain, too.
Oh, she's one of the great Disney villains!
Her look is so distinctive, with her black and white hair.
You just shudder when she comes on screen, and that's part of what makes the movie great.
