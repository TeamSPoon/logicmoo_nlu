Which is why I keep saying, they need to remake the originals.
Oh, God, I'm going to kill you, then I'm going unfriend you on facebook, stop following you on twitter.
You're just upset, because you know I'm right.
I'm not upset because you're right. I'm upset at the thought of redoing a part of Americana. The original trilogy is a part of the American heritage. They're not just movies. Can you remake "It's a wonderful Life?"
I don't see why not.
Ok, I'm going to unfriend right now. You're not my friend any more. You are an enemy of the American people
Upset. I'm right. Rinse and repeat.
No!. You're NOT right!. You're wrong! The original trilogy is fine as they are!
Fine except for all the incongruities. That means being out of place, by the way.
I know what incongruity means! And no, these are NOT examples of incongruity.
