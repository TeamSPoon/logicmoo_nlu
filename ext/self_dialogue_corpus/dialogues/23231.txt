Did you ever see the Twilight movies?
Oh yeah they weren't too bad. I thought they kind of butchered the books though.
My girlfriend really likes Robert Pattinson, so I went to see them in theaters with her. Personally I think the girl who placed Alice is really cute.
Yeah I've seen her in a few other things, she is pretty adorable. What was your favorite scene in those movies?
Well as a guy speaking, I really liked the final battle in the last one. Even thought it did all turn out to be fake.
I thought that was a clever way to give people some action and still retain the story. Kudos to the director.
What did you think about the CG werewolves?
Oh they weren't too bad. I think looking back on them a few years later it doesn't quite hold up, but back then it was okay.
Yeah it's crazy how poorly some CG actually ages. But it's better sometimes than the alternative.
What do you mean by that?
Well like take for example the first Underworld movie. They used puppets for their werewolves and it was absolutely terrible.
I think I remember that! You're right, they did look pretty bad.
Even at the time they came out they were the worst. I tried to go back and watch that movie and couldn't even do it.
Speaking of movies from the early 2000's, did you like The Matrix?
Man I was a kid when that thing came out and I loved it so much. The first one anyway.
Oh yeah, well the second one wasn't too bad. There's like a 30 minute action scene in the middle that I really liked.
You mean the whole chase scene where Keanu Reeves is trying to get to Morpheus and the others and they're on the freeway?
Yeah that whole thing, starting with the big fight in the mansion. Talk about adrenaline pumping awesome!
You've got a good point. I think maybe I'd like to go back and rewatch that; not the whole thing, just those parts of it.
And don't even bother with the third Matrix movie, Matrix Revolutions. It was terrible.
