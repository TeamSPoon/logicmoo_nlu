Yes that's correct D, C,F, E is what you get transpose Bb, G#, C#,  C.
Yes. I am good at this.
Well now consider the last rule.
Um... what was the last rule?
Begin the row with any note you want except without repeating the notes. Well, that's more like rule 1 AND 4, but anyway
oh yeah...
Consider the following notes.  D, C,F, E, Bb, G#, C#,  C.
Um, those are the same notes we did before.
Yes, Now you're gonna treat them as a row.
So the row is now D, C, F, E, Bb, G#, C#, C?
Yes. What's wrong here?
Oh... C is repeating.
Precisely. How can you fix this?
We constructed this initially by tranposing the retrograde by a 3rd.
What happend is if transpose it by a 4th?
Let's see. I should've gotten Eb, C#, F#, F?
Yes. And if you were to use that in your row, can you?
No.
Why not?
Eb, C#, F#, F, Bb, G#, C#, C now gives me repeating C#.
