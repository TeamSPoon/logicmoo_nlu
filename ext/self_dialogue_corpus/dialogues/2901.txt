How many teams are there in the NFL?
I think there's 32.
Wow, so many!
Not really, I would think there would be more.
Right, cause there's so many people in the United States.
Yep, like 318 million or so.
How many people are on each team?
I have no idea, maybe like 30?
Yeah, and then gotta add assistants and water boys and such.
Sure, so more like 50.
Still, that's a lot of people.
Yeah, I think most of the teams are pretty spread out in the U.S.
Probably, there's probably a lot in the north though.
Specifically north east, I would assume.
Yeah, I wonder where the NFL was formed?
I believe Ohio, if I'm not mistaken.
So yeah, northern teams would be popular.
Mhm, I think southern teams are popular too.
Some states don't even have a football team!
I know.
