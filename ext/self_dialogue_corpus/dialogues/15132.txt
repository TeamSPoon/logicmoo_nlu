You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
One hundred percent. Practically inbred PA-dutch.
Ha, that's super white.
So what would you like to know?
Tell me about your music.
MY music, or PA Dutch music?
Your culture's.
Look, they're not "my culture" as it's kind of dying off.
Just talk about the music.
It's super basic, really. It's basically folk songs with basic accompaniments.
Is it nice to listen to?
it's basically a step up from church music. It's super boring but simple, not offensive at all.
What are the songs about?
Same folk song material as others: family, love, food, homeland, and religion.
What's the most popular song?
I'm not sure.
Edelweiss?
That is well known, but it's Swiss in origin, actually, so not completely PA dutch.
Then what?
Hei Lie, Hei Lo is one, and Schpinn, Schpinn is another. They're all forgettable.
