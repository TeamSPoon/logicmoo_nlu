I love Disney movies. I see them even though I'm am adult and have no kids.
I love them, too.
I remember going to see Beauty and the Beast, the animated version, in college.
You don't think of college aged kids going to G rated movies.
Well I did and I loved it.
I did as well.
Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast?
The one with Emma Watson?
Yes, that one.
No, but I hear it's great and I plan to see it.
