What have you been listening to lately?
You know me, all kinds of things. A lot of country actually.
Old stuff or new?
A mixture. I have a country playlist of 3000+ songs and at least 500 different artists.
Wow, that's a lot of music. Do you have a favorite artist?
I definitely couldn't just name one, but Tim McGraw will always be towards the top of the list.
Are him and Faith Hill still married?
Yeah they are. In fact, I want to say that they released a new duet within the last couple of years.
Oh really? I guess I didn't realize Faith Hill was still producing music.
You know, I can't really say I've seen any solo work of hers lately.
Maybe she just gets featured on some of his songs.
Yeah, that might be all she does now. I want to look her up and see what she's up to these days.
Speaking of classic country female artists, isn't Shania Twain working on a new album?
Is she? That's so exciting! She's one of my all-time favorites.
Me too! She's been around for a long time. She's definitely a pioneer.
I agree. I'll have to look her up to and see what the deal is. Do you think she'll go on tour again?
I hope so! That's one artist I have not gotten to see play live yet.
Oh, she's fantastic in concert. Maybe if ,she comes to town, we can get tickets!
Sure! We can make a night of it.
Dinner, Drinks, and Shania Twain! That sounds like my kind of night.
