Do you have any heavy metal or hard rock music you think is best to listen to?
I don't really like hard rock or heavy metal all that much.
Not any of it?
Well, sometimes I like to listen to a little bit of Metallica.
Their new stuff or older stuff?
I really prefer their older stuff, from a few years back.
I really haven't listened to much of their music. What do you like about it?
I really like the guitar playing.  He does an awesome job!
What's the most awesome part of it?
Just the speed and intricacy you can hear in his playing.
That's pretty cool.
It really is.  I believe he had classical training.
I hadn't heard that.  Pretty cool and interesting!
Yes it is.  You like them?
I do.  I like all of their albums, from the old to the new.
What's your favorite song?
I think mine has to be Enter Sandman.
That's a pretty cool one. Did you see them doing that one with Jimmy Fallon?
No!  I love Jimmy Fallon, and I can't believe I missed it!
You should go look up the video.  It is neat!
