What is your favorite ship in Star Wars?
I like the Emperor shuttle?
Why?
It's roomy and seems cool.
I never got into the Sith storyline.
I wasn't a big fan of all the prequels but the original trilogy was really good.
What did you think about Jar Jar Binks?
He's terrible.  What were the writers thinking?
I know.  Maybe they were trying to be more inclusive.
Ha ha.  Just like Jazz on Transformers.
