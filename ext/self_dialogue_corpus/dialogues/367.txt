What did you think of Deadpool?
It was interesting seeing a superhero movie rated R.
Yes, there was a lot of aggregious swearing.
It felt like a lot of the gore and dialogue was in it just to prove that they could with an R rating.
Yes, but it was a good mixture of funny and epic.
I agree, Deadpool is a great superhero.
His romantic interest is an interesting character as well.
Agreed. I hope they make a sequel.
I heard something about one in the pipeline.
Will deadpool be introduced to the Avenger's team?
