So football season is coming up. Are you excited?
Absolutely!  Even after last year, when the Falcons chocked so badly
Oh yeah, that was one for the record books!
I doubt that will game will ever be forgotten
Do you think the Patriots are going to take it all again?
I think they'll make a good run, but no one is on top forever.
Good point, and no one is always a loser
And THAT'S why I'm still an Atlanta fan!
Haha!  Okay, but it's probably not their season this year either.
So who are you watching, other than the Pats?
The Steelers look very interesting this time around
Yeah?  Didn't their owner just die?
Yeah, but their defense this year is AMAZING
I'm looking at the Seahawks this year.  Their defense will also be very strong
Yeah, Seattle has really put effort into building
They're hungry for another bite of the apple after last year
Speaking about a comeback, Sports Illustrated has a lot of faith in Greenbay this time around.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, they've put a lot of work on their offense
Well, they have some ground to make up!
