What do you think about Zootopia?
you mean the movie inside of which a bunny trying to make friends with a fox?
yes
I think it was okay. Over all, it's simply too simple and childish for adult to watch
why is that?
I mean there are some good value in it, but I just don't see how a bunny can make friends with fox
that's kinda true
I think it's better for movies to lead kids to a direction that reflects reality, not completely away from it, one day they'll learn the hard truth
well, you covered it all
did I say too much?
