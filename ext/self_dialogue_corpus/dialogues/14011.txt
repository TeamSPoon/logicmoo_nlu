Did you know Lady Gaga has a foundation called the "Born this way foundation"?
No, I didn't what do they support?
It is a foundation that focuses on promoting youth empowerment and combating bullying.
I wonder if she was bullied as a child.
I don't know but she is so different I'll bet she was.
Have you heard the song she sang with Tony Bennett?
"Cheek to Cheek" I love that song.
Me too and their voices blended together so beautifully.
I think I saw her on the television singing a country song.
Really, that would be cool.
