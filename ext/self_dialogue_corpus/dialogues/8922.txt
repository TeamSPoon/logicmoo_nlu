I saw Imagine Dragons in concert yesterday.
How was that?
It was awesome.  They played tons of new songs from their album that will be coming out.
They have a new album soon?
Yep, I think it gets released this Friday.
Oh nice.  You'll have to let me borrow it.
Some of their new songs have been on the radio.
Yeah, I've heard that Believer song way too much.
True, but a couple of new ones will start to go into rotation.
I'll have to be on the lookout for them.
