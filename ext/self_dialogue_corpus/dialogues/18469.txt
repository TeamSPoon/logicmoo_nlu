Hey what kind of music do you listen to?
I listen to many types, but mainly listen to pop music.
Have you heard the new Miley Cyrus song?
I don't think so, what is it called?
I think it is called Malibu.
No I have not heard that. Should I listen to it?
Yes it is much better than the music she has been making the last few years.
That's good. I did not like the music she has been making lately.
Same, I don't think she is acting as crazy and outrageous any more.
That is good, she has the ability to make great hits when she tries.
Hopefully she is going to continue making music like this newest track.
That would be nice, so what is this song about?
It is about her feeling free and happy on a beach in Malibu with her boyfriend.
Sounds like a pretty peaceful song.
It is a very chill song that is nice to hear when you want to just relax.
Does it have any featured artist or is it a solo?
It is just her in the song, which I would prefer anyways.
Me too, because she has a great voice alone
So are you going to check it out later?
Yes I will when I get home.
