Who was your favorite character in Beauty and the Beast?
Mrs. Potts.  Definately.
What do you like so much about her?
When Angela Lansbury sings the theme song, it is so beautiful.
But Angela Lansbury does not really have a great singing voice.
Not really, no.  However she has a certain quality to her singing that's very sweet.
I liked how Mrs. Potts interacted with her son, Chip.
I don't know how, but somehow I found a chipped cup to be cute.
Do you think they will create a Beauty and the Beast sequel?
I kind of hope not.  They got it right the first time around.
