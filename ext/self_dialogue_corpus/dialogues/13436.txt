Hey, you a Star Wars fan?
Somewhat, I remember watching the original movies on VHS when I was a little kid.
I haven't gotten into the new ones as much, but the original trilogy is an all time classic.
For sure, think about how many recognizable characters there are, from Chewbaca to R2D2 to Darth Vader.
And saying something like "the force" and everyone immediately knows what you're talking about.
My favorite part is the concept of something as powerful as a death star, and yet they are able to defeat it somehow.
I loved the light saber fighting. We used to play like that when we were kids.
Me too, the whole idea of being in outer space and fighting an evil empire is super fun.
It's funny, the people who played that way as kids still dress up like that to see new Star Wars movies.
Good point, it's a lifelong following.
