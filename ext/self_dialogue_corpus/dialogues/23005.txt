Are you into violent movies?
Yeah, I am. Why do you ask?
Well, I'm just looking for a good violent movie to watch.
Well, have you seen the movie Django Unchained?
No, I haven't. Is it good?
Yeah, It's really good.
What is it about?
It's about a slave who gets freed and becomes a bounty hunter.
That sounds awesome.
It is really intense at some parts.
I bet, who are the actors in it?
The main character is played by Jamie Foxx.
He is such a great actor.
Yeah he is, and the guy who frees him is played by Christoph Waltz.
Isn't he also in the movie Inglorious Basterds?
Yeah, he is the evil Nazi in that movie.
That guy is a really good actor too.
Yeah he is, and they both ended up making Django Unchained a great movie.
Isn't Leonardo DiCaprio in that movie too?
Yeah, and he plays an extremely racist slave owner.
