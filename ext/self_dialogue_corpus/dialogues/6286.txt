I have to admit something to you.
Oh yeah. Confess away!
You know how I constantly make Bambi jokes. I've never seen Bambi!
Your secret is safe with me. Your jokes always made sense so I never questioned it.
Oh good! I'm glad it wasn't obvious that I hadn't seen it.
It definitely wasn't obvious. I do the same thing with a few Disney movies.
Really, what do you do?
I always make jokes about the spaghetti kissing scene in Lady and the Tramp.
Me too! But I actually saw that movie.
I've seen a clip of that part. I think it'd be much messier in person.
