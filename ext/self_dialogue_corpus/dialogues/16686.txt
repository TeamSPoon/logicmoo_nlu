Hi.
Hey.
What's going on?
Not much, you?
Same.
Cool.
What kind of music are you into?
All kinds of genres.
Is there one in particular that you like the most?
I tend to just listen to whatever sounds good to me.
I see.
Yeah it's not really something I think a lot about.
Just kind of whatever is playing?
I guess to an extent.  What about you?
Like genres?
Yeah.
I like rock, r and b, soul.
Gotcha.
Good talking to you.
