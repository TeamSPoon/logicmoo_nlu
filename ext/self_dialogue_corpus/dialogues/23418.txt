How many movies do you go see in a year?
Probably only 2 or 3
Do you prefer to watch them at home?
Yeah thats what I like better
They are going right to DVD alot quicker.
I think soon enough it will be going to DVD while still in theaters
I dont know that seems too progressive
People are more on demand than ever before.
While that is true, I think theres  still a market for the theater.
No doubt, but this is simple enough.
I hope they dont all end up straight to DVD.
Like most of the American pie films
Speaking of, did you see they are filming a new one?
With the original cast?
Yes.
Thats crazy I thought the last one was terrible.
Their audience matured but the plot didnt.
Thats what I didnt like.
That they had the same jokes?
Yes they were improbable some of those situations
