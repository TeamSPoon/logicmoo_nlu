Hey did you see the Reds and Cubs game yesterday?
Yeah, but I had to turn in early.
Oh okay, well it was a great game because the Cubs won!
Oh nice! What was the final score?
The Cubs ended with 9 and the Reds had 5.
How are the Cubs doing this season? Do you know?
Doing alright! It is a close season so far though because they are 21-19.
Where was the game yesterday?
It was at Wrigley Field. I have been there a couple of times and hope to go again soon!
Yeah, I have been there too!
Yeah, so Lester extended his winning streak at Wrigley Field yesterday to 11 straight at Wrigley now!
Oh nice! Bryant is lookin good and can knock it out!
Yeah, he hit a home run!
I thought that I heard on Sport news that his BA is .297. Does that sound right?
Yep, that is was I heard too.
Do you happen to know how much a ticket runs these days?
For Wrigley's Stadium?
Yeah, I paid about $50 dollars the last time I went but I was wondering what they cost now?
I know that you can get a real good ticket, on Stub Hub, for around $165 now.
Cool & Thanks! Have a good day..... I am gonna look into getting a ticket now!
