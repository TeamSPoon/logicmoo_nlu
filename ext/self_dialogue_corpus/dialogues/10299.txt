Have you seen Lethal Weapon?
I remember seeing it years ago.
I love it so much. Mel Gibson did a great job in that movie.
I agree.  My favorite part is when he was fighting with the bad guy in the movie.
Yeah it was packed with action.
The whole movie was literally packed with action.
Yeah.  I love the whole series of them.
Me to.  I wish they would make more Lethal Weapons.
I don't think they will, the actors are getting to old.
Maybe they can do a spin-off with new actors.
