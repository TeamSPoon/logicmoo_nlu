What is your favorite thriller movie?
Nightmare On Elm Street
One...two... Freddy's comming for you!
Haha!  Yea, it has some great scenes
Honestly the entire series is great!
Yea, except for Freddy VS Jason
Yea, that was just some rediculous fight where nobody could even win
Exactly!
But I dont see it as actually pat of the series
Yea, it's more of a spinoff!
