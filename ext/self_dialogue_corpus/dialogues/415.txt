Hey, man, did you catch the NFL draft?
Yeah, I caught parts of it, they had some interesting picks here and there.
Oh, anyone in particular you thought was a good choice?
Well, again, only caught part of it, but I think  Solomon Thomas for the 49ers might be a good choice.
Yeah, could be, he seems pretty versatile Only thing I find odd about him as pick is they already got decent defense men.
Well, you can never have too many defensemen as long as you're not neglecting the other areas you'll need.
Yeah, that's true.
What about you?  What picks did you find interesting?
I thought Joe Williams was a good pick, myself.
Oh, missed that part.. where did he get picked up from?
Utah.  He's got a pretty record with speed he's got like 1,407 yards on 210 carries.
Oh, not bad!  That'll be good for dodging tackles and whatnot.
Yeah, that's what i was thinking.  Did you remember any other picks you got?
Well, not sure about "good" but definitely notable...  Reuben Foster.
I think I heard about him.. did he fail a drug test?
Yeah, that's what I meant about concerns, but lot of his teammates support his character so, the result could have been a false positive.
Well, it's not like there no drugs in the NFL... I mean, if you took out everyone I bet half the teams would have to stay home.
Yeah, that's true, but from what I understand, the guy was really sought after, even got a A+ rating from Niner's wire online.
Wow, they're awfully pick about who they get anything above a "B" to.
So I've been told.
