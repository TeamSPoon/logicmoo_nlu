Have you ever seen Bring Out the Dead?
Isn't that the one with Nicholas Cage?
Yeah, and Patricia Arquette
Yes, but it was a really long time ago.
I just caught it on TV last night. It made me think of you.
Yeah it was difficult to watch in places.
I remember that you told me that you used to be a paramedic in Detroit.
Yeah about ten years ago. It definitely wasn't easy.
Did you identify with anything in the movie.
Oh, yeah, especially about taking the people you couldn't save with you.
What do you mean?
When you can't save someone, there is a lot of guilt that goes along with that.
But it's really not your fault......
I know, but still......
There was a lot of comedic moments in the movie though
Yes that definitely helped lighten the mood for me
I don't really like Nicholas Cage in most things, but I think that this was his best performance!
I agree, he's a great actor, but maybe his movies aren't usually my speed.
I hear that it won a few awards.
I think it deserves it. I was a good, pretty well balanced film.
