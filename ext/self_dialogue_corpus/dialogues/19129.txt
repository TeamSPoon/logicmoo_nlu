Hey there! What have you been listening to on pandora?
I have a number of stations created but mainly random stuff
Oh yeah? my playlist is pretty huge myself. Listen to techno?
Oh yeah! what kind are you into?
Well most of my stations vary, I have old school, to bass, some edm, and dance.
I'm getting heavy into hardcore dance myself.
I do have one heavy hardcore dance station right now actually.
What djs?
To be honest, most of them are names I've not been exposed to.
Does it seem like they are pulling from mixed cds?
Oh yeah, the album covers seem to be mixes from cds I assume you could buy.
But good right?
Absolutely. One cd they keep pulling songs from is good enough that I was to buy it. Just can't remember the volume number.
What's the name?
Hardcore Dance.
Should be easy to google and then match the album art.
I haven't thought about that honestly.
That's how I've tracked down a lot of the cds I have seen on pandora.
Well thanks for the tip!
No problem!
