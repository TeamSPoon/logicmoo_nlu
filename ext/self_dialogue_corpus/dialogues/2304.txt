Have you heard of the Cowboys 2016 draft pick Jaylon Smith before?
The name sounds familiar but I can remember.
He was a stand out linebacker for Notre Dame.
Yeah I know who you are talking about. Didn't something happen to him?
Yes it did. He suffered what many people thought was a career ending injury in his last game as a college player.
Oh yeah. What type of injury was it?
A knee injury. I am not completely sure but I know he had nerve damage so there was a lot of concern about his future.
That sounds bad. Why would the Cowboys draft him?
Well without the injury Jaylon would have probably been drafted in the top five but when the Cowboys second pick came up he was still available and they took a chance.
Yeah! A big chance. That seems like a huge gamble.
The Cowboys had their personal team doctor look at his knee and he was confident it could be repaired.
That sounds promising. So that was two years ago, how is he doing now?
His surgery and rehab went great and he is now practicing with the team!
Sounds good but what is he saying about his knee?
He is saying it feels great. One-hundred percent and he expects to be out on the field this season.
Have you seen him practice? Does he look sluggish?
Not at all. There have been several videos posted online of him working out and practicing and he looks quick.
So it sounds like he will be able to come in and make an impact immediately.
The Cowboys need a pass rusher badly and Jaylon look like he might fit the bill perfectly.
I hope so. If this gamble pays off and the Cowboys end up with a top ten pass rusher it would be one of the biggest draft steals ever.
