how did you feel about rogue one?
it messed me up!
i know, same here!
i guess i went in knowing everyone might die, but...
i don't know. i was expecting at least one person to live!
i was HOPING! at least the droid
they couldn't even give us that one thing?
i guess it was a suicide mission
i still wasn't prepared
i'm not sure i ever will be!
