Do you have a favorite actor?
That would be Tom Cruise.
He is a good choice. Lots of work done.
Ya, It seems like he is constantly working.
Very true. heard his newest film the mummy was real bad though.
I have not seen it. It did not get well reviewed but still want to see it.
i think he does some cool stunts in it. As per usual for Tom.
That is one reason I love him so much. Admire that he does mostly all his own stunts.
That is cool. He must pay for so much insurance.
Him or the studio probably.
What are your top two cruise performances?
Top spot has to go to A few good men. That courtroom scene was history making.
It was a good scene. Very iconic.
Ya and totally quotable. So identifying.
That was more jack's lines in it though.
I suppose that is true. Not just Cruise making that scene what it is.
What is second on your list?
I've always enjoyed his performance in Magnolia.
That was a great film. His character was pretty interesting.
He sold it so well. I feel he is such a gem in the acting world.
