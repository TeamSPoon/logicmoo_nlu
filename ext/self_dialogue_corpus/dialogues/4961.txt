Have you been to the Braves' new stadium at SunTrust Park?
No, but we have tickets for later in the season.
Which game are you going to?
We are going in August to see the Braves vs Reds.
Awesome! My favorite player is Nick Markakis, who is yours?
I really like Freddie Freeman. He's a great hitter!
Yes, and a great 1st baseman!
I really wish the Braves would make it to the World Series again.
Yes, we are overdue for a World Series win!
Those guys in the 90s were fantastic players!
I used to love watching Tom Glavin, John Smoltz, and David Justice play.
Me too, and I miss seeing Bobby Cox running out onto the field too.
We have some talented players, we just need to get it together.
We're still in the "rebuilding" phase.
I really think Freeman, Markakis, Kemp, and Swanson are going to the ones to lead the team.
It will be interesting to see how this year goes, especially with a new ball park and location.
I saw an article the other day in AJC that called the park a "Home Run Hitter's Paradise."
I'm sure Freddie Freeman is loving that!
I still miss Turner Field though.
Yes, lots of good memories there of many good ball players that came through.
