Have you heard of Fifth Harmony?
Are you kidding me, of course I have, they're like one of the most popular pop singers
indeed, man you gotta check out their music video
which one? they have a lot of music videos.
Can't remember the full name, something to do with work
you mean "work from home?"
exactly, that's the one
oh I've seen the video as well, they're very juicy and the beats are good
Is that your favorite music from them?
probably
