what do you think the worst star war movie his
I think it has to be the phantom menace unfortunately
why do think its the worst one
the plot was so boring. it was hard to follow why we should care about intergalactic politics
I thought it was pretty boring too. the action had too much fan service.
like all of the gratuitous light saber fighting
It felt really long too
yes, and the acting wasn't great
natalie portman did a good job
I think her performance was adequate, but the rest was pretty forgettable.
