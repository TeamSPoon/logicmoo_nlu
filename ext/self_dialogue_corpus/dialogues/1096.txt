Man, watching the Browns last year was rough.
They were just inept, weren't they?
They just had no talent anywhere on the field.
Their QB play was horrendous.
Yeah, didn't matter who they threw out there.
Didn't they have the one guy from Washington?
You mean RG3?
Yeah, that's the guy I was thinking of.
Yeah, he played a few games for them.  I thought he got injured again.
Wouldn't surprise me.  Dude gets injured every game I think.
Their other QB's were all garbage though.
Everything about them was.
Their defense was atrocious too.
I think they've drafted a lot of new guys though.
Yeah, they have.  Their front office is all about analytics.
You mean finding guys who might not fit a profile but can ball?
Right.  Might not be the right height or weight, but are good players.
We'll have to see how that pans out for them.
Yeah, give them two or three more years before you proclaim judgment.
That division's a tough one though.
