Tell me a little bit about why you like The Beatles so much. I understand your Mom liked them.
When I was little, my uncle (who lived at my grandma's house) had every single Beatles album. Grandma had a big cabinet record player/radio, and I used to listen to them on it.
So which ones did you like best? Anything in particular?
I liked The White Album, and songs like "Rocky Raccoon" and While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Clapton played on that one.
Why did Harrison have Clapton play on that one? I mean, he's not a Beatle.
Well, of course not! Apparently they tried having the group play it, but Harrison wasn't satisfied with it, and invited Clapton to play the solo, instead.
That was a good choice. So what other albums?
I liked "Help", and "The Beatles". I remember watching "Help", the movie - and knowing all the songs
Yeah, that movie was like one big video. maybe it was like one of the first movies written around rock songs.
No, now you're just ignoring greats like Elvis, who did lots of musical movies!
