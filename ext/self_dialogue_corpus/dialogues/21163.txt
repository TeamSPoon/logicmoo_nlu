Do you think there will ever be an Arrested Development movie?
No way. There are other shows that deserve a movie before it anyway.
Like what? Name one!
Off the top of my head? Um... The Venture Bros., for sure.
That's a cartoon! I meant live action movies.
You should've said that then. Besides, Aqua Teen Hunger Force got a movie, so I don't see why it can't.
I'm sure Aqua Teen was way cheaper to make.
Yeah, but even so, a Venture Bros. movie would cost way less than something like Minions or Finding Dory.
And less people would want to see it. That's why those movies get such a big budget.
I guess that's true. It seems like it's all about turning movies into shows these days anyway.
That's true. Twelve Monkeys got turned into a show.
So did The Exorcist. Every classic movie is now a TV show, I guess.
This isn't new. They've been turning movies into TV shows for decades.
Oh yeah, I guess they did have things like that Robocop cartoon back in the '80s.
That is a little different, but yeah. Old shows get turned into movies all the time, too.
Maybe originality is dead in Hollywood. Everything is just remakes and sequels now.
I think it's been that way forever. Even since the beginning of film they've been turning books into movies.
That's great, because then people can watch something, and they'll never have to read ever again!
Oh c'mon, don't tell me you didn't like Young Adult Novel 97 The Movie?
Maybe once we reach 100 that'll be the end of it, and Hollywood will finally shut down for good, having run out of things to adapt.
