Oh man, I've been listening to this Frank Ocean album all day. Its really great, thank you.
I'm so glad that you like it. Would you like to go see him with me?
I would love to go. When is the show?
Its next Tuesday in the city at 9:00 p.m.
I'll definitely go with you. I hope he plays "Nature Feels."
Oh me too, I love dancing to that one.
Can I please borrow his second album from you? I'd like to copy it.
Sure, its called Blonde, I'll bring it to the show for you.
Great thank you so  much.
You're welcome! I'll see you next Tuesday.
