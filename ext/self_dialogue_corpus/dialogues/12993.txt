What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the first one for sure.
Do you mean episode 4 or episode 1?
Oh that's funny. I was thinking Episode 1.
Oh I see, the one with Young Anakin?
Yeah that's the one!
I like the older movies, from the 70s
I like them too but the special effects arent good
Yeah the action can be a little cheesy but I still like it
Yeah, Darth Vaders voice is a little funny to me too. Not sure why.
