What kind of music do you like?
I really enjoy the simplicity of Country music.
Do you listen to Carrie Underwood? Her songs are so powerful.
Yes, I agree! I really liked her song So Small.
I really like hip hop music but I can't seem to find an Artist to listen to.
Well, what about Nicki Minaj? She's sort of Hip hop.
I liked her earlier songs, but I am not a huge fan of her newer songs.
Yeah, her earlier songs were very good.
I really want to listen to some throwback music. Back from early 2000. Any suggestions?
Jesse McCartney was pretty good. I really liked his Departure album back in the day.
I haven't listened to him in ages! That's perfect, thanks for the idea.
Right? I'm going to listen to How Do You Sleep right now.
I want to listen to some music that has sensible lyrics, lyrics that speak to me.
Try listening to Owl City. Old band, but their lyrics always seem to "get me".
Wow, they are old. What song do you have in mind?
Try listening to Shooting Star. The lyrics are the best.
Hey, you listen to punk rock right?
Sometimes, only if the band is good. What do you have in mind?
Green Day! The creators of Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
I remember listening to that years ago! Time for a throwback today!
