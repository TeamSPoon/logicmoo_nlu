Do you like the artist Eminem?
I used to! I haven't listened to him lately.
Yeah I've been listening to a lot of his older stuff lately.
My Name Is will always be my favorite song.
His verses are just so good!
You can tell he put a lot of thought into them.
He really did. Everything blends so well.
And it's music a lot of people can relate to.
He had to overcome a lot to get to where he is.
Yeah, i love his movie 8 mile too.
Yeah that one is really great.
Does he produce music now?
Yeah I think he focuses more on that.
A lot of rapper seem to do this.
Yeah many like to produce music rather than write.
Writing seems like a lot of pressure.
Totally, and producing you can have more control.
I hope he does write more music though.
I'm sure he will in the future.
We can only hope.
