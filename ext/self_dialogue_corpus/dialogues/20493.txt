Have you seen Deadpool?
Yes I have, that movie is so funny and awesome!
I agree, I think Ryan Reynolds was the best fit for Deadpool.
He is such a funny actor, I did not think the movie was going to be a comedy.
Me either, when the credits started in the beginning, did you notice the funny names?
Yes I was laughing from the beginning, I knew right there it was going to be funny.
Did you know they are making a Deadpool 2?
What! No way! When does that come out?
I am not sure, but I do know they are making a second one.
I wonder what it will be about.
Hopefully Ryan is in it again.
He would have to be, nobody else could play that part as well as him.
I liked his little jokes to the camera, like he was interacting with the audience.
I liked that too, not very many movies do that at all.
His jokes were so hilarious, and I am not a fan of comic movies.
Neither am I, but it makes me want to watch more if they are like Deadpool.
I do not think many comic movies are quite that funny.
Have you seen any other comic movies?
I have only seen a couple, and they were nowhere near like Deadpool.
I haven't seen any, but am going to check some out.
