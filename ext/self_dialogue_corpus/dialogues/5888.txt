Did you know that Auli'i Cravalho casted as Moana.
I didn't know that. But I knew that Dwayne Johnson casted as Maui.
Sina was my favorite character.
My favorite was Gramma Tala.
Gramma Tala was very funny.
I know right. She made more jokes than Cheif Tui.
And I loved their songs.
Especially "How far I'll go".
I want to watch it again.
My instincts tell me that they will release a new one.
