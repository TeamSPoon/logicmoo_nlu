Did you see the Fast and furious 8?
I watched it, but I couldn't really get into it.
What didn't you understand?
I didn't really think that Dom would leave his girlfriend like that.
Well, he was blackmailed, so he didn't have a choice.
Yeah, but the other woman wasn't his life long soul mate.
She had his kid, though.
He didn't know that when he started the whole rebellion adventure.
I didn't think it was a bad movie.
I don't think it was bad, it just wasn't as good as some of the others.
