What's your favourite aspect of the Star Wars franchise?
I would have to say the special effects.
Really? Considering how bad they were back then?
Yeah they were bad but there's something homey about movies from that time.
I don't know, for me it's kind of distracting. I like a more streamlined look.
There's something to be said for the improvement in special effects, but I like the fact that back then you had to settle for something obviously bad, that people couldn't have every snazzy thing they wanted.
You actually like not being satisfied?
On the contrary, I'm completely satisfied with them. The difference was you had less available to be satisfied with and you just had to be content with it.
I think I understand that.
It's just my two cents anyway.
