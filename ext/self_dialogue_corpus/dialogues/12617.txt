Wasn't it great to see Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford in the Star Wars film, "The Force Awakens?"
Yes, but I liked the new characters, too.
The new characters were awesome. Kylo Ren had an inner struggle between the Force and the Dark Side.
Yes, and being the son of Leia and Han made him all the more interesting.
What did you think of the Oscar Isaac character?
Poe Dameron? He was great, too.  I love Oscar Isaac.
Were you upset when Han died?
Yes, but I figured Harrison Ford wouldn't do many more sequels.
It was really emotional when Rey found Luke at the end.
Yes, I had goose bumps during that scene.
