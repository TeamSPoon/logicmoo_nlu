Are you ready for a good Panther's season this year?
I don't know, Cam Newton has to really step his game up.
I feel like Cam Newton gets a bad rap.
I mean he is a showboat.
I guess for how good he is, he can gloat a little bit.
All ego aside, even when he was injured, he still played the game.
That's true, he's really dedicated.
Yeah, but he didn't give himself a chance to heal up.
That should be  a testament to how much he cares.
It seems a little selfish to me.
Why would you think that?
I mean, they have a stable of other players that could carry the team while he's out.
Is that fair to the rest of the team to keep the star player out?
Luke Kuechly could do just a good a job as Cam could and leading.
Yeah, but he would do the same thing.
Luke was out for weeks with a concussion, and he didn't feel the need to jump back in.
I didn't even notice.
That's the point, Cam could have stayed out and came back in at 100%
I guess you're right. Newton needs to mature a little bit.
He should stop getting hurt, period.
