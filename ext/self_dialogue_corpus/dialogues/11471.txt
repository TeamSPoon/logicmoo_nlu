You know what has to be the absolute best song to sing along to of all time?
Oh gosh, this could go anywhere! What is it?
Hey Jude. It's so classic!
Well, it is a classic. But the best of all time?
Definitely. I mean the part at the end with the "na-na's"?
Well yeah, I have sung along to that quite a bit in my time.
The Beatles have a lot of songs that are great to sing along to as well.
I always liked to sing along with that songs that goes "I get by with a little help from my friends."
Oh that song is a great one, probably a top 10 sing along Beatles song.
The Beatles are just always great to sing along to.
