Who is your favorite droid?
Oh I know what mine is, but yours better not be Threepio.
It's not. It's the super sarcastic sassy droid in Rogue One.
Ha, he was funny, but raises a lot of ethical questions.
Yours?
R2D2. He's super functional and is sort of an deus-ex-machina.
So what's the ethical issue?
If you create a robot with personality, it's alive and conscious.
So?
That's artificial intelligence, and it's being used as slave labor, despite being self-aware.
