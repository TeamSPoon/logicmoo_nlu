Did you watch the Celtics and Wizards game?
Yeah, the Wizards one by one point.
I can't believe John Wall hit that last three point shot.
I know, right over Avery Bradley too.
Who do you think will win game seven?
I think the Celtics will win.
Are you sure, Washington seems to have all the momentum.
That's true, but each team has won at home.
Thomas, Bradley, and the rest of the team need to have a good game.
I believe they will, especially Thomas in the fourth like usual.
They are both doomed when they face the Cavaliers though.
I agree on that, they will get swept or lose in five.
Lebron James has just been too good this postseason.
The Cavaliers are too stacked, for either team to hope to win.
Still, the Celtics and Wizards made great progress.
They are both going to be future contenders and problems for other teams.
Especially the Celtics, with all those draft picks they have.
They will probably land the number one pick this year.
A playoff run and the number one pick, the future is bright in Boston.
Not many teams ever get that type of luck.
