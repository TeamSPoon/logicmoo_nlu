Do you watch the Super Bowl every year?
Not every year. I've seen a good majority in the last few years, though.
What's your favorite Super Bowl moment of all time?
I think it was the last time the Bears went. They ran it for a touchdown on the first kick of the game.
That was Devin Hester that ran it right?
Yeah. Watching him play kick returns is amazing.
It really is. I believe he's a free agent now.
Yeah, he is.
Who did they play in that Super Bowl? I can't remember.
It was the Colts.
Oh yeah. They ended up losing still didn't they?
Yeah, unfortunately.
The Colts were very good that year, to be fair.
They were. It was an entertaining game, though.
It was one of the more memorable ones.
I also really loved when the Seahawks played the Broncos a few years back.
That was a surprising game. A lot of people were upset.
Yeah, no one expected that outcome at all.
They completely dominated the Broncos that year.
They certainly did. It was nice to see the Seahawks win so big when they were projected to lose.
