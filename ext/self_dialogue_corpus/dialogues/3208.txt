So how good is your NFL trivia?
Hmmm, I think it's pretty good. Test me!
Ok, How long do you think it would take for you to get Green Bay Packers tickets if you were on the waiting list today?
Those Packers fans are fanatics! Probably a very long time but I don't know exactly.
You would have to wait almost a 1,000 years! There are approximately 86,000 people on it. With under 100 people giving up their tickets per year!
That's insane! Okay hit me up again.
Wilson has been making the official foot ball since 1941...do you know how many footballs they make per day?
Oh I got this! It's about 4,000 per day or one for every Eli Manning interception.
Ah, good one! How about which NFL ever three-peated and never once in the Super Bowl Era?
Back to those Packers! Vince Lombardiâ€™s Green Bay Packers of 1966-68 won three NFL championships in a row, but no team has ever pulled off the feat in the Super Bowl era.
Right you are!
This is fun. Keep going.
Ok, what days of the week does the NFL play?
Sunday, Monday and Thursday?
Nope, they actually have played every day of the week. Games have been moved because of holidays and weather.
Really? I did not know that.
Ok, how much doest that Superbowl trophy cost?
It's a lot of metal. I'm going to say $20k?
Wrong again? It's $25K.
Dang, that was fun we'll have to do that again!
