Do you like Lady Gaga?
I think she's kind of strange, but some of her songs are pretty great.
Yeah, I think so too. I heard she used to look a lot different before she became famous.
I think you're right. She used to have darker hair and looked like your average person.
She doesn't look bad now. She just has a unique sense of style.
I guess you could call it that.
Her clothes make a statement.
What kind of statement, exactly?
I think just a statement that she's different from other pop stars and not afraid to do something outside of the box, you know?
I suppose. Either way, I like her music.
