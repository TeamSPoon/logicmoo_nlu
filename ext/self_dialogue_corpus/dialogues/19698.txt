Did you hear Nicki Minaj’s new song featuring Drake and Lil Wayne?
No I have not. What is it called?
It’s called “No Frauds.” You can stream it online for free.
I’ll have to check it out.
It’s my favorite song at the moment. I was happy that she performed it at the Billboard Music Awards.
Oh yes, I did see her performance. When’s her new album coming out?
There are rumors that it will be out around Christmastime. She’s releasing buzz singles right now to build album anticipation.
I see. I can’t wait to hear more from her.
Can you believe that she’s been out as a mainstream artist for almost a decade now?
No way. Have you seen her in concert yet?
My family and I saw her at the Staples Center in 2015 for one of her Pinkprint tour dates.
How was the show?
It was really good. It was very animated, featured great dancers and was family friendly.
Perhaps we can see her if she happens to swing by our area during the next year.
Sounds like a plan. I’m sure she’ll be here to support her new project.
What other female rappers do you like?
I like Lil’ Kim, Iggy Azalea and Azealia Banks. What female rappers do you like?
I like Nicki, Eve, Foxy Brown and The Lady of Rage.
And this is why we’re friends. We both love female hip-hop.
Indeed my friend. Great minds think alike.
