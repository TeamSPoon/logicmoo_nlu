How do you thing the Saints are going to do next season?
What city are they from again?
New Orleans, LA is their home town. They play in the Superdome.
That is one of the largest stadiums to play in I think.
Yeah. I think they will do well next season?
Are you sure? Their performance has been dropping off lately.
They have Drew Brees. He's on of the highest ranked quarterbacks in the league.
That's right. He won MVP when they went to the Superbowl.
Yeah, he's pretty amazing.
Yeah, but do you think he'll be able to pull the whole team this year.
They have a great all-around team. They'll be fine.
I though he lost a lot of his receivers this past season?
Yeah, but they picked some good ones at the last draft.
I hope so. Having a killer passing arm doesn't do any good if he has no one to throw to.
That's true. What do you think they will be strongest at, offence or defense?
Defense for sure.
They haven't had an amazing defense since the 1990s. They need points.
Maybe, but you have to stop the other team from scoring to win.
True. I still think the offence will be their strong suit.
I guess we'll see when the season starts.
