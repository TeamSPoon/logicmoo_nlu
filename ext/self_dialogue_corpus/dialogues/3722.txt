So, did you ever see Inception?
Oh, yeah, I LOVED that film!
Yeah, my favorite part was that scene where those two guys are fighting and the gravity keeps shifting around on them.
Oh, yeah, that was really cool.  Humor wise though, I thought the funniest part was where that guy turns to Ellen Page's character and he's like, "Quick, kiss me!"
Yeah, and then he's all, "Oh, darn, that didn't work."
Yeah, the whole theater laughed at that one.
What's really amazing is few of the effects that did using computer graphics.  I've read they used them rather sparingly.
Yeah, that was cool.  I only have two major nitpicks with the movie though.
What's that?
Well, I didn't feel the guys on the third stage of the dream much of a threat, even though they had automatic and stuff.  And two, too many movies started using that "bwwwwwwang" sound in their trailers.
