Do you still play?
Not recently.
They've been repaving the basketball field around our apartment.
No way?
Yeah, it's active.
That owns hard.
We ought to get a few people around.
I mean, I'm busy.
Really?
Yeah, what do you mean, 'really'?
Like, it's basketball.
Work is work, idiot.
It's good.
It sucks.
No it doesn't, what?
It's not good at all.
You were killer.
I got a job.
Come on.
I have responsibilities.
