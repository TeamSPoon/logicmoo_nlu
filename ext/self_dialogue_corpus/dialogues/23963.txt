What's your favorite movie series?
What do you mean?
Like movies with multiple parts? Harry potter, Lord of the Rings, etc.
Oh yeah. I love Lord of the rings.
Nice, that's actually my favorite too. I've watched it 8 times.
Jeez! 8 times? I've only seen it once.
Maybe it isn't your favorite then.
It is! I love the atmosphere, the characters, the fantasy.
Me too. I'm in love with it.
Have you seen the hobbit?
Of course! I've seen all three.
I don't think it was as good as the original Lord of the Rings movies.
100% with you on that. Nothing beats the old lore.
Getting new content was pretty cool though.
Agreed.
Who's your favorite?
Definitely Gandalf, no question.
Fly you fools!
You shall not pass!
I love Gandalf !
