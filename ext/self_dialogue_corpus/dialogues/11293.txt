What is your favorite Beattles song?
Honestly, I know it's corny, but I like I want to hold your hand.
Yeah, it's sweet.  I like Lady Madonna.
Which one is that?
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast, wonder how you'll feed the reast.
I also like Penny Lane.
That's a good one. The music is great on that one.
What about In My Life?
It's a little slow for me.  But I don't like the White Album that much.
Me either.
