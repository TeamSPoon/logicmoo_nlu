You know Lemmy, from Motorhead, right?
Yeah, of course I do. Lemmy is God!
Anyway, before Motorhead, he was in a band called Hawkwind.
Never heard of them
They were well known in certain circles. Kind of a Space/Art/Psychedelic Rock band.
Sounds interesting. Did Lemmy sing?
No, he played Bass. Anyway the band was very influential and lots of rockers and hardcore fans talk about Hawkwind.
What's their best album?
I personally prefer Warrior on the Edge of Time.
That sounds epic! Kind of a Moorcock vibe!
Exactly! That's another thing. The band members were huge Michael Moorcock fans and Moorcock himself wrote lyrics for some of their songs.
No way! Moorcock wrote rock songs?
Yeah. They have another album titled Chronicle of the Black Sword.
Ok, Elric. Do any other Moorcock characters turn up in their songs?
Chronicle of the Black Sword is mainly about Elric, but Jerry Cornelius also makes an appearance.
So, Moorcock's Eternal Champion cycle shows up in Hawkwind. Led Zeppelin had songs with Tolkien references.
Tracing the influence of Science Fiction and Fantasy on rock would be an interesting project.
Surely, it's been done, though.
To some extent, but I'm not sure how far or how deep anyone has taken the idea.
That would be a cool project! Maybe even something that would be worthy of a book.
