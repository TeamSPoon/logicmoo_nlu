What should I listen to today? I am so bored with my playlist.
Are you into anything older, like more retro?
You mean like from the 90s?
No, I mean like even earlier than that, the 80s or late 70s. Do you like any of that music?
What are some band names?
Fleetwood Mac, maybe?
What are some of their songs?
Well, there is Go Your Own Way, which I think is pretty cool.
Where can I find that song?
I'm pretty sure it's on all of the streaming things like Spotify and Pandora. You can look on YouTube too to see if you like it.
What are some of the album names?
Rumours is probably my favorite Fleetwood Mac album. It's from the late 70s, but the music is still really good.
Can I get that at Amazon if I like the music?
Yeah, you can get anything on Amazon, haha.  Seriously, though, listen to some songs on Spotify or whatever before buying it.
I'm going to check it out on YouTube first, yeah.
I'm pretty sure you will like the band since you like some of the more folk song type music.
So it has messages in it and more interesting stories?
Most of the music does. I mean, Fleetwood Mac has some duds like any band has, but mostly it is really good stuff.
Great.  Do you have any links to some of your favorite songs?
Sure, I have a few in my YouTube favs I can get you.
