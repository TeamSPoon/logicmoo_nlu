You have to see the movie "Get Out"
Oh, it's really good?
It's amazing. Really original.
Isn't it about racism?
It's not about racism exactly. It has some really great plot twists.
I guess I'll have to see it then.
Peele did a great job with it.  The guy is super talented.
Hard to imagine when you just think of him as a comedian.
He had a low budget but got really good work from the actors.
Now I have to go see it.
