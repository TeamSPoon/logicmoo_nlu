Who do you think is the greatest of all time in basketball?
I'm not sure, it's either Jordan, Kobe, or Lebron
Definitely, I agree.
Who do you think is the best though?
Maybe Lebron.
You think so?
Yeah, I think in the past few seasons, he's taken his game, and his career to another level.
Yeah.
It's incredible how much he's overcome since leaving the Cavs all those years ago.
Yeah, he was so hated for a while.
Also, the fact that he's just getting better.
What do you mean?
Like, he's becoming a better basketball player ever single season.
Yeah, I guess so.
Have you watched him? His sense of the game is just masterful now.
True.
It's crazy to think that he will continue to get better as he ages.
Yeah, I guess.
Not to mention that his athleticism seems to still be all there.
Yeah, he still can move like he used to.
