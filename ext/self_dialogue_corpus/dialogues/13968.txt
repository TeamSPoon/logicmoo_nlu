Whats your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I have so many.
Okay, well lets do a top 2 then.
Okay, my first one would be Judas.
Judas? I guess that's a good one.
Yeah, I just always liked the beat and the tempo.
I gotcha. And your other one?
Okay, I really like A Million Reasons.
Isn't that a new song by her?
Yeah, it's great!
