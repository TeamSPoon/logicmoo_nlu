What do you think of Disney movies?
The cartoon ones of the live action?
Cartoon ones.
I loved the sort of golden age one.
Like what?
Bambi I think is the epitome of the golden age of Disney.
That is the one with the deer that has his mom die, and the cute skunk.
Yep, the skunk that is always falling in love.
I loved having those old Disney movies on VHS.
It was like a treat getting to see a new one.
