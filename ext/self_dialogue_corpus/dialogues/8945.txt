Whagt did you think about Coldplay's last album?
Is Coldplay really rock?
What do you mean by that?  Of course they are.
Well, they've just had a lot of electronic stuff lately.
True, but Parachutes and their earlier stuff was all rock for sure.
It's kind of hard to believe that they've been around for 20 years.
They've had good staying power.  It helps that they've crafted good music during that time.
They've also reinvented themselves too.
I think they're retiring, aren't they?
I doubt it.  They'll be back.
