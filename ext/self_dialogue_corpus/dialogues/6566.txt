I think Kida may be my favorite disney princess...
Kida?
Yeah, from Atlantis.
Oh! I almost forgot about that one.
Seriously, I demand that you go see it again.
Maybe tonight- no, definitely tonight.
Yeah, man because I think the animators used 2D and 3D to make it, just like Treasure Planet.
Really, I love when they do that.
It makes the movie even better when an animator spends so much time paying attention to detail.
It does...it does.
