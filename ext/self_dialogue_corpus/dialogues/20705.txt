Have you seen the last Mummy movie yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like an action movie.  Did you like it?
I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tonight with me?
Oh I see, well tell me about the movie plot first.
Well, it is about a team or army of people that basically awaken a mummy from sleep, happens to be evil of course!
Sounds fun! Alex Kurtzman is the director for this movie.
I think they have made close to $280 million so far on this movie.
The critics have been a little harsh on this one.
Yes, I saw the reviews, some were quite bad.
I think I will try this movie with you, and see what I think.
Great, what time do you want me to pick you up?
How about 7pm? Is that good?
I think I will head to dinner before hand, if you want to join me for that I can come earlier.
Ok, as long as its quick and cheap!
Ok! We will head to the restaurant near the movies.
How long is the movie?
It is about 2 hours long
Ok, I do not work tomorrow, so that will be great.
I will pick you up at 5:30!
See you then!
