I am putting together a mix tape for my grandma, would you help me pick out some songs?
Sure, what kind of music does she like?
She likes gospel, and some country.
Maybe you should use the country artists who sing gospel songs.
That is a great idea.
You could use Alan Jackson, he has a lot of gospel songs.
What songs does he sing?
He sings amazing grace, the old rugged cross, blessed assurance and so many more.
Great I will add him to the mix tape.
Reba also sings quite a few hymns.
My grandma loves her voice.
My favorite hymn of hers is How Great Thou Art.
I will definatley use that song.
She has many more you can check out too.
I am also going to use Vince Gill's music too.
What song does she like by him?
Look At Us.
That is such a sweet song, full of love.
I agree, thank you for your help.
Your welcome.
