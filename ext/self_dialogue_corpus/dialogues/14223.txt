Did you like Lady GaGa's new album?
The jazz one with Tony Bennet, you mean?
No she recently released a new LP.
Oh, really? What's it called.
It's called Joanne. But I don't really like it.
I liked Born This Way and Artpop. What's up with Joanne?
Well she tried to go country. It's a really odd result.
I can't imagine her singing a country record.
Well, it's country mixed with pop. It'll time some time to get used to it.
At the very least, she was pretty good at the Superbowl.
