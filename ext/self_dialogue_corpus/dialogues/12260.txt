What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?
For me, it was the cinematography. Every shot in the movie felt like it was a work of art.
The effects were beautiful, too.
What about the plot?
I liked that the early scenes with Rey took their time.
That felt like showing Luke on Tatooine in A New Hope.
They were wise not to make it purely an action movie without that kind of scene.
It did make The Force Awakens pretty long, though.
But that kind of development will pay off later.
Agreed. Without it, we won't be able to appreciate where the characters go in the future.
