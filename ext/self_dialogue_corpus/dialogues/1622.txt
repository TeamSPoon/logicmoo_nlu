Hey, are you as excited for the NFL season as I am?
You know it! I can't wait to see my Packers in action.
You think they have a shot to win it all this year?
Definitely! Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback in the league. I think he can lead us to another Super Bowl.
You really think Rodgers is the best in the whole NFL?
Of course I do. Who would you put ahead of him?
Um, Tom Brady maybe? The greatest quarterback who ever played the game?
Brady's great and all, but he's almost 40! He's way too old.
Well, Brady didn't look too old in the Super Bowl against the Falcons.
Yeah, but it's a year later, and Father Time is still undefeated. I'd rather have the 33 year old quarterback than the 40 year old one.
Whatever. We'll just agree to disagree.
We'll settle it at the Super Bowl. If your Patriots even make it that far.
Who's going to beat us in the AFC? Name one team that has a realistic shot.
Pittsburgh, for one. Maybe the Raiders.
Pittsburgh can't beat us in the playoffs. And the Raiders are still too young to be a real threat.
Carr looks good though. I think he's the real deal at QB.
Fair enough. But who knows what he's going to be like coming back from that injury?
Yeah, that was so disappointing last year. I was really looking forward to a Raiders/Patriots matchup in the AFC championship.
Maybe we'll get to see it this year. And then we'll get to see the Pats and the Packers in the Super Bowl.
Man, that would be so sweet.
