I heard that they're finally making another Jeepers Creepers movie.
They are? That's news to me.
It's called Jeepers Creepers;: Cathedral. Filming is already underway.
I bet it'll be out by Halloween. Who's in it?
Meg Foster, Stan Shaw, and, I think, Michael Papajohn.
Johnathan Breck still playing as The Creeper?
Defiantly. I can't wait to see it.
Same here. It takes place after the last movie right?
Actually, no.  From what I read Creepers 3 takes place between the first and second movie.
That's disappointing. I really wanted to see what happens to the old guy and his son at the end of the third movie.
