Do you listen to much punk music?
It might depend to some degree on what you consider to be punk.
Oh, so what kinds of things do you listen to that might be punk.
I'm really into Bad Religion and the Dead Kennedys.
Those sounds like punk bands to me.
Yeah, the Dead Kennedys definitely are. Some people think of Bad Religion as more pop-punk music, though.
I never got too much into those discussons. I just like to listen to the music.
Oh, so what punk bands do you like?
I'm really into Husker Du.
So I'm guessing you like their earlier stuff?
Yeah, I like their stuff in the 1980s.
Aren't they more into alternative rock now?
Yes, they are. But they were a great hardcore punk band back in the day.
So what's your favorite stuff from them?
I really love the album Flip Your Wig!
That album's great.
So are you into any more recent stuff than Dead Kennedys and Bad Religion?
Not really. I'm not sure punk is being done very well anymore.
You could definitely make a case for that. Thanks for the chat.
Yeah, thanks.
