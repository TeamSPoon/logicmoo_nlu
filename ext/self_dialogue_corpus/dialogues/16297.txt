Do you know who was one of my favorites in high school?
No , who was it?
David Bowie, now he could put on a show.
Sure could. What are some of your favorite Bowie songs?
Well, I love Under Pressure, Heros and China Girl.
Those are some good ones.
How about you?
I really loved the duet he did with Bing Crosby, the christmas carol, Little Drummer Boy.
Oh yea, I love that too.
Their voices really blend well
I agree.
It is a shame that he passed away.
Yes and his last cd was a bit depressing.
I guess because he knew he was going to die.
That is really sad.
Well, he left the world a gift with his music and his voice
Yes so very talented.
I had several of his albums but not his latest Darkstar.
So did I.
His voice was incredible.
