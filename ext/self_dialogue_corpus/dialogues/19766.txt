Are you a fan of oldies?
Oldies? What are oldies?
You know. Oldies music from the 50's and 60's
Oh. Is it rock music?
Well, it can be similar. I guess it depends on the song.
Oh ok. Do you mean like drive in style music?
Yes. Good example.
No I haven't listened to oldies. Can you tell me more about it?
The music is soothing and relaxing. Good for when you are reading or doing work on the computer.
Sounds cool.
I listen to it alot.
Oh you do? Sounds like fun.
Yes it is. Been listening my whole life.
Do you think people under 30 would be interested in it?
Well, yes. It is a niche type of music. Some say it is boring.
I guess I can understand that.
Some times I can't sleep at night and I listen to the soft music to help me relax and sleep better.
Does it always work?
Sometimes, but not always.
Ok. Maybe I will try a few songs.
