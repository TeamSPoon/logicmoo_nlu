Hey, you want to come to a concert with me next week?
Sure. Who's playing? and where?
One of my top favorites... Bob Seger. He'll be at the Palace.
Ah, good ole' Detroit boy. Sounds like fun. I haven't been to a live concert for quite awhile.
I saw the Beach Boys in Chicago last summer.
Really? That sounds like fun. How was it?
Well, it was at the beach... in August. But it rained and it was really cold.
Wow, that must have put a damper on the evening. Ha ha
Oh very funny. Actually once everyone got really soaked we all just gave up trying to stay dry and just went with it.
Still though, singing about summer fun at the beach?
Yeah, the music was really good but it didn't look like they were having much fun.They made the best of it though.
Alright, well we can get into that old time rock 'n roll at the palace. That should be fun.
Yeah, although I really like smaller venues. I've caught a couple concerts lately in Traverse City venues that are pretty good.
What kind of music?
Classic rock covers mostly. But some jazz and blues too. Lot of local people, but some pretty famous names at Interlochen too.
So maybe I'll come up and join you for some of those concerts.
Okay, that works. I'll send you the schedule and you can pick out what you want to see.
Alrighty then, thanks.Let me know how much the Seger tickets are.
Ok, I'll purchase them and you can pay me back.
Or, we can go out to dinner beforehand and I can just pay for that. Either way...
