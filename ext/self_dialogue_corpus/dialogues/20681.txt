Have you noticed all of the remakes of older movies lately.
I  have, I wonder if they are doing a good job on them.
Well, take for example IT, I watched that many years ago.
Yeah, that movie scared the crap out of me.
I wonder if they will do justice to the original.
I doubt it.
Yeah, I bet they rely on a bunch of cheesy special effects.
Isn't that what most of them do these days.
If they aren't making remakes, they are making movies about television series.
You mean like Baywatch, with the Rock.
Yea, and Zach Efron.
That really looks like it is going to be terrible.
Yea I won't be wasting my money on that.
Who thinks this kind of movie is a good idea?
That's Hollywood for you, all about the money.
True, but it got terrible reviews from critics, how do you make any money turning out junk.
Well, we both know that Hollywood makes money on junk everyday.
Yes, they do.
Even movies that fail in the USA still makes tons of money world wide.
Yeah, there is no accounting for taste with some people.
