I just saw the movie The Equalizer with Denzel Washington. Have you seen it?
YES! I love that movie and love most of Denzel's movies. I really liked The Bone Collector.
I haven't heard of that one. Who else is in it?
Angelina Jolie and Queen Latifah. It's a thriller and really good.
I like Angelina Jolie. Have you seen Salt?
Yes, that's one of my favorites of hers. Wanted was good, too.
Loved Wanted! Have you seen Maleficent?
Several times. I really liked it. She's a good actress.
Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean?
No, and I doubt I will see it. I didn't even see the last one. I got kind of tired of them, to tell you the truth.
I saw it. It was just okay. More of the same but I still like Jack Sparrow.
i remember the first time seeing Pirates. I thought Jack Sparrow was hilarious. It got old after awhile. Do you like Keanu Reeves?
Yes I love Keanu. I see all of his movies.
I loved John Wick but I haven't seen the sequel yet. I'm going to see it in the next week or two.
You are going to love John Wick 2. I didn't think it would be as good as the first one but it was.
I can't wait to see it but I like to wait until it's been there for weeks to see a movie. That way I almost have the theater to myself.
Ha ha, I do the same thing. I sit on the opposite side of the theater from anyone else. I'll probably go see The Mummy next week.
I don't think I'll see The Mummy but I'm looking forward to the other Universal Monster movies. Like Jekyll & Hyde and Bride of Frankenstein.
I wonder who is going to star in those movies. Do you know?
Russell Crowe is going to be Dr. Jekyll and I think they're trying to get Angelina Jolie for The Bride. Sounds like two good ones if they do them.
