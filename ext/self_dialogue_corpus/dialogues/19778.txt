Do you like country music?
Yea, a little bit.
Have you ever heard of Chris Stapelton?
I think I heard one of his songs.
Did you like it?
Yea. It reminded me a lot of the older country.
His music is more of a rock and roll country.
I really like that.
I met a guy that went to high school with him. He said Chris was really cool.
That is really interesting.
I always wonder what famous people are really like.
Yea.
Chris just cut his finger and had to cancel some of his shows.
Oh that is too bad. I bet his fans are upset.
Yea probably a little. I would just want to see him.
Yea. that would be really fun.
I wonder how much tickets would cost. Do you know if he is coming to town soon?
I'm not sure.
I think i'm gonna find out. I want to go to his concert.
Do you mind if I join you?
