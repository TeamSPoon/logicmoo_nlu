Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
No! I have heard great things about it.
I haven't seen it either but I wanted to see it in theaters.
I always loved the animated version when I was a kid.
Same! My favorite character was the cup Chip.
What other Disney movies did you enjoy?
I loved other princess movies such as Cinderella, Snow White and The Little Mermaid.
I always sung the songs from Snow White on my way to school.
Heigh ho, heigh ho it's off to work (school) we go!
I wonder if in the new Beauty and the Beast movie they sing the same songs from the original.
