Bought any good albums lately?
A Prince album.  I got really nostalgic after he died.
Which album?
Purple Rain.
Yeah nice.
I like the song Purple Rain especially.
I know what you mean.  That was a different time.
Also I like the movie Purple Rain. Ever saw that?
I remember when it came out.  Didn't see it though.
It was a rock drama. Prince starred in it.
Missed it.
Prince got a couple Grammys for the music album.
Good guy.
The movie came out when they were still using VHS!
Now we've got dvds and Blu-Ray.
When I hear VHS I get nostalgic.
Ha ha ha.
Now vinyl is back in style! Maybe VHS will return.
What goes around, comes around.
That's the truth.
