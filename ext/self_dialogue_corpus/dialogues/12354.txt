Do you think Revenge of the Sith was the best of the prequel?
Yeah only because we know how Anakin turns to the dark side
I wish we could have drawn it out longer
Why do you say that?
I think if we could have embraced Darth Vader as a nice guy longer it would have been better.
You mean empathize with a villain?
Yeah I wish we could have done that.
It went on for 3 movies
True but I wish it could have been another 3!
Thats way too long to make that story work
