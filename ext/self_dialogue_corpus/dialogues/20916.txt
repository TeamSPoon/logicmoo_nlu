I have a new favorite movie
What is it?
Captain Fantastic.
I saw it too.  I loved it.
I know, right?  I didn't think I would, but it is about so much.
Viggo Mortenson is amazing.  He is so versatile as an actor.
You are right.  Who would have thought he could play such a hippie, communist, woods-loving dad?
Not me.  After Lord of the Rings, I thought he only did action parts.
Do you think you would want to be one of his kids in the movie?
I don't know.  It would be tough to live in the woods all of the time.
But think of how strong they were.
And smart.  My favorite part is when the little girl explains the Bill of Rights.
I know.  It's great how he throws everything in their face.
I love how the movie ended as a compromise.
It was beautiful, especially when they cremated the mother.
I cried like a baby.
Me too.
I felt like I was actually part of the family.
I think that was part of the magic.
You are right.  It really touched me.
