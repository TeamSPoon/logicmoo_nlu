What did you think about Han and Leia being Kylo Ren's parents?
I thought it made sense once the details were reveled in the movie.
Yeah, that was a sad twist, how Luke was the one training him and Kylo--I mean Ben--went bad.
Yeah, that created a strong and believable reason why Luke ran off and lived alone all those years. His own nephew turned Sith on him.
And destroyed the Jedi Academy, don't forget that.
Yeah, talk about a tragic event. I hope they have some flashbacks in the new movie that explains more about what happened with that.
I would think so. At the end of the last one, "Force Awakens", Rey finds Luke, so i'm sure she will ask about what happened that made him run away like that.
Yeah, poor Leia. That was sad when Kylo Ren killed Han. Hope she finds some answers and confronts Kylo herself.
Yeah, that would be an awesome scene!
Guess we'll have to wait till December when "The Last Jedi" comes out and hopefully will find out more!
