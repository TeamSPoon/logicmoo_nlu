Do you remember when Lady Gaga sang that song from The Sound of Music?
Yes! That was Incredible!
I remember so many people on facebook being amazed that she had any singing ability at all.
Yeah. I do too. She's been a singer her whole life, though.
Yeah. Just because people have a quirky celebrity persona doesn't mean they are not talented.
Didn't she go to NYU?
I think so. She didn't go by Lady Gaga, though.
Do you know what her given name is?
I believe it is Stephanie, I'm not sure of her last name though.
I'll look it up.
