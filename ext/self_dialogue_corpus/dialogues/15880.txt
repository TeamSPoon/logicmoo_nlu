Hey, I am wanting to make a CD to listen to on vacation. Do you want to help?
Sure, I love searching for good songs.
Great! You can help find some because I am at a loss.
Sure! What kind of music do you like to listen to?
Well, I am a big country fan.
Do you like the new country songs or the older ones?
I guess they are all good but I do love the oldies.
Do you like George Jones and people of that time?
Oh yes, they are my favorite. George Jones is one of the greatest.
Yeah he is. I especially love the songs he did with Tammy Wynette.
What are some of those songs he did with her?
Golden Ring, Two Story House, Southern California, just to name a few.
Golden Ring is awesome!
Yes it is. Did you ever hear the song he did with his daughter?
No I don't think so. What is it called?
It's called You and Me amd Time. It is definitely one of my favorites.
I have never heard that one before, I will have to give it a try.
His daughter sounds just like Tammy Wynette.
Then I know it will be good.
Yeah, you will definitely have to add it to your CD.
