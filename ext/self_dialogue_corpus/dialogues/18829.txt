I need to create a playlist of women singers. Can you help me?
Definitely. Any particular genre?
No. Open to all suggestions.
Okay. I definitely recommend some Joni Mitchell. She is a folk singer with a beautiful voice.  Big Yellow Taxi is a song you may have heard.
Okay. I know that song.
PJ Harvey is great. I would play Man-Size off her album Rid of Me.
What kind of music does she play?
She's a rock musician. Very good. You'll like it, I think. Speaking of female rock musicians, you should definitely add Patti Smith.
Any particular track you like for her?
Horses is one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a long one, though. It's almost 10 minutes long. I don't know if that matters.
It shouldn't be a problem.
Okay. Have you heard of Florence and the Machine?
I've heard of them. I am not really that familiar.
Florence Welch is the lead singer. There's a song on the debut album Lungs called Dog Days are Over. It's a great addition to your playlist. It's a very catchy, high-energy track with beautiful vocals.
How about Amy Winehouse?
Yep. Put some Amy on there. Anything off the Back to Black album. I wouldn't play Rehab, though. I would pick a different track.
How about Tears Dry on Their Own?
Good choice. That's one of my favorites. It has a great retro sound. Speaking of retro, how about some older stuff like The Supremes and The Ronnettes?
Good idea. What songs?
For The Supremes, I would play When the Love Light Starts Shining. Oooh. Play some Tina Turner, too! River-Deep Mountain-High!
