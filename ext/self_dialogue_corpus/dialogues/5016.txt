Could you tell me who played the Cubs in the 2016 World Series?
Yes. It was the Cleveland Indians.
Didn't the Indians play in the World Series in recent years?
They last played in 1997 against the Florida Marlins and lost.
Seems like a long time since both the Cubs and Indians won a World Series.
Indeed. The Cubs last win prior to last year was in 1908, and Cleveland last won in 1948.
I recall the 2016 World Series went all the way to seven games.
That seventh game took extra innings to decide.
It took practically all night because of the extra innings, and there was a rain delay in addition.
When will the World Series start this year?
It is scheduled to begin October 24.
Who do you think will play in the World Series this year?
Maybe the Astros and Cubs, but its too early in the season to tell.
Have the Astros been to the World Series before?
They were once back in 2005 against the White Sox.
That's confusing because both are American League teams.
That's true now, but the Astros were in the National League back then.
Did the Astros win it that year?
No, the White Sox won it all.
So both of the Chicago MLB teams have now won the World Series in recent memory.
