Did you take that culinary coarse you were telling me about?
Not yet, but I plan to register in the Fall.
Sounds good.  I was thinking about doing the same thing.
You should because there are so many opportunities to be a chef I the restaurant business.
You're right.  But I'm still wondering about what else I would like to do.
What exactly did you have in mind?
If I don't become a chef, I was thinking about becoming a counselor.
Oh that's a great idea.  That's a wonderful profession to get into.
Yes it is.  I've been pondering over this for some time now and now its come down to deciding which.
Well it sounds like you've got some decisions to make in regards to a career choice.
I hope I'm able to decide soon because registration is coming up.
Yea I know.  In fact I have to start my registration before the week is up.
Good idea better sooner then later.
I completely agree.
So what else do you have planned for the week?
Nothing much.  Probably just relax at home and either read a book or watch a movie.
Sounds good.  Doesn't look like I'm doing much as far as going out.
Oh OK.  At least you'll have some peace and quiet at home
Yeah.  Well I gotta make some runs hope to see you soon.
Take care and good luck.
