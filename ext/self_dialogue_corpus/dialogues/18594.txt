What were some of your favorite TV shows growing up?
Oh man that's a loaded question, lots of answers.
Just name a couple then.
Okay, I loved Full House as a child. I also really liked Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
That show was hilarious I loved Will Smith in it!
I did too. Always made me laugh.
Remember the theme song to it?
"Now this is a story all about how my life got..."
"...twist turned upside down.."
I would sing a long loudly every time it came on the TV.
I did too! I watched it a lot with my cousin.
Remember how Carlton used to do that dance?
Oh yes that was too funny!
I still try to do it myself sometimes but am not the best.
My brother had it perfected when we were little.
Did you like any other shows?
Could Will Smith sing at all?
Not really, but his kids do.
You're right I remember seeing his kids on TV singing.
They're a little odd, but good singers.
