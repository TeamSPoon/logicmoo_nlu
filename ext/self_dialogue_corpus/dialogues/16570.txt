Honestly, I'm a big fan of broadway.
Really? I wouldn't have guessed!
Is that sarcastic?
No of course not, I'm being serious I didn't know you liked musicals?
Yeah, it doesn't come up a lot but I do.
Well what do you like about them?
I like how they're live, I also like just the music in general. It's more emotional than regular music I think.
I can see that, I know a few musicals but not a lot.
What, like the Lion King?
Yeah.....I like Phantom of the Opera too.
That was a movie, right?
Yeah but I know both!
I like Phantom too, don't worry I'm just playng.
I think Masquerade is so underrated.
Agreed! I love Les Miserables too.
YES! That is my favorite that I know.
Whenever One Day More comes on I want to sing every part.
I DO sing every part!
It's just addicting, isn't it?
It is.
