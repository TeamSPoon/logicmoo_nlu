Okay, this is gonna be a tough one. Top five favorite country music stars?
I'm not sure it's gonna be so tough. First few are really easy. Garth Brooks and Toby Keith.
I figured they would top your list. So who else is up there?
Alan Jackson, George Straight, Randy Travis.
Is that your list?
No, just running through some of the better ones.
Conway Twitty would probably be up there. Oh, and Tim McGraw.
Okay, that's four. Who's number five?
I haven't even thought about the women yet.
Oh?
Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynna, the great Patsy Cline.
So who makes the top five?
Okay, Maybe this will be more difficult than I thought.
Ha! told you so.
Oh man! I forgot all about Rascal Flatts.
Oh, they are good. I love that one song.
Let me guess "Melt"?
Yup, that's it.
It was my first Flatt song also.
So, do they make the top five?
