How is your day going thus far?
It has been pretty good, I have been going through all of my old CD's.
I love going through old music and reminiscing about it.
I do to, it brings back so many great memories!
I know! I used to be a huge fan of Blink 182 back in the day.
I used to love them, they were so cool!
Yea they were my favorite band all through high school.
Mine to! What a crazy coincidence.
What was your favorite song that they released?
I can't choose between All The Small Things and Always.
Those are two really good ones, I loved them both.
They are both classics in my eyes. What is your favorite song from them?
I would have to go with What's My Age Again.
That is a classic as well. I can remember jamming to that song many times!
Me and you both! I can't believe it has been around eighteen years since it was released.
Wow, has it really been that long?
Yes, it got released in 1999. Time flies!
It sure does; Blink 182 might be one of the best bands of all time in my opinion.
I agree, and Travis Barker was the coolest drummer ever!
Yea he was awesome. They need to do a comeback tour and we will both go!
