I reallly enjoyed Lady Gaga's performance at the Super Bowl.
It was just awesome!
I don't usually care for her.
Really?  Why?
I don't like some of the outfits she wears.
Well, I agree some of her outfits are quite way out.
She likes to show her body, that is a certainty.
Yeah, she had a pretty nice body till she gained some weight.
I don't care for most of her music.
I have her last four albums and enjoy them very much.
