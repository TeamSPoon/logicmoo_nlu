What do you think about SZA's progression as a pop star?
Personally,  I like Sza's older stuff, but Ctrl is on another level.
Ctrl was up there with Miseducation if you ask me.
I feel like her music is a fascinating take on R&B - it has a ton of inspiration from indie and left field pop production,
I feel like CTRL, is a vulnerable and beautiful R&B record.
I agree, it is some of her most mature, honest songwriting ever.
Do you know how she met Kendrick Lamar?
No, I never heard how they met.
She first met Kendrick posing as an interviewer, she was signed to TDE that same year.
Wow, that's some Nancy Drew stuff right there. Good for her for getting her foot in the door!
