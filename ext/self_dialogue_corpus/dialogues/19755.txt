Are you a Beyonce fan?
Of course I am! I don't know anybody who isn't a fan of Beyonce.
It is exciting that she's having twins, but also a little sad.
Why would that be sad?
I meant sad for her fans. She probably will have to take quite a bit of time to herself.
That's true, but that's the price of motherhood.
At least she has Jay-Z to help her.
I'm not a fan of Jay-Z's music.
Really? Why not?
I'm not a rap fan. I don't like hardly any rap at all.
Wow, I love rap! I love some of the collaborating things that Beyonce and Jay-Z have done together!
What have they done together?
Well, one of the first things they collaborated on was in 2002, called '03 Bonnie and Clyde, and the most recent is called Drunk in Love.
I don't think I've heard either of those.
What about the song Crazy in Love?
Oh, I've heard that one! That's a little older too.
Yeah, that came out in 1998. I think that's how they met.
Wow, that's amazing.
They have a great career together.
A great family too.
