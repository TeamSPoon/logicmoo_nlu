I can't believe the Patriots won another Superbowl
I know- I'm so tired of them. I'm not a big fan of sports dynasties.
Do you think Tom Brady is too old to be an elite quarterback?
If it was anyone else, I would say yes. But Tom Brady is super human.
Agreed. Though I really don't like him or Belichek
Yea, I like the underdog- I wish Matt Ryan won.
Matt Ryan is a really under-rated quarterback. I think he will be good in the years to come.
What about Tony Romo? Do you think he still has a chance in the NFL?
He may, if his age and injuries don't get in the way.
A lot of people outside of Dallas don't like him, but his stats don't lie. He is an elite quarterback as well
Agreed- he was- but I think he is too old. What team would pick him up?
Maybe a team that has a young quaterback draft pick that needs a veteran presence for a couple years?
Yea that could be a lot of teams this upcoming year.
I think it would be weird to see Tony Romo in another jersey besides the Cowboys though!
Thats true- I felt the same way when McNabb left the eagles for the redskins- so weird
Or how about when Bret Farve left Green Bay for Minnosota?
Oh yea- that was weird too.
Did you hear about that Oakland Raiders QB that is trying for a comeback at 48?
48? That is WAY to old to play professional football.
Agreed
