Do you remember 50 Cent?
I do! He used to be so popular!
My favorite song from 50 Cent was "In Da Club"
That song was such a huge hit when it came out!
Yes, him and the various people in his G-Unit crew had great careers.
Is he still making music?
I think so! He also invests in things too.
What kind of things does he invest in?
He invested a lot of money into Vitamin Water many years ago.
Wow, I am glad to hear that he is getting creative and finding new ways to make money. That is a smart move.
