Are you a big football fan?
Yes, I watch NFL games a fair amount.
Who is your favorite team?
Probably the Atlanta Falcons. What about you?
Oh the Falcons. That was such a sad Super Bowl.
It really was. Did you watch it?
A little bit. It was rather depressing.
I could not believe they blew such a big lead.
I know. What was the score again?
The Falcons were up by 19 before the last quarter!
Oh, that's right!
Yep, and then the Patriots scored 19 points in the last quarter.
Tom Brady is a pretty great player.
I guess. I am still bitter about that game!
Where was that Super Bowl held?
It was in Houston, Texas.
Oh you're right. How many Super Bowls have the Patriots won now?
I believe this was their fifth.
I think you are correct.
Hopefully the Falcons will be good next year!
