Are you familiar with the Beatles' music?
Oh yes, they are one of my favorite bands.  Do you enjoy them?
They are my absolute favorite. What's your favorite song?
Hmm, that's a hard choice but I think In My Life. You?
Ooohh, nice choice.  I think mine is Eleanor Rigsby.  What era of their music do you like the most?
Probably what they were putting out in the 70s. I like that they were getting more experimental.
Yeah, I like that era too.  I think my favorite is their beginning time in the early 60s.
Yeah, they were more pop. One of the original boy bands, haha.
Yep, gotta love those classic early songs.
I agree!
