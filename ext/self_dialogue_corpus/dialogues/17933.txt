Do,you like,ringo Starr's solo music?
Yes,I think it's very good.
I agree with you.
He's been underrated for a long time.
Yes he has.
I believe he had more hits in the seventies than any other ex-Beatle had after the breakup.
I know,he is a great talent too.
Yes he is.
I love photograph and it don't come easy.
Great songs.
I like the no-no song.
That's a different song.
He wrote it after he went sober.
It has a lot of meaning for him.
That it did.
He's still performing.
And still writing.
I hear another album coming.
I heard early next year.
Good to hear.
