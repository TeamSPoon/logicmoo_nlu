Okay, what's your favorite genre of music?
Kind of hard to answer, I have a couple.
Okay, so what are you favorite genre's of music.
Well, heavy metal rock would have to be my first choice.
Okay, so what would be your second choice.
That would have to be Country music.
Heavy Metal and Country, don't you think that's a bit strange?
What do you mean?
I mean, heavy metal and COuntry are pretty far apart on the scale of music.
True, but I have an eclectic taste in music.
Okay, give a typical day of music listening.
Well, I might start out listening to Big and RIch, or Trace Atkins.
All right, a little bit country, then I presume you go a little rock.
Bad joke, Donny and Marie, but yes. I might switch to Rob Zombie or Metallica.
Kind of a one 180 turn, have a lot of rough days?
No, I just go with my own musical flow.
Uh, huh. I has no idead what you mean by that.
I mean, I might listen to 80s glam rock one day, then symphonic rock later that same day, followed by Country western music next.
Man, you weren't kidding about having an electic taste in music.
No, I wasn't.
