I've been listening to Led Zeppelin all week, such great stuff!
Yep, absolutely and it seems to never get old!  What songs have you been rocking out to?
Trampled Under Foot and In My Time Of Dying, both off the Physical Graffiti album.
I love that album!  Down By The Seaside reminds me of spending time with my family in Scotland.
Jimmy Page's guitar work is incredible.  He can be hard and rock out yet softly strum in the same song!
That makes me think of his work on The Rain Song.
What a beautiful song, have you ever seen the video that goes with it?
Yes, Robert Plant is riding a horse and he's like a hero going to rescue the damsel in distress.
That is from the Song Remains The Same video, isn't it?
Yes, part of that video is a concert and part of it is an acting/story dramatic thing, must be one of the first music videos ever!
