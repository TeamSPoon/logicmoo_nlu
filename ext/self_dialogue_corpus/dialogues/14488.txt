I am so mad right now.
Whats up why are you mad?
I am getting annoyed because the team is doing shitty.
I have not had the time to catch the game yet how shitty are they doing?
They are down by 20 and its the first half.
That is not to bad
Yes it is it is downright shameful.
Your way to hyped over the team
This is the first playoffs game if they lose that is it .
But at least they made it that for to the playoffs most teams do not make it quite that far
I guess your right with that fact
Only a select number of teams makes it far
True as their is over double the teams for the playoffs that do not make it.
Who knows it might not be too late though.
You are correct it is only the first half
they could pick it up and turn it around for the second half
True if they turn it around they could win
and then they can go to the next round you see
Man you are always right
It is just cooler heads prevail bro
