Who do you think will win the superbowl this year?
I think the Packers have a good chance.
Why do you think that?
Aaron Rodgers is one of the best Qb's in the entire league
I agree with that but they have some weaknesses
Yeah I agree with that too, their defense isn't very good
Unfortunately I completely agree, there are certainly better defensive teams
Also, they are consistently hurt at the most important time
Yeah last year their offensive line main men went down
That's the problem with a lot of teams
Who else do you think may win?
I think the Patriots always have a good chance under Bellicheck
Yeah I think they may already be the favorites
They have a strong defense and offense
Yes but the most important thing that really sets them apart is their coaching
Yeah, Bellicheck has won like 5 superbowls in the last 10 years
Never without Brady though
Yeah but I can see Brady sticking around for a while
We shall see
Goodluck to my favorite team, the patriots!
