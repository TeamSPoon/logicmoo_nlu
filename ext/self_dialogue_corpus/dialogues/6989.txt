I just saw Cars 3.
Oh! Was it good?
It was ok. The first will always be my favorite.
Yeah, I understand. It had to be better than the Planes version, right?
Yes, that one was terrible. The sequels have all kind of been lame.
Well, it's nice to see Owen Wilson in something again.
Yeah, it's been forever! He is definitely the voice of Lightning McQueen.
My kids just got rid of all their Cars toys. I'm sure they will be regretting that.
Yes, it kind of made me want to play with that stuff again!
I will have to take them tonight. It sounds fun!
