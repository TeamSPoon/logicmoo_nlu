The Lion King is one of my favorite Disney movies. How about you?
Hmm. Alladin has always been my favorite. The Genie always makes me laugh.
I have heard they are making a new Alladin movie.
Oh yeah!? Another animated film?
No. It is live action, like the Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson.
I loved that movie! Who's going to be in it?
I believe they are still casting but lots of rumors are comming in.
The genie will be some hard shoes to fill!
Robin Williams was always wonderful.
He was great in Flubber also!
