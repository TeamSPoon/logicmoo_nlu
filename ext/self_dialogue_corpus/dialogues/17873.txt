Has anyone heard the newest Nine Inch Nails album?
Do you mean Year Zero? That was so long ago.
No, there is a new album released online only. It is only a few songs, I guess, and only available via download.
Oh. No, I'm not a big enough fan to look for their stuff too hard.
Well, it's pretty decent. Seems more mainstream than some of the other stuff. Do you like them?
They're okay. I thought they were done making music other than for movies.
I guess not. It seems they may even be touring again. Have you heard anything about that?
I think I saw that they were going to perform in a festival in California somewhere.
Really? What festival?
The FYV Fest in LA.
I knew they were playing a festival in Sacramento in October. When is this one?
The FYV fest is in July. The 23rd.
Do you know how much tickets cost?
It depends. I got a weekend pass for $329
How much for just the one day?
Like a hundred bucks.
Cool. Do you know how long they are going to be on?
No idea.
What is your favorite NIN album?
The Downward Spiral.
