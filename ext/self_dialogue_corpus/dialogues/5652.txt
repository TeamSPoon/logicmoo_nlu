I love Disney movies!  Have you ever seen Snow White?
I sure have, it's and oldie but a goodie for sure, I think it came out in the 30's.
Yes, it did, 1937 to be exact.
The mirror and the Evil Queen scared the heck out of me when I was little.
Yes, me too, the voice of the Queen is so creepy and when she turns into the old hag, it's even creepier.
I kept yelling "don't eat the poison apple Snow White"!
The home of the seven dwarfs is so cute, tucked away in the woods.
Speaking of woods, wasn't that part scary when she was lost in the woods and the trees were like monsters?
Yes, the movie has some really scary stuff in it!
It's a great movie that will withstand the test of time for sure!
