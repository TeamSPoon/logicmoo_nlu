Do you know any movies that will help my kids understand mental health better?
Actually, yes. There are a bunch of Disney movies that tackle this theme, but the best is Inside Out.
Why is Inside Out such a good movie for mental health?
Well, it takes place both in the external world with interactions between real people and inside the heads of various customers.
So what's it like inside their heads?
Well, each of the main emotions is played by a character inside a person's head.
What emotions are there?
Disgust, joy, sadness, anger, and fear.
So like the negative emotions are bad and the positive one's are good in the movie?
No, not exactly, it's more nuanced than that. You need a proper balance of the positive and negative emotions.
