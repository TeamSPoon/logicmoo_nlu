It almost NFL time.
I know I can't wait.
Me either.
Are you going to do the parties at your place this year?
Yes, I am glad I finally have a house big enough.
Sweet! It will be great.
I have a great man cave in my garage.
Cool man.
Yeah, I got a 60 inch HD TV.
The games will be awesome on that.
Yes, I got the package where we can watch all the games too.
Awesome!
Satellite rocks man.
Sounds like you have it all planned out.
I do.
Now, if the Falcons go all the way this year.
This is their year. I feel it.
I hope you are right.
I am. No doubt.
I wish I had your confidence.
