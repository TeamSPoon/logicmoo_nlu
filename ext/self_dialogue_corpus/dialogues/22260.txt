Have you ever seen Big Trouble in little China?
I don't know, who is in it?
Kurt Russell.
Is that a newer movie?
No pretty old. He was very young in it.
No I'll have to look for it on Netflix.
It was good and funny too. His movies are usually entertaining.
Yea, I liked his movie called Overboard.
Me too, one of my favorites.
To think those tow have been together for a long time.
I think thats cute. Most in Hollywood don't stay together.
Yea Goldie Hawn is a good actress.
Kurt Russell was also good in Escape from L.A..
I saw that one, and Escape from New York.
Yea, me too. I like that one.
He was in some movie with Sylvestor Stallone too.
Yea, something about them being cops and being put in prison together.
Yeah I think they had to break out.
Yea, that might have even been the name.
It does sound familiar.
