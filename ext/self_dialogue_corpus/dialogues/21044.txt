Hey what´s up! have you seen Anabelle?
yes, wich movie?
Anabelle Creation
not yet
did you enjoy the first one?
I sure did! it was very scared
I think is one of the best terror movies ever
hmmm it is a good movie but I prefer The Exorcist
What? are you serious? the Excorcist is an old movie, is not scary at all
well the first time I saw it, I wasn´t able to sleep for a week
hahaha you truly are scared about everything then
the same thing happened when I watched Anabelle
I wasn´t so scared
I was, I even got rid of some dolls I had
wow it really got in to you
yes it did
so what about Anabelle Creation
do you think it will be scarier than the first one
I bet it will
well I´ll let you know once I watch it
