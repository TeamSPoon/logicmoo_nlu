What was the last movie you saw?
At a theater?
Yeah
God, I dunno um Harry Potter I think. I need to get out more. Put me in a nursing home. Sell the house. (Sigh)
So have you just not seen anything interesting to get you out?
Not for the prices they charge. I'll just wait for it to come out on dvd.
Aren't you afraid you'll miss movies you really want to see?
Not with all the other options today.
Is it because you're single?
That's part of it.  I've thought about going there, buying a ticket, sitting there watching it, then going home, and it's just not appealing
I get that. There's not anyone to analyse the movie with after, or reminisce with.
It just doesn't appeal to me.  I get it that some people enjoy that, but that's not me.
My friend becky enjoys it. She goes to art movies by herself.
I know there are, and that's fine, just not for me
I've thought about going to movies by myself. Mostly Disney and pixar, that I can't get anyone to go with me. I wanted to see a dogs purpose,  still want to see guardians of the galaxy 2, and the new minions movie.
Well, pick one and we'll go. I need to get out of the house. We might have to leave early if I'm in too much pain
Oh, well never mind then. I don't want to walk out of a movie half way through,  that would suck.
Well I know, and I'd try to make it, but with my broken hip, there's only so much I can take
I dunno. I'll think about it. The new guardians looks good and Chris pratt is hot.
Really? I think baby groot will be the best part of the show! I am groot!
