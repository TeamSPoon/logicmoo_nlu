So when is the last time you seen a Thriller movie in the theater?
Actually it was quite long ago.
What was the last movie that you seen?
Sadly it was Paranormal Activity.
Oh ok I love those movies.  I usually wait till they come out on DVD.
IF they make another you should be sure to go to the theater to see it.  It's a better experience.
What was a part in the movie that stands out to you?
I think the best part of the movie is when the girl gets drug out of her bed.
Oh yeah I remember that part.  Very scary.
Yeah I couldn't sleep for days just thinking about it.
