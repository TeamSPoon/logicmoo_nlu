Are you going to see the new Star Wars movie when it comes out?
I don't know....
You should.  Have you seen the original ones?
I did when I was younger.
Did you like those?
Actually, yes.  I thought they were really cool.  Did you like the prequels?
They were disappointing.
Why do you say that?
I hated what they did with the characters.  They were super overexaggerated.
I can see why you would say that.
Did you see them?
Yes, I thought the special effects were really great.
Oh, do you like things like that?
Yes, I think special effects make or break a movie.
Awesome.  So what movie  do you think has the best effects?
I think the cgi and effects from Avatar were amazing.
I heard that was a really good movie, but I've never seen it.
Wait you've never seen it?
No.  Want to watch it with me sometime?
Sure, I'd love to.
