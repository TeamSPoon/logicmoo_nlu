So have you seen any new movies lately?
Well I haven't really been out to the movies in a while.
Ok so then what was the last movie you saw?
The last movie I saw was Logan.
Oh yea? How was it?
It was really great. I really enjoyed it.
What did you enjoy about it?
Well firstly I'm a big fan of Wolverine so it was amazing.
Yea I really enjoy marvel movies!
It was so good if you haven't seen it yet you absolutely must!
I have seen it and I agree it was really good.
Not that this made a big deal but being R rated made the movie that much more interesting.
I completely agree. It made it much more edgier.
Yea it really does. What was the last movie you saw?
Well the last movie I watched was the new Underworld movie.
How was it? I didn't really get a chance to see it yet.
It was really good. It doesn't really explain anything, but it does kinda give you an idea of what happened in the last movie.
Ooh? Do you get to see more of her child? Cause she was amazing.
No you don't, she doesn't actually show up in the movie.
Well that sucks cause I thought she was amazing in the last.
