Have you ever seen Black Swan?
I haven't. I heard it's good though.
Natalie Portman is incredible in that movie.
Isn't she a ballerina in it?
Yeah. She becomes completely obsessed with artistic perfection.
Was it scary?
It was very chilling. It had a high sense of realism which made it even scarier.
I love movies like that. Does she go crazy?
Very much so. She even starts to hallucinate and imagine things.
That's awesome. I'm going to have to watch it now.
