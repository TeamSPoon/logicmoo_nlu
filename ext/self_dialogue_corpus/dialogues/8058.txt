What do you think about pop music?
I really don't.
Well, okay, I'm asking you to think about it.
I guess I'd say that it all sounds the same to me.
All about meeting someone you'd like to hook up with?
Yeah! And you know I can't relate to that.
Yeah. My own pet peeve about it is the vast number of times they throw "yeah" and "tonight" into a song.
I know what you mean! It's like they're not even trying.
Yeah, there have been some really well written pop songs in the past though.
I kinda like Fun's song I Wanna Be The One.
