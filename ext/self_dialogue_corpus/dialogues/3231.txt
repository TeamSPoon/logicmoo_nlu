Have you ever seen Waxworks?
The movie with Paris Hilton?
No, there was an older one.
Oh, really?  What was it about?
Some kids go to a wax museum at night.
Okay, and what happens?
They get sucked into the exhibits.  Pretty much they die.
Sounds interesting.  When is it from?
I want to say the 80s.
I might have to check that out.
