I really like the Pats offensive skill set.
They proved it against St. Louis, and they didn't even have Gronk.
That must have killed him.
Well, he was limited to 9 games, but he was as good as any other tight end.
True, but he is usually way better.You think he'll have a good year?
Yes, I see him on the circuit, no restrictions! He appears ready to go.
They also added the dude from New Orleans, what is his name?
Brandin Cooks.He can really fly?
How fast, faster than Hogan.For sure, not even a doubt!
Randy Moss then! I would not try to compare his speed to Moss.
He was different, almost all throws were upfield. Cooks is a bit shorter, too, but can also play the slot.
Really, they have 5 receivers, all at least very good. Malcolm Mitchell came on strong!
And Amendola keeps taking payouts in order to stay on the team. Danny is still a clutch player.With proper use, he could play two or three more years.
Do you think they should've jettisoned the big back?
Personally, what I think does not matter! We trust in Bill!
LaGarette Blount was on fire last year. He scored 18 touchdowns!
But, maybe Belicek always gets it right with guys. Can you remember any coming back to bite him in the..
No, he is the greatest coach in football history, even above Bill Walsh.
How about Vince Lombardi.He won the first two Superbowls. He would have won more if he came later.
Lombardi was great.But..what if the Pats win it again?
