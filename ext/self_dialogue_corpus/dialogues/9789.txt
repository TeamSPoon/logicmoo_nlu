Hi.
Hello.
Who's your favorite rapper?
I don't know if I have a favorite, not a huge fan.
If you had to pick one who would it be?
I really like Wiz Khalifa.
I've heard that name, but I don't know if I've listened to anything by him.
Really, he's all over the radio.
I usually listen to XM and don't catch a lot of rap.
Oh I see.
