Do you have a favorite classical music composer?
I've never really thought that much about it.
Well, are there any classical compositions that you especially like?
Hmmm... I like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. And Fur Elise.
Those are both great songs.
So maybe Beethoven is my favorite?
Not a bad pick. I am more partial to Bach.
He's the one that wrote Toccata and Fugue?
Yes, that was Bach.
I guess that was a pretty good song too.
What I like about Bach was how mathematical his music is.
What do you mean by that?
He wrote music in a way that had mathematical precision in the foundation. His songs were structured almost like equations.
Whoa! That's not a concept I've ever heard of.
Yes, it's very interesting. Most people think about music as free-form expression, but Bach's compositions were anything but.
I don't appreciate music on that deep a level. I just like a good tune.
I think Bach's songs work on that surface level too. Like you said, Toccata and Fugue is pleasant to listen to without knowing the deep stuff.
True. I'll still stick with Beethoven, though.
Nothing wrong with that. Both guys would be on the Mt. Rushmore of classical music.
Along with Mozart!
