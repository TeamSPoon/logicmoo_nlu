I have a movie to recommend to you.
Let's see. Which one?
"Silence". The last Martin Scorsese film.
I've been wanting to see it since I watched the trailer!
It is so good! Very psychological.
Tell me a bit about it.
It is about these two Catholic missionaries that go to Japan to evangelize and look for a priest that never came back from there.
Very interesting.
Yes, it is very intense and it has a lot of suspense.
Who are the actors?
The cast is unbelievable. The main two actors are Liam Neeson and Andrew Garfield.
Nice combo. Andrew Garfield got nominated this year for the "Oscars", but it wasn't because of this movie right?
No, it was because of another movie: Hacksaw Ridge. But I honestly think that his acting on "Silence" was better.
The kid is making a name for himself, right?
Definitely. In this movie you totally forget any other roles he has done in the past. He is very believable.
I will see it soon.
You wont regret it. After you see it we have to talk about it.
Sure. I'll give you my opinion.
I must warn you that you might be tempted to believe it is a true story but it is actually based on a Japanese novel.
Oh, ok. I'll keep that in mind.
