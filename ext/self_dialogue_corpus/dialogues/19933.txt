Did you ever listen to Iron Maiden?
Nah I never got around to it, but I've heard lots about them.
Want me to tell you more about them?
Sure, why not.
They were pretty big in the 80's, my dad's a huge fan.
Yeah I know that much at least.
They've got some really iconic songs and melodies though, which is cool for 80's metal.
I don't think I have heard any of them.
You should listen to The Trooper definitely, that one is on a few different albums I think.
Any others I should listen to?
The whole Piece of Mind album is good.
Don't they have a weird looking mascot?
They do, that's Eddie.
He has a name?
Yeah he's like a zombie character that's on all their album artwork.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah. Oh, also 2 Minutes to Midnight is good.
Was that on a Guitar Hero game?
Some of their songs were, it might have been.
I'll write those down and look them up when I get a chance.
