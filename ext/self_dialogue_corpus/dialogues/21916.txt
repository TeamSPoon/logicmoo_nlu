Seen any good movies lately
no I don't go to the movies much
So where do you watch them
at home we have a nice surround sound system and enjoy staying for watching movies
so what types of movies do you watch on your sound system
all kinds but when there is high action and loud sounds we blast it and turn up the base
sounds cool any favorites that you watch on it
oh sure many actually independence day is one we love watching so much action and explosions
yea that's a good one. I like comedies but action is enjoyable too
to you have a favorite comedy
not really but what about mary is one I can watch over and over again
agreed that's a good one I love animal house that one cracks me up to no end
same here movies aren't the same as they used to be
I know it's all about the money now
sure is too bad, bring back the wizard of ozz
now that was a unique movie especially for it's time
I know imagine how it would be made today with all the special effects and all
It would be tremendous the characters would be so creative and the entire scenery would be incredible.
I think I've seen it every year since I was born I watch it whenever it's on
I like to watch it around the holiday season as a family event
