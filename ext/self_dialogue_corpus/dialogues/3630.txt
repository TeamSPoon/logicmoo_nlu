Do you like thriller movies that sort of mess with your head?
Psychological thrillers?
Yes, like Momento.
I love those kind, the ones that make you question your own mind.
I like the ones that make me wonder the star is crazy, or it is all real.
Like Rear Window?
The old Cary Grant movie, yes.
I was so convinced he was crazy for half the movie.
I think that was the point.
I loved the ending, when it all ended well.
