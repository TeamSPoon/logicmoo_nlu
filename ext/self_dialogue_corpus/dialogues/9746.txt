So, listen to any rap hip/hop lately?
Actually, I just got done watching the new video for XO TOUR Llif3 by Lil Uzi Vert.
Oh, what did you think?
The video is freaking WEIRD, man.  The whole is like a single gif picture of this guy (I presume the artist) driving in his car with a red and blue gradient pattern where the window would be.
A gif?  What do you mean?
Well, the whole thing is like a cartoon with just four or five frames of animation looped endlessly while he's singing. I think it's intentional badly drawn as part of the "style".
Oh, they call that "Stylistic Suck" on the TV Tropes website.
Oh, didn't know that.. haven't to look that up.  Anyway, I don't know, the song itself is okay, I guess.  I'm biased though, it's not really my type of music.
Well, to each is own.
Another thing that bugs me about the image though is they've got a badly drawn nose ring coming out of the guy's nostrils, but it looks to me like he's got a runny nose!
