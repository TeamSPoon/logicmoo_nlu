How good was the movie The Lion King, released in 1994!
Yes, it has one of the best Disney animations
Great film, the plot is developed in Africa.
It is true, we can observe the different species of animals that appear in the film
His story is sad, it is that the king of the pack Mufasa betrays his brother and dies!
Of course, leaving orphan to Simba, who had to flee from the herd by his uncle stealing his throne.
Then Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon
They are very funny characters
They sing the song Hakuna Matata
Oh sure, that's my favorite song in the movie.
