Do you like any songs by Pearl Jam?
That's one of my favorite rock groups ever!
What's your favorite song by them?
Black. That's actually my favorite song period.
I know, mine too. It's so dark and painful but it's not hard at all to listen to like most songs that are dark.
I agree with that. Eddie Vedder has an amazing voice.
Have you ever seen the video for Jeremy?
I did and it was really disturbing but it showcased their talent.
It definitely did. If you don't know any song by them you at least know Jeremy.
That's right. I believe it was their most popular song.
