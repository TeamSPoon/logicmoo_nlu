What did you think about The Bourne Identity?
Probably one of my all time favorite movies.
I love Matt Damon
I saw the behind the scenes of how they make it, and they put a lot of detail into those fight scenes
The whole trilogy was good, but then it started to go downhill a bit when they introducted jeremy renner.
Yea, the bourne legacy was a bit weird.
And the newest Bourne Film was a bit lackluster too unfortunatly
I agree, the original 3 films were so good, that my expectations were probably just too high.
Here's hoping they can figure out a way to get that quality back.
I'm sure they will focus on a good story like the original
