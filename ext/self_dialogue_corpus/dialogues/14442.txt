DId you see the basketball game last night?
No, I didn't! What happened?
Oh it was crazy! I can't believe you missed it....
Just tell me what went down!
The game was between the Lakers and the Magic.
Okay, I love the Lakers.
I love the Magic.
Well, we can agree to disagree.
Well long story short, the Magic won.
That's nice! Was there a large point margin?
Not really, Magic was at 110 and Lakers was at 104.
Well good on the Lakers for almost trying.
Yeah, I agree. Are you going to watch the game next week?
Depends who is playing. Who are the teams?
I heard it's the Magic again versus the Warriors.
Hm, I'll have to check it out! Are the warriors good?
They're alright, but I think they're definetely memorable.
I agree with you. Well what time are the games at so I can watch?
They usually start at 7pm our time.
Great! Well I'll have to watch the game then.
