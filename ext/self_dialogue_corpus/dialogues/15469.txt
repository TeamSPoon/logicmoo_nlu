I just love Pentatonix!
I do to. They are amazing.
The amount of skill it takes to harmonize with four other people is beyond me!
I bet they practice non stop.
Their Christmas music is always on my playlist.
Mine too. Even in the summer!
Ya know, I have seen them with other artists too.
Yeah, I have even seen them on Seasame Street singing with the puppets!
One of my favorites is when they sang with Dolly Parton.
Jolene!
I heard that on of the members was leaving.
Really?
I think that for mental or emotions reasons he wanted out.
Wow, what will the others do?
Not sure. I wonder if they will try to replace him?
That would be really hard.
They just all seem so compatible.
A replacement would would be impossible.
Maybe it was just a rumor.
Lets hope so!
