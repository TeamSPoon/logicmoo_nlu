What year did Bambi come out?
I think it was around 1940.
Really? That long ago?
Yes, it was the second Disney movie after Snow White.
Wow, I didn't realize it was that long ago.
Yes, it still holds up though.
Yes, good characters.
I liked Thumper the rabbit.
Yes, he was a fun character
Especially when he would thump his foot.
