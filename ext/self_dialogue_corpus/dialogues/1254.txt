I am in the mood for some football!
I know! Will the NFL ever return?
It seems like it has been gone for such a long time! We are getting close at least.
I am excited to start having my Detroit Lions watch parties again. You will have to come over this Fall!
I did not know you did that, I would love to come!
Yea we just grill out here at the house and watch the Lions play.
That sounds like a great time, count me in this year!
Awesome! Speaking of the Lions, what kind of team do you think we will have?
My hopes are high! I am pretty excited about where we are right now.
Being a Lions fan has been painful over the years, so I am keeping my hopes in check.
I can understand that; although I think we finally have the parts to make a decent run.
I love Matthew Stafford and some of our other pieces. I am just hoping they come together the right way.
I think Jim Caldwell knows what he is doing, so I am confident.
I feel like in order for us to really become a contender, we have to get better on defense.
I agree with you there. We can not simply be in the middle of the pack in every category and expect to make a run!
We need to get better at linebacker first and foremost!
I know, I am hopeful that rookie Jarrad Davis can be the answer there.
He will really have to play well in order for us to get back to the playoffs in my opinion.
Our depth has been an issue for quite some time!
I know, I wished the front office would really address that in the coming years.
