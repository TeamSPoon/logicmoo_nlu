So what do you think about the Rams moving back to LA?
I am strongly against it, I think they NFL should have just created a new team for LA and one for Las Vegas.
Yeah, did you see they fired Jeff Fisher last week?
He is great coach, but he was giving a terrible team to try to win with, and it just could not be done.
Speaking of Las Vegas, I guess you seen the Raiders are moving there in the next few years.
Now Vegas is going to have the NFL and the NHL.
Are there enough core people that live in Vegas to support two pro teams.
I have no idea, I thought most of the population there was tourists.
I wonder who is going to be the team to beat this year in the NFL.
Probably the Patriots, like always, and their cheating ways.
Probably so, but Dallas made a strong showing this past year.
That rookie quarter back and the rookie running back for Dallas are great additions.
I wonder if we have heard the last of Kapernack and his refusing to stand for the national anthem.
Well, with his team that won I think four games last season, I am  not sure why we heard about him at all.
Yeah, the 49'ers were terrible last year, almost as bad as the Rams.
I am really pulling for Green Bay to have a strong year.
Yea, Aaron Rodger didn't have the greatest of years this past year, but he is still a great quarterback.
Cam Newton is also great, but how his team went from a superbowl appearance one year to a losing season the next is beyond me.
I think they lost a lot of their core players and some were injured.
Well, hopefully someone can step up and knock the Pats off their pedestal this year.
