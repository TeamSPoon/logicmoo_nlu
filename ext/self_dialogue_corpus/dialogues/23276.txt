Did you ever see a classic movie and wonder what all the fuss was about?
Yeah. Totally. I felt that way when I saw Citizen Kane.
Me too!
I think I might have been too young when I saw it.
Yeah. I didn't get it. I read a film critics book and they said it was the best movie of all time.
Right. That is what I always heard, too.
It was not a memorable film for me. I can really only remember the last scene.
The "rosebud" scene.
Yes. I would be interested in going back again, with more sophistication and knowledge to see if the film means anything to me now.
Let's do that together. We can have a little film club discussion.
Let's do it. How old were you when you saw it?
Early 20's.
Same here. I think that genius of that film is in the cinematography, maybe?
Maybe. Maybe the genius of it is in the angles and lighting, because it didn't seem like it was in the story or plot.
Yes. Let's watch it again. I would be interested in starting a film night with you to watch classic films.
That sounds great.
At Halloween let's watch The Phantom of the Opera and Nosferatu.
Yes. Classics! And let's watch really, long difficult films that we are too lazy to watch on our own. I never even saw Gone with the Wind, can you believe it?
Me either! Let's watch silent films. Let's watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari together and Buster Keaton flicks.
It sounds great. You're right. I am too lazy to watch these on my own. Some company and discussion would make it far more enticing.  I will pop the popcorn!
