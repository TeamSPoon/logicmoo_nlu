Are you a fan of Cam Newton?
I love him. He's a great player
He is, and he's also a pretty snappy dresser.
Yes. He does have that going for him as well.
Do you think the Panthers will have a good season?
I don't know. They're all over the map lately.
I think Drew Brees and the Saints might be okay this year.
I think Drew is a little old.
True. The bears need to get their QB situation straight too
For sure. I think Mike Glennon will be good though
They only went 3-13 last year so anything is better
absolutely. I don't like John Fox.
He used to coach the Panthers correct?
Yes. He was bad with them too.
Who coaches them now
Ron Rivera is the coach.
Ah. Riverboat Ron.
He's a great coach I think
I agree hopefully he takes the panthers somewhere this year.
Anything is better than 6-10
