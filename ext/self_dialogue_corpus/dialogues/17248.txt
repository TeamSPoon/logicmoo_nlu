Hey, have you heard the new Eminem song, "I Miss You"?
No, what's it like?
Well it's in the same direction as his newer stuff, and Dre produced the beat.
Wow cool, I generally prefer his older stuff but I'll check it out.
Yeah me too, what's your farovite album?
I personally like the Marshall mathers LP.
Oh cool, I like the Slim Shady LP.
That's a good one too, have you been to one of his concerts?
Yeah, at the last one I went to some girl threw a beer bottle on stage.
Yeah crazy stuff like that happens all the time at his concerts.
That's why I'd much rather go to a Snoop Dogg concert, less violence.
Yeah I really think Eminems lyrics can promote violence at his concerts.
I wonder why that is. Do you buy any merch while your there?
Yeah because they really don't get much money from their record companies, so I like to buy their merchandise from the stands.
Me too, I picked up a sick shirt last time.
Nice, I have a whole collections of ones I picked up from rap concertts.
Do you go to any different types of concerts?
Yes, I also go to electronic, such as Daft Punk.
Yeah I saw them last year with Skrillex, I think Skrillex did better.
Well Skrillex is good too yeah.
