What do you think of Areosmith?
One of the best bands of all time.  They have so many hits they need a greatest hits of greatest hits list.
Tell me about it.  Just pure awesome rock.
I really liked Dream On.
Yeah, the way it built up was just pure energy.
What about Back in the Saddle?
I always sing that to myself when I'm getting back someplace I haven't been in a while.
Me too.  What else was good?
Living on the edge.
Oh yeah great song.  What about Crazy?
Or Walk this Way.
Another great one was I don't Wanna Miss  A Thing.
Oh man almost a perfect song.  Great Rock Ballad.
I really liked their cover of Come Together.
Yeah, these guys are like music maniacs.
Boston based band too.
Which is why Steven Tyler sings at Fenway for the World Series so often.
Yeah, did you see the time he did the Esplanade on the 4th?
Holy cow that was ten types of awesome.
Yeah, I'd like to see them do it again.
