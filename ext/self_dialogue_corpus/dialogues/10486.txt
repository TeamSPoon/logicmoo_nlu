Have you seen the new movie, Pirates of the Caribbean?
Is it the most recent one?
Yea! Dead Man Tell no Tales.
I have not! Was it good?
I really enjoyed it.  They have brought back some of the original actors.
Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley?
Yes, those two are the best.
I know! I'm excited to see it now.
What about the new Baywatch?
With Zac Efron and The Rock?
Yes that's it.
Hmm...not sure if I would like to see that one.
It seems like it's a very stereotypical movie.
I agree with you.
I'm excited to check out The Mummy!
Is that with Tom Cruise?
Yes, and Russell Crowe.
Those are some of my favorite actors!
Me too, I can't wait to check it out.
Let's go together!
