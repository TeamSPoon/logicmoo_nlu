Do you know if they're planning to do a Little Mermaid live action remake?
I haven't heard anything about it. With the way they've been going this route, it's only a matter of time.
I think they will do Pocahontas first and then perhaps something like Aladdin.
Little Mermaid would be a lot more fun to remake. The ocean setting, the world undersea would be fantastic to recreate with today's technology and CGI available to Disney.
I think that's why it would also be difficult to do because that sounds like it would be a really big budget project.
When have you known Disney to not go all out on a film of theirs? They're the kings of current big productions!
That's true, you're right, I could imagine it. I hope the Little Mermaid get's moved up the list. I really want to see who would play the new Ariel.
There are so many options. I'm excited about how they would approach the sea.
I need more Sebastian the crab in my life!
There's a slight homage to Sebastian in Moana if you caught it, the end credits.
