What do you think of Nine Inch Nails?
I absolutely love them.
Do you have a favorite record by them?
Hm.. I have to say With Teeth.
With Teeth was really underrated.
It sure was. The whole thing is a gem.
Do you have a favorite track off of the album?
Probably "Sunspots". So good.
"Sunspots" is catchy. Very groovy hooks.
Yeah it's hard not to want to dance to it.
Trent knows how to make a good song.
Yeah. From a lot of different elements of rock as well.
Their discography is so vast.
Yeah, Trent has been at it forever now.
And he still has it too.
He sure does.
Hopefully their next record is decent.
It's hard to think it wouldn't be counting his track record.
You raise a good point there.
We'll see when the record comes out at least.
