What is your favorite Disney movie?
Beauty and the Beast.
Oh, I love that one too!
Belle is my favorite princess.
I know, I love to see a female lead that is smart and loves books.
That's my favorite part!
Did you see the live action movie?
Yes, I thought it was great!
I love that Disney is doing more of those types of remakes.
Me too, it brings a whole new side to the classic movies.
