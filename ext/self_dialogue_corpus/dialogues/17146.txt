Yes. and you said no.
That's correct.
And now you're asking me what?
Are their a set of note in the pentatonic scals, C, D, E, G, A, where the notes are separated by more than a whole step?
Oh, ok i get it now.
So are there?
Yes. between E and G
Is the c major pentatonic scale a hemitonic or ditonic scale?
Yes.
Correct. But you did miss one thing.
What?
You said between E and G. you missed between A and C.
Oh.... ok.
Yep.
So... this is important why?
because you asked how Debussy used them. or soemthing or other, I don't remeber.
Oh yeah, I was wondering how he invented all this but he didn;t so I don't care.
Um. he frequently used all these devices
There it is again the devices.
Yes. A creative process requires employment of various devices.
