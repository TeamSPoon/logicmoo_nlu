What is your favorite line in the Beatle's song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?"
That's hard to say! I think I like the phrase "kaleidescope eyes" the most.
It's definitely beautiful imagery - and a little crazy!
For sure! What about you, what's your favorite phrase or line?
I like "looking glass tie". I always picture a mirror in the shape of a tie.
Yeah - it's almost like you could see yourself reflected in that person's heart.
Exactly. Another interesting song is "We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"
Tell me about it! Though it does have a catching rhythm.
Once my five year old sister heard and she was singing it all day long for days!
Oh no! How did you get her to stop?
