Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I've only seen the 6th one, and the end of the 7th one.  Do you like them?
I think they're pretty fun.  Dumb but fun.
I liked what I saw.  It's always fun to watch Dwayne Johnson throw people around.
Oh yeah, the scene in the interrogation room?
Yeah - jeez, that was a lot of damage!  The light fixtures too?
Well, that's what you get when you mess with Dwayne.
I can tell!  How about that scene with the plane?
That was great!
How did the plane stay at such a low altitude without crashing?
