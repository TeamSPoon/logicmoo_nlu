Seen anything interesting in the theaters lately?
No, I want to see the new Wonder Woman, but I'm not sure the kids are ready for movies like that yet.
Yeah, my younger one wouldn't be, and our boys are close to the same age.
We were thinking maybe Cars 3, but I don't know if Pixar/Disney have another good Cars story in them.
I read that there's a female technician as a main character in this one. That's a good message.
It is. I like that.
The older boys might like A Wimp Will Rise, it's based on those Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.
My boys love those books.
So did mine, though they didn't like the first movie quite as much.
Mine either.
Despicable Me 3 is coming out, but we haven't seen any of those.
Oh, you should go. My boys love Despicable Me.
I see the Minions everywhere, and people seem to really like them, but I don't get it.
They're just funny. And cute.
What do you think of Captain Underpants?
My kids enjoy the books, but I'm not fan.
Yeah, it seems a little... lowbrow.
It is, which is what they like about it.
Bathroom humor is always a big hit with boys, I think, but I don't really want to encourage it.
I know, right?
