Have you seen the animated movie Tarzan?
Sure it is a pretty good one.
Do you know who was the voice of the baby ape Terk?
Wasn't it Rosie O'donnell?
I am not sure but whomever it was I think it was my favorite character just because of the voice.
I am not sure I understand, what do you mean?
All of the disney characters seem to have a predictable voice.
Like low and gruff for a villain and high and melodious for a heroine?
Yes but Terk's voice was gravelly and hit the punch lines with just the right tone that it sunk in for me.
I will have to rewatch it so I can hear what you are talking about.
