I think it would have been awful to live on the Death Star.
Well, it blows up, so yes, it would have been.
I meant before that.  It's cold, large, empty of emotion.
But probably was an engineering feat if you think about it.
How many people would it have taken to build that thing?
I would think tens of thousands.  It was basically a small planet
How many people lived on it you think.
Who knows, but I'm guessing several thousand.
And now they're all dead.
You are truly a buzzkill.
