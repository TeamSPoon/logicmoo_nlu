So what do you think about the movie Bad Moms?
Oh I don´t have an opinion yet, I have not seen it. Is it good?
I am not sure, I have bias feelings toward it.
Why is that so?
I did not like that they would prefer to be bad moms but at the end it sorta worked out.
Oh really, no I am intrigued, I´ll have to rent it or watch it on Netflix.
Please do! and tell me what you think of it.
Which actress are on the movie?
Oh the cast is really good. You have Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate
Oh, then I definitely have to see it, I like Mila Kunis really much.
Oh really, which other movies of Mila Kunis do you like?
Black Swan, Friends with Benefits, Oz the Great and Powerful, Forgetting Sarah Marshall
Ohh I just realized that Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell is not their first movie working together.
You are right! They co-stared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
What did you think about this movie?
It was funny, but I do not recommend anyone to experience this in real life, it´s heart breaking.
You are right. My favorite one though is Black Swan.
Really?, why is that?
I just love ballet and how hard the ballerinas have to work to get their part.
Your are right, even though Mila turned out to be a figment of Natalie Portman´s imagination in the movie.
