i wish they would remake blazing saddles.
That is sacrilegious.
Why? Just update it with more modern actors.
What does that even mean? It's set in the 1900s. We can't have a modern actors. It's a period spoof.
Anyway, it will be more fun if it was updated with new actors, then. y'know famous people.
Why did I even begin this conversation. That makes no sense.
well think of it. Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle playing the sheriff. it will be hilarious.
Whatever, One thing I don't get is why people like Tootsie so much.
That wasn't very good if you ask me. But because it was set in the 70s. I just hate movies from that era.
I haven't watched in a decade I think. I don't even remember the details of it. But remember it being boring.
