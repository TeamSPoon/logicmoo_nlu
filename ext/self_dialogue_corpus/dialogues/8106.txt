Have you heard Hanson's new song yet?
No I haven't what is it called?
I was Born, its one of their best songs ever!
Thanks! I'll have to look for it on Spotifiy.
The music video is even better, they have their kids in it.
Shutup! That's amazing, I can't believe they have kids- they are my favorite band of all time.
I know! They are just as cute as ever....who's your favorite?
Zac, he was in 1996 and he still is today.
Did you start with Middle of Nowhere?
Yes, best cd and I still stream it.
