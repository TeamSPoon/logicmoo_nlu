Hey did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?
They're doing what?
Yeah, moving to Vegas.  No more Oakland Raiders
Wow, I hadn't heard.  You know this isn't their first move.
Really. I always assumed they were from Oakland.
No, I think they have moved a few times but always end up back in Oakland.
Well, I wonder what the Raider fans think about that.
They are pretty loyal in Oakland.
I know, you don't get fans like them anywhere else.
They are crazy.  Wearing all that stuff like skull head on their shoulders and all that.
Yeah, pretty insane.  I think that they are the wildest fans in the NFL.
The dog pound gets pretty crazy too.
True but not like it used to before the old Browns left Cleveland.
Of course there is the Dirty Towel too in Pittsburg.  They have some pretty good fans too.
They sure do.  Stemming from the 70's when they won four titles in like 5 years.
Yeah, the old Bradshaw days.
Those were good but being a Dallas Cowboy fan those kinda still hurt as two of those was against the boys.
Yeah, classic confrontation.
Too True.  I waited 19 years but they finally got them back in 95'
Took you a long time to get revenge on the Steelers.
