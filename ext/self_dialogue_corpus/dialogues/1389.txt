Whose your favorite ex-footballer?
I liked Ochocinco!
But he wasn't a great player.
He had personality and style!
Now that, he definitely had.
He has lots of personality, if nothing else.
He became a celebrity!
Yes, they let him in Hollywood!
He belonged there.
But he wasn't that crazy while still playing!
Yeah, he flourished.
Whose your favorite?
TO. Terrell Bryant!
Another reality star.
I got to see his personality on his show.
The show was short lived!
Maybe he can play ball again.
I doubt it.
Is he that out of shape?
I'm sure he is.
