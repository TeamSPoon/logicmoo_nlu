What do you think about the Giants this year?
They are going to be pretty good.
Yes, but it is a tough division.
For sure, the Redskins will be good too.
You don't think the Cowboys are better?
I think that Cousins is the better quarterback.
Yeah, but Zeke might run for 2000 yards.
Sure, but that is only because Dez Bryant is old and not as good as he was.
I know what you mean, their receivers are trash.
Do you think the Eagles will compete in the division?
Perhaps, but I'm not sure how good their offense will be, it was pretty bad last year.
Yeah, they are still suffering from hiring Chip Kelly.
For sure, he should have stayed at Oregon.
I know, trading away Shady McCoy was his was of snubbing the team, the writing was on the wall with him leaving.
He was too stubborn to take advice and learn from mistakes.
Speaking of mistakes, how about Eli's interceptions?
Oh no. There is that. Maybe getting Marshall will help, he is a big bodied target.
Yes, I'm excited to see him out there.
Do they still have Cruz?
I'm not sure, I'll read up on that.
