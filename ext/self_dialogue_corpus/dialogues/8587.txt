Did you notice that Green Day wasn't at the Grammy's
Yeah, weird....
They had a new album out this year too.
They won best album a few years back.
Rock is dieing and they're the only ones trying to keep the ship afloat.
I can't hardly listen to the radio anymore.
Just the "oldies".
Ha! Never thought I'd be part of that croud.
We're a dying breed freind.
Too true!
