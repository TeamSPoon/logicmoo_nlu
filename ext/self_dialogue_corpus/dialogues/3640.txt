Hey' have you ever watched the movie Limitless?
No, what's it about, some sports film.
No, Bradley Cooper plays a frustrated author whose life is a mess. Then, his former borhter in law offers him a nootropic drug called NZT-48
Nootropic drug. What kind of drug is that?
They're drugs that improve the function of the brain. Who know that old adage that we only use 10% of our brains.
Yeah, so this stuff let's you use more of it?
More like all of it! One pill and you have a triple digit IQ and perfect recall of everything you've ever seen, heard, or read.
Okay, but what's the downside?
The downside is the drug isn't common and the withdrawl symptoms can cause hospitalize you or even kill you outright.
Yikes! Thanks for the info, I've the movie a look, but don't offer me any of the that drug.
