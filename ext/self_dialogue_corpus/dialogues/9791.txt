Have you seen the new movie about Tupac Shakur?
I haven't, but I really loved Tupac's music.
Do you like his songs more when he's being political or personal?
I'm not sure I can separate the two. Actually, part of what makes his music so strong to me is the way that he brings the two together.
I think everybody I knew bought a copy of "All Eyez on Me". It was a classic album.
So was "Makaveli". It had such symbolism and depth.
Do you think there's been a West Coast rapper better than Tupac?
Definitely not; he was the all time great. I do like The Game, though.
I like West Coast beats, they are so funky and smooth.
I wish there would be a resurgence of that kind of assertive party music.
