What do you think of Neil diamond going out on his fiftieth anniversary tour.
I think it's great.
I'd love to see him again.
You've seen him live before?
Yes,probably close to ten times.
I've seen him,around five times myself.
What a great live performance he puts on.
It's an incredible show.
I think hot August night was one of the best live albums ever put out.
Oh god yes!
Absolutely rocked.
Right from the start with crunchy granola suite.
Wow,what an opening.
Shilo,Kentucky women and,play me.
They were all on that  album.
Song sung blue and morningside too.
Sweet Caroline still huge today.
The ending of the concert with I am I said and holly holy.
Right into,soolaimon.
And finished with brother loves traveling salvation show
