Do you listen to Lady Gaga?
No, I only have heard some of her hits.
She's a legend and a true artist.
Is she though? She seems like a cookie cutter pop star to me.
What do you mean? What other pop star has worn raw meat on their body as a dress?
Wasn't Art Pop her last album? It's only for shock value so tabloids will print her.
She's a talented singer. What's not to like?
Yeah, she does sing better than some pop stars, but all her songs sound like everything else.
"Pokerface" was a masterpiece! She even does tributes to classic rock legends. I think she performs jazz too.
That's great, but her talent and art image hasn't really kept her relevant. Her career seems to be on the decline.
