Do you know any films about Mickey Mouse?
Yes! I know Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas.
Is that just another holiday film?
No! It's actually really good.
What happens in it?
Mickey just goes through a series of unrelated stories.
Will it make me laugh?
It might, I don't know you.
Will it make me cry?
Probably not, it's a children's movie.
What style is it?
It's computer-animated. Mickey is in it, and so is Daisy Duck.
Would you recommend it?
I think I would for a child. It's not that great.
Is it tired?
Yes, it tells the same old story again and again, and not really well.
Is it just to sell more Mickey stuff?
It could be described that way.
Should I see it?
I would say so, yes. It's available online, too.
