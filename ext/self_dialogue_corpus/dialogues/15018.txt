So what is your favorite comedy movie of all time?
I really liked the original Dumb and Dumber with Jim Carrey.
That is such a funny movie, did you see the sequel?
Yes, I try to pretend it didn't happen because of how bad it was.
Yeah, it wasn't as funny as the original, what other Jim Carrey comedies do you like?
I really enjoyed The Mask and The Cable Guy.
The Cable Guy was such a funny movie, I really liked Matthew Broderick in it.
Yes, though he wasn't as good as he was in Ferris Bueller.
Oh, I love that movie, so funny and good.
I love the part where he sings and dances on the float!
