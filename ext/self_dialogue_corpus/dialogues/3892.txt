What did you think of Gone Baby Gone?
Don't remember it offhand.  Who was in it?
Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman...
Oh, I remember it now.  That was a great film.
Very skilfully done by Ben Affleck.
He's a better director than actor in my opinion.
The ending is so sad.  The mother doesn't even really care about her daughter.
It makes you wonder if the guy made the right choice.
He obviously didn't.  That's the crux of the moral dilemma.
What a horrible thing to have to live with.
