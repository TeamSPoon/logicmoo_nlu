What is your favorite action movie franchise?
Marvel hands down.
I like Pirates of the Caribbean.
Both franchises are great.
What action movie do you hate?
I hated Jupiter Ascending.
I don't like the Matrix because the first was good but the next two ruined it.
I like old action movies as well.
Me too I like the Terminator.
I prefer the Die Hard movies.
