I am excited about the new Chris Pratt movie!
Do you mean "Gaurdian's of the Galaxy Vol. 2" or "Jurassic World 2"
Gaurdians of the galaxy of course. I did not know they were making a second Jurassic World.
They are, and critics seem to think it will be better then the first.
Chris Pratt is definitely hero material.
Yes, his combination of comedy and caring really works for all of his movies.
Will Bryce Dallas be in this one as well?
Yes, she is slated to reprise her role as Claire Dearing.
Will it be a sequel? Picking up where the first one left off?
I am not sure. There has been talk that it will not center around a "theme park" at all.
What would the plot be then?
I have heard they may be going in a different direction. Maybe dinosaurs and humans co-existing?
Is anybody else coming back to reprise a role from one of the other movies?
Yes, on April 25, 2017 it was announced that Jeff Goldblum would be reprising his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm from the first two films.
Wow, I loved his character!
He was always one of my favorites as well.
I wonder where they are filming?
I am pretty sure they filming in Hawaii.
When is the release date?
Universal announced a release date for the film is scheduled for a June 22, 2018.
