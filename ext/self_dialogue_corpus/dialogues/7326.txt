My favorite Disney movie is Hercules.
Oh, I love that one!
The sense of humor is excellent.
I love Kuzco.
He is so funny.
The music in it is nice too.
Yeah I feel like it's under appreciated
For sure. I also like Alladin for the humor
Robin Williams is fantastic.
I wish he did more voiceovers for Disney movies.
