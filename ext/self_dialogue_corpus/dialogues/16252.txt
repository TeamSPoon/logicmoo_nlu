What do you think is the most romantic song?
Unchained melody.
Is that the song that is in ghost?
Yep. It is by The Righteous Brothers.
That is such a romantic song and scene. Good call.
I think it was voted the most romantic song of all time. At one point anyway.
I just always think of ghost and patrick swayze , demi moore and that pottery wheel.
Yes very iconic. Speaking of swayze. Did you know he wrote the song in Dirty Dancing?
What song? There are many in the film.
She's like the wind.
I thought he only sang that , he really wrote that too?
Yes, apparently he thought the lyrics were cheesy. But I loved it.
I always cry when that song comes in on the film.
Ya it may be the plot but it also is such a moving song.
He should be proud to have written and performed it so well.
I guess he also felt the dancing was a little cheesy too.
Well he was a trained ballet dancer. It is much more difficult than ballroom.
Fair enough, but if he can dance, sing and songwrite like that no need to  be ashamed in any sense.
All musicians and actors seem to have some deep insecurity and peculiarities.
Ya who knows what demands of being the public eye in that capacity does to you.
