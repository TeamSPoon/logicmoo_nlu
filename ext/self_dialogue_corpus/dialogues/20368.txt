Have you ever seen any of Hirokazu Koreeda's movies?
I only saw the one that was on Netflix called Like Father, Like Son.
I saw another one on Netflix called I Wish.
What's it about?
Two young brothers who want to reunite their divorced parents so they can be a whole family again.
It seems his movies tend to revolve around family related themes.
Absolutely, this one is no different. It is a beautifully told story that truly captures a child's perspective.
Like Father, Like Son had incredibly gifted child actors.
This movie is the same. In fact, the brothers in the movie are brothers in real life!
I'm sure that contributed to the organic feel of the movie.
Koreeda actually didn't even initially write the film. He casted the boys first, and then he wrote the film after that.
That's an interesting approach that allows him to tailor the characters around the actors' real personalities.
Precisely. The childhood innocence and optimism is very touching in this film.
How many times have you seen it?
I watched it alone the first time and with my family the second time.
Would you say it is a slice of life movie?
Yes, and I think the Japanese do these films the best.
I have to agree. The introspective nature of the characters is usually conveyed in a way that seems natural and unforced.
How is the music in this film?
Not my taste... a little bit like American country. It worked for the movie, though.
