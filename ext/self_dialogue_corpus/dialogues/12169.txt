What did you think about Return of the Jedi.
It was awesome.  Great capstone to the original three movies.
Yeah, good fight at the end too.
And a good introductoin to the Emporor.  I mean a proper one anyway.
Yes, he'd be very important in the prequels.
Yeah, he was a good bad guy.
One of the best parts of the movie, was the escape from Jaba.
I also like the Ewoks.  They were pretty cool.
Yeah, they were cute.  But vicous in battle.
I agree, they took out loads of Emperial Troops.
