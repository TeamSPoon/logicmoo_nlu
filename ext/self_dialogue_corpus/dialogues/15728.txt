Do you know what band I've been listening to a lot lately?q
I don't know, who?
The Grateful Dead!
Are you serious?
Yeah. I never really got into them before.
So does this mean you're a huge hippie now?
No, that's the thing. That's all I could associate them with.
Like, patchouli and good vibes man.
Yep. But I tried to ignore my associations with all that hippie culture, and their music is actually great!
Really? I mean I guess I never really gave them a chance either. I thought it would be super cheesy.
That's exactly what I thought.
So was their a specific song that changed your mind?
Wharf Rat. It's amazing.
What album is that from?
It's from their eponymous "Grateful Dead" record they released in 1971.
That's easy enough to remember.
Check it out. It's legitimately a classic.
I'll do that. I guess they couldn't have had such a crazy following if they weren't at least... good.
That one song especially.... it doesn't require any knowledge about them as a band, It's just a great intro to the Grateful Dead.
Alright, I'll listen to it tonight.
