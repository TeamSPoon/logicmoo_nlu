What is your favorite action movie?
I really like Gladiator.  Braveheart will probably come second.
Gladiator is one of my favorites too.  It was just a well-done movie from the beginning to end.
I still get teary-eyed when I saw the last scene of Maximus' friend burying Maxmimus' small carvings of his family.
One action movie that I love that doesn't get enough credit is Conan the Barbarian.
Conan the Barbarian?  Is that the movie with NBA Basketball player Wilt Chamberlain?
No, that was the sequel to Conan the Barbarian.  The name was Conan the Destroyer.
Conan the Destroyer was absolutely awful.
James Earl Jones did a great job portraying the villain Thusla Doom in Conan the Barbarian.  He made the movie for me.
The actions scenes in the movie were great too.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime then.
