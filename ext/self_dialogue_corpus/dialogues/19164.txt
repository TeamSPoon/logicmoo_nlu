What's,your thoughts on Sinatra?
I like franks songs.
Boy did he have a lot.

I always wanted to see him live.
I know. I never did either.

I,definitely agree.
Imagine hearing,summer wind,or lady is a tramp.
I can't imagine how good it had to be.
Or him belting out my way.

Yes,I've heard that.
Sinatra opened up a musical venue near me in the seventies.
Did he really?
Yes he did.
And of course you didn't go l
No,I somehow missed that.
You have to regret that.
