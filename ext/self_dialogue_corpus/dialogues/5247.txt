Peter Pan was such a good play and movie
I know I really enjoyed it, I liked the fairies
I have heard a theory that Peter Pan was really a dead boy who was getting other kids who had died
I know,the author of the book had a brother who had passed away
that's right and people think he wrote the book with his brother in mind
the lost boys were great though, they were so messy but took care of themselves
the part when they show how Peter Pan got lost as a baby was sad
I know, he just rolled away down the hill
I wonder why Captain Hook was so angry with Peter Pan, he was a scary man
he was but in the end he had what was coming his way !
