Okay so classic Disney movies. How about Cinderella?
That was a good one. The music was catchy.
It was. Although it was a bit of a girl movie.
No kidding. A girl is forbidden from going out by her step mom - total teen drama, right?
My thoughts exactly. The step mom probably wasn't even that evil.
No, that was just Cinderella's take on it.
And there's no way Prince Charming was that charming.
I wouldn't think so. Most prices are sort of spoilt and ill adjusted.
Well, it's definitely a young woman's fantasy. Right down to the Fairy God Mother.
Who's skilled at producing ball gowns! For sure.
