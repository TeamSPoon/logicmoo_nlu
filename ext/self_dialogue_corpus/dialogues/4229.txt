What was the last great thriller film you saw?
Hm, recently? Probably No Escape with Owen Wilson.
Oh yeah, that was pretty good. I like the Jason Bourne movies a lot, too.
Yes, those are good. He is a very convincing super agent.
What about the older thrillers? Like Fatal Attraction?
Oh, that's so creepy. Great movie. Good cautionary tale.
I also liked one called No Way Out with Kevin Costner. Had a great twist ending.
The one where he's a Secret Service agent?
I think so. It's been a long time. I just remember he made out in the back of a limo with someone.
Oh yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of, too.
