Have you seen the new movie Get Out?
No, but I heard it had a great score on Rotten Tomatoes.
I just saw it last night.
How was it?
It was not at all what I was expecting.  The plot line was a little different than what I was expecting, but it was still pretty good.
Would you recommend it?
I think so.  Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just went to the cinema and saw Baywatch a few days ago.  It was great!  I love Zac Efron!
Isn't The Rock in it too?
He is. They are so funny together.  I wasn't sure about this remake, but it was very funny.
Is it comparable to the original Baywatch?
It is.  It's just a little more modern.
Do you usually like movies with Zac Efron?
I do.  I think he's pretty funny, plus he's nice to look at.
Have you seen The Neighbors?
I have.  It's one of my favorite Zac Efron movies.
I like The Neighbors because Seth Rogan is in it.
Seth Rogan is so funny!
Did you see The Neighbors 2?  I did and I liked that one even better than the first one.
I did, and I agree with you.
