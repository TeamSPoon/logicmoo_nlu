Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, but I've heard about it.
Dude, it's awesome.
I just saw the Force Awakens.
Well, go see Rogue One.
What's it about?
I don't want to spoil it, but it's about how Vader becomes the man.
Well now that does sound pretty good.
It's better than Force Awakens.
Damn, now I've got to see it.
