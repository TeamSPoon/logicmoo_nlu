So have you chosen a song for your wedding dance yet?
No, I'm still undecided. I was thinking "Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol, but I don't think that will work.
Why not?
Because my fiancé hates it.
Yeah, probably not the best choice then. What about Ed Sheeran?
Maybe. I mean, I really like his voice, but I'm not that familiar with his stuff.
He's got a great song called "Thinking out Loud". It's about staying in love as you grow old together.
That sounds perfect!
Speaking of "Perfect", that's the title of a song from his latest album. That one might work, too.
Is it a romantic love song? Because that's what I'm looking for.
It's very romantic.
I'll have to check both of those out.
Wait, didn't you say you were into R&B and hip-hop?
Oh yeah, especially Beyoncé and Rihanna.
Why don't you use one of their songs?
Hmm. Which one are you thinking?
"Stay" by Rihanna?
I like that one. It's a little too sad, though.
True. How about "Halo" by Beyoncé then?
Oh, that's perfect!
