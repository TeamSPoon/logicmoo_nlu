Did you watch the Oscars this year?
I did actually.
What did you think of the show?
I was disappointed.
Why was that?
My favorite movie didn't win a lot of awards.
What movie was that?
Lion
The Dev Patel movie?
Yes, it was wonderful.
I didn't see it.
You really missed out. The acting was amazing.
Is it a sad story?
It is very sad at parts, but also very beautiful.
Is Nicole Kidman in that movie too?
She is!
How is she in the movie?
Excellent. She was nominated for an award too.
Glad to hear it. I've always been a fan of hers.
Me too!
