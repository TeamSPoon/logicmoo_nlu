Hey, are you psyched about the football season coming up?
Yeah, not soon enough!
How do you think your team would do?
Well, I think they'll do good. You know, the titan's still a young team and there are lots of talents...
Yeah, the QB is good. What was his name?
Marcus Mariota.
Oh, yeah, didn't he get hurt?
Yup, he broke his leg, but he should be good now. He's a young one.
From Hawaii, right? Who'd have thought...
I know, right? He is good though.
Yeah, the Titans kind of surprised us all.
I think there's a good chance for us this season.
I hope the same for mine...I don't know though. We will need some new players.
What was your team again?
Cardinals. Our main players are kind of getting old.
Yeah, is Palmer still playing?
He is. He's okay but he always chokes though...
Haha...at least he doesn't cry like some of them.
Yeah, like Campbell...
No kidding!!
