Hey, can you believe the Rockies?
It's been crazy, the question is if they can keep it up
At some point the bullpen is going to cost them right?
Probably, I mean, the Dodgers are better on paper
At the very least CO will hit all year
It's hard for surprise teams to last, but maybe they can. They have youth
Yeah unlike the Twins they have a good mix of youth and vets
Anyway, do you think LA has the best shot in the NL?
They have the cash and assets to acquire more help, they have youth
But they can't hit lefties!
Yeah that is so funny and perhaps their downfall again. Though there's not a ton of lefties in the NL
But there are bullpen lefties and that matters in the playoffs
The key to beating LA is essentially keep it close for 5 innings and then turn over to your lefty bullpen
Okay, what is the saddest team in baseball?
Easy. San Francisco.
Yep. That is a team that has long needed to tear it down and rebuild
Does that mean trading Posey?
Well, that would truly be a tear down.
They have to do something, or pray they find some decent pieces in the offseason
I think their run is over and they need to start over
