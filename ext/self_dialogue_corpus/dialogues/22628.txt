How many remakes of Kong will be made?
I just think every producer keeps making it worse
I mean I can see it done once but this is too much
Universal wants to create a monsters universe
That is strange
Well Disney has the Marvel one
And DC has their universe
So everyone needs a universe now?
Thats the way the public wants to go
I guess the movies they see have to mesh with each other?
Yeah its a bit strange when you think about it.
I think that they need to figure out how to create new movies
Yeah we are all bored of incessant remakes
I agree with that, its very odd.
Do you think that any will make a new one?
Like create a new monster?
Yes.
No I think we will see remakes until one flops
Sort of like how The Mummy did?
in the US it was bad but internationally it made alot of money
