It's so nice to see Lady Gaga branch out in her music.
I agree. I think people underestimated her singing ability when she first became really popular.
Oh I think so too, but her album with Tony Bennett really shows of her vocal ability.
What was that called again?
Cheek to Cheek. It won a Grammy.
Wow, that's amazing.
She sounds great in her new song Million Reasons, as well.
I agree. I like her songs that have a slower tempo like Dope.
I love that song. I think I heard it was about her battle with addiction.
Wow, it must be such a meaningful song to her.
