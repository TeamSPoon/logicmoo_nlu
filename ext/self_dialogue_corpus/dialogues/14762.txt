What was the best Monty Python movie?
Probably Life of Brian.
I would disagree. That movie that was had some slow spots.
But it had such a classic scenes!
I think the Holy Grail would be my choice.
I totally forgot about that one
She turned me into a Newt!
A Newt?
I got better.
OK, you win. Holy Grail was the best.
