What is your favorite movie?
Pirates of the Caribbean.
Which one?
The Curse of the Black Pearl.
Is that the first one?
Yes it is.
Oh, I liked the second one,  Dead Man's Chest.
I like that one too, but I think the first one is best storyline overall.
Have you seen the newest one, Dead Men Tell No Tales?
No not yet, have you?
No I haven't seen it yet, but I have heard mixed reviews about it.
I have too, but I am sure it will be worth seeing.
I agree.  Johnny Depp is my favorite actor so of course I have to see it.
He's my favorite actor too. What's your favorite Johnny Depp movie?
I like Benny and Joon.  What's yours?
Edward Scissorhands.
I love Edward Scissorhands.  Winona Ryder is really good in it.
I agree.  I loved her in Beatlejuice.
Oh me too! That was a great movie too.
I just watched it the other day.
