How are those Panthers looking this year?
Oh, you know we're gonna Keep Pounding!
We'll see. Is Cam up to the challenge?
I think so. He was hurt last year a lot of the time.
That's true. But it did start off poorly too.
Yeah, but he got hurt, I think in the season opener in Denver.
He needs to spend less time on Nick and more time studying the game.
I agree. There's a reason Brady doesn't have a TV show.
Exactly. It takes hard work to be a champ!
I think Cam can take them all the way though. We saw what he's capable of two years ago.
That was a great season indeed.
Oh yeah, if they had won... easily top 3 team of all-time.
I agree. Sucks that they lost.
At least they didn't lose like the Falcons though.
Amen to that!
That L was so bad, it made me feel better about the Cam's previous loss.
Tell me about. Blowing a 25 point deficit.
Yeah. That's some special incompetence.
Either that or Brady is just a god.
Well, yeah... Brady's definitely the greatest of all-time.
