What is your favorite type of music?
I mostly listen to oldies.
Me, too.  Any particular years?
Mostly the 50's, 60's and 70's.
Yea, that was the real golden age of music.
Yea, it brings back a lot of good times and memories.
They don't make music like that anymore. Who were some of your favorite groups?
The Beatles and Stones, of course, but other groups like the Mamas and the Papas, Jimi Hendrix, all kinds of groups.
What a change, from the beginning of rock and roll, folk, to do-wop, to the Beatles, to soul to heavy rock.
Yea, I grew up listening to all those kinds of music.
Do you remember a lot of the one-hit wonders?
You bet, those were some of the best.  Red Rubber Ball, Little bit of soul, Wipe-Out, so many.
Yea, i remember all those, listening on my transistor radio, before MP3's CD's, even cassette tapes.
Yea, i remember when you could only hear music on a little AM transistor radio, even before FM began broadcasting music.
Yea, those were the days.  What are some of you favorite summertime songs from back then,
California Girls, fun,fun,Fun, A Summer Song, even songs like A Summer Place and Summertime, Summertime
Too bad, those days are forever gone.
Yea, but the good thing is you can find those songs on YouTube now.  and even on internet radio stations, so they will always be here.
Yea, it's like having a time machine, going back and listening to those songs.
They can take everything else away from us, but they will never take away those songs and those memories.
