What's your favorite movie?
My favorite is 'Ex Machina.'
I think I've heard of it, but never saw it.
It's phenomenal.  It's about a guy who falls in love with a robot while performing a Turing Test.
I don't know, that doesn't seem that interesting to me.
My explanation may not be the best, but you'd have to see it to understand the elements that make it good.
What elements in particular did you like about it?
Well for one, the fact that it's a very self-contained story.
Meaning?
Everything happens in a small, tight setting.  And it's done with only 3 actors.
Wow, really?  Doesn't it get boring?
Not at all.  The dialogue, core themes, and rising tension all make it an excellent movie.
Who are the actors?
Domnhall Gleason, Alicia Vikander, and Oscar Isaac.
Wow, that's an all-star cast.  They're in everything these days.
I know.  And they should be, because they're so incredibly talented.
Now I'm a bit more interested in watching this.
You really should.  It'll really make you think a lot.
Okay, I'm going to check it out.  Thank you for your suggestion.
Sure thing.  We'll have to talk about it once you've watched it.
