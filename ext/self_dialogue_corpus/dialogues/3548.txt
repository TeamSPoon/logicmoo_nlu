I've been really into horror movies lately.
Yes, the same thing is happening to me.
I just rewatched Halloween last night.
The original or the remake?
Obviously the original.  The remake is horrible!
Halloween is such a great movie, Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic in it!
Yes, it's my favorite of all the horror movie killer movies.
Michael Myers is the best one as well.
Freddy and Jason have nothing on him.
I definitely agree with this!
