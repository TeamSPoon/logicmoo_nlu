Here is a good CD.
Oh, Handel Concertos. Sounds cool.
It's amazing. Michala Petri and Keith Jarret achieved something spectacular with this.
It's cool to see an actual CD and a jewel case again. It's been a long time.
Yeah, I still think CDs beat streaming audio.
What's the album like?
It's incredible. The music comes alive with feeling and grace.
Is it energetic?
In places. They don't treat the score like a museum piece.
Good. It's sad when classical music is approached in a stuffy fashion.
These musicians followed up with a CD of Bach concertos which is similar, though Bach and Handel were worlds apart, expression wise.
Bach generally used repeating patterns, while Handel wanted to build up themes within pieces.
It's great to have booklets and liner notes instead of just an MP3 title floating in digital space.
We're missing out a lot by abandoning analog media like physical album covers and printed text.
Anyway, I prefer the Handel CD to the Bach one. It shines out a warm light, if you know what I mean.
How would you describe the Bach CD?
It's more of a rainy day walk through dark streets. Bach really dives into minor keys.
It sounds sad and slow.
Right. Handel seemed to put more tension into his music, which adds physical life and works well at many tempi.
I look forward to hearing this!
