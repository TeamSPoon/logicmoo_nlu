That was a great movie, wasn't it?
No, but it's decent popcorn fare.
What? You didn't like The Shallows?
I didn't say I didn't like it. It just wasn't a "great" film.
So it is  no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride.
The Shallows is too sappy to be lean and mean.
Really? It's like that.
The Shallows is almost a good movie.
I found it be very suspenseful...tense. Made me jump a few times.
It was kind of cool but honestly I found it boring.
It started out good, though,like a realistic movie.
But then unrealistic things happen. Like the shark jumping with fire, or the ending.
It was a decent movie.
Only if you didn't think too hard. Once you do start to think about it that's when you ask, "what am I  looking at?"
True it could have been more realistic.
It was very unrealistic from start to finish in my opinion. I wish I could get my money back.
As an unsatisfied customer?
Very unsatisfied.
I kept yelling through the movie, get out of the water.
That's is why I am glad I did not sit next to you.
