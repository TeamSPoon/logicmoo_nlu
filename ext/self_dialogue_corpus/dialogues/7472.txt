Do you know what the first Disney movie was?
Nope, sorry. Disney's been around for a long time, it could be any of a handful of the old ones.
Like which ones?
Well it'd have to be one of the movies that they made by drawing everything out.
So something like Cinderella then maybe?
Yea that's a good guess. I don't think that was the very first one though.
Which ones were you thinking of?
Maybe Dumbo, or Bambi. Those seemed to have the old school color look, where the colors aren't as vibrant.
Oh yea those are good choices. What year do you think those came out?
A long time ago, but not too long back that color didn't exist, so maybe the early 50's.
