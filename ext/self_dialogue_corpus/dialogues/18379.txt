I was thinking about that movie La Bamba the other day. I really like that early rock music.
What was the name of that guy who played in that movie?
The actor was Lou Diamond Phillips but the real musician was Ritchie Valens.
Didn't he die in a car accident?
No, it was actually a plane crash that killed him right at the height of his recording career.
Oh that's right! He died at the same time as Buddy Holly! Those guys were legends in Rock and Roll.
It's interesting that he took a traditional Mexican folk song and put it together with new rhythms to make La Bamba.
I wonder why he chose Mexican folk music to work with.
Well he was of Mexican heritage. His real name was Richard Valenzuela.
I didn't know that. Maybe I did and just forgot.
I bet you knew it if you saw the movie La Bamba. He had other hit songs too.
I can't think of any. Do you know the names of any of them?
Come On, Let's Go was one of them but I don't really like that one.
Wasn't there one about a girl too?
Yes, it was called Donna. In the movie that was his girlfriend's name but I don't know if that is fact or fiction.
I hope it's fiction because otherwise that would really be sad. That would mean she had to deal with his death as a young woman.
The whole world had to deal with his death! Did you know the day he died is known as The Day the Music Died?
What date is that?
It was February 3, 1959.
I think there was a song called American Pie that talked about The Day the Music Died. That is just so sad.
