have you watched the third pokemon movie
the one with entei?
yup, that was my favorite
i liked it a lot. i didnt purchase it though
i had that one on vhs
i feel like i like it more because i never purchased it
maybe so.
the unowns were so mysterious and cool
we still dont know much about them
they were just lettes that had psychic powers
and then there was entei running around with ash
the movies are always pretty good
its mysterious and intense at its best
i was disappointed suicune did not show up though
i always liked entei better though
because fire is more masculine?
yeah, i suppose so
i always liked the fire pokemon
every guy does to be honest
charzard too
