Have you ever heard a handbell choir?
No, what is that?
A group of musicians play a song using bells, or handbells.
How many bells does each person play.
It can range from one bell, especially for the large bells, up to eight bells.
Eight bells at the same time?
Usually only two at a time but some of the smaller bells can be rung four or six at a time in a technique called shelley or four in one/six in one.
That sounds difficult!
It can be but gets easier with practice.
What other techniques are used with handbells?
Sometimes the bells are plucked to make a short sound.
Like plucking a chicken?
No, you put the bell on the table and lift and drop the clapper.
What other techniques are used?
Mallets are used for tapping on the bells.
Won't that damage the bells?
Special mallets are used so they won't damage the bells unless you hit them too hard.
So it must be gentle!
Yes! Handbells cost a lot, so you want to be very careful with them!
Thanks for the information!
