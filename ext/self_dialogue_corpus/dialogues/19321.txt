Have you heard Brett Young's new song?
I'm not sure, what is it called?
It is called In Case You Didn't Know.
Yes I have and I really like that song.
I do too, I was thinking of playing it for my girlfriend.
I bet she would love that.
I hope so.
You know another good song is My Girl.
Who sings that song?
Dylan Scott sings it.
Do you think she would like that song?
I do, it is a sweet song.
Which song do you think I should play for her?
Why not play them both?
That is a great idea.
I would start with Dylan Scott's song first since it isn't as heartfelt.
Thanks for the advice.
Your welcome. Let me know what she thinks.
I will, thanks again.
Your welcome.
