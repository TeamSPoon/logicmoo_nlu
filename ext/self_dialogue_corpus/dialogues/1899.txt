Which teams made it to the playoffs last year?
Packers, Steelers, Falcons, and Patriots were in the final group
I wish the Packers could have gone all the way.
I love Aaron Rogers.
I hope this year is his year
Me too. I don't like the Falcons as much
Yeah Matt Ryan isn't as good a quarter back I don't think
I also don't like the Steelers or the Patriots
Yeah, neither of those teams excite me
I think the NFC South will have an interesting year
They were all pretty dismal last season.
For sure. The Saints were a dissapointment.
They beat the Panthers a few times
That's true. Cam Newton isn't quite there yet as a quarterback
He certainly can't compete with Drew Brees
He dresses way better though.
The man can certainly wear an outfit
I don't like Ron Rivera's transition lenses
I think they're kind of cool
I guess they're necessary for that outdoor stadium
