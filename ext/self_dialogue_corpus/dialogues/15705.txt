Do you know what instruments are in a marching band?
Some of them, why?
I was just wondering if you'd like to learn about the different instrument families?
Actually I would. Can you teach me?
You bet! There are technically three groups of instruments in a marching band.
What are they called?
The first is called the woodwind section.
Is that like trumpets and flutes?
Well, the flute is a member of the woodwind family but the trumpet isn't.
Why not? They are both made out of silver and you blow air in them to make a sound.
That is partly true, but trumpets use a mouthpiece which requires you to buzz your lips together to get the sound.
So what else is in the woodwind family?
Clarinets, saxophones, and piccolos belong in the woodwind family. They all use air but you don't buzz your lips to get the sound.
Okay, so what is the name of the family that trumpets belong to?
That is the brass family. It consists of trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, horns, and tubas.
Is there anything else in that family?
Not in a marching band unless they have the type of tuba that wraps around your body. That is called a Sousaphone.
It's named after John Phillip Sousa the composer right?
Yes it is. Do you know what the final group is called?
It is called percussion because you hit the instrument with a stick or mallet. That's my favorite group!
