So, what type of movies are you into?
Oh, all sorts, but I really love kind of bad, crazy b-movies.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, the kid that are so bad they're hilarious.  Especially when the people making them don't seem to realize how crappy they are.
How could you not know you're movie's crappy?
Well, variety of reasons, but often it's not that the actors don't know, it's usually the higher ups.  Like in Troll 2.
Troll 2?  Don't think I've heard of that.. or Troll 1 for that matter.
Ah, that's beauty of it, you don't have to know anything about the first Troll movie to "get" this one.
Oh wow.
Yeah, if you put in "Troll 2" on youtube you'll see a ton of hilarious clips and reviews about it.
I may have to try that.
Oh, yeah, if you like unintentionally campy stuff it's the best.
So, what's the movie about?
Well, the "plot" is this family, mom, dad, two kids, including a boy sees his dead grandfather's ghost, trade houses for a week with this family out in this weird town.
Wait.. the kid sees his dead grandfather's ghost?
Oh, yeah! And that' snot even the craziest thing about the movie!
Okay...
So, they go into this town called Nilbog (two points if you get what that stands for) and it turns out the townsfolk are goblins that want to kill and eat them.
Er.. what?
Yeah, I know!  You'll be saying that a LOT during the movie..
