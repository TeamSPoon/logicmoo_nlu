You know I saw the Rolling Stones once.
Yeah?
Yeah, and Mick Jagger can't sing the way he sounds on the albums.
I never thought Mick Jagger had a great voice even on those studio recordings.
Well trust me, he sounds a hundred times worse live.
I haven't had the pleasure of going to a concert.
You didn't miss much. I left part way through I was so disappointed.
Well that sucks.
Yeah it does, they were my favourite band for a long time.
You can still enjoy their albums though right?
Yeah I don't mind them, even though they're not my favourite anymore. "Paint It Black" used to be my favourite song.
I think that's one of their better ones.
On their album it is. You wouldn't be able to make out any of the words live.
I'm not a big concert goer anyway, and I don't like them THAT much. I just have a few songs of theirs I really like.
Oh what ones?
Sound wise, "Brown Sugar", lyric wise, "Sympathy For The Devil".
Your mom always liked Brown Sugar.
Yeah I know, I remember her putting it on a mix cd and listening to it all the time. I never knew what the words were until just, like, last year.
There are slightly different versions of it so I hear.
Oh yeah!
