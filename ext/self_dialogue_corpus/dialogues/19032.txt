Do you like Beyonce'?
Not really. I enjoyed her music more when she was with Destiny's Child. But I don't like her solo stuff.
I feel the opposite, actually. I enjoy her more now as a solo artist.
Besides Beyonce', who else do you like to listen to?
I'm also a Madonna fan.
Her earlier stuff or her latest?
I like it all. I have most of her albums, with a few exceptions.
Which albums do you have?
Her earlier stuff like Erotica, Ray of Light, Like a Virgin, and later albums like MDNA. Do you have her albums?
I don't have any of her albums, but I enjoy her music.
What songs of hers do you like?
I like "Frozen", "Ray of Light", "Like a Prayer", "Vogue". You?
My favorite songs are, "Ray of Light", "True Blue" and "Who's that girl"?
Oh yes, I love "Who's that girl" too. She incorporates Spanish into it, right?
She does. Do you like the song she did with Ricky Martin?
I'm not familiar with that. What's it called?
"Be careful" (Cuidado Con My Corizon) which translates to Be careful with my heart.
I haven't heard that. I will have to check it out.
Please do. If you like, "Who's that girl" you should enjoy it. And Ricky Martin is very talented, too.
He is. I bet their voices sound amazing together.
