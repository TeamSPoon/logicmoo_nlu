Hey, I am in the mood to make a new CD today. Do you want to help?
Sure, I'd love to!
Great! You can help me find some different songs to listen to.
What kind of music are you in to?
Country is my favorite. I love new and old country, it doesn't really matter.
How about some Reba McEntire or Dolly Parton?
Sure I like them a lot. What are some of their most popular songs?
Jolene, 9 to 5, and I Will Always Love You for Dolly and The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, Fancy, and The Greatest Man I Never Knew for Reba.
Oh those are great songs. I had forgotten all about them.
Yeah, I love the older country songs a lot!
