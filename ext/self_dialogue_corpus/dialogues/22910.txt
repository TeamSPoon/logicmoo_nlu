Did you ever see the Brave Little Toaster movies?
No, what on earth is that? It sounds weird.
Yeah they are weird, but they're really cute movies!
Are they new?
Oh no, they're older.  The first one came out in 1987.
What on earth are they about?
Well, they're Disney movies.  They're about a bunch of appliances looking for their master.
What on earth, that sounds bizarre.
It's really funny, and since it's in the eighties everything is so outdated.
What do you mean?
All the appliances are totally outdated and not modern.  It's interesting to see.
What do you mean by they're searching for their master?
They get separated from their owner, who they refer to as their master.  So they set out to find him.
I guess the toaster is one of these appliances?
Yes, and there's also a lamp, and a radio, and an electric blanket.  And a vacuum cleaner.
It definitely sounds unique.  I'm surprised I never heard of it.
Yeah, so am I.  There's a sequel too.
what's it called?
The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, I believe.
That sounds even weirder.
