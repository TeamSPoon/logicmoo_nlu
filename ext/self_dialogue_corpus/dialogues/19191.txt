do you like the new mgk album
bloom, right?
yeah, it might be his best yet
he's trying to do all the pop rock/rap thing
wel, only in a couple songs
he's singing a lot now
i wonder if he's influenced by yelawolf
yelawolf did that country rap album
love story?
yeah, that album was really good
i liked it from top to bottom
it really worked well with his style
they're both finding their style in rap
yeah maybe its the year of the fusion
fusion rap
well, then again theres always been fusion
yeah, thats how they start a new genre of rap
horrorcore, funk rap...etc
there is no genre of funk rap though
yeah, its just rap
