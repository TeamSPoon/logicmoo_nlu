What was the Disney movie with the singing crab?
The Little Mermaid!
That's right! That was the one where the mermaid girl wanted to find love so she went on land to meet the prince, right?
Yes! Ariel sold her voice to the evil sea witch Ursula so that she could go on land.
Did she get her voice back?
Yes! Did you see the movie?
No, I just saw a commercial for it on a kid's television station. I don't know very much about it.
It's a good movie! Eventually Ariel and Prince Eric fall in love and get married.
Does it have any songs that I would recognize?
Kiss the Girl is from the Little Mermaid and that is very popular!
