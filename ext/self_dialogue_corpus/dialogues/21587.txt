What would you say is the most overrated movie of all time?
Off the top of my head, maybe Titanic.
Why do you say that?
I think it won the most Oscars of any movie ever, and made a boatload of money. And it just wasnt that great of a movie.
I don't know that people act like it's the best movie ever, though.
Then why did it win the greatest number of Academy Awards?
I think because it was a technical challenge to make the movie. Technically, it's a great movie.
All that technology doesn't make it a great movie.
It doesn't make the plot good, or the acting performances good. Although I think Kate Winslet was good.
She was good, and Leonardo DiCaprio was OK, but the plot was really cliched.
Sometimes, people like movie plots that are cliched. Take Star Wars.
Yeah, I see what you mean. Sometimes a simple story is best.
I think that's especially true of visually stunning, extravagant movies.
Now that I think about it, Avatar was kind of the same way.
That seems to be James Cameron's style.
He directed Titanic and Avatar?
Yes, I'm pretty sure he did. Avatar made even more money than Titanic.
And had an evil worse plot! But it was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
So back to Titanic, I think it was a movie that was really good for what it was.
I see where you're coming from.
