I cannot wait for football season to start.
Seriously? It's the middle of summer.
I know, but I think the Steelers are really going to do well this year.
I hope they do, but you still have a problem
I know, the Patriots.
They really have the Steelers number.
They have everybody's number. Could you imagine the Steelers' Super Bowl trophy case if not for Tom Brady?
How many Conference championship games have they played?
Four, and that is the problem, they are in the same conference. So unless they can beat the Patriots they don't even get to go to the Super Bowl.
Did they win any of the four?
No, the Patriots won them all and then went on to win the Super Bowl, I think, every time.
Can anybody beat them?
I think so. Even though they lost, Atlanta showed that on any given Sunday, the Patriots can be beaten.
Are you sure about that?  I mean, the Patriots won the game.
I know, but they needed a lot of luck.
Isn't that what they have the most of? I mean, isn't it just luck that they win?
I'd like to think so, but I don't think that is really the case. There is another factor.
Tom Brady?
Yeah, Tom Brady. I think he is going to play until he's fifty.
That would be bad news for everyone else.
