Have you seen the new Transformers movie?
I have, I watched it this weekend.
What did you think?
Well, I will say that it was easier to understand what was happening this time.
That's it?
Pretty much. It wasn't very good. It's really just marketted towards little kids now.
I guess that's why they put that nickelodeon girl in it.
Exactly. She served no purpose. The plot was dumb, Optimus Prime turned into a bad guy in less than 30 seconds.
Well, they only have so much time to create plot during the movie.
Not this movie, it was like 3 and a half hours long and it was torture.
Oh wow, that sounds horrible!
It kind of was. I fell asleep twice, and still didn't miss anything.
It was that boring huh?
Yea, I mean they tired. Lots of big robots, lots of explosions. But nothing new.
Well, I hear they are already doing another one.
I wouldn't doubt that for a second.
Maybe the next one will be better.
Hopefully I never find out. I'm waiting for Pacific Rim 2 to come out.
Yea that was a much better movie than Transformers.
It is, but they are taking way too long to make another one.
