Do you think the Snow Man will be a good thriller?
I think it will just be a rip off of the old Jack Frost movie.
The one that was kind of a thriller, but also sort of a kid's show?
Yes, I think it will be silly.
Do you know any ones coming out you might like?
I seen one called the Mummy, it is already out.
I really want to see that one.
The reviews said the Mummy was actually really scary.
I love the suspense part of thrillers, like maybe the bad mummy or bad guy might win.
I think the suspense is the best part of any thriller.
