Did you see the new Guardians
oh yea, awesome.
What was your favorite part?
Probably the intro.  Baby Groot dancing was amazing.
I liked the scene where Yondo uses his arrow.
You mean when the lights go out and the music starts?
Uh huh.  It was kickass to see him do so much destruction.
Yondo is my favorite character. Sad to see him die.
I liked the new girl, the one with the horns.
Ha, the dialogue between her and Drax was epic.
How about when baby groot kept bringing them the wrong stuff?
Very funny.
What did you think about the golden race.
Meh. It was okay. Maybe next movie they'll do better.
I was surprised to see Sylvester Stallone.
I guess there's a whole scavenger backstory.
Could be another movie.
Hopefully we see it.
Did you know that the mining planet is the head of a Celestial.
Like Kurt Russel?
