So I know you love oldies.  Who is your favorite oldies band?
Oh definitely the Temptations!  Their music is amazing.
I love their music too!  I think they are on my list of favorites too.
They were originally called the Elgins when they started up in 1960
Wow, I had no idea!  That's random.
Yeah, and did you know that even just a few years ago they were still performing?
All five of them together?
No, only one of them is still in the current Temptations but still.
I bet they don't sound the same.
Yeah they're definitely not as good as the original.
So what are your favorite Temptations songs?
I love My Girl and Just My Imagination.
I love those too!  And Ain't Too Proud to Beg is amazing also.
Yeah, they were also incredible dancers.
I know!  That made their music even stronger.
Course so many of the Motown bands were fantastic.
Yeah, but I think the Temptations were some of the best that Motown brought to the table.
No doubt!  I'd love to see the new ones perform live, even though it's not the original band.
Yeah, you could probably catch them.  It was just 2015 that they were around I heard.
I wonder if they're still touring.
