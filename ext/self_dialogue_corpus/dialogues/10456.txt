Hey there, how have you been?
Good man, good to see you.
Same! I've been meaning to tell you about this band that I think you'll love.
Ooooh, I always love getting recommendations from you. Hit me.
The band is called Elder.
Never heard of them; what are they like?
They're basically like doom metal, which I know you love, but they're a little bit proggy too.
I kind of hate prog rock though.
I promise, you'll like these guys. The prog elements are pretty subtle and they just give you a nice break from all of the riffs.
OK, fair enough, I'll check them out.
What else have you been listening to?
Lots of Fleet Foxes, believe it or not.
Oh yeah? You were into them a while ago, I remember.
Yeah, I kind of burned out on them and that sort of folk-y stuff, but I think it's been enough time that I'm ready to get back into it.
You know they have a new one coming out soon, right?
Yeah, that's kind of what got me back into them. I'm pretty pumped about that new one.
Which album of theirs should I start with if I was going to check them out?
I'd start with the first one, the self titled one. It's solid.
Cool, I'll check it out.
You should - I think you'll like them.
