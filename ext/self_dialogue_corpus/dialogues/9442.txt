Hey, did you get a chance to listen to my last mixtape?
Yeah I did.
What did you think?
Honestly, it just wasn't my taste.
Okay I can respect that.
It's not a criticism of you, even within my favourite artists there will be songs or entire albums that I'l listen to and feel like if I never hear it again I'll be okay, and those are my favourite artists.
Like who?
Like Public Enemy. Their first studio album I thought didn't last long enough, but their next album was a struggle to get through and a relief when I finally finished it.
Well no offense taken, I'm just happy you gave it a fair shake.
Yeah of course.
