Are you ready for the coming NFL season this year?
Yeah I wish I could just freeze myself and wake up when it's the fall and football time.
What teams are you following the closest?
I'm a Raiders fan. I also like the Cowboys a lot.
The Raiders huh? Are you from Oakland or you just like the team?
No, I'm not from Oakland, I've never lived there. I've just always liked The Raiders since I was a kid.
Do you care that they're moving to Las Vegas in a few years
It's going to be weird not seeing them in Oakland but I'm more of a fan of the team than the city where they play.
So apparently Derek Carr signed a massive contract, do you think he'll live up to such lofty expectations?
I hope so, he's the future of the franchise. I would hate for all that money to be wasted.
Are you a part of Raider Nation, do you put on th makeup and costumes for games?
No, I just watch on television at home. I've only been to a couple of Raiders games in my life.
What other players do you like for Oakland?
I like Amari Cooper a lot. I've been following him ever since he was at Alabama and I expect good things in the future from him.
So if the Raiders are playing the Cowboys, who do you root for?
Definitely the Raiders. I like the Cowboys but not as much as I like Oakland.
You think they're going to make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I always think they were will before the season starts. Everyone's optimistic until the games start.
How many games do you realistically think Oakland will win this year?
I would say 10 to 11 games if my prediction for this year.
