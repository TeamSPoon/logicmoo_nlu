Have you ever heard of the band Third Eye Blind?
Yea, I've been to three of their concerts.
Really? That's awesome. Did you know they came out with a new Album?
Yea I heard, but I haven't had a chance to listen to it.
You should, it's pretty cool.
Honestly, I kind of stopped listening to them when they got political.
When did that happen?
Around the time Bush was in office.
So, whats wrong with a band that stands for something.
Nothing, that's just not what I was used to. I liked their songs about love, and life.
Yea I get that, motorcycle driveby is one of my all time favorite songs.
Mine too, it really helped me get over a bad break up.
Yea it did the same for me. But you should still check out the new album.
Well I researched it online and it looks to be mostly political.
You should make your own judgement though.
The thing is, I don't want to taint my memory of them. Right now I still love them.
Oh I get it, you think if you listen to the new stuff, you won't like them anymore.
Exactly, it's why I just stick to listening to Semi Charmed Life and Blinded. I love those songs.
Me too, I could listen to them all day.
I normally do.
