Were you ever a fan of horror films?
Some yes.  I like The Evil Dead series.
I do too!  The Army of Darkness film was my favorite.
That was probably my favorite as well.  I would love to see a modern day sequel where Ash goes back to the world he was in.
Do you think Army of Darkness is considered a horror film?  I kind of look at it as just an action film.
I do believe it is a horror film.
I just don't think it has the same type of suspense that horror films typically have.  Such as a Friday the 13th movie or The Blair Witch Project.
I think it possesses the familiar subject matter of horror films.  I believe it has some level of suspense coupled with strange, supernatural monsters.
Would you say that Army of Darkness is the in the same category as The Shining for example?
Yes, I would admit that The Shining is a different type of horror film than Army of Darkness.  The comedy in the Army of Darkness may be what sets it apart.
