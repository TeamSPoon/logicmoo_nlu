I feel like there haven't been a lot of good comedies in the theatres lately.
I know what you mean. A lot of the funny actors I used to like don't make movies that much anymore.
What would be some examples of the kinds of funny actors you used to like?
I'm talking about people like Will Ferrel, Adam Sandler and of course Chris Farley, who passed away.
I agree. Those are all good examples.
Will Ferrel made some great ones back in the day.
He did Talladega Nights, Old School, and Anchorman.
Also, he did Elf, Step-brothers and he was in Zoolander.
He was also in a movie called Stranger Than Fiction.
That was another good one.
It was much more cerebral than his other movies.
Yes. Yet somehow it was still really funny.
Remember there was a female rapper in it?
Yes. That was Queen Latifah.
I remember the woman who did the narrative voice. She had some sort of accent.
Yes, and she did some weird thing where she would put out cigarettes in a tissue.
Who was that woman that played Will Ferrel's love interest?
That was Maggie Gyllenhaal.
Remember when Will Ferrel's character played her some song?
Yes. That was a song by Wreckless Eric called Whole Wide World.
