Have you been watching the Playoffs this year?
Yeah, it's kind of boring though.
I thought it was just me!
It will end up being Cleveland v Golden State again I think.
Me too. Do you think they'll both sweep?
It's probable. Which is crazy, and unexciting to watch.
Rounds 1 and 2 had some great games, though.
Yeah, the Spurs/Memphis series was really great.
I just can't remember the last time it was this anticlimactic.
Last year was at least exciting because it was Curry v Lebron for the first time.
Yeah, this just feels like a repeat of last year.
I think Golden State might win it though.
Maybe. LeBron is still playing like he's in his 20s though.
Yeah, he's really on a mission to win it again this year.
Will you watch the NBA Awards?
Just to see who wins MVP, I think.
I don't like that they're waiting to announce the winner.
Me neither, it's better when it's just their team there.
You think Westbrook will win?
Yeah, and he deserves to win too.
