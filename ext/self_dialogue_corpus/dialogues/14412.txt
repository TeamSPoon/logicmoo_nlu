Wow dude did you see that Warriors Knicks game last night?
Lol I bet the Warriors won by 60.
Actually the Knicks were up for most of the game
On the Warriors?  Did their starters take the night off?
When I first looked at the score, I was thinking atleast 2 or 3 had to be resting but nah, only one was out with a strained hamstring.
The Knicks actually played defense?
I mean it seemed better than their norm, but they just can't stop any ball penetration. It was mainly just the Warriors building a house with all those bricks.
Hahaha
That one 7 footer for the Warriors missed 3 layups, was going full Moses Malone with the rebounds but missed 3 wide open chippies.
Hes 7 foot tall just dunk it with two hands...
To make it worse the Knicks got the rebound threw it up the floor and got a 4 point play from a 3 in the corner.
4 point play?
Yeah dude where you get fouled on a 3 and make it.
Oh, right...remember I'm still getting used to the 3 even being a thing as old as I am.
You're so dumb..anyways..so the Warriors ended up coming back from a 16 point deficit in the 4th...the Knicks looked tired
Yeah they have no bench, kind of their problem really.
It was hard to watch kind of...was man against boys out there with the Warriors just making every shot they looked at.
I know that feeling...they do that to my Bulls all the time.
So the moral of the story...you can play above your talent level for a while...but the Knicks will always be the Knicks.
I feel sad for New York.
