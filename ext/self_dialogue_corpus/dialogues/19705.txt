What is your opinion of Nickleback?
I think they have gotten a bad rap and are a really talented group.
I tend to agree, I have listened to them since I was young.
I don't really understand why people act like they are so bad.
They have basically become a meme.
They may have a bit of pop sound and sing about some silly stuff sometimes but they are certainly very talented.
I agree, I actually still enjoy listening to their music sometimes.
The singer Chad Kroger basically sacrificed his vocal cords to entertain people.
I know, I think he had a cyst on his vocal cords surgically removed.
How does that even happen?
I don't know, I remember about a decade ago a doctor said that his vocal cords would not last another seven years if he kept singing the way he does.
Well it seems he is still singing, they just put out a new song.
Yeah, I gave it a listen but I wasn't a big fan of it.
Me too, it seems like they have just run out of ideas and that special something that their music had ten years ago seems to be gone.
Its a sad thing to see something so great kind of fade away into obscurity to the point they are just a joke now on the internet.
Ten years ago they were on top of the billboard charts.
I think they should focus on leaving on a high note and if they still need to make an income there are probably dozens of ways for them to do that considering their level of fame.
I don't know, I think they should keep doing what they love.
I don't disagree, I just feel like they are going downhill.
Who knows, maybe their new album will have some decent songs.
