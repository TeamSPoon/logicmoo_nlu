Have you Rough Night yet?
No, but I can't wait to see it. It looks hilarious!
Me too. I haven't seen it yet, either. I saw one of the actors on Jimmy Kimmel the other night.
Which one? You mean one of the stars of the movie?
Yeah. The guy. What's his name... Paul W. Downs.
Didn't he write it also?
He co-wrote the screenplay. And he also plays Scarlett Johansson's husband.
Wow. I really want to see it badly. I love Scarlett Johansson.
I do, too. I've been a big fan since The Other Boleyn Girl.
She was amazing in that. I also loved her in Lost in Translation.
That's one of my all-time favorite movies.
Have you seen anything good lately?
I just saw Wonder Woman. It was fantastic.
I just saw The Mummy.
Oh, really? How was it?
Good. Really good. I mean, really good in some ways. It's different from the usual basic action movie.
It's got a historical fantasy storyline, obviously.
Yeah, of course. The ancient Egypt thing. I don't want to spoil it for you, though.
I'd like to see that. Would you want to see it again?
Yeah, but not for theater ticket prices. I'll probably watch it again in six months when it hits Netflix or some other streaming platform.
