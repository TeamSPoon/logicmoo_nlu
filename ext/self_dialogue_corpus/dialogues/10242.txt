I thought that The Last Boy Scout was an underrated action flick.
I did too.
Bruce Willis used to be a good actor.
He and Damon Wayans played well off of each other in that movie.
Willis played a private eye down on his luck and Wayans was the Pro Football player.
Yeah, I could go back and watch that one again.
Do you remember who directed that movie?
That was a Tony Scott film.
I didn't realize that he directed that one.
Yeah, he did. He is one of my favorite directors.
