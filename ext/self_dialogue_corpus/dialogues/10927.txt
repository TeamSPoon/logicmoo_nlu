Did you see game seven of the Penguins versus the Capitals?
No, I missed the game! What happened?
The Penguins won and eliminated the Capitals.
I bet Ovechkin is so mad that they lost in the second round again.
The Penguins have such a good record against the Capitals in the playoffs.
Pittsburgh fans are so lucky to have Crosby.
Yeah, I think Crosby is a better player than Ovechkin.
That is up for debate, but I agree with you.
So are you going to watch the next round?
Who are the Penguins playing next?
They are playing the Ottawa Senators.
That will be a good series.
The Senators are a very defensive team while the Penguins are very offensive.
Who do you think will win the series?
I think the Penguins will win and then win the Stanley Cup too!
If they make it to the finals will you go see them play?
Tickets will be expensive, but I think it will be worth going to at least one game.
I would only go if someone bought me a ticket.
Watching hockey live is worth the ticket price though!
Yeah, hockey is pretty awesome.
