It's almost football time, man.
Yes, sir. Pats are gonna take it all the way for Brady's sixth ring, I think.
I think that too. I wonder who can even beat them?
Maybe the Packers, but Rodgers has to start playing for real in the playoffs.
Yeah, until this year, he was one-and-done since 2011.
I didn't know that, but it doesn't surprise me. They always fall in the playoffs early.
I think he needs a better defense. His offense is obviously pretty decent.
Pretty decent!? I think you mean aboslutely monster!
No Lacy this year though.
True. But they got Bennett.
He may add another dimension to their blocking game.
They probably need him with getting their new back up to speed.
It's still an offense that revolves around Rodgers though.
Oh, yeah, for sure. His arm is probably the best in the NFL.
Remember those Hail Marys!?
Yeah. I felt so bad for the Lions!
I felt so bad for the Packers when they had a successful Hail Mary against the Cardinals, but then lost still.
That was a downer. But that pitch to Fitzgerald was amazing.
Yeah, it was. Well, I'll see you on the first kick off next month.
Sounds good. Football is almost back!
