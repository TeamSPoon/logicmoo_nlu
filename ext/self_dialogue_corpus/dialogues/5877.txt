Did you see Sky High?
Yeah that was almost foreshadowing by Disney
What do you mean?
Well they are behind the Marvel franchises right now
Oh so you think the movie was about high school kids learning how to be super heroes?
Yeah it almost like it imitated life.
I think thats a great connection.
I thought the movie was a little light
I liked Kurt Russell in it
Yeah he always does a good job for the studio.
