Hey, what's your favorite movie?
Oh man, that's a tough question. Let me think for a minute.
For me it depends on the mood and genre.
I usually watch documentaries, so I don't see as many of the best picture type dramas that most people love.
I think for me, I'd go with The Godfather. Just in terms of story and acting, it never gets old.
Yeah, that's a good one. I think I've seen it 10 times. It's 3 hours but you still don't want it to end.
I love the second movie too, but the first one holds up better on its own.
The third one was crap though. There really wasn't a reason to make that one.
I wasn't a fan. The plot was confusing and stupid, and the acting was worse.
I think Big Lebowski was a great movie. That might be my favorite.
I loved that movie. It's so quotable.
They manage to make it depressing and funny at the same time. And the jokes seem fresh every time you watch them.
I just saw Forest Gump on TV recently and remembered how much I loved it as a kid.
I did too, but I totally didn't get the historical references.
Yeah, there were definitely parts of that movie not meant for 12 year old kids. It made me appreciate it more when I got older and rewatched it.
It was crazy how young Tom Hanks looked.
Haha, yeah. Not that he's aged badly or anything, but 20 years is a long time.
Have you seen him in Bachelor Party? It was from the late 80s and is about as raunchy and hilarious as you can get.
I love that movie!
Haha, that one is not meant for 12 year olds either.
