Well you know what I always say, "Hakuna Matata".
Are you seriously quoting me The Lion King mottos right now?
Well I'd say Timon and Pumba knew how to live life.
Except for the fact that it meant Simba was just going to leave behind everyone he loved.
Let's give Simba a break here okay. His evil Uncle Scar tricked him into thinking he killed Mufasa!
Yeah Scar was a pretty bad dude.
Simba did eventually come back to take down Scar and become the rightful leader of Pride Rock.
All's well that ends well.
Hey did you know that The Lion King was based on Shakespeare's Hamlet?
I didn't know that! It makes sense though!
