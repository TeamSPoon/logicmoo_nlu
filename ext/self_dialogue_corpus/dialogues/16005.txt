Do you want to come over?
Sure, what are we gonna do?
How about we listen to some music?
Sounds fun, I can bring some of my CDs.
Do you have any country ones?
I sure do, who do you like?
I have always loved Keith Whitley.
Really? I thought I was the only one who loved old country.
It is my favirote kind of music.
Great, I have plenty of his songs and many others.
Do you have Stranger In The Rain?
Yes! I love that song.
What about Dont Close Your Eyes?
I have that one as well. Great song!
I agree, do you have any George Jones songs?
I have a lot of his as well actually.
Great, there is nothing like country classics.
You got that right!
Jones and Whitley are both legends.
Yes they are and they will never be forgotten.
