What happened in Force awakens?
Didn't you watch the movie?
Yeah I did, but I fell asleep in the middle of it.
What! It was so good.
Yeah, I had a really rough night before.
Well, it's kind of fuzzy, but basically Rey ge's captured by Kylo ren, and escapes, then she learns she is a jedi, and wins the fight against Kylo ren.
That's pretty awesome. Were the fights cool?
Actually there weren't too many fights, but there a lot more in Rogue one.
I'll have to watch that movie.
Yeah, let's watch it together. I'll watch it again.
