Do you like Devo?
You mean the 'Whip It' guys?
Yeah, they did that one, but they're so much more than that.
Yeah I always thought of them as a one hit wonder from the 80s.
Well they've been around since the 70s.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, they were a pretty important part of the punk movement.
No shit, I never would've guessed.
Oh yeah. Bowie was a big fan of their's, and he helped connect them with Brian Eno.
Now I know him, ambient music guy, works with David Byrne sometimes.
Yeah Eno produced some of Talking Heads earliest and best albums, but he also  produced Devo's first album.
What does that name mean anyways, Devo?
Devo is short for de-evolution. The band has this theory that humanity  reach their high point  some time ago, and is now devolving as a result of corporate domination of the culture and a push towards homogenization of the people.
That's pretty heavy for a band I always thought of as a novelty act.
Well that's why they always dressed alike and acted alike, they saw themselves as a satirical reflection of the times, and used pop music to convey their message.
Well I may have to listen to them more sometime.
They definitely had a hard time with their label when they got signed to the big time. A lot of their songs featured subtle digs at their corporate handlers.
Like which ones?
Well you ever hear that some of theirs 'Girl U Want'? It's all about selling pop bands to kids.
I have heard that one before, I think it was on the Tank Girl soundtrack back in the day.
