Did you know that Madonna is called the Queen of Pop?
Well, she deserves it.
I liked her, right from when she started.
Me too.
Like A Prayer was one of my favorites.
Me too.
I also loved Papa don't Preach.
I forgot about that one. Thats great.
She puts on a great show too.
I'd like to see her in concert.
