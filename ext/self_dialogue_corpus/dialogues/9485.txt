Do you like the rapper Future?
Future is awesome.
His voice is so deep it almost sounds unreal.
I know. It's hard to understand him sometimes.
He makes some meaningful music, though. He holds nothing back.
Yeah, he's definitely an open-book type of artist.
He releases albums really fast, too.
He released two on the same day just recently.
I saw that. The crazy thing is they were both really good.
I've yet to hear anything I would consider bad from the guy.
