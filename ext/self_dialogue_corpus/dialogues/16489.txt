So how are you doing since The Gaslight Anthem has been on hiatus?
Man, not good, I can't find anything to replace them.
Yeah their sound was one of a kind, even though it was drawn from so many other bands.
That Springsteen Jersey sound jived so well with their punk roots, there's a void there for sure.
Definitely, when the Summer approaches and there is no Gaslight show to go to I get real sad.
Yeah some of my best memories with friends was seeing Gaslight Anthem perform in the summer.
Thankfully Brian Fallon's solo stuff is pretty good.
Yeah I like it a lot, just isn't the same you know?
I know what you mean.
Rosemary was my favorite off of Painkillers because it was dripping with Gaslight vibes.
There's still that Brian Fallon flare though, both his solo work and Gaslight are so obviously him so it's fine.
True, it's just you want to hear Brian's words over Rosamilia's guitar work you know?
Definitely know what you mean, it's like peanut butter and jelly.
Peanut butter and jelly with some heartbreak.
Did you see he's getting Ted Hutt to produce his second solo album?
Whoa I did not see that, that's awesome news.
Yeah, Butch Walker did a great job with Painkillers but Ted Hutt did great work on Gaslight and the Crowes.
For sure, who knows maybe it's a secret Gaslight record he's been writing.
That would be such a great surprise.
Christmas would come early if that were the case.
