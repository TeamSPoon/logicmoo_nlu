I did not know that I would like the music.  A friend told me about the group.
Do you have the Awesome Wave CD?
Yes I do.  Do you want to borrow it?  Here it is.
Okay, I will listen to it now.
So, what do you think?
They are amazing.
Yes, I am surprised that they are not well known in the US.
I agree.  They are so good.
I will bet that they will be famous in the US soon enough.
We are always ahead of our friends in terms of listening to new music.
I know.
Thank you for introducing me to Alt-J.
You are welcome.  I knew that you would like it.
Yes, we have similar taste in music.
If they have a concert in our city, would you like to go with me?
I would love to.
You know who else would like this type of music?
No.  Tell me who they are.
Anthony and Lucy.
I do not know them very well.  Anyway, I've got to go.  Thanks again.
