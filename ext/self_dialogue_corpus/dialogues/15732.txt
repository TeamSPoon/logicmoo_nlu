What do you think of Mumford & Sons?
I don't think I know who they are. Are they a musical group?
Yeah, they are an Indie band originally from the UK.
It sounds like something I might be interested in. What songs do they sing?
They have so many great ones. Their most recent album is really good though.
What's the name of the most recent album?
It's called Wilder Mind.
I'll have to look it up. Are there any specific songs you would recommend?
Honestly, everything they have is really easy to listen to. Try out their song "Monster".
I'll definitely give it a shot. I don't usually listen to Indie style music.
I used to stray away from indie music because I didn't really understand the genre.
Yeah, that's kind of what I think. I'm not sure what to expect when people talk about Indie music.
Well this group in particular is really easy to listen to. Their lyrics are catchy and they are really popular.
I'm going to have to look up some songs to download from them. I don't think I've ever downloaded any kind of Indie music before.
If you like this group you might also like The Lumineers.
Are they also an Indie band from the UK?
They are an Indie/folk group but they are actually from the USA.
Oh cool! I'm about to look them up on Pandora.
Search for Ophelia, it's my favorite.
Will do, thanks for the recommendations.
