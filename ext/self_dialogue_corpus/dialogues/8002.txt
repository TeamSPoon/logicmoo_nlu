who is your favorite Hip-hop artist?
I really like Eminem he has a good flow and often an authentic message.
Have you heard I miss you? It is a great song.
I have not heard it yet but I like most of his other stuff.
You know more recently he has been featured with other artists on other tracks instead of doing his own songs as much.
yeah, like Kill For You by skylar grey.
Good song, as he is just as good in that role.
I especially when Eminem and Dr. Dre collaborate.
I need a doctor is one of my favorite songs down by Dr. Dre
Agreed, I really hope to see more songs like that in the future.
