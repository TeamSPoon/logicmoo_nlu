What kind of music do you listen to?
Mostly rock music. You?
I like all kinds. Mostly rock, but also some rap, and I like video game soundtracks.
What's your favorite game music?
Final Fantasy, no question about it.
I've never played those games.
The composer, Nobuo Uematsu, is fantastic, though he has stopped working on every game since he went freelance.
How many games did he compose for?
The first ten, and he returned for FFXIV. What kind of rock music do you like?
My favorite bands are AC/DC, Metallica, and The Offspring.
I really like the Offspring. What's your favorite song?
Can't Repeat.
I like Come Out and Play.
That's a good one too. That whole album is really good.
Self Esteem is another great track from there.
I'm afraid I haven't kept up with their recent albums, though.
They still have it. There passion hasn't softened over time, unlike Metallica.
Yes, Metallica's old stuff is clearly better. I guess they just can't muster up that same anger in their old age.
They're all married with kids, and are rich. They don't have much reason to be angry anymore.
I suppose you're right.
