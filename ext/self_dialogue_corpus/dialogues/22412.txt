I love the movie V for Vendetta, have you ever seen it?
Yes, I think I did.
The one where the main character wears that mask.
Yes, I did, it was very good.
Yea, I watched it a few times.
There were some good actors in that movie.
Yeah Natalie Portman played a good part.
Yea, can't believe she shaved her head for that.
I loved V, he was great. Sort of supposed to be a bad guy, but I think he was good.
Me too, he just wanted everyone to see how the government was controlling them.
Yea, when you think about, seems like things could eventually turn out like that.
Yeah cameras and security everywhere.
Who was the man that played V, do you know?
No, I'm not good with names of actors.
They never showed his real face and I don't watch credits.
No me either.
My husband knows it and always says I would know him if I saw him.
Guess he was a popular actor.
Not sure, but V is pretty popular with me, mask and all.
Yea he is a good guy.
