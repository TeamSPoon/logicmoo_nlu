You know keep the footages and just add more modern touches?
if they have the green screen originals then I guess that's possible.
Why wouldn't they?
I think they're either destroyed or gets archived and gets old to a point where they become unusable.
That's an extremely short sighted thing to do.
Be that as it may, not sure if they have the original green backrgound footages.
if they don't have them, then there is no way to add modern CGI to them.
Maybe not. There is always a way. It would be so cool to see the deathstar gets blown up in a more realistic way.
Even computer science phds probably won't be able to do it without the original green background footage
They can still do it, but it just takes too long. Have to do it frame by frame, pixel by pixel.
