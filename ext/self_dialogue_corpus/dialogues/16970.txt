Do you like Eminem?
Yes I used to listen to him a lot when I was growing up.
Do you still listen to his music.
Yes I do and I still like it but i've matured past his older stuff.
What do you mean?
Well when I was a kid songs like I'm sorry mama and others really hit home for me.
Yeah true why do you think you outgrew those?
Well I have grown up I understand why my parents were the way they were.
That's a good point I feel the same.
I can still appreciate them just not as much as I did once upon a time.
What do you think of his new music?
Like what?
Like Rap God?
That's one of the most lyrical songs i've ever heard and he mastered it.
I agree, he kind of said hey match this.
He was showing the world what he can do if he wants to.
He's a lyrical genius I don't think anyone would argue that.
He's arguably the best rapper of all time.
I agree.
We should get together sometime and listen to his songs.
