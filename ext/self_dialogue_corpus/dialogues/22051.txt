Did you see Nightmare on Elm Street?
Which one?
Actually I was going to ask if you've seen both the original and the remake?
Yes I've seen the entire series and the remake.
What did you think about the remake?
Horrible. It never should have been made.
I completely agree. Robert Englund is the only Freddy Kruegar.
Totally. I gave it a try, but the new Freddy wasn't frightening at all.
Yeah exactly. Which is your favorite from the original series?
I like the first one and the third, Dream Warriors.
Those are the best in my opinion too.
They scared me the most and had the best plot lines.
Yeah, plus having Heather Langenkamp come back to reprise her role was good.
I know. I'm just so bummed they killed her off.
I remember being completely shocked by that.
Me too. I was young when it came out but I wasn't expecting the main girl to die.
It was nice not having spoilers back then.
For sure! Social media has ruined that.
Check out Robert Englund's biography if you haven't already.
I will for sure.
