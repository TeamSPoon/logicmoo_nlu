Name your favorite rock band.
Metallica!
Now that's a nice choice! No Leaf Clover is probably my favorite.
That one is really good, but my favorite is Fuel.
That's quite a head banger! You don't seem like that type of person.
I sure am! The intensity of the music is gripping and I enjoy it extensively.
That is interesting. Who's your favorite band member?
It's a mix up between James and Kirk. They're both really good.
The band wouldn't be the same without James, so I've always favored him because of that.
That's logical and I agree. It wouldn't be Metallica without him!
