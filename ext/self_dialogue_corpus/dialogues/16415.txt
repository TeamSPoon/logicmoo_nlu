Do you like Imagine Dragons?
I don't really know much of their music.
Oh, you should really check them out! They have some great stuff!
Like what?
Check out the song "Radioactive" - it is so intense.
Oh, I know that one!
Yeah, it is great music to work out to.
I'm always looking for good workout tunes.
They have a new song out called "Believer"
Is it good?
Yes, I would say it is on the same intensity level as Radioactive.
Maybe another good one to fit into my workout jams.
For sure! It would definitely get the blood flowing.
Any other good ones for my playlist?
The have another really cool song called "demons".
Yes, I have heard of that one too.
It is such a great song, full of so much emotion and intensity too.
I would love to see them in concert.
I have been to see them twice, such fantastic performers!
I hope they come back in town!
