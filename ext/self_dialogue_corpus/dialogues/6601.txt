What do you think the next Disney animated movie will be?
I don't know but if its like tangled or frozen then I hope it comes soon
I know! I love their new style.
Yes but their old style is also good.
I think they need to have a mix of both 3d and 2d animated movies
I agree
Why do you think they don't do it?
Because money
You think Disney is only in it for the money?
Yes, definitely. Why do you think they charge so much to go into their parks?
