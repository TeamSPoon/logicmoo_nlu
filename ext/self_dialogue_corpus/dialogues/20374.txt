Give me a recommendation of a dumb, but funny movie.
Watch The Hot Chick.
Is that a new movie?
No, its from like 2002.
Who all is in it?
Well, I think the only well-known actor is Rob Schneider.
What's it about?
This deadbeat guy who gets turned into a hot chick. Its hilarious.
That sounds odd.
Well, you said you wanted a dumb, funny movie.
That's true. Is it just a bunch of sex jokes and whatnot?
There are some, of course, but its not full of them. Just try it.
I will. When did you see it?
I saw it in like 2005. I watched it a few times because it was hilarious.
Its not a chick flick, right?
No, but I assume most of the people who like it are girls.
I'll watch it tonight.
Tell me how you like it. I know it got bad ratings.
This is like the 3rd movie with Rob Schnieder turning into something else.
The other one I know of is The Animal
