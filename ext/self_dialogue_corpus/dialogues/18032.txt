Hey, I haven't seen you in ages, how have you been?
Not too bad, I actually just got back from vacation.
Awesome, did you do anything fun?
I saw some really awesome bands in Louisville.
Anyone I would know?
They were mostly cover bands,  they did a lot of 80's and 90's rock covers.
That sounds like a bunch of fun.  I love old rock music!
Me too, I love listening to the lyrics of the songs; they told stories.
I'm a sucker for a great guitar riff or drum solo too.
Speaking of great drum solos, I actually saw Phil Collins there.
"In the Air Tonight" is one of my favorite songs ever.
Have you seen "The Hangover?"
Yes!  Mike Tyson playing the air drums to that song is the best part of the movie!
Agreed. I don't know anyone that does play air drums when that solo hits.
I do the same thing with the guitar solo from "Welcome to the Jungle."
Guns and Roses, right?
Yep, I love them.  My brother introduced me to them when I was little.
I only know a few of their songs,  I think i was too young for most of it.
I have a huge song library, l can get a couple songs to you that I think you'd like.
Wow, you really are into 80's and 90's rock, arent you?  I appreciate it.
