So what did you think about that new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Dead Men Tell No Tales was pretty good, although I thought that the series had been going on for a bit long.
To be fair the last one was released in 2011, 6 years ago.
Still, when you think about it the series has just been going on for a very long time now.
Johnny Depp does a good job in it though, you have to admit.
He does!  I actually only really watched the latest one because of him; he fits the character perfectly.
Isn't Javier Bardem in it, too?
Yes, he's the main villain.  I loved him in No Country for Old Men.
I haven't seen that one yet.  It's a Coen brothers movie, right?
Yup.  It's a slow one too.
Yeah, I'm not sure how well I would do with a slower movie.
Some people like the bombastic stuff that Michael Bay puts out, but I think having a slow burn is much better.
Are there any other movies that have come out lately?
Wonder Woman just came out today!
Ah, are you interested in that one?
I'm unsure to be honest.  That universe of movies hasn't really grabbed my attention yet, but the trailers have looked awesome.
Really I would just want to watch it for Robin Wright.
Yeah, I loved her in House of Cards.  i'm just concerned because of previous movies like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad.
Oh yeah, those ones were not so good at all.
Yeah, I think that Zach Snyder kind of ruined the nice story that Batman v Superman would have had.
