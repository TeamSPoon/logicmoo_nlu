You hear any new music lately?
yeah, a little. that future remix with kendrick is good
yeah, I heard that too. future's tough
ice off his new album is ridiculous
Ice Ice Ice...the one with juicy j right?
yep, he kills everything he's on, too. albums always suck, but he's a killshot for guest appearances
i've also been messing with kodak black a lot
yeah, drowning's my stuff.
a boogie with the hoodie is similar to that
trap music in general has been hot for a while
lil uzi vert has dropped 2 legit classics in the last year
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF YOU CRYYYYYY
right? that song is ridiculous
and "now I do what I want"
yep, and the song with playboy carti "woke up", that beat...
puts me in a good mood immediately every time
crazy how much I've gotten into the new wave, I used to be an old school person
oh me too, but the old school doesn't put out any new albums
true, never thought about it like that
1990's are still the golden age, but yeah.
