Who's your team this year?
I like the Giants this year.
Going all the way to the Super Bowl?
Oh no, maybe Dallas, then.
That Dak Prescott sure is something.
Don't forget about Ezekiel Elliot!
But how could they let Tony Romo go?
That's all he had in him.
I guess that's true.
Who else made moves this off-season?
The Raiders are literally moving in a couple of years.
Oh, that's right! Las Vegas!
Would that be good for the team?
I can't say, but it seems to be good for business.
Just when you think Oakland is the new hot spot for sports, huh?
Well they got couple of years and also Marshawn Lynch!
Oh man! They're a must-watch now.
They also paying their quarterback $125million for 5 years.
Wow! Las Vegas!
Las Vegas indeed.
