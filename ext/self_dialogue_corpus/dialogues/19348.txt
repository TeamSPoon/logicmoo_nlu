What's your all time favorite song?
That's an impossible question.
Why? Everyone has a favorite song.
Not me, it depends on my mood.
Well do you have a favorite artist?
No, again it would depend. Why who is your favorite artist?
I love the Rolling Stones.
They are amazing. But I could never say they are my favorite.
What if you had to choose, who would you choose?
I just couldn't. I have too many songs that pop into my head.
Name some.
Time After Time is one of my favorites. So is True Colors.
So Cindy Lauper is your favorite artist then.
No, because Changes by Bruce Hornsby is also one of my favorite songs.
Oh I get it now.
Yea, and then Africa by Toto, and Motorcycle driveby by third eye blind. There are just way too many to choose from.
Ok, but you obviously are a Pop music fan. At least we know what genre you like.
Not really. I also love thunderstruck by AC/DC.
Ok, then, Pop and Rock.
Nope, sorry. I also am a huge Tupac fan.
