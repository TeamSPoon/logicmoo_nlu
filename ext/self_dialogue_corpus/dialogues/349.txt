Are you a marvel fan or DC when it comes to superheroes?
Good question, I love DC but lately Marvel have been killing it lately with movies.
I agree both the supermen movie and the Batman vs super man movies were disappointing.
I agree and superman is one of my favorite characters.
I felt the same way about Batman until the latest movies. Now I think Iron Man is my favorite superhero.
I could see that, he’s a great character, especially together with Captain America.
Now your talking, he’s another one of my favorite superheroes, the winter soldier was excellent.
I agree, the first one was just ok, but the winter soldier and civil war were great.
Civil war was amazing, the fight between my two favorite characters was so good and so were the other superheroes.
Spider-Man stood out to me in that movie, another iconic superhero.
