When I was in middle school I had a big emo and scene phase...
No way! I did too.
All I listened to was stuff like Panic at the Disco and Fall out Boy.
See, I was more of an Evanescene person.
All three of them are great though.
Agreed! I wonder if Evanescene are still together.
I thought they were! But maybe not.
We can always look it up.
Bring me to Life is that song though.
It's my karaoke go-to song, actually.
Mine is Fall out Boy's I don't Care.
Yes! That song is so catchy.
I just like the fast beats and really, how hard it goes in.
Same! The music video is great too.
Yeah I've seen it! With the masks!
Yep, I think they are funny and it's creative.
Panic at the Disco is also like that.
Yeah, too bad it's pretty much a different band now.
I Write Sins is still a classic though.
Yes it is.
