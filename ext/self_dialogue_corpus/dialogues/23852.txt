Every Christmas Eve I make sure to watch the 24-hour run of "A Christmas Story."'
I don't think I could pay attention to the same move over and over like that.
It's not hard, though I usually just keep it running in the background while I'm baking or wrapping or whatever.
That makes sense. Do you watch any other Christmas movies?
I love "Miracle on 34th Street."
The old one or the one from the 90s?
Oh God...the old one! That remake was terrible. The old one is classic and is the only one in my opinion.
That bad huh?
It was terrible and took it to kind of a dark place in an effort to 'modernize' it.
It's terrible when they do that and sacrifice the story.
It really is. Plus they cut a couple of key characters. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
Any other Christmas movies on your repertoire?
I never go a year with "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," "A Charlie Brown Christmas," and "A Christmas Carol" with George C. Scott.
Oh that one used to scare me as a kid!
Me, too. George C. Scott is so good in it but so grim. And the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is freaky.
He reminds me of the Ring Wraiths in "Lord of the Rings."
Right?! Or a dementor from "Harry Potter."
Very Christmassy.
Yeah very. But the acting is really awesome in it.
It's definitely stood the test of time.
