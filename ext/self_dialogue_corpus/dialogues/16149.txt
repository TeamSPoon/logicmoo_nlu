What do you think of Cold War Kids?
I have no idea. Who is that?
Oh, they are a band in the alternative genre. I really like them.
I've never heard of them. What is one of their songs.
Well they have a bunch, but my favorite is called First.
I don't think I've heard that. Then again, I don't listen to that genre much.
It was actually that song that really got me into the alternative genre.
How is that?
I heard that song on the radio and then looked it up on Youtube. From there, I just went with the suggested playlist.
That's interesting. Did you find a lot of other music you liked?
Definitely. I really like Alt-J, Soundhounds, Milky Chance, and so many more.
You are way out of my area. I've never even heard of any of those artists.
You should definitley try it out.
I may like it. I do like some semi-alternative music like Mumford and Sons.
I love them too. They have that folk/dance vibe.
Yes, they are pretty unique.
The song Wake Me Up has that same feel, but I can't find anything else like it.
I know what you mean. It seems to be a one off song that combined folk instruments with EDM.
I heard it wasn't well received when it was introduced at the festival.
Well, it definitely is now! That song was everywhere a few years ago.
