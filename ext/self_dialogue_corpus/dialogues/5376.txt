What's your favorite Disney movie?
I just loved the lion king! What about you?
I'd have to say Aladdin. I think the old movies are better than the new ones.
I'm not too sure about that. Moana was great!
I think they're good, but the old ones have a more nostalgic feel to them.
Well I see what you mean, but watching the new ones bring that feeling back to me in a way.
What do you mean?
Well they all have a warm theme to them so watching them makes me feel like a kid again.
Do you think they're better than the old movies?
I think they both have their place, but I still prefer them to the old movies.
