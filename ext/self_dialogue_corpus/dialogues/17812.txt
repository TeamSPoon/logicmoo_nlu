What do you think of the way music is going?
I don't even know. There are so many genres and sub-genres I literally can't keep up.
What about radio music?
Well more than ever it's poppy and taking more and more notes from each other to the point I almost can't differentiate between some songs.
Yeah, I know what you mean. But hip hop has been keeping it real. There's some good pop, too.
I mean, obviously, it's meant to appeal to the masses.
Well, yes, but besides that it's actually good like a lot of it is quality stuff, from Lady Gaga to Lorde to Adele to Beyonce.
You just named all women, are you saying there aren't any good male pop artists?
No, there may be, just none that appeal to me much, besides like Mac Demarco or Weeknd.
I see, so, what? You're saying I should broaden my horizons?
I don't see the harm in it, that's for sure. But if it's not for you then it isn't for you.
Yeah but I'll give it a shot. Seems to me there's more variety than ever before.
That's for sure. A lot of people currently labeled as hip hop don't believe they should be labeled as such, yet they are and continue to be. In itself it's a really diverse genre.
Do you really think so? Or are you just so entrenched in the culture and music you can't see fault?
No, I see the mistakes, I see the mess ups, I hear the good and the not good, but if you were to listen to hip hop seriously, hip hop of the past 20, 30 years, you would see just how much pop music is influenced.
Oh I know the extent of that, there are samples out there I would have never thought of.
Indeed, like Kanye sampling so many, or Pharrell sampling, Eminem sampling classic rock songs; it's really crazy and amazing.
I have to agree, I can't wait to see where it goes. It almost makes me want to make music.
Do it. You don't have to do it full time, but why not contribute to your genre's culture, and humanity's culture(s).
Yeah and who knows maybe I'll create my own genre or sub-genre.
