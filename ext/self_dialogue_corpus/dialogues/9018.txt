So who is your favorite rock band?
I'm going to go old-school and say AC/DC.
Really? Mine's Nirvana.
Nirvana is really good too.
Brian Johnson from AC/DC does have a very unique voice.
Yeah, his vocals on "Back in Black" are so raspy and unique.
They are good, but I just love Kurt Cobain's song writing.
He was definitely talented. Nirvana completely changed rock music.
They kickstarted the grunge era. Too bad it didn't last longer.
Yeah, it's been a long time since I've heard a convincing rock album.
