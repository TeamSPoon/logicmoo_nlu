Do you remember how old your were when Toy Story came out?
I think I was 9 almost 10.
I was 8 I think.
Did you like the movie?
I loved it! Got it for Christmas one year.
Back when it was on VHS tape?
Well of course! In the dinosaur age.
Even that little kids movie had a few really good songs.
I think my favorite was "You Got A Friend In Me."
Yes I would sing that all the time because it got stuck in my head.
I know I remember that.
I wonder who sang that song?
I think it was Randy Newman.
Oh okay, I have no idea who that is but that's interesting.
It was such a fitting song for the movie don't you think?
Yes I do!
Not only were Woody and Buzz Andy's friends, but the toys were friends themselves.
You're right! I hadn't thought of it like that.
They went on to make even more Toy Story movies too!
Yes I think a 4th one will be out soon!
