When I was a kid, A Nightmare on Elm Street scared me to death!
It scared me, too.  I saw it for the first time when I was eight years old.
Oh, no wonder it scared you.  That's young.
I had a nightmare about my face being burned like his.
That sounds scary.  His makeup job in the movie looked real.
I didn't like all the sequels as much as the original.
Yeah, it was hard to top that first one.
That girl in the movie was a pretty good actress.  What is her name?
Her name is Heather Langenkamp.  Yeah, I always liked her screen presence.
I still watch that movie every October around Halloween.
