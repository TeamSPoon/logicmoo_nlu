Hey, music major.
Hey, that's me!
My roommate says she has synesthesia.
Sweet! Musically-connected?
Yes, can you explain it? I have no idea what it means.
Synesthesia is basically your senses being cross-wired and responding to the wrong stimulae.
How so?
Well, for music, you can see colors when hearing certain sounds. You can smell things too. Those are the most common.
So, one piece produces a color?
No, and it depends on the person.
How so?
For some people, each timbre produces its own color. For others, certain chords, certain keys, and so forth.
That doesn't sound consistent.
It's not - each person hears and sees it differently.
I'll have to tell you later when I talk to her.
A bunch of composers wrote down the colors they associated with each.
That sounds fun but it could be torture.
It might be! Messiaen, specifically.
What happened to him?
He started seeing colors after extreme starvation in the Nazi camps.
