I've just realised that despite there being dozens of Disney films, they're all set in London.
Well that's just not true.
OK then name one that isn't.
Dumbo is set in Africa.
That's just one exception.
Tarzan is literally king of a jungle.
OK so they made a couple.
The Jungle Book literally has jungle in its title, there are bears and tigers. You don't get those in London.
OK I may have been a bit wrong there.
You were about as wrong as Dumbo was when he got drunk and thought he could see pink elephants.
