What is with all the killer moons in Star Wars?
That's no moon! It's a trap!
Exactly! Two death stars and then Starkiller base. Shouldn't they expect that by now.
I think they handled that well in The Force Awakens. Han made jokes about it.
You know, by blowing up three bases of that size the Jedi have killed more people than died on Alderaan.
I never thought about that. They were all bad people though.
Not necessarily. They were probably full of innocent droids and slaves.
Oh no! Probably maintenance workers too. I doubt the storm troopers were cooking their own meals.
Face it. Luke and the Jedi are a mass murderers with good intentions.
Wow, you just ruined Star Wars for me.
