We've got another football team in LA!
I know! The Chargers and the Rams are here now.
Which would you rather see?
I'd say the Chargers. I think they're going to be better this year.
I agree and the AFC West is looking really good now.
No joke, I think it might be the best division in football.
The Raiders took huge steps this offseason.
The Broncos still have that incredible defense.
And Kansas City is looking as good as last year too.
Just comes down to the Chargers then.
I guess so. I think they had too many close games slip away last year.
Yeah, I felt like they lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter.
I wonder if it'll swing their way this season.
Either way, I'll try and get Chargers tickets this season.
I hear they're in Stubhub.
Yeah, it only seats 30,000 so the environment is more intense.
I'm sure they'll take every advantage they can get.
I hear that.
Good luck getting tickets.
Thanks.
