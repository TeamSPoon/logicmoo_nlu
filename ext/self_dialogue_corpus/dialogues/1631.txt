Ready to see Kirk Cousins light up the field this year?
No doubt. Can't wait for football season to start.
Me either. My Redskins are looking great.
They don't look better than my Giants though.
Giants do look sick, I'll admit.
You know how we do... One good year and then one bad year and then back to good!
Maybe they can slay the Pats again this year.
Someone has to do it. We know the Falcons and Seahawks can't!
Who else does the Redskisn have this year?
I missed the draft, but I know we got that great new running back.
He looks crazy good.
Yes indeed. I can't wait to see how moving through holes.
I'm excited to see Christian McCaffrey as well.
He's just what the Panthers need.
That and an actual decent receiver.
True. Benjamin is looking a bit big nowadays.
He's the Eddie Lacy of the Panthers!
I heard he lost weight.
He did, supposedly, but he obviously has no self control. Seahawks might have messed up.
We will see. Can't wait to see them play Marshawn this season!
