NFL football is pretty unique compared to the sports in the rest of the world, isn't it?
Yes. It has a unique history.
How did America's version of football become what it is today, do you know?
It basically was derived from English sports like Rugby and Soccer.
Why do they call it football in America, when football is actually a completely different game everywhere else?
It's because, when the game was invented, most games at that time were played on horseback, such as Polo. Since it was played on foot they called it football.
Is that the same reason Europeans call soccer football?
Yes, but we call their football soccer to differentiate from our own game played on foot, which we call football.
But it still causes confusion. Do you know any other interesting facts?
The Superbowl is the most watched television event in America.
That's not surprising.
Another interesting fact is that 78% of NFL players go bankrupt within 2 years of retiring from the league.
That's a higher number than I would have guessed.
A little known fact is that the cheerleaders don't make money. They only get a few dollars a game, and they spend more money on hair and makeup than they get paid, so they actually lose money.
That's a real shame. The cheerleaders are the main thing some people enjoy about the game.
The NFL doesn't make as much money as you might guess.
How much do they make?
Well, they pull in 9 billion in total revenue, but the entire profit of the NFL is only 1 billion.
Compared to other types of entertainment that's very unimpressive.
Yes, it is.
