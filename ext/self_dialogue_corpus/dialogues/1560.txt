What is your favorite football team?
I like the Steelers?
Who is your favorite player on the team?
I like Roethlisberger.
The quarterback?
Yes, I think he is one of the best in the league.
He gets hurt a lot doesn't he?
No not that often. He had an injury that had him out for a couple of games last year.
Think he is better than Terry Bradshaw was?
Well he passed Terry Bradshaw for most passing yards for a Steelers quarterback in 2012.
Oh I did not know that.
Yes, people forget. that was the year that he  threw for 3,265 yards and 26 touchdowns in thirteen games in 2012 as the Steelers finished the season with an 8-8 record!
Amazing. He was sure on his game that year then.
Yes he most certainly was.
I prefer the Dolphins myself.
The Dolphins are ok. They have a nice uniform, ha ha!
Yes, but that is not the reason I like them.
Then why do you like them?
Probably because that was the team my dad liked and I grew up watching them.
Ok, well that makes sense.
