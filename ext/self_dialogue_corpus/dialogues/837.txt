I really hope the Vikings go to the Superbowl this year.
Meh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means it won't happen.
How do you know?
Because they haven't been there since the 1970s and we lost at that.
But we made it to the playoffs since then.
That falls under the category of 'close but no cigar.'
Man, you're mean.
If by 'mean' you actually meant 'truthful' yes, I am.
We almost made it the year Brett Favre was in it.
Yeah, that was something.
The Saints really cheated.
I wouldn't call it cheating, but they were out of line.
I know.
Even if Farve was a mile away from the ball the Saints would have 10 guys pile up on him.
It was obvious they were trying to hurt him and put him out of commission.
Even I could see that and I almost never watch football games.
Well, we'll make it this year.
Sure. Then at the end of a losing season you'll be saying 'we'll get 'em next year.'
