Which team in the NFL do you like the least?
Take a guess and I'll tell you if you are right.
Is it the Arizona Cardinals?
No that isn't right.
Is it the Los Angeles Chargers?
That isn't right either.
Okay I give up then.
Are you sure just think about it.
Oh wait is it the Baltimore Ravens?
Exactly I just can't stand them.
Why don't you like them?
There is so much domestic violence associated with their team.
Oh I agree but they can't control that.
Actually they can control it but they choose not too.
What do you mean?
They always look the other way, give second chances, and even let the most shady players join their roster.
That is a good point.
They let Ray Lewis keep playing even after his murder trial.
Yeah but he is a solid player.
He definitely is but still the mentality in Baltimore is winning over being moral.
