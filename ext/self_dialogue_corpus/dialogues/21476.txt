Hey, I was going to check out a movie and wondered if you could recommend one to me?
Do you like Johnny Depp in movies?
Well, most of his movies I really enjoy. I think he is a very good actor.
Have you watched the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies?
Yes, I am pretty sure I have seen them all, except the latest one. They are a big hit with my husband.
Well, I went to the movies and watched the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales
Did you like it?
I did like it, but you know, it is very similar to the other movies.
Oh, well, I guess that is to be expected in sequels. Anything new?
Well, we watched it in 3D so I really enjoyed that.
Cool! It's been a long time since I watched a movie in 3D. Was there many 3D effects?
Yes, actually there were quite a few. Since it's a movie about pirates, you can imagine there were many water effects.
Oh, yes, I imagine. So, were there ever any sharks or anything scary that looked like they got you?
Yes! I actually jumped a few times! There were a few scenes were it was so realistic!
Oh, I think that would be fun. Is it appropriate for younger children?
I think so, but I guess it would depend on how strict you are with your child's movie viewing.
Well, I just don't like extremely graphic language or sexual content. Would it be safe in those areas?
Yes, there might have been a few mild curse words, and maybe some language that was a bit sexual, but nothing really bad.
So, would you take your younger children to see it?
I would, I think it would be a great family movie for your bunch!
