Have you watched Speed before?
Sure have.
That movie was awesome.
iIf you like that kind of movie.
Do you?
You bet I do.
Was a little unrealistic at times.
Yeah it was but that doesn't mean it wasn't awesome.
It's always easy to watch sandra bullock too.
and keanu
I thought it was funny when the bus jumped the freeway.
I know right
like all of a sudden there was a ramp there for it to use
that was funny. or the one part when they got off the on ramp crashing into cars and not slowing down.
yeah all you would do is slow down
plus making sharp turns
bus would do nothing but flip
you know what even funnier
what
speed 2
