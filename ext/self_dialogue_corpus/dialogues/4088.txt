What parts were the scariest?
The scariest for me was when the mother made the boyfriend sink into the floor and he couldn't speak or move!
Didn't the place she sent him to have a specific name?
Yes, but I can't remember it.
Ah.  What was the creepiest part of the movie for you?
When I learned that the guy running around the grounds military style was actually the girls grandfather.
The funniest?
When the boyfriend was saved at the end by his TSA friend.
Would you reccommend this movie?
Yes, if you like a good mix of all genres in one.
