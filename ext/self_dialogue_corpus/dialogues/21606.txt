Have you ever seen Some Like it Hot?
No, I haven't.  Is it good?
It is awesome.  A classic comedy, no doubt.
Who's in it?
There are several stars you may know: Marilyn Monroe. Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis ring a bell?
Oh yeah, that's a lot of star quality there.
And the chemistry between them all is awesome.
So, which one of the men plays Monroe's love interest?
Well, that's kind of tricky.  You see, the men are dressed as women for most of the movie.
What?  Why is that?
They witness a murder in Chicago, so they dress as female musicians to try and escape fro the mob.
That sounds like it has the potential to go wrong in several ways, in a funny way, of course.
Indeed it does.  Curtis's character falls for Monroe, while Lemmon's character is busy fighting off the advances of a rich womanizer.
Oh man; isn't it an older movie? It sounds a little scandalous.
Yes, it's older, but it's very modern.
It sounds like something I'd be interested in watching.
Trust me, you won't be disappointed if you do.
I'm sure I won't; I love old movies like that.  They're relatively clean, but they are still clean and entertaining.
After you watch it, let me know.  I want to hear what you think.
Sounds good.  I'll check if Netflix has it later.
