Tell me more about ethnomusicology -- the study of the social aspects of music.
It started during the early 1900s and became formalized in the 1950s.
I see. What other fields does it encompass?
It's closely related to comparative musicology -- the cross-cultural study of music.
That makes sense. And, it's typically studied in anthropology departments?
Yes, but it's more broad than that.
How so?
Well, it also includes psychology, linguistics, history, and music theory.
Wow, that's broad!
Yes, it takes a lot of knowledge to completely understand the role of music in a given society.
Is that role always positive?
No, it is not. Music can be used to control people.
Well, I'd rather focus on the positive aspects of music.
Me too.
Give me some examples of a positive role music plays in society.
Do you think religion is positive?
Yes, of course.
Well, music is often closely tied to religion and spirituality.
Give me an example.
Some of the oldest music come from the Temple of Jerusalem. The orchestra there had 12 instruments, and the choir had 12 singers.
