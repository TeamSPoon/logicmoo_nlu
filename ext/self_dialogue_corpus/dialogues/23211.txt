So, I was watching this movie...
What movie?
I don't know. It was just a movie.
Just a movie? How can anything be "just a movie"?
Because it was...just a movie!
Was anybody starring in this movie?
Yeah. Brad Pit.
Then it wasn't just a movie...it was a Brad Pitt movie!
Fine. So I was watching this Brad Pitt movie...
Which movie? He has done so many.
I don't know. It was just a Brad Pitt movie!
Just a Brad Pitt movie? How can you say that?
Because Brad Pitt was in the movie, and it was just a movie!
Apparently uyou know nothing about Brad Pitt and his movies! Every movie he is in is a blockbuster!
So what? It was just a movie!
How can anybody be so ignorant about Brad Pitt and his movies? They are each unique, special, and 1000 times better than just any other movie!
Wait...ok...now I remember!  It was a movie called, "Cool World"...
Cool World? Did you say Cool World?
Yeah! The unique, special work of genius starring Brad Pitt that I watched last night was called, "Cool World!"
That movie was so bad it only got 4% on Rotton Tomatoes!  So, maybe that really was "just another movie"...
