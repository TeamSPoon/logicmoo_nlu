Have you ever watched Rocky Horror Picture Show?
Of course, it's a classic!
Awesome! Which character do you think I'm like?
Well, with how much you love attention I would probably go with Frank N. Furter.
Hey now, everyone likes attention every once in awhile!
You're not wrong, but you might wanna tone it down a little bit.
You're just jealous.You would probably be Rocky; standing there not doing anything.
So rude! Who was the guy that played Rocky anyway? Was he ever in anything else?
Rocky was played by Peter Hinwood, and I'm not sure if he ever did anything else.
I remember hearing that he quit acting because he thought he wasn't very good at it.
Well that's one way to drop out of acting I guess.
Better than making a million terrible movies at least.
It's like he was the opposite of Tim Curry. That man is amazing!
Seriously, it's crazy he didn't win any awards for being in Rocky Horror Picture Show.
That really is a shame because I think he did so great in that role.
Aww man now I want to go watch Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's all your fault.
Sorry I have such great taste in movies.
You should be sorry because I actually have work to do, but might put that off if you wanna come over and watch it with me.
I'm totally down to watch it! do we get to throw stuff at your TV though?
Uhhh, absolutely not. Please don't break my TV.
