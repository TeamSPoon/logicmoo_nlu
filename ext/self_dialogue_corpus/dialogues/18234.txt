Are you guys going to the fair this year?
Yeah, I think so we usually do.
Have you heard anything about who's playing.
No, I know Poison and Motley Crew played the last two years.
Nevermind I just googled it.
Did you figure out who's playing?
Yeah it looks like they have 4 acts this year.
Who are they?
Mellisa Ethridge, Old Dominion, the B-52s, and the Marshall Tucker Band.
Oh, they are all great! Are you going to any of them?
Yeah, I'm thinking Old Dominion or the Marshall Tucker Band.
Want to go together?
Yeah sure, which one were you thinking.
I really like Old Dominion.
Me too. I love that song Song for Another Time.
Me too. But the Marshall Tucker Band is pretty good too.
Yeah I really like can't you see and heard it in a love song.
Yeah those are both good.
I can't decide. Maybe we should go to both?
That works for me! I'm stoked!
