Did you hear any rumors about the Spice Girls reuniting for a tour?
No, I didn't. Did you?
Yes, I heard they were getting back together.
While that would be awesome, I'm sorry to inform you that is highly unlikely.
I figured. I think at least two of them are judges on different shows now.
Yes, but how fun would that be. I loved them back in the day.
I know. It was so corny, but their music was just so catchy.
Of course everyone knows Wannabe, but I think my favorite song was actually Stop.
Was that from their second album?
Yes, for as big as they were, I can't believe they only had three albums.
I don't even remember the third.
It was released after Geri left.
Which one was she?
Ginger! How could you not know that?
Oh I don't know. Didn't they do a song for her after she left.
I think so. The four remaining recorded the song Goodbye, and I assume it was for her.
Their music was just great to dance to and now if the song Wannabe comes on, everyone goes crazy.
If you grew up in the 90s it's hard not to sing along to that!
I guess you are right.
If only they would tour again!
