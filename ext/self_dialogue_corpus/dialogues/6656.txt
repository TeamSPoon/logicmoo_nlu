What is your  favorite disney movie?
The little mermaid. You?
I love Ariel as well. So The Little mermaid is up there.
But is it your favorite disney movie?
Well it is between that and Dumbo.
Dumbo, really?
Yes, Dumbo is actually terrific.  It has one of the best story arcs ever.
I had never thought about that aspect, just such an old one I forget about it sometimes.
An oldie but a goodie... you should rewatch it. I am sure you will enjoy it again and again.
I think I will. Thanks for the reminder.
