Tell me an interesting story about music.
Okay, have you ever heard of John Cage?
No, who is he?
He was an experimental musician. John Cage lived from 1912 to 1992.
I see. He had a long life.
He created a piece of music which was silent.
What?
He made a song called 4′33″. This song was planned silence.
I don't get it.
John Cage believed that music made from both the presence and absense of sound.
I understand now.
Good. He was once put into an isolation chamber.
He wanted complete silence?
Yes, but it didn't go as expected.
What happened?
The scientists in charge warned him. They said people often get uncomfortable under such conditions.
How did John Cage react?
He was happy!
Why?
He claimed that the chamber was broken because he could still hear his heartbeat. And, that his heartbeat was music!
