So you said that you're a fan of Furious 7?
Yes, I am. I really liked that movie when I first watched it.
What did you like about it?
There was a lot of things. It'd be hard to tell you just one......
Well break it down for me!
I really liked the story, especially what they ended up doing with Brian's character.
Right. I was very nervous about what they'd do with him after Paul's passing.
Same here, but I think they handled it the best way they possibly could.
So many people cried during that closing scene, didn't they?
You bet. I counted at least ten people immediately next to me all in tears inside the theater.
