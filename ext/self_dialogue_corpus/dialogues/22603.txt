remember forrest gump
that movie is so overrated
yeah, people loved it so much
it was so long too
wasn't it like 3 hours?
pretty much that.
you like lord of the rings though
lord of the rings is exciting though. theres monsters and dragons
but each movie was like roughly 3 hours
well, the monsters goes a long way in piquing my interest
i suppose so. thats 9 hours though
yup but they did it well. i love fantasy
i guess you arent into real life stories
forrest is not even a real life story
i thought it was based off someone
i dont think so and the dude definitely didnt run over the country
yeah that was pure fiction
it makes no sense and was stupid
and now people say run forrest run in real life
its annoying
