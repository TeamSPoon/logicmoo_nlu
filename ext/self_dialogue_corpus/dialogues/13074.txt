Did you know I could speak Jabba-nese?
Jabba-nese?
Yeah, the language that Jabba the Hutt speaks.
Oh?  Let's hear it.
Seesaw peacha wonti Chewbacca.
Haha, what does that mean?
At last we've captured the mighty Chewbacca.
That is might impressive.  How long did it take you to memorize that?
About 40 minutes when I was 12, and for some reason I always remembered it.
Any time watching Star Wars is time well-spent.
