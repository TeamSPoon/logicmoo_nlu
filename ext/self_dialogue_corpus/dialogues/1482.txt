Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!
Yea I go to every game I can
I watch from home
Oh?
Yea I get super drunk
I drink some at the games
But yea I get really hammered!
How hammered?
I got so mad last time
Mad?
Yea my team fumbled the ball and i smashed my TV
I bet that went over well
My wife came in and told me that I was crazy
How did that turn out?
I ran out of the house
Where did you go?
Hotel room
