What is your favorite movie?
I've got 3, you wanna hear them?
Sure, what are they?
The Emerald Forest, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone.
Ahh, so you must be a big adventure buff.
I guess so. What about you?
Titanic, sorry I know it's probably not one of your faves.
No, but it was ok. I found myself wanting to be the "Jack" character after awhile.
Yeah, up until he took the plunge into the Atlantic ice bath.
You know that movie was not only "Romantic" like boy girl romantic. It was "period" romantic.
Yes! It romanticized the time period. Got it.
It was good. Who could forget the balcony shot with everybody in suits.
Yep, I agree and that's why it's up there for me.
Did you hear they are making a part 2?
What, you're kidding and how would that be possible.
I don't believe it is. We'll see.
And how about those 3 favorites of yours? Which one would you choose?
Can't do it. It's a package.
Indiana Jones?
Ahh, yes! Who could forget those lost jungle scenes.
