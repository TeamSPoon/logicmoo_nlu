Which Lady Gaga song is your favorite?
My favorite would have to be her new song, 100 million reasons.
Really? Why do you like that song so much?
It is such a soulful song that really conveys her emotions. Also, you can really see her artistic talent.
Yeah, I like that song, but I really prefer her early stuff like Bad Romance.
Why do you prefer that song?
It is so much more fun to dance to and it gets stuck in your head.
That's true, but 100 million reasons is much easier on the ears.
True, but you've got to admit that Bad Romance is a guilty pleasure of yours.
Yeah, you'd be right about that.
