do you like fences?
yeah, i love their self titled.
got a favorite song?
from roses is beautiful
its so sparse and emotive.
i think i relate to it.
how come?
my girlfriend just dumped me.
im sorry bro.
fences is good for music about breaking up
its a bit more moody than typical pop breakup
its sader and more wistful
it has some quality to it
you should listen to their new album too
the ep?
yes.
i like pale papers
thats my favorite from the album
its not as good as their lp though
thats true
