I just started watching the Fast and the Furious movies.
How do you like them so far?
Well, I've only watched the first four. I'm kind of confused.
By what?
A couple of things seem to be happening out of order.
Oh, right. You should watch them in chronological order.
What does that mean?
Like, Tokyo Drift is the third movie but in the story it doesn't happen until the sixth part.
Why is that?
It just the way the movies are. Like Stars Wars.
No it's not. There was thirty or so years between those movies.
Yeah, well. It's similar.
So which Fast and the Furious movie should I watch first?
The first movie is the first movie.
And then?
The next one is 2 Fast 2 Furious.
You said Tokyo Drift is the sixth part?
Yep. So watch Fast & Furious instead.
Wow. This is confusing.
Only a little bit.
