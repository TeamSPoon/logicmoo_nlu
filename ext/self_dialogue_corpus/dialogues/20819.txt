I watched that movie Boss Baby with my son the other night.
Was it good?
It was surprisingly really good. My son really enjoyed it.
I want to see it but wasn't sure.
Well there is a lot of funny parts and the way the movie is it makes you think.
How so?
Well it makes you wonder if it really happened or if it was a dream.
That's pretty cool. Alec Baldwin does the baby's voice I heard.
Yeah and Tobey Maguire is the narrator's voice.
I will have to check it out for sure.
Dreamworks did the movie.
I love Dreamworks movies.
Me too. My favorites are the Shrek movies, The Secret Life of Pets, and of course Trolls
One of my favorite older Dreamworks movies is Over The Hedge.
I love that movie. One of my favorite actors does a voice in that movie.
Which actor?
Bruce Willis. He does the raccoons voice remember.
Oh yeah that's right. Nick Nolte does the bear's voice too.
Yeah it's a good movie. Lots of good voice actors too.
I am gonna have to watch it again sometime.
