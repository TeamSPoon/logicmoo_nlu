You know what I think is the dumbest way to use the running back is?
Oh, God Here we go. What?
Just letting run straight up the middle.
Um no that's one of the best ways
Oh God, no. They either run into the asses of the offensive line or get tackled by the D line
Only if the O line didn't block properly. If they block well, the RB can pop out from the back with all the momentum and run straight through
Yeah, well that never happens.
It happens all the time!
Anyway, who has the best rushing attacks this year?
Probably Falcons. Devonta Freeman, Tevion coleman,. Both beasts
Yeah I liek those two.
I also like Zeke with cowboys
zeke is a beast. You know who else is a beast?
Yes I do.. I know who esle is a beast rusher. Le'veon Bell.
Boom. Mic drop
Dude is a beast. You know what we need?
Yes, I do. I know what we need. We need to get Zeke, Devonta, and Le'Veon on the same team.
And just rotate them play after play.
Run their defenses down, play after play
And then boom a hole will pop open and my boys go running with da ball!
