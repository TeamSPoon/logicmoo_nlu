So what will the Patriots do to cheat this year?
Who knows...it's something every single year.
Definitely...I call them the Cheatriots and their coach is Bill Belicheat.
I love that...and couldn't agree more. Every one of their super bowl wins is tainted in my opinion.
And people who think Belichick is great are kidding themselves...he stinks without Brady.
Oh definitely. He was nothing with the Jets and nothing with the Browns.
The only player on that team that I like is Gronk.
I like him too...pains me to say I like a Patriot though!
Edleman isn't bad either...I don't know how they always find these little receivers with talent.
I know...him, Welker, Amendola...same types.
I'm personally hoping that someone...anyone...wins the AFC East but the Patriots.
I do to...same old same old every season.
And Brady claims he's going to play until he's 50.
He'll probably find  way to cheat his way into doing it.
That 4th quarter in the super bowl last season was amazing though.
I'll have to admit, it was. But I think the Falcons gave it away more than the Patriots won it.
Maybe the Jets will surprise everyone in the East this year.
Right...maybe I'll grow 3 feet by tomorrow!
Yeah, probably have about the same chance!
Exactly... but I do love the Jets so I hope they just don't embarrass themselves this year.
