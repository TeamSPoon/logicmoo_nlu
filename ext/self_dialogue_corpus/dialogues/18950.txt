I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers don't you?
They're one of my favorite rock groups. Do you have a favorite album by them?
I definitely do it's called Stadium Arcadium. Best album of theirs in my opinion.
That's a double album isn't it? Came out a few years ago.
Right they had the Mars side and the Jupiter side.
I remember the Jupiter side being a little more mellow than Mars.
That's right and John Frusciante had come back on guitar.
Right where he's supposed to be. He was their best guitarist.
That's true. Of course I also love Blood Sugar Sex Magick.
That's a classic album. Give it away give it away give it away now!
That's my favorite from that album along with Under the Bridge
Everyone loves Under the Bridge. I liked their Californication album too.
Oh right off top, Other Side is my favorite song on that album.
Right it's so dark but lively at the same time, I love it.
That guitar solo in the middle of the song...that was so classic Chili Peppers.
I saw them in concert a few years ago in San Antonio.
I bet that was an awesome experience.
Yeah I was pretty close. It was the Stadium tour so they sang those songs plus some classics.
One of my other favorites from them is Breaking the Girl
Right it had a distinct sound and the lyrics are so powerful.
