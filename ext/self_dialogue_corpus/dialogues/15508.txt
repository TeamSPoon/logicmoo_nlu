I think that kid's movies these days have some cute songs on them.
They really do. My boys especially enjoy the movie Trolls.
My kids enjoy that too. Another great one is Moana.
Yes my boys and I were just watching that yesterday since they added it to Netflix!
Did you see the video that went viral of a little girl singing her heart out to a Moana song?
No I haven't! I will have to try and find that.
It was really cute.
It's funny how these kids movies songs can get stuck in your head.
Yes it is! I was watching Winnie the Pooh with my toddler not long ago and those songs began to get stuck in my head.
Oh I loved that show as a kid, which song specifically?
I think it was the song "Hip Hip Hooray".
That one doesn't ring a bell with me but I am sure I've heard it.
It was pretty cute.
I'm thinking that we may need to branch out and watch different TV shows.
Yes I am getting tired of the same songs over and over. Another cute one though is Octonauts.
Yes and they sing a song called "Creature Report" towards the end! I could sing that song by heart.
I definitely could too! I've heard that song enough times that is for sure.
Have you looked at Baby Einsteins?
I think I have. The baby I watch enjoys it.
They also have really cute music on that show.
