Do you want to hear some really weird facts about the NFL and it's players?
Sure? Why do you ask?
I want to write a list for  a blog and I want to run them by some one else for interest factor.
Ok I can do that for you.
Tim Tebow was on MTV in high school.
Interesting but kind of boring.
Okay let me try another one. Joe Montana pointed out the actor John Candy before Super Bowl XX111 winning drive.
That's a better one for sure!
This one is pretty fun. Rob Gronkowski has in own cereal brand...Gronk Flakes.
You can add Flutie Flakes for Doug Flutie.
Thanks I will. How about this. Larry Izzo of New England Patriots once took a poop while on the sideline and got the game ball for his trouble because he did it without anybody noticing.
What???? That is awful!
n the NFL playoff between Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears of 1988, the fog was so thick that the players weren’t even able to see the sidelines and the fans couldn’t see the field. The refs had to announce what happened after every play.
Wow how awful for everyone!  Iam surprised some people didn't want their money back.
You know Neon Deion? Deion Sanders is the only player to hit a major league home run and score a touchdown in the NFL in the same week (1989 season). Sanders is also the only man to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series.
Mr Super athlete!
NFL legend, Herschel Walker has multiple personalities. He doesn’t remember receiving the Heisman Trophy because one of his other personalities was in charge at that time.
That is so sad! I remember watching  him being interviewed and he talked about that.
Well that's just a few I have picked out so far. What do you think?
I think it's a good start and NFL fans would enjoy the weird facts.
