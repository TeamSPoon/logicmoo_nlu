Which shows did you like to watch when you were younger?
You mean as a child or young adult?
Either one! What were some of your favorite shows?
I had quite a few. One especially that I can think of right now is The Golden Girls.
That was such a cute show! I have watched that from time to time.
I loved the song they played in the beginning.
You mean "Thank you for being a friend" ?
Yes that one!
"Thank you for being a friend. Travel down the road and back again..."
"Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant..."
You got happy just hearing that song come on the TV.
I know! I loved it.
Of course I always sang along as well.
Well of course you did, that only makes sense.
Do you know who wrote that song?
That's a good question I'm going to look it up.
Okay let me know what you find.
Well, it was written by Andrew Gold but later recorded by Cynthia Lee.
Oh okay because I know it was a woman's voice singing that song on the show.
Right, it definitely was.
