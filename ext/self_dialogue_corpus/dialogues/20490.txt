What did you think of some of the movies that have came out in 2017?
I think it was a good year for movies.
What do you think was the best film?
I would have to say Wonder Woman.
That movie did so well.
I love the action and the plot.
The movie was good for a superhero movie, or just a regular movie.
The Mummy was pretty good too.
I thought it flopped.
It did not do well in the USA, but it did abroad.
I do not think it was any good myself, sort of silly.
I like silly movies.
Seen any silly ones this year?
Baywatch was pretty silly.
I heard that one was funny, who was in there again?
The Rock was the main draw.
I thought Power Rangers was also a bit silly.
It was dumb, I did like Boss Baby.
It was meant to be funny, I loved Alec Baldwin in that one.
You might like the film FistFight then as well.
