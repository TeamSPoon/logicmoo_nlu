I think Captain Jack Sparrow is the best pirate character ever.
I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!
The scene where he is talking to the guards, right before Elizabeth falls from the cliffs is the most hilarious. He's telling them the truth, and they don't believe him.
The look on their faces when he removes Elizabeth's corset is priceless.
I liked when he used his handcuffs as a zipline.
That was funny, so was when he and Will hijacked the ship.
I liked the part where they were walking underwater with the canoe.
I still don't understand how they could breathe!
That Will Turner is so dreamy. Who didn't think that when they watched it?
I know I sure did.
