do you like the clone troopers
yes they are like my favorite
do you ever wonder what their armor is for
i know right the armor looks cool but it does not seem to protect them from much
its kind of sad that they seemed to be nothing more then slaves
i dont know if you could call them slaves more like a product
but since they are living thinking bieings how can we just say they are a product
well since they was created in a lab its not much different then producing alot of other products
i wonder what happen to them after the clone wars
ive been wondering about that as well because in the force awakens they are no longer any clones around
