Can you believe it's been over 60 years since Hollywood released a decent movie?
What are you talking about? Have you been living in a cave for that long?
I'm talking about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; the single greatest movie ever.
I wouldn't go that far.
Well, I have and I will.
What makes it so great? Clint Eastwood?
No. The storytelling is what's so great about it.
It was okay.
It's better than okay. It's more original and intriguing than any movie released since.
I think that's a bit of a hyperbole.
The story and plot was simple and to the point. No plot holes or unneeded distractions.
You know what I didn't get about that old movie?
What?
Why was Tuco 'The Bad' when Eastwood's character double crossed him first?
Good question. I guess it's because of the extreme way he went to get payback.
'Blonde' should have been 'The Bad' in the title, if you ask me.
They did explain more about Tuco than 'Blonde' in the story. We don't even know his real name.
Isn't the character Eastwood played in those old movies usually nameless?
Most of the time, but that doesn't change the fact that it's the best movie ever.
If you say so.
