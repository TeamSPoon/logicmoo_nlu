Do you think Baywatch is going to be good?
No, its a campy movie.
The Rock is a good actor though.
He is, but they should have brought the original cast back.
I dont know about that, theyre old.
Yeah but girls in bikinis never get old.
I think when they look saggy they do.
Hey thats not nice.
Sorry. Is Hasselhoff going to be in it?
Oh yeah I am sure he has a role.
Maybe a cameo?
I think theyd give him a bigger role than that.
Yeah I am not a huge Zac Efron fan.
Well when hes doing comedy hes pretty good.
He just likes to show off his body.
Well the movie is Baywatch so keep that in mind.
Yeah I try to but its still annoying.
Gonna be a lot of guys shirtless.
Thats usually how it goes.
It might be campy but I still am interested in it.
