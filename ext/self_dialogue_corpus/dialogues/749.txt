So, who is your SECOND favorite football player?
Ha ha, well it would be a coin toss between Warren Sapp and John Lynch.
Really? why those two?
Well, John Lynch was just so consistant and got the job done.
Interesting, he had good stats?
Every season. He brought it to the house week after week.
Right on. You also mentioned Warren Sapp.
Yes, he was another consistant one with good stats.
Same as Lynch?
Similiar. Plus he had other things going on.
Like what?
Well, he was nick named "The Senator" he use to get involved with the politics of football.
Wow, i did not know that.
Yeah, plus he'd go out of his way to get the fans wriled up.
Seriously, he did that?
Yup. First game i ever attended he was up in with the cheerleaders trying to get fans excited.
That's insane! Good for him.
Yeah, i was bummed when he left. Last i heard he was playing for the Raiders.
Raiders? Really?
Yeah, i'm going to have to look him up. I've seen him in a lot of commercials lately so i don't know if he's playing or not.
