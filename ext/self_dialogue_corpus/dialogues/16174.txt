Did you listen to Frank SInatra growing up?
No I was too young.
Me too but my dad did.
I don't remember alot of his songs but I remember My Way.
He recorded hundreds of songs.
I remember he sang some with Dean Martin.
And Sammy Davis Jr also.
Oh yea, the Rat Pack as they were called.
Ole blue eyes they called him.
Oh I remember the song Luck by a Lady too and Mack the Knife.
Oh yea, I do too. What others do you recall?
How about Strangers in the Night?
Yes!! And New York, New York.
Wow , I forgot about all them till now.
I guess that is because he was more of our parents generation.
Yea that is true.
Maybe I will try to learn more about him and his music.
I bet that would be interesting.
I know he came from Hoboken NJ.
I have a cousin who lives there.
