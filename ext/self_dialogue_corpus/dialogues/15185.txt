What's the best kind of music to dance to?
For me, it would be R&B.
I like something a little more up-tempo.
Fair enough. When it comes to dancing music, I think R. Kelly is top of the heap.
And I'd rather listen to something like Katy Perry or Kesha.
We have very different tastes in music, to put it mildly!
A lot of people put down Kesha, but her music is really dance-able.
I am not her biggest fan, but maybe you're right. I just like something smoother.
R&B is definitely smoother, but there's not as much energy in it.
I think it's energetic, just a different type of energy.
Yeah, i guess maybe 'energy' is the wrong word. Maybe excitement?
Again, I'd say it's excitement of a different kind.
The bottom line is that I'd rather listen to 'Roar' or 'Warrior' than any of R. Kelly's songs if I'm in a dancing mood.
And for me, songs like 'Ignition' and 'Imma Flirt' are sure to get you moving on the dance floor.
I do like 'I Believe I Can Fly' by R. Kelly, but that's not much of a dancing song.
No, I agree. R. Kelly does songs that are more inspirational than dance-able too.
I guess I mostly enjoy the inspirational ones.
Whereas I think the inspirational songs get a litle bit corny at times.
Yeah, next time we're driving somewhere, I'm controlling the radio dial!
We'll see about that!
