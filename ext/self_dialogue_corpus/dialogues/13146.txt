Have you heard of Ewoks?
Not that I can recall, what are they?
They're these short, hairy woodland creatures from the movie Star Wars Episode VI.
I haven't seen that movie.
You should, I think you'd really like the forest moon of Endor.
Is that where the Ewoks live?
Yes, it is.  But it's also a place where the Empire has built a base.
That sounds dangerous.
It turns out to be quite an adventure and the Ewoks help to win the battle.
That sounds fun, I think I'll go watch that movie now.
