So, what's the deal with football anyway?
What do you mean?
Like, why is everyone so obsessed with it?
Well, it's a pretty universal game. I don't know why American Football has taken hold the way that it has, but football goes back hundreds of years and crosses all kinds of cultures.
Oh, right. They call soccer "football" outside the US, don't they.
Well, sort of. "Soccer" is short for "Associated Football", and it's the most popular football variant outside of the US, so everyone else tends to use the genericized term.
Wait, you mean they're actually the same game? Football and Soccer?
Sort of, but... back it up. There's a game called Football, right, and there are a zillion parallel versions of it that people play.
But which one came first?
None... of them? I mean, there must be a common ancestor, but all of the variant rulesets sprang up at around the same time in different isolated pockets.
So... okay, variant rulesets. So they really are all the same game; just, different groups of people chose to use slightly different rules for some reason?
That's what I've been saying, right. It's mostly a university thing, you know.
You mean different schools used different sets of rules for Football?
Basically, right. And different schools had different influence, so their variants spread more readily than others, until we reached a few standardized sets that most people recognize.
You say a few. What other kind of football is there?
Well, you know Rugby.
Right. Oh, right -- so that's actually football, then? I've always thought of it as, sorta, halfway between football and soccer.
That's more or less what it is... except, rephrase it for me.
Rephrase it? Like, it's a variant of football halfway between Associated Football and American Football?
By Jove, I think he's got it.
