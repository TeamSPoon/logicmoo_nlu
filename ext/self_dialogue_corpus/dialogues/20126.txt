One movie I have never seen is Braveheart.
You have never seen Braveheart? How so?
I just never watched it, it stars Mel Gibson, correct?
Yes it does, it is such a great movie.
That is what I have heard, I have just never sat down to watch it.
You are missing out, it is such a classic.
I must be the only person who has never seen it then.
It is action packed.
I am not a huge fan of action movies honestly.
Really? Why is that?
I do not know, I prefer movies like horror and comedies.
Well, there are some movies that are action that are also funny.
I guess I just never really give movies a chance then.
I have a few you need to see.
Like what?
Well Braveheart you must watch, and also have you seen Jarhead?
Jarhead, that has Jake Gyllenhall in it?
Yes, it is based on his tour overseas in the military.
I have seen some of it, is it funny too?
Some parts are funny, its a must watch!
