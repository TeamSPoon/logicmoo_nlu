OMG I saw U2 last night.
Wow thats so great, where did you see them?
They were at Gillette Statdium.
Isn't that where the Patriots play?
It is, it's a great spot to see a show.
It must have been amazing what was your favorite song.
My all time favorite U2 song is beautiful day.
Did they play it?
They did and it was so good.
I wish I could have gone to that show.
All of the songs were awesome.
Do they have a great stage presence?
They really do, the special effects were cool.
I also like that U2 does a lot of charitable work.
Agreed, members of U2 are always doing something for important causes.
Bono is really an inspirational guy.
I agree he is.
Did they play Where The Streets Have No Name?
They opened with that, I hadn't heard it for a while and was reminded about how good it was.
I'm jealous, wish I could have gone.
