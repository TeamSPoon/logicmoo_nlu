Have you ever experienced crystal bowl music?
No. But it is an interesting way to ask. Why the word experience and not just heard?
Because it a sound unlike anything else and each bowl has it's own voice.
You have me curious now.
When you are in the same room with someone playing a crystal bowl the sound fills the whole room with that one note.
okay that is a little bizarre. I am not sure I see the point but go on.
Each bowl is  tuned to a particular note which in turn is in key with a certain chakra.
So you are saying that it affects you physically?
Exactly! Now if you have the ability to have several bowls with different notes you get some amazing sounds going on.
What does it do for you? Doesn't it hurt your ears after a while?
No not at all! It's wonderful especially if you lay down on the floor or somewhere and close your eyes. The music and sound is so incredible.
It sounds pretty neat the more you explain it to me.
There are people who have  all 8 notes for each chakra  and will play them in sequence so you can feel it in the location of your body that is specifically tuned to
Are there mp3s you can find of this? I know it won't have the same effect as being in the room but I still want to hear them
yes there are a lot out there plus some of them are accompanied by chanting or didgeridoo
I like didgeridoo music it's so awesome.
yes I like it as well
I am really excited about listening to this crystal bowl music.
There are Tibetan brass bowls that are used in some of these sessions as well
Don't give me any more to think about!!!
