Precisely. Do you unbderstand somewhat now?
I think so. Go back to that example you gave
Ok, so you have C, C#, G# triad, right? And let say you want the retrograde
Backwards. so... G#, C# C.
Now if you were to invert that G# it is allowed. But if you were to transpose that G# into C or C# that's not allowed.
Oh.... i get it now.
Now imagine doing this with the entire row of notes.
it's mind boggling.
It really is. And it's not easy because you're tryign to discover musical form out of these rules.
That's why so many of these have simiular feelings to them.
Yes. because they follow the same rules, or at least in part.
Wait, so there are other who do not follow these 4 rules?
Yes. Hauer system they don't have the rule 3.
Weird.
So let's say you have C, C#, G#, and Bb. And If I were to retrograde that i would get what?
Bb, G#, C#, C
Good. And if I were to transpose it by a 3rd, what do I get?
Um... Bb raised by a third is what?
Bb is 1, B is 1#, C is 2, C# is 2# and 3 is D.  Then the original Bb, G#, C#, C is what?
So it will be D, C, F, E?
