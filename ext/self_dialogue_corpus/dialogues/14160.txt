What do you think about Lady Gaga's album 'Joanne'?
I enjoyed it and I think it showcases another talent of hers.
I think it shows how diverse she can be.
I agree. Her cover of 'Cheek to Cheek' with Tony Bennett was good too.
Do you think those covers of old standards appealed to younger fans?
I think her appeal spans several generations.
I am happy she is known for more than just her fashion choices.
Do you think she will return to dance music?
I would love to see her write another song like 'Poker Face'.
I still think 'The Fame Monster' was a masterpiece!
