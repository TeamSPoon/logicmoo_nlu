Did you end up watching the Green Lantern?
yeah I did the other night?
What did you think of the movie?
I thought it was quite good, I don't know why people said it sucked.
Yeah I don't know why people are saying that stuff either.
I guess it was probably a little different than what they expected from the comics.
Yeah and the story could have been better.
The effects and writing was pretty good though.
I agree I really liked the ending part of it a lot.
Yep the destroyer of worlds ending was good.
