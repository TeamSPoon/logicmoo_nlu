Hey, do you like star wars?
Hecks yah I do.
Do you prefer the originals or the newer ones.
While the cg is great for the new movies I like the originals. The story lines were awesome without the cg.
Which one is your favorite original?
Definitely empire.
Great choice. That's my favorite as well. Did you see it inn theaters back in the day?
I'm so old I saw it at the drive in.
That's awesome. What's your favorite new version.
Definitely the most recent. It was a prequel to the original.
