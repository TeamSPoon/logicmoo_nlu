Who do you think it the top running back in the league?
I'm not sure running back aren't what they used to be.
Yes, it seems the league is turning more aerial.
The forward pass is getting more and more important.
Teams don't even put as much weight into the position.
You think Adrian Pederson?
He is good but not sure as he is getting older.
How about Lesean McCoy?
McCoy is shifty but not an all around back.
How about the new kid Ezekial Elliot?
He looked good last year but still a lot to prove.
Le'Veon Bell had a good year last year.
He is definitely one of the better backs in the league.
How about DeMarco Murray?
After going to Tennessee he had a resurgence.
He is a good back when his running style is used right.
David Johnson from Arizona is good too.
He would be on my list of good backs.
Jordon Howard from the Chicago Bears is another upcoming rookie from last year.
He will be one to watch in the upcoming season.
