Would you say you liked Weekend at Bernie's?
I would definitely say that!
What about Weekend at Bernie's 2?
Yep, I liked that one too. How about you?
I did like them both. Corny movies, but entertaining.
I watched them recently and noe that I'm older they don't seem as good, but I still liked them.
That's why I was asking.
You just watched them again too?
No, I am going to though. I wondered if they held up well.
They were still entertaining.
I remember wishing I could live in a house like that when I got older.
Oh I know! That beautiful property on the ocean.
And it seemed so big and open in a friendly neighborhood.
You know, when I was young I thought that was I'm California for some reason.
It isn't?
Nope, they worked in New York City and took the ferry out.
Wow, I always thought California too.
I guess we didn't pay attention to detail.
Yeah really. Maybe they shot it in Malibu or something though.
That's true. You never know.
