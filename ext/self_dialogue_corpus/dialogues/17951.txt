Have you ever heard of 8-bit music?
8-bit music?
Yeah. Another common way to recognize it is old video game music.
Like from pokemon or something?
Pokemon was one of the first champions of 8-bit. I love 8 bit music
Why, it seems so basic.
It has a nostalgic feel to it for my childhood, and some cool gamey tunes can be made.
Like signaling a pokemon battle is starting, or Team rocket's goons coming out?
Those sounds are classic!
I can kind of appreciate it.
There are actually some groups that use 8 bit in conjunction with typical songs now.
Wow really?
Yeah look them up. Nitrofun is an example. It's like a EDM 8 bit hybrid.
That idea sounds so cool. Blending nostalgic sounds with drops.
Yeah. They have EDM songs for Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Pokemon. IT's pretty epic.
I'll have to check these songs out sometime.
Just look it up on youtube. They have a lot of views.
I'll bet.
There are even some music videos to these too with the games. It's a nostalgic ride.
I'm on it right now!
