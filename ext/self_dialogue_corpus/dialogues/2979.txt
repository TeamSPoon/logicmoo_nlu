Did Jay Cutler get a raw deal from the Bears?
No they paid him alot of money
I mean was he as bad as we think he was?
Not at all, I think he got squeezed a bit.
He wasnt bad in Denver.
Or Chicago for that matter.
He did have all the weapons you could need.
Yeah he had a propensity for making dumb decisions quickly.
Who else was terrible in his era?
There were a ton of Cutler types throughout the league.
Like Mark Sanchez?
No Cutler was better than him, Sanchez was good when he had a great defense behind him.
So why hasnt Cutler gotten any calls?
Maybe he has but I think he doesnt want to play anymore.
He did look disinterestd in games.
I think Phillip Rivers got to him back in the Denver days.
I mean yeah he was a crybaby back then.
But he always had receivers to throw to.
Yeah so it makes almost no sense that he wasnt better
Thats what I am trying to say
