Do  you prefer to watch movies alone  or with someone?
That depends on the movie.
What kind of movies do you like to watch alone?
I like movies that men probably would not watch with me.
What type of movies do you like when with someone?
I like watching horror movies, that way I can cuddle when I am scared.
Do you like comedy movies?
Yes, I prefer watching comedy with someone.
I agree, much more enjoyable that way to watch with someone.
How do you watch your movies the most? DVD? Theater? Netflix?
Definitely Netflix as I do not have cable to watch movies.
Their selection is pretty good.
Yes, they have quite a few popular movies on there as well.
What is the last movie you watched?
I watched Deadpool because I bought it from Walmart recently.
I love that movie! Ryan Reynolds is so funny.
They are making a second one too.
I know, I am excited to see it when it comes out.
I hope it is as funny as the first one.
I bet wit will be if Ryan Reynolds is in it.
