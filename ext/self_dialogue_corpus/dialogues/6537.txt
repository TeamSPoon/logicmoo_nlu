Oh my gosh, I just saw the Disney movie Moana!
What did you think? Wasn't it great?
Yeah, I loved the intense scenes and colors.
Totally, I really liked that it was a female-led culture.
That's true. It's nice to see Disney moving away from girls being "little princesses" who need help from "big princes"
I completely agree. It used to be that Disney was all about the princesses who needed saving.
Yeah, now it seems that, especially with Moana and other movies that have come out recently the girls are in charge of themselves
I think it's important for the little girls to see strong female leads in Disney movies
I totally agree. And the songs in Moana were amazing!
Yeah they were! It was definitely a movie I, and my kids enjoyed.
