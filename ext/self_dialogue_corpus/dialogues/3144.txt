Titans are stacking up on their receiving corp.
How's that?
They got Corey Davis AND Taywan Taylor.
Taywan was great at WKU. He amassed over 1730 yards his last year. Mariota should be able to target him pretty good.
They have just 3541 pass yardage with someone as accurate as Mariota.
He needs WRs and TEs. Which is why they're stacking up the receivers
Tenessee is actually not that bad from passing TD standpoint.
They're 8th in the league with 29 pass TDs
That's a respectable number
Yep. But Green Bay, man. 40 passing TDs. That's insane.
Aaron Rodgers is a passer. And he has Nelson and Adams who are both about the same in abilities
Randall Cobb was such a disappointment last year
Ugh. I played him in fantasy way too much. Regret it so much
He was expensive too.
I know. Never again.
We need to get preseason data for the rookies.
That's not gonna help much anyway.
Of course it will, it show cases the rookies
But they neve really show off what they can do.
Well, that's not the point, just seeing how they interact with the team says a lot about their potential.
