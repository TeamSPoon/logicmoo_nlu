You're a musician, right?
Duh.
Are the stories about instruments being destroyed true?
What do you mean?
Like, airlines breaking violins.
Holy crap, yes. It's a nightmare.
Why is that?
Well, people who have expensive instruments on planes sometimes are forced to check them but they refuse because they'll be smashed.
Are they?
Yup, imagine a $15,000 violin for your concert that you're flying to being completely smashed because you can't protect it because they won't let you fly with it.
That sounds horrible.
Yeah, they don't respect musicians at all.
Did it happen to you?
Yup.
What happened?
I was flying home with my undergrad band.
What instrument?
Tuba.
So, how'd it break?
I saw them THROW it in the plane and others on top of it. My valves were completely destroyed and they refused to pay for it.
