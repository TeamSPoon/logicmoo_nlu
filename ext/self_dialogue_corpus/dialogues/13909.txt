Are you a Lady Gaga fan?
She has an amazing voice.
I heard her sing live on Howard Stern and it was awesome.
She sounded just as good live as on the radio.  That is very rare
Her sounds like Bad Romance and Poker face were fun.
I really liked paparazzi. I liked to dance to it.
Her newest album has some good songs also.
I heard the song million reasons the other day.  That was pretty good
Have you ever scene her in concert?
No, but some friends of mine have and said it was a great show.
