You've seen the Harry Potter movies, right? What did you think of the final one?
I loved it. I wish they would have been able to include every scene though.
I know, me too. That would have made the film too long, though.
There is a scene I wished they'd left out; Harry breaking the Elder Wand.
Oh I wished they left that too! I'm just going to pretend that he repaired his wand first off screen.
That would make more sense than him keeping Draco's wand.
You think he would keep Draco's wand, or would he get a new one? If he didn't fix his wand, that is.
Well he did win it from him. The wand changed its alliance to Harry.
That does make sense. I'm still going to pretend that he fixed his wand first.
Whatever works for you.
