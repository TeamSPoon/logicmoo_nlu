I scored three points at my game today. I've never scored points before.
That's awesome. I wish I played.
Lance is leaving the team so you could always try out for his spot.
When is he leaving?
Next weekend.
I will try out if you want.
I bet you'd make it. Talk to Tyler about it.
I need to work on my dribbling, though.
Let's practice right now.
DO you have a ball here?
I have the one from Dave and Buster's.
I love that ball. It's a good one.
A good ball makes dribbling easier.
Any pointers for me?
Just keep trying.
Like this?
Haha, with one hand.
This is hard work.
Tyler helped me so maybe you could practice with him too.
I hope so.
