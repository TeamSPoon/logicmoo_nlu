What is your favorite all time sub-genre of rap?
I really vibe with the early 90's gangster rap like Snoop Dogg and NWA.
That stuff was great, but did you ever listen to the jazzy hip hop of the early 90's?
Not a ton, I was really into the hardcore vibes and rebellious understones of the gangster stuff. Which artists are you referring to?
A Tribe Called Quest released Midnight Marauders, which I consider one of the most classic hip hop albums of all time.
That music was quality but lacked the hard hitting beats that I like.
Artists back then were on a different level lyrically and had such positive messages.
That may be true but the beats didn't bump like the ones produced by Dr. Dre.
Dre was definitely ahead of his time, but I feel like he didn't find his own until he and Eminem delivered "The Eminem Show" in 2000.
Eminem would have never made it in the industry with the production and direction of Dr. Dre.
