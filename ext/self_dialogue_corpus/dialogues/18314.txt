Have you ever heard of the Frames?
No. I haven't. Are they new?
No. They have been around for almost 20 years.
Do they play around here?
They don't play as a group anymore. It's founder went solo.
Is he from the US?
No. He's Irish. But he does tour here.
He sounds interesting. He must play Irish Folk music.
That's close. It's folkish with some Rock and Blues tones.
I would like to hear that.
His name is Glen Handard. He sings and plays guitar.
Does he play solo, or does he have a backing band?
He has a backing band. Amazing group. I saw them live in New Orleanes, LA.
That's awesome. Must have been a great show.
We were in the second row in the middle section. It sounded amazing!
Are they going to be here anytime soon?
Most likely not, they usually try to hit the major city and festivals.
Where is the next Concert?
Houston, TX, I think.
Great! Let's get tickets.
