Do you like martial arts movies?
They are pretty good.
I would check out Drunken Master.

Jackie Chan plays a martial artist who fights while drunk.
I love Jackie Chan! When did this come out?
A long time ago. It's a classic movie with hilarious dubbing.
Jackie Chan is so nice. I would love to meet him.
There is a reason he is as famous as he is.
I wish more people were like Jackie Chan!
