Do you like oldies
how old?
lets say 50's
yes I listened to that music growing up, they were my parents records
who do you like in the 50's style music
I love love the Platters, my grandma used to play the 8-track in the car all of the time
really I love the Platters too
what songs do you like best
The Great Pretender
Oh wow that brings back so many memories
what is your favorite
well I have to agree with the Great Pretender, but I also love Smoke Gets in your Eyes
Yes that is from the same album I believe
I also love only you
I think that song captures the essence of the 50's
maybe because they have featured it in so many movies about the 50's
possibly
I also love Magic Touch
yes that one is great too
you can buy a greatest hits album that features all of those songs
