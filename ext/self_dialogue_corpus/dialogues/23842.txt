I'm currently watching Waterworld laying on the couch.
Was it on television or did you find it on Netflix?
Actually neither. I own this movie on DVD.
Wow! I haven't really watched a DVD in so long!
I know. This movie is great though so I try to see it a few times a year.
What is the movie about?
It is about a guy who can breathe underwater. The entire Earth is flooded with water.
That sounds pretty cool. Can everyone breathe underwater?
No. There is only a select few people who can.
Is it a super power or something?
No. I guess he evolved that way.
That is kind of like a super power I guess.
Sort of, but he doesn't use it that often.
I would use it all the time. That is really awesome!
The people in this new Earth don't like people with gills I guess.
Why would you not like somebody who could breathe underwater if the whole world is water?
I actually don't know and that is a great point.
You would think that they would ask him to do certain things to help them out.
Now that you mention it, I'm not sure why they wouldn't do that.
I really want to see the movie though. Maybe we can watch it next time together.
