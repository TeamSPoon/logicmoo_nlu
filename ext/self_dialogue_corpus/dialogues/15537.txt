Do you ever listen to Hank Williams, Jr.?
Of course!  I love the old country classics.
Yeah, I love the song Family Tradition.
Me too!  I like to turn that one up and sing it.
Yes, it is great.  Patsy Cline is great, too.
I love her music as well!  There's nothing like Stand By Your Man.
Oh yeah, that's a great one.  It's so different from today's country music.
Yeah, it's really changed.  There's great stuff out today, too though.
Yeah, I feel like it was better back in Hank's day, but who knows.
I guess it's just a matter of opinion. There's a lot more diversity out there today.
True, true.
And Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson are really classics as well.
I guess you could say that.  I do love Garth Brooks.
Yeah, me too.
It's strange to think that Garth and Alan are almost becoming like oldies now.
I know!  I hear them on the classic country station sometimes.
Yeah, I do too.  That is odd to me because I can remember when they were new.
Yeah, we are getting old my friend.
The music is dating us!
It really is.
