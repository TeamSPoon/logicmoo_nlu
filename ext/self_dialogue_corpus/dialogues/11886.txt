Do you like the Beatles' experimental phase?
Yes, I like all their psychodaelic music.
Me too, I really like when George Harrison played the sitar.
He really respected Ravi Shankar, and benefitted from his influence.
I agree, and I like their sitar-songs better than their early popular stuff.
Do you enjoy the song "Within You Without You?"
Yes I do, but it goes a little deep for me.
Do you mean that you feel like you're lost in the song?
Exactly, it feels like a trance.
That's funny, I feel the same way about that song, but I embrace it.
