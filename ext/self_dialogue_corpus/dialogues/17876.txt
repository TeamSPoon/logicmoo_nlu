have you heard new limp bizkit
no, why should i?
its not that bad
it better be better than their old stuff
uh, not so sure about that
fred dursts lyrics have always been so horrible
its hard to really defend songs like rollin
or songs like nookie
hes a reason why nu metal has a bad rep
nu metal just isnt good.
limp bizkit has good instrumentation though
their guitarist is good
he did join another band but he went back
should have stayed  with a different band
he liked limp better
he has talent and deserves something better
well, limp is still pretty successful
but still the most hated band
more than nickleback?
i dont know about that
