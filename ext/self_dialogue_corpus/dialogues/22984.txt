Have you ever seen Lonesome Dove?
No. What kind of movie is it?
It's a western.
Oh I love westerns. What's it about?
Well there's a lot to explain but basically it's about two retired Texas rangers.
How long is it?
The first one is about seven hours I think.
The first one?
Yeah there's a few of them.
How many?
There's Lonesome Dove. Return. Dead Man's Walk, Streets of Laredo and Comanche Moon.
Which one is the best?
The original of course.
I'll have to check those out some time. Are they anything like Tombstone?
Not really. Other than the fact that it's a western.
Still sounds pretty good. Do they go in order?
No you have to watch Dead man's, Comanche, Lonesome Dove, Return and then Streets of Laredo.
Ok. Good to know.
They are all very long so set the appropriate time aside.
Thanks. I will.
