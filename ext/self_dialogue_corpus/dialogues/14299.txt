Are you watching the Celtics play the Cavs tonight?
Yeah, what time is it?
It starts at 8:30.  Who are you rooting for?
I wanted the Celtics to win, but they're getting crushed right now.
Yeah, 86 points last game?  That's embarrassing.
Seriously.  The Cavs lead by 41 points at halftime.
Who can come back from that?
It would take a miracle.  Can you imagine losing on home court like that?
I wouldn't want to show my face in public.
That press conference afterwards was tragic.
That's what happens when Isaiah Thomas gets injured and he's the one you count on most.
I heard he's out for the rest of the playoffs.
The Celts are DONE.
Better luck next year, guys.
Yeah.  The Cavs are unstoppable right now.
It's a good thing LeBron came back.
True, but he didn't score all those points by himself.
Maybe not, but he really lit a fire under their butts.
Fair enough.  Did you see how he's not an MVP finalist this year?
Yeah, what's up with that?
