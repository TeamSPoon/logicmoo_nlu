Are you listening to the Beatles?
Yes, I'm listening to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.
It's weird how they completely changed their style.
I know, they used to be a pretty standard pop band, but everyone loved them. They really changed significantly.
It seemed like some of their songs were a protest.
Revolution comes to mind, Taxman seems to be another one.
They weren't too happy about being taxed on their wealth, I guess.
I guess not. You mentioned Revolution, have you ever heard Revolution 9?
Yeah, what a strange, strange song.
Sometimes I really wonder what they were thinking when they made that song.
