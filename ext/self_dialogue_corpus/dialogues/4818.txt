I miss the good old days for my Atlanta Braves
Yeah it's been a long time since they have been competitive.
I mean they do have the best hitter in baseball, Freddie Freeman!
Yeah but Freeman just got hurt. He broke his wrist!
Are you serious! How long is he scheduled to be out?
They are saying 8 to 12 weeks.
Jeez, that's a long time. Well that sucks but it wasn't like the Braves were going anywhere this year.
I know but at least you could watch Freeman swing a bat, now there's no reason to watch this team.
I just keep waiting for this team to turn a corner and become elite again.
Yeah me too, but they have so many holes on this roster, I still think they are a long way away.
Yeah it's really sad to see how far they have fallen
As a kid, I used to watch this team play all of the time on the superstation.
Yeah me too, that's how I became a fan of this team.
Yeah but we are a long ways away from Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz.
Yeah those guys are not walking out of the bullpen any time soon.
Nope. They just built that new stadium, so maybe that will give the fans something to be excited about.
Maybe, but when my team isn't winning it doesn't matter where they are playing
Yeah being in constant rebuild mode is not a lot of fun
I miss the good old days of tomahawk chopping our way to another division title and World Series Appearance
Yeah, well don't hold your breath it could be a while
