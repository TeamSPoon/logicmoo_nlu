Can we agree that the White Album is the best Beatles album.
I'm partial to Revolver and Rubber Soul.
Ok - but name your top 5 songs from the White Album.
Dear Prudence; Helter Skelter; Blackbird; I'm So Tired; While My Guitar Gently Weeps
What about Julia
Also good
What about "Happiness is a Warm Gun"
I've never been a fan of that song - seems like a bunch of unrelated material jammed together.
Are any of these your favorite Beatles song?
No - that would have to be "Strawberry Fields Forever"
