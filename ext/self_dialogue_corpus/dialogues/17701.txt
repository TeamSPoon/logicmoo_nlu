have you heard of the band Asain Kung-Fu  Generation?
no, are they a good band?
oh yeah, ive been wantching the anime naruto and one of there songs is in it and its been stuck in my head
for real, isn't anime japanaese
yeah, the band is japanses, they do a lot of anime intro songs.
whats the name of the song thats stuck in your head?
it's calle Haruka Kanata which means far and beyond in english. it's so catchey and great.
is it hard to sing along to it since it's in japanese
as a matter of fact, it isn't. if you listen to it as many times as i have, you start sounding like the singer. very strange but fun.
did you buy any of there albums yet?
yeah, ones called "Landmark", "Sol-fa" and there newest album, "wonder future"
what type of music do they play?
it's like alternative mixed with some 90s rock, very good. their lead singer Goto Masafumi was inspired by Weezer. he really likes that band.
Weezer? theyre an awsome band, listened to them when i was a teenager
me too! and what shocks me is that Asain Kung-Fu  Generation are still together! most bands break up really fast.
i know, its to bad and sad when that happens. how long have theyve been toghere?
since 1996, can you belive that?! thats really rare.
wow, it is, must be a really popular band in japan. im going to listen to some of ther music to see if i like them
