Did you see the movie The Last Song?
With Miley Cyrus?
Yeah.
No I didn't.
You definitely should!
What is it about?
Well I don't want to give too much away, but it is a love story movie.
Oh that is cute, I like movies like that.
Good.
So what other movies do you recommend?
I recommend the new Star Wars.
The one from a few years ago?
Yeah.
Is it as good as the old ones?
I think so, and I like seeing the cast return.
Yeah that is always fun.
I think you should see the new pirates movie.
I will check it out.
Great! Nice talking to you!
Nice talking to you too!
