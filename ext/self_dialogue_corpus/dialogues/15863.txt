Who are your picks for some of the best bands of the 1970s?
Queen is the first band to come to mind.
Oh yes. Bohemian Rhapsody.
I also really like the Doobie Brothers. Black water is a great song.
Listen to the Music is my favorite. What about Blondie?
Not a big fan, but I do like Call Me.
I think The Eagles came out with a lot of good songs during that time.
I remember when Hotel california came out. Everyone I know liked it.
I think one of their best songs was Take It Easy.
I haven't heard that song in a long time.
How about the Sex Pistols?
I don't think I ever listened to them. How about Cheap Trick?
I Want You To Want Me.
You know what's cool is that many of these bands are still touring.
Like who?
I know that Cheap Trick and The Eagles are still touring.
What about The Doobie Brothers?
They are currently on tour.
We should watch to see which bands might come here.
Yeah, we could go see some in concert.
