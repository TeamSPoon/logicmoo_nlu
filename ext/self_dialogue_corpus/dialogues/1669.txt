What's going on with the Cleveland Browns?
I have no idea, I just hope they do good this year.
I'm not real familiar with the newer players.
Yes, I miss the old guys but I guess they weren't very good.
The classic Browns were awesome.
Yes, but they never won a super bowl.
Do you like the Steelers?
No way. Got friends that do.
If you're from Cleveland and are a Pittsburg Steelers fan, you are a traitor.
Yes, I don't get it.
I hope the Carolina Panthers do good.
Why is that?
I like their logo and colors. I used to play Madden years ago.
That was so fun, good times. I miss playing XBOX all the time.
Are there any other teams you like?
Not really; no player crushes either.
My husband lives fantasy football all year round.
I guess you can make money that way if you know what you're doing.
I always look forward to the NFL super bowl every year.
Yes, it's like a holiday. It doesn't matter which teams play.
