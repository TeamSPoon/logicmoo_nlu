Hey do you know if Palmer is playing this season?
You mean the quarter back for Arizona? I think so. At least I haven't heard otherwise...
I was just wondering. I thought they were looking for a new QB.
I'm sure they are looking. Their defense is pretty solid but they do need more offensive players.
Yeah, I was thinking the same. Like they need good receivers.
At least they have a good running back though.
Who? Oh, you mean the Johnson guy.
Yup, David Johnson. He's pretty exciting. Reminds me of Mike Bell.
Who did he play for?
He was a free agent played for Broncos, dolphins, Saints...he was on the team when they won the Superbowl.
He doesn't play any more?
I don't think so. Anyway David Johnson reminds me of Bell. Like same type of player.
Maybe he will be a lucky charm for the Cardinals.
You know who can use a lucky charm?
Who? I'm sure there are several...
The Browns!
Oh my gosh! They need a lot more than a lucky charm...like they need a whole football team!
Hahaha...you are right. They had the worst season ever!
They can only improve now,right?
Yeah, I can't imagine how they can play worse!!
