Have you seen that movie 'Role Models'?
With Paul Rudd? Yeah, that movie's hilarious.
Paul Rudd is funny in everything pretty much.
He's so great as the surfer dude in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.
That's the one with Russell Brand in too, right? Great movie.
Yeah, that's the one. It has Jason Segel in it too.
From 'How I Met Your Mother'? I should rewatch that movie again, it's so funny.
'Knocked Up' is another great one with Paul Rudd, too.
He's just a really funny guy. I can't think of anything I've seen him in that I didn't like.
Agreed - he's really funny and great at picking funny movies.
