Have you ever listened to anything by Great Big Sea?
No, who is that?
They are really good, think of a modern folk music group.
Oh really? Like what kind of songs?
They do a lot of variety, I originally started listening to them for their sea shanty type songs.
Oh, those are always good.
They do other stuff too, covers of various songs like "End of the World"
A good song.
Yeah, I like their music because it tends to tell a story.
What kind of stories do you mean?
Well, a lot their songs tell stories about the sea as I mentioned earlier. One of my favorites is about a mermaid.
How does that go?
It is a goofy song. It tells the story of a sailor who sees a mermaid falls in love with specifically her top human half
That seems pretty normal.
It is, but then it goes on to talk about how he sees her sister, who is a fish on the top and human on bottom. And you can see how that would help.
Heh, I can see how. That sounds pretty neat, I may have to pick up an album from them.
I definitely recommend it, they have a lot of good songs.
Any suggestions on which to pick up?
Sea of No Cares is a good one. Safe on the Shore is also nice.
Thanks, I will have to look into that.
