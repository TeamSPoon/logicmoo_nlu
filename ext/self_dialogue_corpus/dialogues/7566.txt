I just rewatched the last Harry Potter movie. It was pretty good again.
Really? I've only seen it once.
Yeah, when it first came out I some how missed it. It would have been great to see it at the theater.
That's where I saw it. Those movies need to be seen on the big screen. You can really get sense of all the special effects.
Yeah, I love how they do animals. The dragon scene is amazing. I actually was feeling sympathetic for the CG dragon!
I know! Poor dragon.
It's such a great scene when burst through the roof of Gringots Bank and takes to air with out heros hanging on...
Yeah, that is one of my favorites too. Exactly what I imagined.
I see new details every time.
Me too. There always seems to be some little gem that missed before and it's so great. Love those movies.
