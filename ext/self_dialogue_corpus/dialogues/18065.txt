Do you like Twenty One Pilots?
Yes! I love TOP.
Cool, what's your favorite song?
I love Car Radio.
That's off of Vessel.
Yes. What is your favorite song?
I really like trees.
Why?
The melody speaks to me.
Isn't trees religous?
A lot of their songs have deep religious meanings.
I didn't know you were religious.
I'm not.
Then why do you listen to their music?
Most of the religious stuff is secondar to the meanings I impart from it.
I really see a lot of religion in their music.
I do as well, but I relate more to the themes of depression and loss, and staying strong.
I really connect to the music.
So do I.
It's easy to connect to.
