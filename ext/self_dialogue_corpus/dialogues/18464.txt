I'd do jazz for my wedding.
Really? Jazz?
Yeah, why not?
It's a little low-key.
Well okay like... jazz during low-key stuff like eating.
You're thinking of like a big band setup instead of a DJ?
Yeah! It's classy!
Yeah, I guess. I'd kind of want some pop music though.
Pop music isn't timeless like your wedding is.
Yeah, but I want everybody to dance and have fun in the moment.
People dance and have lots of fun with a big band.
Do they, though?
Yes! Oh my god, have you never been to a bar hosting a big band?
Uh, no. I mean, I go to concerts, but...
I'll take you some time. There's this bar that does it every couple of weeks.
This isn't like sad, The Wedding Singer-type bands, are they?
No dude they're like legit musicians that work in orchestras for their careers.
That sounds really interesting. Do you need to know how to, you know, swing dance or whatever you do?
You don't swing dance. I mean, you can, but... it's just like fun couples dancing.
Okay. I'm willing to give it a shot but don't blame me if I look like an uncomfortable 8th grader at the school dance.
