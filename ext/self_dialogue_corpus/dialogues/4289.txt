Who's your favorite director?
M. Night Shyamalan.
You have got to be kidding!
He does some really good thrillers.
He's had a few....
The Sixth Sense is probably my favorite.
It was good, but the best?
One of my favorites.
But you can only watch it once.
I've seen it a couple times, but you're right. Once you know the plot twist, it's a little redundant.
