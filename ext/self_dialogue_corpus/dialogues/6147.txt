Did you ever watch the Aristocats?
I loved that movie as a kid.
Which was your favorite cat.
Duh, O'malley the alley cat?
Same here, he was so cool.
I watched it for the song they sang in the abandoned building.
Well, everybody wants to be a cat.
I certainly did.
That butler was messed up, trying to get rid of those cute little darlings.
I was so happy when everything turned out for the best.
