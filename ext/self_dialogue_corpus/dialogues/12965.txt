So I heard your sister finally introduced you to the Star Wars movies.
Just the first 3. The actual first 3 that came out, not the ones that are supposed to take place first.
What did you think?
I think she recruited a new fan.
So you liked them!
My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time.
Favourite part?
Oh, probably the whole relationship between r2d2 and c3po.
They are great together. I love c3po's calm demeanor in the face of some scary situations.
Yeah me too! And I feel like as non-humans they're almost more relateable, just because they're not the ones totally obsessed with interests of the opposite gender.
