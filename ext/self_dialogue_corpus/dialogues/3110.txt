What are the most common injuries in the NFL?
It's easiest to describe injuries by their location.
Okay, what body parts are most commonly injured in the NFL?
It typically goes in this order: knee, ankle, thigh, shoulder, and head.
Wow, that's interesting!
I agree. As you can see, the injuries cover the whole body from head to toe.
Yes, I see that. I'm particularly interested in knee injuries.
That makes sense. About 20% of all injuries in the NFL involve the knee.
What happens?
Typically, the players move awkwardly and damage the knee. Or, they receive a direct hit to the knee.
What's going on inside the knee during these injuries?
They are typically tears.
What actually tears?
Either the meniscus or the ligament tears.
How do doctors fix this damage?
It takes reconscruction surgery. They use grafts from other locations.
How long is the player out?
They should be back on the field within a few months.
That's pretty amazing!
It is -- especially since many NFL careers have been ended by knee injuries. Yet, today, most players quickly recover.
