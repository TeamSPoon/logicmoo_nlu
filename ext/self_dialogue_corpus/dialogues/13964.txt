Did you ever get to listen to Lady Gaga's album Born this Way?
No I haven't , it looks great.
Yes, it was produced on Streamline label.
What are some of the songs on it?
Government Hooker and Marry the Night are two songs on it.
She can come up with some strange titles!
I am sure some of the producers helped her with that.
No doubt!
My favorite is Born This Way on that album.
Fantastic artist, she is.
