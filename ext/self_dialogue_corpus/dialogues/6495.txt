Have you seen the latest version of Tron?
That would be, “Tron: Legacy” in 2010.
Yes, it was quite different to the original Tron released in the 80s.
I think the story was very different, but the visuals were quite similar.
I would have to disagree.
In what way do you think the visuals were different?
The visuals in the new version of Tron were more vibrant, the suits that the characters wear glow more realistically.
In the original Tron the suits that the characters wear glow too.
Yes, but in the new version the glow is more realistic, in the original version it looked like a cartoon.
I think both movies were ahead of their time, and had amazing visuals.
