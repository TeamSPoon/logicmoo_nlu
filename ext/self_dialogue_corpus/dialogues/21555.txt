Can you think of a sad movie to watch?
Yes, Pumpkinhead 2. It is really sad.
Wow, is that a drama?
No, it is a horror movie.
When was it made?
It's pretty old. It was a straight to video release in 1994.
Cool, are there any other older movies you recommend seeing?
Yeah, I recommend checking out the Blair Witch Project.
Oh, that's a new one isn't it.
No, the new one is a remake of the old one from the 90's.
Is it good?
Yes, it is terrifying.
Did it cost a lot to make?
No, it was extremely cheap and it made so much money.
So Pumpkinhead 2 and Blair Witch Project are good. Any others you can recommend?
Do you want horror?
How about comedy?
Sure, What About Bob is great.
Who is in that?
Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfus.
