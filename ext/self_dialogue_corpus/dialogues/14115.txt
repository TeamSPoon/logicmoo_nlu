So I finally listened to the Lady Gaga songs you gave me.
Oh yeah? What did you think?
I am so in love with her! She's the best.
I know. Any favorites?
I've been pretty much listening to Bad Romance on repeat all day.
Yeah. It's a winner. Have you seen the video?
No, but I'm guessing I need to!
Yes! It's so high fashioned and weird in the best way, and the dancing is so hot.
All of her dancing is amazing. But her vocals are spot on.
I agree. She sounds even better in concert.
