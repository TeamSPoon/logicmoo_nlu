Do you watch a lot of NFL games?
Yes, I love the NFL. The Carolina Panthers are my favorite team.
My favorite team the Dallas Cowboys.
I started liking the Panthers the second they move to North Carolina. That is my home state.
I grew up a Dallas fan because my father was the one.
My second favorite team are the Colts because my wife is from Indianapolis
I also pool for the Atlanta Falcons. I lived in Atlanta for a few years.
Do you ever go see the games in person?
I've been to a handful over the last few years. I love seeing football live.
I haven't been to any this year but last year I got to go to Panthers games.
How was the Panther stadium?
It's really nice. When you see it in person it's just so massive.
I know what you mean, the AT&T Center is ridiculous.
It just gets so expensive I watch most of the games on TV.
Me too, I watch at least four games a week.
Besides specific teams are certain players my pool for two
Oh cool, who are some your favorite players?
Apple for Philip Rivers and Russell Wilson because they both went to NCSU.  That's where I went.
I don't really have any favorite players and just my cowboys and Falcons.
Well I hope my Panthers have a great season. Good luck to your Cowboys.
