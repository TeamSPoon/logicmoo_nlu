Have you heard of Keldian?
Who or what is Keldian?
It's a band from Norway that makes Power metal with Sci-Fi inspired lyrics.
Sounds intriguing. Care to recommend any songs?
Would have to be Memento Mori from their second album Journey of Souls.
Do you know if they are on Spotify?
Yeah, their entire discography is available there.
Great, then I could easily check them out when I have the time.
I was really impressed when I stumbled over their music, really got hooked on them for a while.
Any specific reason that they caught your attention?
Think it really hit home when I noticed a song they had made about a book I had been reading.
Which song was that?
Hyperion from their second album.
How many albums have they released?
They have three albums so far, but they are working on their fourth album these days.
How would you rate their albums from best to worst?
In my opinion it would have to be Journey of Souls as 1, Outbound as 2 and Heaven's Gate as 3
I'm guessing Heaven's Gate is their first album?
Yeah it is. Not a bad album in any sense.
Hope I will get some time to listen to their music.
