I've been rewatching all the old Disney movies lately.
Oh nice! Which one was your favorite?
I always really like Pocahontas.
Oh me too, that was a great one. I loved the Colors of the Wind song.
What was your favorite?
I really like the newer movies like Frozen, the songs are so good.
Me too, that was definitely a good one but I like the classics.
Agreed, it is always good to go back and see the old ones for nostalgia.
I really loved the Hunchback of Notre Dame as a kid too it's crazy watching it as an adult.
Oh yeah, that one has a lot of themes I didn't pick up as a kid.
