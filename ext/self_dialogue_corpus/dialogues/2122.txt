Do you think the Panthers might pull through again like they did in 2015?
I hope so, but they remind me of when I lived in Michigan. The U of M made it to the Rose Bowl numerous times, but lost.
I sure do like Cam Newton.
So do I it's nice seeing a tall quarterback and he's pretty quick on his feet.
I know this I hope the NE Patriots don't get in the play offs.
Why's that?
Remember how it got boring in basketball for a few years because it was either the Bulls or L.A. that went to the playoffs.
True.
What team would be your 2nd choice?
The Lions of course, but that's just a pipe dream.....
They were in the black & blue division back in the 60's right?
Yeah, now it's the Pink? NO, gray.....LOL
Ouch..........
Actually since I lived in Colorado many years I like the broncos.
I remember when the L.A. Raiders were feared or was that the Oakland Raiders?
I don't think they've moved recently
When's the last time you went to a game?
I haven't, baseball yes but I don't like the cold.
Those Green Bay fans are die-hards.
I think we all are in a way.....GO PANTHERS!
