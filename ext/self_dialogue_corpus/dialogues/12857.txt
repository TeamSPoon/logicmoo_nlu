Hey, who do you thing we'll see in The Last Jedi, what new or old faces?
Well, we may see the kids of Wedge Antillies, provided he had any?
Who knows, maybe will see Lando again?
I don't think so, Billy Dee Williams doesn't do much acting anymore.
True,true, so any other theories.
Well, Finn might return since he's in the trailer, and his injuries didn't seem irreparable.
Yeah, what about Luke, how do you think Mark will play him.
I think he'll be part Obi-wan, part Yoda, part an old hermit who doesn't want to get involved, but feels he has too.
Well, I loking forward to the The Last Jedi.
Same here.
