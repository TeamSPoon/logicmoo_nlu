I bought the new Katy Perry album.
I didn't know she had one. What's it called?
It's called Witness. It has that song on it Chained to the Rhythm.
Oh I really liked that song. Really good for Katy, at least.
Yeah it's a cute song, but the album isn't really my thing.
Really? Why not?
I think she tried to make it really deep, but it comes off as shallow.
That's surprising. I really like Katy Perry, too.
I normally do too. But I think I'm just gonna stick with Selena Gomez's next LP.
If it's as good as Bad Liar, we'll be in luck!
