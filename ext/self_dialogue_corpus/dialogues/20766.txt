What do you think of the new Cars movie?
I saw the trailer for that recently!
What did you think after seeing it?
It looks way better than the first one.
Yeah, I’m glad they are going back to the original storyline.
Me too, the second movie was not that good.
I didn’t like it either.
Putting the focus on Light McQueen is the better decision.
Did you see the accident in the trailer?
Yes I did! Lightning McQueen’s crash looked brutal!
I know! I got worried after seeing it. Do you think he is going to die or something?
I don’t know. I think he might retire.
It would be sad if he did.
Yeah, or maybe it’s going to be some kind of redemption story line.
Do you think you’re going to watch it?
I might! The animation looks amazing!
I know! Pixar did a really good job!
They did! It looks photo-realistic.
I know! It really looks like a live action film.
I can’t wait to see it on the big screen!
