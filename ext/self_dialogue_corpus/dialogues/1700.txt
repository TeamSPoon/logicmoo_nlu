Isn't there some NFL games coming up?
Oh yeah, that's right! Can't wait!
I thought you were a soccer fan.
A little bit. Those 1-1 games are hard to watch, though.
Even a 6-5 baseball game can't compare to a football game.
I remember this 51-48 game on Monday night once.
Right! Green Bay and Dallas or something.
That's entertainment.
Even a bad football game has a lot of action compared to other sports.
You're getting me all excited! I wish there was a game on right now.
Maybe Minnesota or Chicago.
That Sam Bradford was a mistake. Teddy Bridgewater did better.
He is a little short for an NFL quarterback.
I'll bet they wish they had Warren Moon back.
Anybody can play quarterback now. All you have to do is throw the ball up in the air for these giant recievers to catch.
There's more to it than that.
Our recievers are pretty good.
Well, we don't have Calvin anymore.
Yeah, Megatron. I don't know how we got him.
He quit too soon. He must have been hurt.
