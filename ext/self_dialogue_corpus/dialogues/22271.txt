You know what's weird? When everyone else looks forward to Christmas, they think about gifts etc. I think about Christmas movies!q
What do you mean?
I love watching certain Christmas movies. Especially the ones the show every year.
Oh yes! I know what you mean.
Christmas isn't Christmas without "A Christmas Story"
What is that about again? Is that the one with Santa and all female elves?
No. A Christmas Story is the movie with a little boy who wants a BB Gun for Christmas but his parents are hesitant because they think he'll shoot his eye out
I've seen that one! It shows on TV
Yup, every single year!
My personal favorite is Miracle on 34th Street.
Yes, that one is also a nice story. Timeless
Do you prefer the original or the remake?
I usually prefer the original of the movie, but in this case I prefer the remake. When I was younger I really liked the girl who had the lead role.
What was her name? I can't remember her.
I can't remember her name either! But she acted in another show in the 90's called Matilda
Oh yes I have seen Matilda. A cute redhead girl?
Yes, that's her. She was in a lot of movies in the 90's, but I haven't seen her in any big roles recently.
Guess she was a "child star"
Come to think about it she was also in Mrs. Doubtfire
Mrs Doubtfire is one of my favorite movies of all time!
