Can you believe the Bucks almost took the Raptors to game 7?
Yeah! They really showed a lot of good signs for the future.
What do you think they need to do in the off-season?
I think they need to get a dynamic guard in the draft, like that kid from Louisville, Donavon Mitchell.
Yeah, that would be nice. I think they also need to draft that Thornwell kid from South Carolina in the 2nd round.
