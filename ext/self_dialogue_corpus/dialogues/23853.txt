I watched the best movie the other day, "the Rock".
That movie is amazing, its full of action from start to finish.
Yeah, two of the best actors ever, Sean connery and Nicholas Cage.
Yes, they play the part so well togerther, the acting chemistry is great.
I like all the acting in the Rock, ed harris is exceptional too.
Yes, he always plays the bad guy well, but hes not really a bad guy.
I know what you mean, he steals them rockets to prove a point and help the familys.
Its quite sad at the end, but its really dramatic an unexpexted.
You know what island it was?
Yes the island was called the "rock" thats where the prison alcatraz is.
Yes, I think its in San francisco?
Yes thats right, you can see the golden gate bridge.
I really want to see that movie now! its a few years old now.
Yes It came out in 1996
Who directed it again?
Michael bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson.
They have made amazing action movies, did you know another director who had a hand in the movie?
Yes! I heard Quentin tarantino, but apparantly he was unacreddited.
I also love the soundtrack, the movie scores were amazing.
Yes, Hanz Zimmer, actually that soundtrack is available to buy, its some of the best classical, intense music of any film.
