Have you seen the movie Old Yeller?
I don't think so.
Well it is a must see.
Oh yeah, so whats it about?
An old yellow dog that a boy befriends.
What happens?
The boy and the dog become the best of friends.
This is sounding great.
It is, for sure.  In fact, the boy is so in love with his dog that he has to do something in the end of the movie that will break your heart.
What? What? What? Tell me, no wait, don't tell me.
I can't tell you then it would ruin the whole thing and there would be no reason to watch it.
Yeah you're right. Guess I'm gonna have to see it.
Absolutely.  I loved it and would watch it again and again.
Really, then it must really be great.
So, when do you have some free time to see it?
Not sure, maybe this weekend.
How about we watch it together?
That would be great
Awesome, ok, I'll bring the movie and the popcorn.  You bring the tissues.
Alright, can't wait.
