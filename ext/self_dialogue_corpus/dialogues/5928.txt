Why do you think so many of the Disney Princess always have a tragic back story?
Like Belle losing her mom?
Do not even get me started on her story.
Why not?
She is kidnapped, then falls in love. It is nuts.
Yeah, but he changes.
Not enough, he was going to kill her dad.
I think it is a beautiful film.
It is better than the girl from Tangled feeling bad for her actual kidnapper.
Ok, that is true that was a bit out there.
