Every time I eat stick pretzels, it makes me think about The Great Mouse Detective.
The disney film? How come?
Well, it came out when I was little and I remember a friend and I watched it and pretended that the pretzels were pipes like Basil had.
Oh dear, that wouldn't fly these days!
I suppose not, but I always loved that movie. The end was so intense!
The part where Ratigan went all rabid, you mean?
Yes, and Basil and him fell off the clock tower.
I was so scared he'd actually died as a kid!
Basil was my absolute favourite character growing up; I loved how smart he was.
Yes, though watching it now I have to laugh at how silly some of the lines are!
