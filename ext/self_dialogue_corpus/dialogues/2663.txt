Hey, what NFL team do you think will win it all this season?
I'm going to go with the Seahawks.
The Seahawks?!
Yes, this team has made it to the superbowl back to back. Loss one and won one.
So what, so has the Cowboys. Matter fact the Cowboys made it to the Superbowl more than the Seahawks.
Are the Cowboys your team?
No. I follow the Buccaneers
Now that is a struggling team.
Every team has a weak spot.
Yeah and one of yours seems to be the kicker.
Who, Robert Aguayo?
Yes, I hear his preseason practice isn't going so well. He is showing some lack in fundamentals and consistency.
Well as they say, "practice makes perfect."
I don't know about that. I think there is talk about bringing in another kicker and just keeping Aguayo on the roster.
That maybe a choice they make; they can't get rid of him though, because his contract is good for another year.
I guess you will just have to wait and see what the Bucs want to do with Aguayo for the season.
No matter the outcome, the Bucs are still my team.
I wasn't trying to change that. I know how it is to be a loyal fan to a team that let's you down.
Got to keep your hopes up and root for the best.
Your right. After all, it's just fun and games.
