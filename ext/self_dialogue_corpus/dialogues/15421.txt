What do think about Michael Jackson?
Oh, he's one of my favorites.
He was pretty successful.
His album Thriller sold the most copies ever.
Really, how many copies did it sell?
It sold over 60 million.
That's very impressive especially without social media back then.
He truly was a great talent. He was also a good dancer.
His moves on the Thriller video were so iconic.
The video is 35 years old this year.
It's crazy how time flies but his music is timeless.
I always enjoy when it comes on the radio.
I know Thriller is my favorite song.
He had so many hits in that album.
Billie Jean was a great song on that album.
That was one of my other favorites.
it's sad we lost him.
I know he was such an icon.
It's good music is eternal.
Yeah, we can always listen to him.
