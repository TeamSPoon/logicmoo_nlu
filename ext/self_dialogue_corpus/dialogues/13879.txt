Lady Gaga's music has been a little disappointing lately.
I like it, how do you mean disappointing?
Well, it's not that I don't like it, it's decent enough. But she used to feel more exciting and adventurous.
Yeah, I guess I can see what you mean.
She started out as kind of generic dance-pop but then quickly took the genre into some new directions, likewise with her music videos.
Yeah.
But now it seems like anyone could make the music she's making, production-wise at least. And the videos have gotten rather flat and boring too.
She had a good video for John Wayne.
That one was weird again, but I don't think I would call it good. It was missing something that her earlier ones had.
Yeah, I did sort of notice that.
