Have you seen the new Logan movie yet?
You mean the Xmen movie?
Well, it's not really much super hero stuff.
How if Wolverine is in it?
It's about him trying to just get by.He's a drunk.
My favorite character wasting his life.
Well, not really. It really kicks in when he tries to help someone.
Who, another Xmen?
Not really, but you have to watch it yourself. Lots of action.
Well of course with Hugh Jackman in it.
