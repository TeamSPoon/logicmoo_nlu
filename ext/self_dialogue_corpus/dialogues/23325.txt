What was the last mongol movie about?
You've watched it. Why are you asking me?
I don't remember, it was so boring. I think I felt asleep on my couch
You "think" you felt asleep?
I don't remember.
Well, I think it's pretty safe to say you've fallen asleep during the movie. That explains why you don't remember the movie.
That's what I said! So what was that about. i want to remake that but with more blood, more head chopping, more mutilation.
Well now, ain't that just lovely.
Haha, smart ass. i remember it was more like about his development as a person which is kinda weird. Why would you make a movie about the greatest land empire ever, and focus on one dude?
Um. The greatest land empire IS the reason they focused on that one DUDE, because he IS the guy who did it.
But I mean why not focus more on his mad intentions, his evil plans, his pension for violence, and genocide. Victims need to be heard
Victims? What are they victims of? History?
Um hello. Are we victims of Hitler? Are millions of people victims of World war 2?
Ok, fine. "victims" it is.
Yes, so an epic film about the victims of the greatest land empire the mankind has every known!
Funded by whom?
The wall st.
How are you getting this money?
By convincing them they will make money! Gah, why are you being stupid?
I'm not being stupid. I;'m just inquiring about the plans, the details, the actual funding amount etc.
