What is your all time favorite movie?
Oh, that's a hard one.  There are so many movies out there.
Yeah, I know.  I think mine might be "Casablanca"
Oh that is a good one, but I think my favorite is "Moulin Rouge"
Why is that?
I like it for a couple of reasons.  First the music.
Oh, the music is good, I like that they used modern music we listened to already.
Right?  When I first saw it I found that quite jarring, but knowing the words and music makes the experience better for me.
How so?
I am not really distracted by something that I already know so it lets me concentrate on the storyline...and the dancing.
Oh I see what you mean.
Also, the dance sequences in Moulin Rouge are great, ESPECIALLY the "Roxanne" number.
That is a good routine.
I have it on DVD, so you can see it from other angles, it is amazing.
How did you like the dance sequence at the end.
Oh, you mean the Bollywood number?
Yes, when they were giving the performance.
I like that a lot, it had a lot of nuances in it that you don't see in the theatre version.  If you watch their rehearsal you see more of it.
Oooh, I think I am going to have to buy the DVD.
Trust me, you won't regret it!
