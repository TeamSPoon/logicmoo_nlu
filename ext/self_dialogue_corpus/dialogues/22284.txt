Did you see the last pirates of the Caribbean?
No not yet. Have you?
Yes I have.
How was it?
It was great.
I have seen all the other ones though.
Then you probably will enjoy this one too.
Okay I will make a note of seeing that this weekend.
How about other movies playing?
I kind of want to see bay watch.
With the rock?
Yeah.
There is so much hype about that movie.
I know. At first I thought it was going to be a show, but it is just a movie.
Yeah I hope it does well.
Same. But it could be a flop though, you never know.
Anyways. You should see the movie Fargo also.
That isn't playing.
I know, it's from a few years ago but it is good.
I will make a note of it then.
