If you could be in the Star Wars movies, what side would you be on?
I'd be on the Light Side of course!
Are you sure? The Dark Side has some cool vehicles and lightsabers!
None of that matters, we need to take down the Empire and bring justice to the galaxy
That sounds so cheesy. We need to have fun and obey the Empire!
I will never bow down to the dark side! Ever!
Why do you want to be on the Light Side?
I can fight side by side with Luke and Yoda!
I can take them down and prove I am a better fighter!
Pride like yours would be well accepted on the Dark Side!
