I have to admit, I had mixed feelings on some of the casting for the Harry Potter movies.
You don't like Daniel Radcliffe?
Oh no, he's great! I also thought that Ron and Hermione were perfectly cast.
Dumbledore, too.
Oh, for sure! The ones I struggled were some of the minor characters, especially Lily.
You didn't like her?
Oh no, it's not that I disliked her. I just didn't think they chose the right actress for the part.
Why do you say that?
She and Harry were supposed to have the same eyes and she died really young. The actress who played her was much older and her eyes were nothing like Daniel Radcliffe's.
Yeah, I can see that.
