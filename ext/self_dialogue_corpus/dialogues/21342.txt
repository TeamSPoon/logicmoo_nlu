DUUUUDE!! Have you seen the movie Tusk?
No? What's it about?
It's directed by Kevin Smith. And it's insane.
How do you mean?
This dude turns another dude into a fraking walrus, man.
A walrus? Like the animal?
Yeah, bruh. It's intense. But it's by Smith so it's funny too.
Funny? How is getting turned into an animal funny?
Well, just the dialouge. Plus, Johnny Depp is in.
Depp? No kidding. I like him.
Oh, yeah. Depp. And Justin Long. And some other really cool cats.
I might just have to check it out.
You should, man. I have to warn you though. It's pretty gory.
Gory like the saw movies?
Kinda. It just messes with your mind.
I can't believe Smith did a movie like that.
Yeah. Especially since he does the Jay and Silent Bob stuff.
Fraking stoner. I love the guy.
Me, too. He's the best
Totally agree.
