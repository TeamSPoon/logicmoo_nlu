what do you think about the theory that rey is obi wan's daughter?
i honestly hate it. it makes no sense
really? he was in hiding for a long time, yo udon't think obi could have found a boo?
no, i don't. i think she's related to the skywalkers
why?
because she's so force sensative!
i guess only a skywalker could move the force that well
exactly! plus, i really want her to be related to kylo ren
why?
because people keep saying they should be together, and that's nasty! let's shut that down
