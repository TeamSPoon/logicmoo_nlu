Have you ever seen the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
The Disney cartoon?  Yeah.
Do you know how old that cartoon was?
Not really, but I know it was older than my parents.
Yeah, it blew me away that it was that old.
I think they probably digitally fixed a lot of things by the time you watched it.
I guess, because it looked old, but not that old.
Yeah, it's amazing what editting can do.
Yeah, I guess so.
A ton of old movies use the same methods.
