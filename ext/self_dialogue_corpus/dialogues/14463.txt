Do you do the whole March Madness thing?
You mean do I try to fill out the brackets?
Well, that, but also do you watch all the games?
No, I like basketball, but that's too many games.  I watch a good amount and check out scores and highlights for others.
Do you have a favorite team?
My alma mater, of course.  College teams change pretty rapidly though.
Yeah, I guess there's a lot of player turnover as they graduate and bring in new talent.
Yup.  You like basketball?
It's okay.  My brother played in high school and I think it ups the tension and excitement when you know someone playing.
Yeah, it does.  Was your brother any good?
Yes, he was.  Won quite a few games, went to state.
Huh, well good for him.
He still plays, you know, pick-up games and with his friends.
He must really like it.
Yeah, he played football and baseball in school, too, but basketball was always his game of choice.
So, he's into March Madness, too, I bet.
Yes, he is.  He will watch games on his phone and honestly I think the screen is just too small to catch everything.
I don't know, with how clear the picture is with phones now, you can see a lot.
Basketball is a lot of very quick action that covers a lot of distance on the court, so I think it needs a bigger screen so you don't miss anything.
You might be right, but sometimes all th matters is who is winning.
