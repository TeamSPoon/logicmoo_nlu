Gaston is my favorite?
Nobody does it like gaston.
True, nobody does, except maybe his effeminate sidekick.
Woah, effeminate? Hes just a nerd is all.
Didn't you see the 2017 live action version?
They remade beauty and the beast?! How could they!
Oh come now, it was great. They made his sidekick totally girly.
Thats uncalled for.
Gaston was great though. Expertly cast.
Well if they did Gaston right, I guess I will have to go check it out.
