Have you see Priscilla Queen of the Desert?
That is such a fun movie. I love the soundtrack.
I can't believe that that guy is Guy Pierce in 1994!
And what about Terrence Stamp? He is always so manly. I can't believe he went drag.
He seemed to really enjoy doing that movie too. He was nothing like that in the Limey!
Well look at Hugo Weaving. Can you believe he was in the Matrix?
You mean Mitzi Del Bra! I think all those guys had the best time doing that film. How could you not?
I know it's so uplifting and the costumes were so great. I'd like to try something like that just for fun!
Did you see Too Wong Foo? I think that as Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo.
Yeah, I saw it. It was pretty good but not as good as Pricilla.
I think it was 1995.
Yeah, Pricilla is a hard act to follow.
I saw John Leguizamo in something recently. He still acts a good bit. Unlike Guy Pierce. Has he done anything lately?
He must be doing a lot of Aussie films now. I haven't seen him in anything since The Hurt Locker in 2009.
Geez was that when that was? What was that about?
That was the war thriller film. Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal  team who are being targeted by insurgents with booby traps, remote control detonations and ambushes.
Oh yeah, I remember that. It was pretty good.
Yeah but not as good as Black Hawk Down.
That was a killer movie.
Yeah, there's a ton of actors who were no bodys at the time and are now huge names, like Tom Hardy.
