Were you a fan of Quiet Riot?
They were okay.
Just okay. Their album Metal Health was great.
It did have a lot of good songs.
They were the first metal rock band to have a top five hit.
Were they?
Yes, in the early eightees.
Didn't know that.
One of the best rock bands of that generation.
I guess they don't get the recognition they deserve.
