I really love Western movies.
I do too.
I think the most classic cowboy was played by John Wayne.
Oh for sure,he was amazing!!
I loved the movie True Grit.
That was excellent.
I saw it in the theater with my parents when I was little.
Yea I did too.
John Wayne played Marshall Rooster Cogburn.
Yes, Mattie Rose was played by Kim Darby.
Yea there were a lot of famous people in that movie.
Glen Campbell was in it and also sang the title song.
Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper were also in it.
It had a really great story line.
And taught you about determination and the meaning of TRUE GRIT.
Yes.
They remade the movie in 2010.
I know, I watched that one as well.
I definitely think the John Wayne version was the best.
True but the newer one was good also!
