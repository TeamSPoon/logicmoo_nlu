Which is you favorite Lethal Weapon movie?
I'd have to say Lethal Weapon 3.
Why's that?
Because it has both Leo Getz, a Martin Riggs love interest just as tough as him, and Riggs in his fun kind of crazy persona.
Okay, but you have to admit Lethal Weapon 2 also had crazy fun Riggs.
True, ture, but then, after Reika's killed and he finds out the South African's killed his wife, he goes all death wish Martin Riggs again.
Yeah, but he's a little like than in number 3 as well.
When?
When he has that crazy happy look on his face, as open's the door of the armored car, so he can wail on the driver.
Yeah, he defintely looks a little psycho when he does that.
