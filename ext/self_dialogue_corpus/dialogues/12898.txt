I think that blasters are way cooler than light sabers.
You've got to be out of your mind! Light sabers are hands down the coolest weapons in the Star Wars universe.
Blasters are long range weapons, you can shoot a guy from across the room with a blaster.
I'll give you that, but close range nothing can beat a light saber.  If someone is right up in your face you don't even have to get the light saber all the way out to be able to disable your enemy.
Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table in the Mos Eisley Cantina from under the table!
Yeah but if he'd had a light saber he could have taken out Greedo and the entire table by just turning it on and flicking his wrist.
Or he could have accidentally sliced his own leg off.
I still agree with Obi Wan in a New Hope when he says that the light saber is a much more elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
Yeah but you have to train for years to use a light saber correctly, all you need is a nobody off the streets to pull a trigger.
Exactly my point! Any idiot can use a blaster, you have to be a real warrior to use a light saber.
