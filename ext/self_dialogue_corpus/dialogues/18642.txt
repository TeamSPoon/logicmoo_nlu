I kind of like ABBA unironically.
Oh we all have those bands that are not guilty guilty pleasures
What's one of yours?
Hall and Oates I love
You're into Yacht Rock?
Not all of it just Hall and Oates.
What's your favorite Hall and Oates song?
Rich girl of course
Yeah that one is a classic
I also private eyes
I like Kanye in that way too
I don't think he's a guilty pleasure
I don't know he can be kind of silly
I love the song he did with Jay-Z
The one with the line about croissants.
Yes that one
I still like Big Pimpin from Jayz
That was my summer jam back in the day
I love summer music
And now we're back to yacht rock.
