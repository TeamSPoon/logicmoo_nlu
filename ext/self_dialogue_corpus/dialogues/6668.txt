Did you go to see the remake of Disney's Beauty and the Beast in the theatre?
Yes I did and I loved it, did you go and see it?
I did too! It was amazing. The girl who played Belle was so good in the role. Do you know her name?
It was Emma Watson. I was shocked at how good her singing voice was.
Same! What was your favorite part of the movie?
I think my favorite part was the remake of the formal dance in the library. It was so romantic.
I loved that part too but my favorite part was when Belle ran through the village singing in the opening scene.
The movie really was great. I love how Disney remakes old movies like that.
Me too, it truly keeps the films classic and timeless for future generations.
I agree. I cannot wait until the next remake!
