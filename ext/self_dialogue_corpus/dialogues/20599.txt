What's up?
I just finished watching My Fellow Americans.
Is that the one with Jack Lemmon and James Gardner?
Sure is
I love that movie. It's so funny.
It is good.  I can't believe I hadn't really heard of it before.
It came out at the end of the year.   It was one of those blink and you miss it.
Even with that cast?
Messed up huh?  Did you know Walter Matthau was supposed to play James Gardner's part?
Really?  No offense but I think James Gardner was the better choice.
Oh, I definitely agree.  I really liked how they made each party look good and bad.
Yeah, that's rare in movies now.  I wonder if Jack Lemmon hadn't died, if they would have made a sequel.
That would have been cool and fun to see.  Both of them working together in the White House.
Oh yeah.  Oh and that guy who played Ralph Flemming who was also in the gay pride parade was so cute.
Yes he was.  It took me a couple minutes to fully realize who he was.
I think that was the point.. makes you think and wonder like the main characters do.
Are you going to buy the movie?
I might if I find it at a good price.
I got it for 5 dollars.
Kewl, where?
