What good movies came out this year?
Let me think.
Sure.
Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Wonder Woman, and The Mummy are a few notable ones.
Nice have you seen any?
Yeah I've seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
Nice should I watch it?
Dude definitely. Have you seen the first movie?
Actually I haven't. Do you need to see the first one the see the second one?
You'll miss a lot. But I suppose you can watch the second one.
Alright, I might consider it.
Actually. The first one is really good. You should just watch it just because it's a good movie.
Alright I'll go rent a DVD of the first movie.
Can I watch it with you? I really like that movie.
Of course. How's Friday night?
Works for me I'll bring popcorn.
Awesome. This has turned into a fun event.
I love watching movies.
I love you.
I love you too.
