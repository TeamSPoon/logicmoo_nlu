There is going to be a fireworks game set to the Beatles' music after the baseball game Friday night.
Really?  I've never really been into them very much.
I know what you mean.  I am having a hard time picturing fireworks going off to their music.
It would be slow.  I guess you could do a set with Hard Day's Night.
True, or Eight Days a Week.
Those are basically the only two I can think of that are a little fast.
The main song i think of when I think of them is Yesterday.
That and Norwegian Wood.
Both of those are just way to slow and a little down.
I may not stay for the fireworks since I'll have to listen to Beatles's music.
