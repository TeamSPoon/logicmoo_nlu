What do you think about Marshawn coming back to play for the Raiders?
I think it's great. Really. Beast mode. I think it's good for the NFL.
Agreed. I just hope he still has his legs. You know, folks saying he's getting older.
Yeah. I can understand that. I guess we'll see. I'm thinking it's good he got a few years rest. Maybe he's still got some juice in him.
Beast mode! I'm just pumped. I think he adds a level of fun to the game that before the NFL has tried to stop.
Yeah. Agreed. I'm just worried things might get out of hand in Oakland.
Oh. I know, right? Those are some sick fans. Still, it's gotta be good for the community. Folks seeing that he came from the city. All that.
Yup. My only real beef with Oakland is that stadium. Man, that place is a dump.
True. It's unfortunate. Even worse. Now they'll be leaving for Vegas. Who can really blame them, though. It's a true dump.
Yeah. You think players will get into trouble in Vegas? I mean, with betting and the lifestyle and all that?
No. Not really anything more than the usual. I bet they'll have some good parties, though. Maybe some better stories about going out to the club.
Ha! Agreed. I think it'll be alright, too.
Hopefully Carr is healthy this year. Just a shame about the injury.
I know. It's too bad. But yeah, things are looking good for the Silver and Black.
Raider Nation!
Ha! A true fan, ay? That's cool. I just want to see them compete. Play hard. All that.
Not me. I want them to push farther than last year at least. It ended up a disappointing season.
I disagree. I think it just show how important it is to have depth. Obvious example, look at Dallas.
True, true. Dak was just ridiculous.
Yup. But I mean, that's why I think it's just key to have depth. Even at QB.
