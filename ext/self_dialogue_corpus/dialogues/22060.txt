I just went to see The Wedding Plan.
What's that?
It's a movie that came out earlier this month.
Oh, I've never heard of it. What's it about?
It's about a woman that cancels her wedding a month before, and another woman takes over the reservation even though she doesn't have a fiance.
Sounds romantic, who's in it?
No one that I recognized.  Noa Kooler and Oz Zehavi.
I've never heard of them before.
I think most of the cast is Jewish.
What did you think of it?
It was really wonderful.  I went to see it expecting your average romantic comedy, but this also had tastes of religious faith, loneliness, and culture.
Wow that sounds great. Who directed it?
Rama Burshtein.  She also wrote it.
It must have been very important to her then.
Yeah I could tell that it was. I really recommend going to see it.
I'll have to convince my boyfriend to go this weekend.  He might enjoy it.
Yeah he might!  There are really strong characters so it's easy to get sucked in.
I'm excited!
Let me know what you think!
I definitely will.
