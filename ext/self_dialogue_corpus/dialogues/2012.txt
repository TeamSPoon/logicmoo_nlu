I've heard folks say the Chicago Bears will be better than expected this year.
No chance they get to eight wins this year, much less make the playoffs or anything.
Their defense is going to be a lot better.
I suppose that's true, their front seven isn't bad. That secondary, though....
Yeah, it's still bad. Better, but still bad. Vic Fangio at the helm, he may work some magic.
Even still, there's only so much they can do. Aaron Rodgers is still in that division, that's going to be two losses right there.
They always play the Packers tough, though.
I hear that every year. That secondary is still going to get torched.
Jordan Howard is still a bright spot. Quarterback isn't going to be that much worse either.
I will admit Jordan Howard could be amazing. He has to stay healthy, though. Speaking of which, is Kyle Long even going to be 100% this year?
No one knows. He never had that surgery. I still think the interior of the line is going to be fine.
Could be. Tackles still a problem. Question marks at wideout, not much talent at tight end.
What, you don't believe in Baby Gronk?
Ridiculous. Even if Shaheen is Gronk, it's going to be a couple years before he gets there. There's not going to be any consistent scoring for this team this year.
Where do you think they are going to end up? I don't see playoffs at all.
As much as I'd like to see three wins and a high draft pick, they are probably still going to win enough to fall out of the top 5 in draft order.
That would be typical, wouldn't it? Not bad enough to totally tank the season, not good enough for the playoffs, either.
That's Bears football for the past 30 years, man.
Can't argue with that. Maybe Trubisky will be a star, though.
He's going to have to be for Pace to keep his job.
