Do you like alternative or grunge rock?
I used to love it! I still do, but it's not around as much.
Yea, I miss the late 90's. Who was your favorite band?
Linkin Park for sure. How about you?
Mine too! What was your favorite album?
Hybrid Theory, you?
Same! They really changed the music game back then.
Yea they did, but they weren't the first grunge band.
Who was it?
I believe Nirvana. They had a unique sound when they first came out.
That's true, there was nothing really like it at the time.
After them there were a lot of copycats.
Yea, but nobody ever really did it better.
No, but Linkin Park modified it and made it better in my opinion.
What do you think about Nickleback?
I think they get a bad rapport but are actually a good alternative/grunge band.
I agree! I don't know why so many people hate them.
Everyone says it's because their music all sounds the same.
That is kind of true.
Yea but, for a band who makes the same songs over and over people still buy their albums and make them go platinum hahaha!
