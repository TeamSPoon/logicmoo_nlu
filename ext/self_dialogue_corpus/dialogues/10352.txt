Okay. Top action move by Arnold Schrwarzenegger?
That's easy. Commando.
All the movies he's done, and you go to Commando?
It's a good story and It's got Alyssa Milano in it.
Whatever. Okay, greatest Bruce Willis action movie?
Easy. No question. Die Hard.
Agreed. Greatest Van Damme action movie?
Uh, been a while since I've seen one. The only one I remember is the one where he's on a train.
Greatest Angelina Jolie action movie?
There are only two real choices. Salt or Lara Croft. Lara Croft wins.
