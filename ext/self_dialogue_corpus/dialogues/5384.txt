What did you think about Disney's Maleficent?
It was beautifully shot, for one thing.  And you?
It had a lot of high points.
Who knew Maleficent started as a fairy?
I ended up feeling sorry for her.
I guess they borrowed aspects from the Sleeping Beauty film.
Like her appearance.
And the backstory.
I was glad they could provide a happy ending.
Most Disney movies end this way.
