Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?
You mean like Phantom Menace and all those? Yeah I like them
They're not my favorite movies. What did you like about them?
Well a lot of the characters they introduced were really cool. I especially like Darth Maul, even though he was only in one movie briefly
I hear they might make an Obi-Wan movie and that Darth Maul will still be alive in it
Really? That would be extremely cool, I'd watch it
Yeah, even though I don't like the prequel movies, I think Ewan McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan
So do I. And I hear he'd like to be in an Obi-Wan movie if they make it
Well now I think they absolutely have to make it! What if Liam Neeson came back as the ghost of Qui-Gon?
That would make it even better! Qui-Gon is such an underrated character in the series
