Do you know who started this whole "superhero" thing?
Well, the comics date to the 1930s. But, I'm not sure about the movies.
It's the "Adventures of Captain Marvel' in 1941.
Wow, that's amazing. The genre was created 75 years ago!
Yes! But, these movies today are nothing like those from the past.
Yes, the special effects in the new Wonder Woman movie were amazing.
Yes, the special effects in the Avengers series are also epic.
I can't wait for the next Superhero movie! I think the special effects will be even better!
What is the next one?
Well, Spiderman is coming out this summer. Let's go check it out together!
