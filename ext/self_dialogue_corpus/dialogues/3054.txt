Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake?
Jaguars, they gotta be getting paid. Of course they're being paid, who would cheer for the Jaguars for free?
Jeff Fisher was fired
I know, he was one loss away from having the all time most losses record
The Cleveland Browns have been eliminated from playoff contention
You know what, it took us 0-11 to get here so the rest of the AFC North should be ashamed of themselves.
StubHub sent me last years playoff tickets.
Contact the stadium and see if they can verify that the ticket number is last year's.
Demaryius Thomas or Dez Bryant? Whose the better 88?
If given the same QB I would take Thomas all day.
Is it ever possible for an NFL team to get as stacked as the Warriors are right now in the NBA?
It's possible, but very unlikely. The top players are worth too much. We have salary caps to prevent stuff like this.
Do Linemen like their quarterbacks?
Only if their name isn't RG3. On a serious note, QBs typically get their lineman pretty nice gifts. Tyrod got his lineman big TVs last season and Flacco got his Oculus Rifts.
Who retired at the right time of their career?
Ray Lewis, Dude essentially bookended his career with Raven SB victories. Great way to end a career.

The Browns, just moved to Cleveland a few years back and absolutely love everything about the City.
What team seems to always find a way to beat your team, no matter the circumstances?
We usually split the series but those damn Rams man.
