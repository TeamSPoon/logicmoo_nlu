My favorite scary movie is still Night Of The Living Dead.
Man was that scary.
I was only fourteen years old when I saw that.
It was all in black and white.
Yes it was.
George Romero directed it.
There wasn't any top actors or actresses in it either.
No there wasn't.
The Walking Dead took from this movie.
It sure did.
