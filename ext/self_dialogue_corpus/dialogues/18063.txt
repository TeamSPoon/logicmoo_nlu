Maroon 5 is such a good band.
Yes, I agree, I think they're so talented.
I just love Adam Levine's voice.
It's so high, but it sounds so good.
I especially love how his speaking voice is so deep.
It's amazing how that works...shocking really.
Well I know Maroon 5 has been around for years.
Yep, early 2000's I think?
That sounds about right, it feels like that long at least.
What songs do you like by them?
Well, I think Wake Up Call will always be good.
Agreed, I love the video to it to.
I also like Harder to Breathe.
Ah, one of their earlier songs.
Yep, I think it's still good.
Well I will always like This Love.
Yes, that's a great song!
A lot of their stuff is just so catchy.
I can't imagine when they'll break up.
Hopefully not for a long time.
