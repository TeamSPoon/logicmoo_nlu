Have you seen The Transporter?
Yes, it is a classic
I really like Jason Statham movies.
He seems to play the same role in each movie
Yea, he is a really good actor when it comes to action movies
He is very tough, I like it.
Being a driver like that seems to be a great fit for him.
He was also good in The Mechanic
Yea, but I liked the original version a bit more
Most originals are way better, but his version was still entertaining.
