So what's the best movie you've seen recently?
That would have to be "Up"!
Up?  I've never heard of that.
Oh, it's great!  It's an animated film and it wasn't hyped up too much, but it was really a gem.
So what is so great about the movie?
Well, it's about this really grouchy old man who loses his wife and he decides to fly his house across the world using a whole bunch of balloons.
What on earth?  That sounds totally weird!
Yeah it is weird, but it's weird in a good way!  He meets this boy along the way who winds up helping him and warming his heart.
Oh, so it's one of those heart-warming movies.
Yes, it totally is!  The old grouchy man gradually softens through the movie and learns about himself.
Well that sounds good.  I prefer a good action movie, personally, but it's nice to watch movies like that sometimes.
Well I hear that.  I do enjoy heart-warming movies, though.
So have you seen any good action movies lately?
Well, I just recently watched the Jason Bourne movies, does that count?
Of course that counts!  Those were great movies.
I know.  I got a little confused with the second and third ones, but I loved the first one.
What confused you about them?
I felt like there were too many characters to keep up with and the plot was too hard to follow.
Yeah, I could see that.  The first one was great though.
Yeah, the first one was amazing.  I'd watch it again for sure.
