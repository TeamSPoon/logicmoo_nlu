I like the Washington Redskins.
They are good.
Have you been to a Super Bowl.
No, but I would love to go.
They were established in 1932.
That's 85 years ago.
They play in FedExField.
That's in Maryland.
Their headquartered in Virginia.
Richmond to be exact.
They began in the EASTERN DIVISION.
In 1950 they joined the AMERICAN CONFERENCE.
Then they joined the EASTERN CONFERENCE.
Now they are part of the NFC east.
They have a cool uniform.
It can be various colors like burgundy, gold or white.
They have a fight song.
Hail to the Redskins.
Let's sing it.
I don't think so.
