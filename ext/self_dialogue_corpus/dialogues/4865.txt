I wonder how the Brewers and Cubs are dong today.
I was checking on the game and noticed it was postponed today.
I know they are playing in Chicago and it was wet and cold yesterday.
I am assuming it was called due to rain today.
I think they had an hour and a half delay yesterday because of weather.
You never know what the weather is going to be like in Chicago this time of the year.
Hopefully they will get a game in tomorrow.
I hope so as the Brewers are hot and they need to keep playing.
Who do you think is the better team, New York Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles?
I think I would put my omney on the Yankees because of their pitching staff.
Who do you think is the best team in the National League?
I still think it is the Cubs but, they need to get out of the funk they are in at present.
I am surprised to see how well the Arizona Diamondbacks are doing early in the season.
I agree but again, it boils down to pitching and they have a great staff.
I hope the Dodgers get playing better as they have a lot of talent that is not playing so well now.
I think they have enough talent to get better and better and win the West.
I would not be surprosed to see Clevel;and back in it in the American League again this year.
Been a long time since they have done much so yes, would be great to see them get back to the series.
I am going to see my first ball game in Miller park in Milwaukee on August 3rd.
Long way to go to see sa game but, I know you are a Brewer fan.
