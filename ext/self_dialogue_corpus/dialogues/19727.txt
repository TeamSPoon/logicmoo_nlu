Let's do a random music discussion.
How's that work?
Open your iTunes to your general library.
Got it.
Now, scroll up and down a bunch of times with your eyes closed. Then, select a song and tell me what it is.
I got "Courante" by Jim Self.
Umm, what is that?
It's a movement for tuba solo.
Can you go again?
No, this was your thing. Now, discuss.
Okay.. what is a courante?
A courante is one of the many movements of a standard Baroque dance suite.
What are the other movements?
Courante, Sarabande, Jig, Bour√©e, air, gavotte, allemande. Sarabande is the most well-known.
So what are the musical characteristics of a Courante? What will I hear if I listen to this?
It's in triple meter, and is very stately and serious.
Triple meter?
That just means three beats, like in "America the Beautiful"
And how is it serious?
There's a big rhythmic emphasis on all of the beats per measure, with some ornamentation between the downbeats. So there's always a grounding.
