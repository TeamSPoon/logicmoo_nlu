What's your favorite battle in Star Wars?
The Battle of Hoth, for sure, in Empire Strikes Back.
Mine was the battle on the forest moon of Endor from Return of the Jedi.
On Hoth, they had the snowspeeders and AT-ATs. It felt very tense and exciting.
The Battle of Endor was the conclusion to the trilogy. And it was very well-acted.
That battle was complicated, though. Hoth was very straightforward.
It wasn't that complicated. Alliance commandos were fighting stormtroopers.
On Hoth, stormtroopers were taking over the Alliance base on Hoth, while the Rebels evacuated.
The snowspeeder fight was interesting to watch, for sure.
My favorite part is using tow cables to destroy the AT-ATs.
