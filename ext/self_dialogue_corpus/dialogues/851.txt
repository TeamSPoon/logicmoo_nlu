The NFL season is almost here, are you going to any games?
No, I don't have a team near me, but I can't wait to watch some of the receivers this year.
There are a lot of amazing receivers to watch this year, I'm looking forward to Odell Beckham Jr.'s performance, he makes some incredible catches.
He does, do you think he will have a better year than Antonio Brown?
I'm not sure, Brown is really good and the Steelers have a good run game that helps avoid double coverage.
I'd guess that Brown has more receiving yards and touchdowns, but I still think some of the best plays of the year will come from Beckham, he is a great athlete.
The Steelers are going to be good again this year, Leveon Bell was impressive last year and he doesn't have any suspensions this year.
I bet you are right, I wonder how good Bell can be receiving out of the backfield, that was really hard to combat on defense last year.
I remember watching Kansas City play them, and they did pretty good, but you are right.  Covering both Brown and Bell is really hard.
I remember that game, Tyreek Hill looked good for Kansas City.
He could break out even more this year.  He is extremely fast.
Also, Kansas City didn't resign Jeremy Maclin, so Hill could get a lot more opportunities.
Then he could go crazy because he did not get a lot of targets last year, and still had some of the best highlights in the game.
Alex Smith will never be a gun slinger, but Hill scores from behind the line of scrimmage, so that may not matter.
What about Tom Brady throwing to Brandon Cooks this year?
That will be devastating.  He will have Gronkowski and Cooks, they will be frustrating teams once again.
If I had to pick, I think Brown, then Beckham, then Cooks, then Hill for most touchdowns this year, in that order.
I like that list, I think we are missing someone though.
Who is that?
Dez Bryant, he could have the most of anyone on that team with such a great offense.
