Wow, I'm going through a such music dry spell. Haven't liked any of the new stuff I've listened to.
That happens to me sometimes, I feel that. Sometimes even my favorite old music I can't listen to occasionally.
Yeah, it's like I'm either bored of everything I used to listen to and underwhelmed by all the new stuff that's coming out.
I feel like it's just this time of year. There are going to be a bunch of releases in the next couple months that I'm excited for, but it's pretty slow right now.
Like what?
I'm so excited for the new Fleet Foxes record, and the new Arcade Fire. Plus, Vince Staples is coming out with something. Gonna be a great year.
I don't listen to much of that kind of stuff, but maybe I'll give it a shot.
What's your favorite genre right now?
I'd been listening to a lot of electronic stuff, but I think I really tired myself out.
You just need to change genres completely for awhile. I can give you some great folk-y recommendations.
Nah, thanks, but I'm not a huge folk fan. If anything I want to get into more hip hop.
Have you listened to Kendrick's new album?
No, actually. I was meaning to, but I heard people were underwhelmed by it.
What? No, it was incredible. You should definitely give it a try.
Well, maybe... I don't know.
Literally no other rapper right now is putting out music of this caliber. I swear.
All right, all right. I'll listen.
When it dropped I didn't listen to anything else for five days.
I hope that happens for me. I really need that right now.
Let me know how it goes!
