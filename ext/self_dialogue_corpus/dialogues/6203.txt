Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
No I haven't seen it but I don't think it's going to be as good as the original.
The remakes never are. Plus it's live action so there's only so much they can do.
That's true. I love Emma Watson though, ever since Harry Potter.
Oh everyone loved her as Hermione. But she's done a pretty good job of getting awa y from that typecast.
You're right, have you seen her in This is the End?
The one with Seth Rogen and James Franco? Yeah that was funny.
I guess I'll take my kids to see Beauty and the Beast. I'm waiting for The Little Mermaid live action.
I think it's coming out next year if I'm not mistaken.
Now that's my personal favorite Disney movie of all time. Part of Your World is a beautiful song.
