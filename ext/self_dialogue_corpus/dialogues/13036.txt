What about Luke Skywalker, as an action hero?
Well, he's great.
I like him a lot, as someone we viewers can relate to.
Especially in the first movie, as this kind of bored kid who wonders what's out there in the world for him.
Kind of like a male Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, do you think?
I like that idea!
Another interesting thing about Luke is the idea that he is the one we are more like, while Han Solo is the one we want to be like.
Yeah, and can never be, because he's so impossibly cool!
But Luke changes and grows the most across all the movies, I think.
Yes, by the time we meet him in Return of the Jedi, you can tell he's gone through a pretty intense series of experiences!
