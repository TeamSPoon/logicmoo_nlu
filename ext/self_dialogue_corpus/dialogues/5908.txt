I can never watch The Fox and the Hound ever again.
Did you watch it recently?
Yeah, I watched it yesterday.
Why can't you ever watch it again?
I forgot how sad it was.
What part is sad?
First off, when Tod's mom dies.
Oh, I remember that. It's awful!
Also, when Tod's owner leaves him in the forest. I bawled my eyes out.
I probably shouldn't watch that movie anytime soon! I'm not up for a sad movie like that.
