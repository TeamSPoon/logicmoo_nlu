I am really drawn to alternative christian rock. What do you think about it?
I'e heard a little seems cool. could you give me a few band names?
Skillet is a great band very powerful!
Oh yeah, I will have to check them out.
what genre do you prefer.
Well, alternative rock, not necessarily Christian. Funny, even alternative is breaking into its own genres itself.
I guess that is the way of music.Name a band that you prefer.
I really like imagine Dragons.
Oh wow, that is very close to what I like. Perhaps  we should expand our horizons!
OK! will try to explore more alternative music if you do too.
Ha ha, we can start with alternative.
Cage the elephant?
Cage the elephant is awesome!
Yes its still in our little box.
Acapella Alternative?
Yes we really should check that out! OK we have an assignment!
Neat, the next time we meet we can talk about Acapello! and Indie or whatever really I just love music!
Me too but my brain must go inch by inch, Music is so large of a subject.
I am actually in the church Choir, I have a goal to get them singing much newer songs. I will be recommending to them.
I want to start an alternative band so this is great! See you next time.
