Pittsburgh is my squad, dude...
Man call me when they actually do something.
What do you mean though? Six rings, man...
You guys always bring that up!
Yup, and we will always bring it up!
Like, when did they win it last? When I was a baby!
So? THey won though...
Whatever...stop living in the past.
Never. I will always represent.
But they can't beat the Patriots though
They will...and when they do everyone be quiet....
LOL. The Patriots always beat them. Ben is done as aQB.
Wait a minute, wait. a. minute. How are those Eagles doing?
Do't worry about them. They'll be alright.
LOL. No they won't. No they will not.
Didn't they beat the Steelers last year?
They got lucky. Besides, what did they do last year? Nothing
Nothing except beat your Steelers! LOL
It's ok...payback is a mother this year.
We'll see..
