How much do you like Bob Dylan.
He's alright, cool guy.
So you like his music then?
I really do. He's had a long and productive career.
More successful than most musicians, you might say.
He's quite the poet too. Kind of quirky.
Which songs of his do you like best?
"Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"
He's really well known for those.  He's got other facets too.
Yeah I guess he's pretty complicated.
His musicianship played a big role in American music.
In what way?
He's thought of as one of the most influential contemporary musical figures.
Wow that's saying a lot.
And you might recall that last year he received the Nobel Prize.
That's quite an artistic legacy.
For someone with humble beginnings, he achieved a lot.
His music is what I like best about him.
Ever go to his concerts?
Once.  It was low key and he gave lots of stage credits to his band.
