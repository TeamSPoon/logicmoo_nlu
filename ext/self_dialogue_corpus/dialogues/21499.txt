Have you seen any good Sci-Fi movies lately?
I have! I went to see Alien: Covenant the other day!
Oh really? Who directed that movie?
The famous Ridley Scott!
Wow he directed that? No wonder it's so good.
Yea, many people loved it. The reviews were raving, especially in the China Box office!
Are you serious? How much did it gross there?
It grossed 30M on its debut.  I can't believe it either.
That's really amazing.  I heard they're comparing it to the X-Men Apocalypse.
I would have to agree! It was that good.
I think that Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup did a really great job.
Yea, it really takes the right actors to make that movie great.
I agree.  Michael Fassbender did wonderful too as David!
He did fantastic. He was the synthetic survivor and so interesting.
I think it's even better than the original Alien!
The one with Sigourney Weaver??
Yes, that one!
I'm not sure about that! The original is always the best.
Haha, whatever you say!
It's true! I love the original.
