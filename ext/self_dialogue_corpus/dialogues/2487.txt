Are you ready for NFL?
Yes. Favorite time of the year.
Mine as well.
Who do you like?
I like the colts how about you.
I like the Patriots.
I hope they di good this year.
They always do,
I think that another team will take the superbowl though.
I think the Patriots will still get there.
I think they will to but I hope someone else wins.
Really?
Yeah someone else deserves to win.
I think that also but Patriots are good.
Tom Brady has gotten helped along the way too.
What do you mean.
People cheat and get away with it.
He accepted his punishment.
Correct but it was not a good one.
That is the NFL for you.
