Are you excited about football season?
Yes, and it is quickly approaching!
It sure is; the NFL can not get here fast enough in my opinion!
Football fans can not stand to go a long time without watching the game we love!
Speaking of football, which position do you feel is the hardest to play?
Are you talking about in terms of physically or mentally?
You can use any criteria; just what position do you think is the toughest to perform at a high level at?
That is a really tough question!
I think I would say that quarterback is the toughest to play.
Would you say that because of all the hits that they take?
Not really; I just feel that having to know so much verbiage would be really difficult.
That combined with having to process so much mentally would be challenging.
Would you agree with me then?
Actually, I feel that playing cornerback would be the toughest position to play.
That is interesting. Why do you say that?
Well, with so many great, athletic receivers out there today; I just can not imagine keeping up with them.
Especially having to cover certain guys one on one for the length of the field.
Exactly! Can you imagine trying to cover Julio Jones all by yourself?
Well, often times those guys get help from their safeties with the big time receivers.
That is true, but there are normally several plays each game when they are all by themselves!
