Who were the Golden Glove winnders on the Giants for 2016?
They got THREE!  Buster Posey (catcher), Joe Panik (second base) and Brandon Crawford (shortstop).
Is Brandon Crawford off the DL?
Yes, he's back.  He was gone for a while because of bereavement leave for his sister-in-law.  He injured himself right around the same time.  But he's back.
Are there any other Giants on the DL right now?
The Giants have been having a lot of back luck with this.  Madison Bumgarner of course.  But he should be back in June.
Anyone else?
Yes, Mark Melancon, their new closer, has a right pronator strain.  He just returned and saved the game against the Cardinals on May 19.
Michael Morse is back, too.  In his first at-bat of 2017, he hit a home run off of Pedro Baez of the Dodgers.
He was pinch hitting.  Good to see him back.
Nunez is a base-stealing king.  How many bases has he stolen so far this 2017 season?
He's stolen eleven so far.  He has a career number of 116.  Can't turn your back on him.
I don't understand something.  What is the "infield fly rule"?
Wikipedia defines it this way:  "The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. "
So if the defense doesn't catch the ball, it doesn't matter?
Kind of.  It's up to the umpire.  He has to make a determination based on what he thinks is the "ordinary effort" to catch the ball.
So if, say, a short-stop should catch a batted ball easily but he lets it slip through his mitt, the umpire can invoke the rule because the short stop should've caught the fly ball?
It's up to the umpire's discretion.  It's why they're trained and go to umpire school, I guess.  Makes sense.
Well, what's "ordinary effort"?  Is there some criterion or is it just whether the umpire is having a lousy day?
No, there are criteria.  Like weather, lighting, abilities of the player(s) involved, etc.  It's not as arbitrary as it might sound.
