Have you seen the movie "Bridesmaids?"
Yes, it's one of my favorite comedies.
I saw it recently, and I really enjoyed Kristen Wiig.  I have seen her on Saturday Night Live before, but I had never seen her in a movie.
I think she may have had something to do with the writing of Bridesmaids.
I think so too.  The airplane scene is priceless.  "Help me, I'm poor."  That was so funny.
And you just can't beat Melissa McCarthy as the groom's sister.
Did you know that McCarthy's real life husband is in the movie?  I think he often has parts in her movies.
No!  Which character did he play?
He was the air marshall on the airplane; the one McCarthy's character interacted with.
Oh. That is so cool.  They were really funny together.
