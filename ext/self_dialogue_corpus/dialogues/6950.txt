Did you like the lion king?
Yes I thought it was great
The story of Simba was a sad one.
I thought when he discovered his father
That it was the greatest thing ever?
Well great in that it really pulled at your heart.
Yeah I agree with that.
I just think it was a great animated acting scene.
It was one of their bests.
I like that they rarely do sequels.
