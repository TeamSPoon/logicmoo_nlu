Did you watch the Braves play St. Louis the other day?
I started to but stopped watching after it got to 7 to 0. Did you see the final score?
No, but I saw that it was something ungodly, like 12 to nothing.
I bet you're regretting buying those tickets for you and your dad later this month.
Yeah, I actually had tickets to that blowout they just had but I'm glad I didn't.
Yeah I bet, did you get tickets for parking yet?
No, but I need to. I heard with this new stadium that it's very hard to get parking because they fill up so soon.
Yeah it does, and depending on where you park it can really suck trying to get to the stadium.
Man, the only thing worth watching now is Freeman.
Isn't he like in the top 5 in a few different categories?
Yeah he is and I think they said he's hitting at like .430 or somewhere around that.
Too bad no one else seems to be able to do anything.
It looked like things were starting to get better, especially when they were playing at home but it's just gone downhill.
Yeah you would think that with this move that there would be some motivation to play well but I guess not.
Yeah, kind of ironic that they built this new stadium to be closer to the majority of their fans and yet, they are playing so poorly. If that causes less people to show up it will be kind of funny.
Like they made that move for nothing.
Exactly!
So who are they playing when you go with your Dad?
The Nationals.
Oh good lord that's gonna suck. We're gonna get killed!
