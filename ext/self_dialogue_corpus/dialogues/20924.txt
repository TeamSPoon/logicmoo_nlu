I'm going to the movies this weekend with my son
Oh? what are you seeing?
We were thinking of seeing the new Cars 3D movie or maybe Dispicable me
Is everything playing right now a sequel?
Seems like it - there's also another Pirates of the Carribean and Transformers!
I don't go much. Last I saw was at home and it was about Benghazi. That was well done, but pretty horrible
Didn't that have the guy from the office? How did he do?
Surprisingly well, actually. His name is John Krasinski.
I think he mostly does comedies, though.
What I really want to see is the new Wonder Woman. It's supposed to be amazing.
It was. I loved it even though Lynda Carter will always be my Wonder Woman!
How did you like Captain Kirk in as the guy?
He was fine - it's like his thing. I think your kids are too young to see it, unfortunately.
Anything you can recommend for them since you see a bunch of movies?
I haven't seen it, but there's a Captain Underpants movie
Those books are hilarous. We're reading them and we're up to the 7th
the movie has Professor Poopypants and everything
Sounds fun
Maybe you should also see the new cars?
They've seen the other two on DVD from the library so that would be great
