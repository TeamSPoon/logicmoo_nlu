I think the remake of Dawn of the Dead is better than the original.
Whoa there you're stepping on the toes of holy ground there.
I just think they captured the overall vibe of being stuck inside of the mall better.
I can agree that the remake is a great movie but I'm not sure it's better than the original.
It's one of Zack Snyder's best films.
Yeah but that's not that hard to do, the bar is set low.
Oh come on, he isn't that bad.
True, I actually thought The Watchmen was a really good adaptation.
Exactly, people are on his case because of Batman v. Superman but that was doomed no matter what.
Yeah DC in general just don't have their stuff together when it comes to their cinematic universe.
It's a stretch to try and capture the success is Marvel is having and it's just rushed and poorly executed.
Yeah there's no firm vision for their cinematic universe.
Exactly, Marvel has their hands all over their cinematic universe and there's a vision, a way forward.
The way the Marvel Cinematic Universe has panned out really is somewhat of a miracle.
Yeah, and the fact that each one is still making bank is impressive.
People expected the super hero fatigue but we haven't seen a hint of it yet.
That's because you can't get fatigued on fun movies, super hero or non super hero.
I'm curious what Marvel's next move will be when they eventually conclude the arcs in the cinematic universe.
If the money is still rolling in then I can see them going for awhile after with a second arc.
That's true, guess we will see if the TV shows and the movies clash.
