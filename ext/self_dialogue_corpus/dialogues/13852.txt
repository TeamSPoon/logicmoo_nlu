What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I love her! I think she's so progressive and distinct and her music is a good role model for young girls.
Great, because someone gave me some of her music and I don't want it. You can have it.
What, you don't like her?
I'm not a fan. All her music sounds the same and it's so one-dimensional to me.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear you say that.
It's all good, she's just not my personal taste.
Well I would love to take whatever you've got off your hands.
Great! I'll bring you the albums next time I see you.
I can't wait!
