When will the Cardinals win a title?
I am not sure
They should have won it a few years ago
That was a great game
Yes it was
I forget who the other team was though
It was the Steeler
Oh, they are good.
They have a good coach
He has been there a long time
I like their defense
They have a strong defense and a good offensive line
I hope they play again in the Super Bowl
That would be cool
The NFC is tough this year though
I agree. The Cowboys are great
Do you think they can win it?
I think they can get to the finals
Then who will beat them?
The Patriots
