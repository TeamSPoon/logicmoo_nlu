I hear that Ezekiel Elliot is ready to up his game this season.
That's scary. He is a beast.
Yeah, between him and Dak things are looking good for the Cowboys.
I think they'll be in the Superbowl this year.
Yeah, hard to see New England repeating but then again I said that last y ear.
Tom Brady still gets it done.
Crazy to think that the Pats did it in spite of all the injuries.
They just plug whoever into Belichik's system.
I think things get a lot tougher for the Falcons this year.
Yeah, they benefited from an easy schedule last season.
Who else do you see challenging?
Maybe Seattle?
Houston is an interesting team.  They have most of the parts
That's been true for Houston for several years though.
Who else do you think cou ld surprise?
My real dark horse is Miami, they just need to find a way to move the chains on offense.
I could see the Raiders breaking out this year.
True, solid team at every position.
Who falls off the most this year?
I think Denver continues to slide.
