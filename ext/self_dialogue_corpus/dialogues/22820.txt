So me and my girlfriend just went to see the new Star Wars movie
What you actually got your girlfriend watch that with you
Yeah my girl is kind of Star Wars geek
What Star Wars did you watch was it the new one Rogue one
Yep that's the one we seen did you see it already
Yeah actually saw it awhile ago back online
Oh so you damn watching it in theaters
No I didn't feel like watching that when the theaters
But why action movies are so much better than theaters
I know but I see most of the Star Wars one and I heard Rogue one wasn't that good
Who's pretty good it's just the story follows the one girl around Rogue one
Yeah I know I seen some pretty good fight scenes in there but other than that it was pretty bad
Oh yeah what fight scenes that you like
I like the fight scene with the blind guy fighting off the Imperial guards
I know that scene was so hot like you can hear or see the bullets coming knocking away with stick
Oh you know what other scene I like that fight scene where the snipers on top of the roof in the Jedi was knocking the bullets out the way
Yeah that fight scene was good as well have you seen the first Star Wars like the really old one
I've seen every Star Wars out there
What about your girlfriend has she seen every Star Wars
Like I said we both some Star Wars freaks we seen them all
