Wiil Marvin Lewis coach the Bengals next year?
Yup...as long as he has a contract
What do you mean?
Mike Brow does not like to get rid of coaches while on contract
I see...but they have not won a playof game since the 90s,right?
Doesn't matter. Mike Brown does not pay coaches not to coach.
So you guys are stuck with him then
Yes,..sigh
So who should they hire?
Urban Meyer
Nope. Not leaving Ohio State.
True. One can dream though
There has got to be a up and coming coordinator out there some where
Well when you find him, let me know
So how many games do you think the Bungles will when?
Five, and that is being hopeful
Two of them will be against Cleveland...
LOL....yup
God Bless the Cincinnati Bengals
Don't think God can help them
