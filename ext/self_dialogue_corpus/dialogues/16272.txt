I was just listening to the Counting Crows. Man, I love them!
I do too. I don't know what I like better August and Everything , Recovering Satellites, or The Desert Life.
Eek, I couldn't pick if I had to...Long December makes me so sad and nostalgic.
Yeah, that music makes me think of California.
I really like Recovering Satellites. But I can't believe it was 1996!
It does not sound dated at all. I can't believe it either.
Daylight Fading is really good. I also like Goodnight Elisabeth.
Yeah, the are such a great band. i haven't listened to much of the new stuff. Have you?
I see stuff of them 2012, 2013, 2014....I haven't heard any of that!
No, you're kidding me!
Yeah, I think Hard Candy was the last time I even checked in on them.
Dude that was 2002!
I know! I think I have been living under a rock. Streaming stuff on Pandora...apparently I need to live a little.
I'm not any better than you. That's a good find. Now I'll have stuff to go look for and stream.
Yeah, I just can't believe it. There is a lot of stuff out there.
Yeah, but there is a lot I am not loving.
I know what you mean. I think that's why I listen to mostly the same stuff.
Me too unless I catch something on a show or in a movie.
There is some really good music attached to shows.
Yeah, I know. All you have to say Nick Cage on Peaky Blinders.
