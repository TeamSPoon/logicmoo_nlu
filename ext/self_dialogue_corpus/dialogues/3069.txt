Hey man, you ready for the NFL to start.
Oh yeah, I got a feeling my Raiders are gonna go all the way!
LOL what makes you say that?
David Carr is the truth!
He sure signed a deal like he was the truth.
Yeah isn't he the highest paid player in the NFL right now?
I think so. About 25 million a year.
When you have a good quarterback like that, you have to lock him up though.
Yeah, even if you land a decent quarterback, you have to lock him up.
You're right about that, kind of like Andy Dalton in Cinci.
Exactly like Dalton.
That's the biggest curse an NFL team could have.  Landing a "decent" NFL quarterback. Because you still have to pay him big bucks.
Yeah, and once you pay him the big bucks, there's no money left for support players.
Look at the Seahawks, they were great when Russell was new and only getting like 500k a year.
Right, because they were able to spend money elsewhere, on support players.
Yeah it's hard to keep a good roster together when you're paying one player a ton of money.
Yeah but the Raiders will still be really good this year.
I'll agree with you on that, they still have a good line and a decent defense, but they're paying a few players too much.
Marshawn joining them is gonna be huge for this year though.
Agreed, after that though they'll probably gonna fall apart as they lose key players to free agency from not being able to pay them.
