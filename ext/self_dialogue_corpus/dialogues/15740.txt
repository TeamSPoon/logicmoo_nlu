I found a new group, (new to me at least) that I like. Kaleo. Ever heard of them?
I think so. My dad was talking about them the other day. What do they sing?
I really like "No Good". I heard it in Pound class, that's what got me interested in them.
Where are they from?
From Iceland actually.
Interesting! Are they like a boy band?
lol, they are boys and they are a band but their music is more a rock and folk type mix.
That sounds cool. Kinda like Imagine Dragons? I like them.
Maybe a little. I like Imagine Dragons too. Have you heard "Believe"?
Yeah, that's a good one. I'd love to see them in concert.
Another one I was suprised about is that new song by Harry Styles.
Oh, "sign of the times"...I LOVE that one.
Yeah, it's suprisingly good!
What band was it that he was in?
Maybe One Direction? I'm not sure... one of them...
Oh yes, and I really like their song "Night Change"
yes, another good one.
Even Justin Beiber has been suprising me lately.
Yeah, he's released some pretty good ones.
I know right, I can't believe I'm even saying that.
