Did you ever see Carpool Guy?
No I don't think I have seen that one.
It was a good movie it was a lot of soap stars.
Corbin Bersen was in it.
Do you like him.
Yes I like him.
Jeanne Cooper was also in it. She passed away since the movie.
I didn't know she passed away.
Jeanne Cooper was Corbin's mom in real life.
Do you ever see Non Stop?
Yes I liked that one.
I like Julianne Moore.
Yeah she is pretty cool.
That movie is scary to me because I have never been on a plane.
Really you have never been on a plane?
No. I haven't. Super scared.
Nothing to be scared off. But if you go on one don't watch any scary plane movies before you go.
No I wouldn't.
I wouldn't watch Non Stop.
Yes that one was too scary.
