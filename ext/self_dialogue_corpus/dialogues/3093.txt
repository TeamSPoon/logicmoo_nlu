Man every year when the Superbowl ends I get depressed, no NFL football for months
I know, I like MLB and NBA but I still spend most time reading about off season NFL Moves
Who do you think did the best in the draft this year?
I don't know I like Houston picking up DeSean Watson from Clemson and the Browns added a lot of depth too
You planning on going to any games this year?
No I have kids so NFL Sunday ticket at home for me.  Do you get it with your cable package?
Yes I do, I have the NFL channel on all year, annoys the heck out of my wife, LOL
Yeah I watch quite a bit too.  Have you ever been to NFL hall of fame in Canton?
No I havent but I'm dying to go one day.  Favorite team of all time?
Of course the 85 Bears best defense and best coach of all time.
Yeah Maybe maybe, but the Pats under Brady and Belichek are sure giving them a run for their money, maybe surpassed them.
I guess thats true, I just remember watching that Bears team as a kid and it seemed like they could beat anybody
You think any team will pick up Kaepernick?
Probably not.  Sucks for him cause it seems like he still has some good talent but he sorta ruined it for himself with the protest thing
Do you play NFL Madden?
I used to quite a bit, but since I have kids now its a lot tougher but I miss it.  I grew up playing Tecmo Bowl for NES
Do you like the new NFL uniforms?  If you watch classic films they look so modern compared to those old bulky shirts they used to wear
Yeah everything seems so aerodynamic to maximize performance
Okay last question, you go to a game with your buddies, whats the ultimate tailgate meal?
Hmmm great question I'd say cold beer, and brats right off of the grill
