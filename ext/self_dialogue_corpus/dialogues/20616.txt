Have you seen any good movies recently?
Yes, we rented Deep Water Horizon.
Is that the one about the BP oil spill.
Yes.
Who is in that movie again.
The lead actor is Mark Wahlberg.
Oh yes that is right.
The movie was very interesting.
Do you think it followed the real life events pretty closely?
Yes I do.  After the movie was over I did some research and it was quite accurate.
That is neat.
I like when movies follow real events.
Me too.
I think you will really enjoy this movie then.
I will need to pick it up and watch it.
You should.  I think it will keep you interested the whole time.
That is good.  If you had to rate it from one to ten what would you give the movie?
I would give it an eight or so.
Well, it must be pretty good then.
You need to see it for sure.
