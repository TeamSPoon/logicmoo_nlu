Hey you. I saw you just watched Half-Blood Prince.
Yes I did indeed. That certainly was an interesting one.
Yeah. I like it on it's own, but when compared to the whole series, it doesn't really make sense.
I agree. Though there definitely were some laugh out loud parts.
The entire Felix Felices part was hilarious. Harry was making me laugh so hard.
"By all means sir, come along!"
The part with Aragog dead and Harry says people are scared of it because of the pincers. His hand movements killed me!
Yeah. I am a pretty hard Hermione and Ron fan, so I did like the parts that put that at the forefront.
Some of that was pretty silly though. I mean, Hermione with those fake birds? What in the world was that?
Yeah that made me laugh too because it was so ridiculous.
