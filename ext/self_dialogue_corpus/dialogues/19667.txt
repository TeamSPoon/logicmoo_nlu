Guess what album I just received as a gift!
An album?  As in a cd?
Yes.  I still love to collect cd's so I can hear the music that isn't being played on the radio or online.
I guess that's true.  So who is it?
The latest Bruno Mars release.  24k Magic.
Oh! I like him.  He has a great voice.
Yes he does.  He is so talented.  This album has a very "retro" feel to it.
Retro? Like disco?
Nope.  Like funk, r&b, 90's hip hop.
Really? That sounds like fun.
It is.  There are a couple of tracks that made me laugh the first time I heard them.
But the music is good?
Sure, it has that first release "24k magic", and now that other song is out "That's What I like."
Are those your favorite on the album?
No. Not even close.  There is a track called "Chunky."  I love it.
That sounds funny.  I may have to borrow it from you.
Fat chance, maybe I'll go oldschool and burn you a copy.
That would be great.  Are there any ballads that show off his pipes?
You know there is.  He's really talented.  I hope he has a nice long career.
Me too.  All he has to do is stay healthy!
