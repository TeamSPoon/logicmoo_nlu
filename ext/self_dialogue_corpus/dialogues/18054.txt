I am looking for some new classical music can you help me find some?
Sure! What have you previously been listening to?
All the standard people Beethoven, Mozart, etc.
Well did you like what you have been listening to?
Yeah for the most part but it gets repetitive after a while.
I know what you mean. Well first I would suggest digging into the composers you know and listen to some of the lesser known works.
How would I do that?
Search Youtube. The related video section will take you deep into some composers works.
Ok that sounds good. Do yo have any artist specifically that you recommend.
My favorite is Debussy!
That name sounds familiar what's his most know piece?
Arabesque Number One
That sounds exotic. What's it like?
Debussy's music is very beautiful. Soft and warm.
I like the sound of that. What album should I listen to by him?
He doesn't have albums silly. I would start by searching for his greatest hits on Youtube and start from there.
Ok, that's a start. Who else would you recommend?
Another great composer is Erik Satie
What's his music like?
It is very soft and melodic. The perfect music to relax to.
