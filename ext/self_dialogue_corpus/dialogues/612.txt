The NFL season is in two months.
Technically a month if you include preseason
That's true. I'm even more excited then.
It usually isn't that fun to watch, but I'll take anything
Yeah, I'll watch all of the games for my team regardless.
It's cool to see who makes it and doesn't after all the cuts.
Who is your team by the way?
I'm a Browns fan.
I feel your pain as I am a Jets fan.
We can yell at our televisions together.
How are you feeling about the Browns this season
I am not really expecting too much, but our draft was pretty solid and we didn't reach this time.
Yeah, I saw they took an entirely different approach.
We got a long way to go, but that is the right way to build a team.
The Jets definitely are going to be a bottom three team this year.
It's a shame, because they were just in the AFC Title game two consecutive years in a row with Sanchez at the helm.
We had such a good looking team, despite a mediocre quarterback and the wheels just fell off suddenly
Our wheels have seemed to have been off for some time now in regard to the Browns.
I am getting stoked just thinking about the season, despite the likely outcome
So am I! Is it opening season yet?
