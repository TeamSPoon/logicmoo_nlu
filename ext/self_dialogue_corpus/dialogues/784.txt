Is J.J Watt the greatest defensive player of all time?
At only 28 years old it is hard to say he is the greatest of all time.
He is a great player regardless.
I agree with you on that.
He didn't have great numbers in 2016 however.
Yeah he must be looking forward to improving this year.
I know I would want to put up some great numbers following a season like that.
He needs to get back to his 2014 mentality when he had nearly 21 sacks!
That was a great year for him.
Is he enough for the Texans to see success?
Can I be honest with you?
Yeah sure you can.
I don't know why the Texans didn't draft Manziel.
I totally agree with you!
He played so well for Texas A&M maybe he would have done well with a Texas team.
He just didn't fit well in Cleveland.
Yeah I wonder if he will ever be back in the NFL.
It can go either way honestly.
Hopefully we see him on a roster again soon.
Yeah he was amazing in college.
