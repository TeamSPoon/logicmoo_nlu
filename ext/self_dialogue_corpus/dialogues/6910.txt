Ever notice that Disney movies have a real thing for orphans?
You know, I think I heard someone else mention that before...
Yeah, seriously, about every films centers around someone who's an orphan.
Or will be an orphan, a la The Lion King or Frozen.
Yeah, that's trues.
I think most of it goes back to the fact a lot of the movies are based on old fairy tales and stuff, lots of orphans there.
Yeah, I mean, you got Aladdin, no mom and no dad.
Well, actually, his dad shows up in the third movie.
Oh, really?  Actually, I didn't see that one...
Yeah, he turns out to be like the king of all thieves or something... been a few years.
