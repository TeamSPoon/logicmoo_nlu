Are you a fan of X-Men movies?
I think they're okay. I haven't seen all of them.
Which ones have you seen?
I know I saw Logan. I also saw one or two a few years back.
What did you think of Logan?
I thought it was pretty good. What did you think?
I thought it was a terrific way for Hugh Jackman to part with the series.
I wonder if Patrick Stewart will be involved with the movies anymore.
I think he might be done with the movies as well, but I'm not sure.
Wasn't it sad to see him looking so frail?
Yes! I know he's an older actor, but they really made him look weak!
I'll always think of him as the might Captain Picard from Star Trek.
I'm a fan of the Star Trek movies as well. Have you seen all of them?
I don't know. I just remember seeing him in a couple of movies back around 2000.
That was probably Nemesis or Insurrection.
When did they come out?
Insurrection came out in 1998. Nemesis came out in 2002.
Okay. I think I may have seen both of those.
I thought they were okay. They weren't really as good as the original Star Trek movies in my opinion.
I agree. Nobody can replace Captain Kirk!
