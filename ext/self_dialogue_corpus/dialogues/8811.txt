I swear Tool is the best band ever.
They are very good.
I always go back to listen to them and I'm always surprised.
The whole band is talented.
Yeah even their bass-lines are amazing.
Maynard has a crazy voice too.
He does. Their music videos used to scare me when I was little.
They were a little creepy.
I'm surprised that more people don't try to copy their sound.
I think they're so good, it would be hard to match.
