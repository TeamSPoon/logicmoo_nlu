What ever happen to that Stallone movie Demolition Man?
What movie?
You know, the movie where Stallone got put into cryo-sleep for a crime he didn't commit.
The one with Wesley Snipes?
Yeah, that's the one!
Oh, I love that movie!
How cool was that old Buick 442?!!
That car was awesome.  Way cooler than the future cars.
Don't forget the "three sea shells"!!
Haha!  What's the three sea shells?
I always wished the movie told us what they were!!
I guess some things we will never know.
It's too bad.  I wish they'd make a sequel and tell us.
You think they would.  They remake everything these days.
Just look at Bladerunner...
I hope they don't ruin it like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.
Oh, don't get me started on that!!
You and me both.  Terrible!
Well, maybe they'll do a good job.
I think they will.  The previews look good.
