Have you ever seen Misery?
Is that a newer movie?
No, it was probably from the 90s?
Oh, what was it about?
Well, a writer gets in a wreck in a desolate area.  One of his biggest fans takes him in, but she's crazy.
Doesn't anyone realize he's gone?
Well, the police come to ask about him, but she kills them.
Oh, she's really crazy!
Yeah, it's a pretty good movie.
I might need to look into it.
