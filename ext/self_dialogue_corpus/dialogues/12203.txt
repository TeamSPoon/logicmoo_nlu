Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I watched that a couple weeks ago.
My family didn't like it, but I thought it was one of the best Star Wars films ever.
I agree. I think it was better suited for people who have a deep understanding of Star Wars.
I liked that it was toned down. Everyone wasn't all powerful
That's true. There were a lot of normal characters with no force powers that still played a big part.
It showcased what kind of sacrifice even one small task could take.
I personally liked how well it flowed into the storyline of the other movies.
Yeah, the ending sections of the movie had me in awe because of that.
Me too. It made me want to go back and watch the classic movies.
