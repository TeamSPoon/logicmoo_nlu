What is America's favorite pass time?
Baseball of course!
It's always good to go out and see a game, what's your favorite team?
Probably the KC royals.
Oh yeah? They were champions in what, 2015?
Yeah. They did really well that year. The year of the MOOSE!
Haha, yeah. All the chanting.
They haven't done as great, but they are still a solid team.
And really, staying loyal is what keeps teams like that solid.
True, not every year is going to be a championship.
Speaking of which, seems the curse is broken on the Cubs!
Yeah go Chicago! That was so close!
That was intense, really. Indians were so close to taking it home.
Cubs really deserved it though. Over a century and there it was.
I've a friend that is an Indian's fan, and she was not pleased in the least.
Oh, that's too bad. I was really rooting for the cubs myself.
I think people would still go to the games forever, it's just tradition.
It would be worth it forever! Having a home team that is close to your heart.
I think I'm ready for the next game now!
Go Royals!
