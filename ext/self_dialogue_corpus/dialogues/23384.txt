What's the oldest movie you've ever seen?
That would be the awful Birth of a Nation.
I don't know it, what's it about?
Not the settling of America or the civil war, as you'd expect.
Weird.
Yeah it's basically the history of racism from a KKK-is-good point of view.
Wait...what?
Yeah, the heroes at one point are the KKK members running in on their horses. Also, blackface.
That's crazy.
Yeah, people aren't subtle. How about you?
Citizen Kane.
What did you think of it?
It was a bit boring as I don't follow black-and-white movies.
Why not?
If they look old, I'm unintersted.
Did you like it at all, though?
Well, it had good drama, but the acting.
What about it?
It was WAY over-the-top.
I agree. "Old" acting is awful by today's standards, but I liked it.
