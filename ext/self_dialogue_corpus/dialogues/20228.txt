Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, I saw Wonder Woman last night.
Was it any good?
Yeah it was really good actually, one of the best superhero movies.
Really? That's amazing. What did you like about it?
I liked how respectful it was.
What do you mean?
They didn't try to make her overly sexy or anything like that.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
Yeah and her character was really likable.
What else did you like?
I liked the fact that it was directed by a woman too.
I'm sure that had a large effect on the movie.
I think it did, definitely for the better.
Yeah, I'm kind of tired of all the fan service that movies nowadays have.
Me too, it gets old pretty quickly.
I agree, I hope this movie influences movies from now on.
I think it will, it's very, very popular in reviews.
Didn't Rotten Tomatoes give it a really good review?
They did, like 90% or something really high.
