What type of music do you like?
I don't have a certain genre that I like; but anything that gives me a good feeling is my style that I prefer.
I agree. I don't care for rap music or heavy metal.
Me neither. Heavy Metal seems to be just a bunch of screaming!
Are there certain songs that make you feel happy?
I liked the song Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke. Then I really fell in love with it when Jimmy Fallon did the video.
Oh yeah, that was really good, it cracked me up!
He's done other music videos with a bunch of other people, since then, where they are using the classroom instruments.
Oh really? I haven't heard any of the other songs that he's done.
He did "All I want for Christmas is You" with Mariah Carey and one by Adele, and others.
Cool! I'll have to check out the one with Adele.
Jimmy Fallon is really a pretty good singer, even when he's acting goofy!
Do you listen to country music much?
I do. I love Keith Urban. I really enjoyed the video he made in his car, with his wife Nicole.
Oh, that was neat! Where they are singing "The Fighter". I think Keith and Nicole should record songs together, they'd be good.
Yeah, I'm not sure how good of a singer she is, or if she was just lip-syncing to that song.
The thing about country music, especially, is that the words in some songs could be meant to be about your real relationships, or even meant to be about your relationship with God.
I've never thought of it that way before, but yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, the words don't directly relate to spiritual or religious meanings, but you could interpret them that way.
I'm going to start paying closer attention when I listen to country music, to pick up on what you are talking about. Neat!
