Do you like Sean Paul?
I don't know too much about him to be honest.  What about you?
I am a huge fan.  I love that he brings reggae music and combines it with pop.
Has he won any major awards?
He won a Grammy in 2004 for Dutty Rock.
Is that your favorite song?
I actually love the pop songs he is involved with.  For instance, 'Cheap Thrills' with Sia was so good.
Yea, it's one of the remakes of songs that actually sounds better than the original.
What about your favorite song by him solo?
I really love "Get Busy."
