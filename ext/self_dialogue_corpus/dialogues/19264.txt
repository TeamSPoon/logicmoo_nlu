I really want to go to more concerts. I just never see anyone I really like coming here.
Concerts are great, you don't have to see just artists you know.
I know, but I don't want to pay the high prices for tickets and end up hating the show.
You know, you might be surprised. I went to a Mike Doughty show once because a friend had an extra ticket, it was amazing.
You hadn't heard him before?
No, I had no idea who he was, but he was really good. Just see who is playing locally and take a chance!
I might, but I really can't waste money on chances very often.
Maybe try a free concert. Some parks and businesses host free concert series especially in the summer.
That's an idea, I wonder if there's anything like that nearby.
I once saw Postmodern Jukebox and Lyle Lovett play at LL Bean. Both concerts were fantastic and totally free!
That's amazing! I love PMJ!
Me too. Also local festivals and fairs almost always have live music.
I hadn't thought about that! You're right I had a friend who loved to go the fair because of the music.
You have to pay to get in, but if the band is disappointing, you're at the fair! I saw a bunch of country that way, Bryan White, Blackhawk, and Paul Brandt.
I'm not super into country, but it's still a good idea.
It's not just country. A lot of bands play fairs and festivals, it was just what I was into at the time.
What about like music festivals? Have you ever been to one?
I've been to a few. They are a great way to see several bands all for one ticket.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
They really are! We should see if there are any coming up and we could go together.
