Ron Holmes is down!
Oh no!
Big Brock just landed on him.
Ouch!
Big Brock is 350 pounds.
How big is Ron?
He's pushing 250.
One hundred pound difference there.
That's gotta hurt bad.
What's his status?
They're tending to him still.
It looks bad.
Ok, they're loading him onto the stretcher.
Is he awake?
Barely.
I really hope he's ok.
They need him.
Ok, the crowd is clapping.
They're wheeling him off.
Get better, Ron!
