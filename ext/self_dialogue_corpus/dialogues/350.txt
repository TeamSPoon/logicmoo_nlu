Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie yet?
Yes, it was awesome! I am happy they finally made a good movie for a female superhero.
I agree. I thought Gal Gadot did a wonderful job.
Did you know she was pregnant while filming part of the movie?
Wow, she truly is Wonder Woman. Did you also see Batman vs. Superman?
No, I heard it was not that good.
Yeah, it had some pretty bad reviews. But Wonder Woman was in that movie, too.
Oh, maybe I will give it a try.
I don't think it is worth it. You should just wait for the Wonder Woman sequel.
Okay, let's see it together when it comes out.
