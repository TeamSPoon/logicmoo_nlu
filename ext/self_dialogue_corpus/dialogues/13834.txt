Hey, do you know the singer Lady Gaga?
Of course, you think I've been living under a rock?
Ha, no. I was just wondering what she's been up to lately.
Yeah, I hear you. I haven't heard a new song in a while.
With the state of music today, I wonder if she would even put anything new out.
Why do you say that?
Well, every year seems to bring a new sound, and any artist that isn't new for that year sounds too old for the young kids to relate to.
It didn't used to be like that. I liked artists of any age group as long as they sounded good.
Yeah, that's too bad. It makes every artist sound the same, and then they disappear and new ones come. Every new artist is now a "one-hit-wonder".
Believe it. See you around.
