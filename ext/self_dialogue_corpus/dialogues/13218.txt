What is your favorite Star Wars movie from the franchise?
That would be the Force Awakens.
Why that one?
I love the two new main characters Rey and Kylo.
I enjoyed that one too.
Did you like those two characters?
I did but I think at least right now with what we have to go on they're lacking a bit.
How so?
Well the old characters Luke, Vader they had so much lore and story behind them after it was all said and done it's hard not to put them way ahead as of now.
Yeah maybe with the future movies we will get more in touch with these new characters.
