Have you heard of bruno mars?
Oh yes, he is really good
I love him, my friend Kelly says he is whiney
I could see why she would say that, the whining works for him though
Whats your favorite song from him? I think its "Thats what I like", how about you
Just the way you are, the words ring true
He has some beautiful eyes
Yes he does, do you listen to any other genres?
I like country, some rock, I love alternative
Have you heard of creed?
Oh I love them, I wonder what happened to them
do you like classical music?
not really, do you like blues?
I do, but I love R and B and Pop as well
who is your favorite r and B
baby face, he is amazing
He is, he puts some amazing artists together to create some of the best music
the one with him and stevie wonder is just incredible
what is the same
how come how long
