Have you seen the movie Inside Out?
Yes, but I didn't like it at all.
Really? Why?
Sadness ruined it for me. She was always depressed and ruining things.
That was the goal of her character.
I understand that, but it was almost annoying how she wouldn't listen to Joy.
That's true.
Some of the storyline was hard to understand. How Riley's memories were stored in colorful balls.
I think that was to represent her brain.
True, but it didn't look like a brain to me. It was almost like a factory the way it worked. Strange.
