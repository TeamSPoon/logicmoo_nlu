do you think thor ragnarok will be a good movie?
i hope so, i really loved the movies before.
i agree, cris hemsworth really fits the thor role.
tom hiddleston also plays loki very well.
yes he really does, i live tom hiddleston he is awesome.
i hope they start to act more like brothers in future movies.
i don't think so.
why not?
loki is a frost giant and has waited so long for odin to give up the throne. he is filled with spite that i dont think there will be a chance for him to change.
hmmmm. i see. thanks for your opinion.
