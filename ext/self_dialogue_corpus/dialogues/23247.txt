What is the best cult movie of our generation?
Thats a broad field to choose from.
I'd say the Princess Bride.
I'd say Heathers.
What makes you say Heathers?
It has a really unique storyline with strong characters, a surprise ending, and relevant issues.
Yeah but it's so dark.
The Princess Bride is dark too though.
Yeah, but the Princess Bride is something the whole family can enjoy together. It has some dark moments but overall it's really great.
And it is really funny.
Anybody want a peanut!
And there's witty repartee
Plus! Swordfights!
And pirates!
And kissing.
Okay. So maybe it's pretty good.
The best.
But Heathers can be the second best cult movie.
I guess so.
So it's settled!
