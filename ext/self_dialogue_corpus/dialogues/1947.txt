Do you think Dan Marino was a good quarterback
Oh for sure, one of the greats.
I only know him from the Ace Ventura movies
He's a better QB than actor.
OJ was a pretty good actor I think
What position did he play?
He was a running back
For what team?
He played for the 49ers and the Bills
I wish the Bills could have a winning season
Yeah, I feel bad for their fans
Detroit came back pretty well from a terrible team to an okay one
Oh for sure.
And the Browns too
Maybe this year will be the year for the Bills
I doubt it.
The Patriots have so much money and power
It's hard for everyone else to compete
The Panthers might have it in them
Let's hope so.
