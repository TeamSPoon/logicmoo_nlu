I think Lebron is better and Jordan was.
I think you are wrong.
Well just watching him he sees more dominant.
I could see that but when Jordan took over there was nothing like it.
Is that all you have to go off of?
No.
Well what else?
How bout the rings, the points, the historical moments, the fact he never ran to other teams.
Those are better arguments.
I hate hypothetical though.
Yeah as a whole I am sure the athletes now are better than the athletes were back then.
Right, but they have so much more at their disposal.
Yeah, the teams put them in the best possible position to be successful.
Yeah the training and health is way better now.
Yeah and the athletes are under such scrutiny it matters if they take it seriously.
Yeah, so maybe Lebron is better.
Thank you.
But only because of the advances in medicine.
I'm not so sure of that.
Well you are never going to convince me that Jordan is not the greatest ever.
