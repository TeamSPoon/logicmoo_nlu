My favorite movie is "Law Abiding Citizen" starring Jamie Foxx.
That was a good but I didn't like the ending.
Why because you thought the ending was predictable?
Yes. I wished the villian in that one had got away with killing all the people that he did.
Oop spoiler alert right? Most people want the villian in movies to get their due
Yeah, but in "Law Abiding Citizen" the court system screwed the man who eventually becomes the main villian.
I actually thought the premise was genius and the way killer killed his victims was outstanding.
Your sick. But to give us all that action, planning and murders then the movie turns around and gives us a predictable ending.
But if the villian in the movie didn't get their due who would the audience root for?
That's exactly my point. The main character wasn't a murderer or villian at the start of the movie.
He was still the antagonist and antagonists in movies should die, drown and at least go to jail
I agree but this movie was about the court system failing a "Law Abiding Citizens."
The fact that the court system fails you doesn't make or give you the right to go out and commit murder.
Dororthy of the Wizard Of Oz threw water on the green witch and she died because of it. Shouldn't Dorothy have been killed?
No. Two completely different movies. The witch in the Wizard Of Oz brought Dorothy to her castle against her will so the witch got what she deserved.
Monkey see monkey do you know literally, with the flying monkeys hunh?
Oh you got jokes but I was fascinated by castle guards, the apple throwing trees and Glenda the good witch's gown.
Why? Because the guards wore red, silver and black uniforms? Or that Glenda the good witch travelled by bubble?
No because I think they the guards, were the originators of line dancing?
You and your take on movies is whacked and out of this world. (laughing)
