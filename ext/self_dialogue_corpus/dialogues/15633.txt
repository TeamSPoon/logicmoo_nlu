Who would you say is he most overated artist in music?
Thats hard to say. Do you mean from a fan standpoint or just in general.
From a fan's standpoint.
I'd say Beyonce then.
Why do you think she's overated. She has a lot of good songs.
I don't argue that fact but she and her fans make her out to be some kind of goddess.
Whats wrong with that?
There are people out there that thank her for things that she has nothing to do with.
Give me an example.
Alright, a fan thanked her because she was given an extra peice of chicken at a fast food resturant.
Was Beyonce there?
NO! Her reason for thanking her was because she though the news she was having twins some how influenced the resturants descion.
Oh my. That is strange to say the least.
Strange? That is just plain crazy.
I'll admit it's very weird to hear that.
I just feel she is on a pedestal that she really shouldn't be on. Let alone let herself be on.
She can't help it if fans hold her to a certain regard.
Of course she can. If she remained humble she wouldn't act the way she does now.
I guess fame gets to people.
Yes it will always get to you if you let it. Thats why you should always be humble.
