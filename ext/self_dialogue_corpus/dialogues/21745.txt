Hey, did you know that Midnight Cowboy was the only X-rated film to ever win Best Picture?
I have heard that. But isn't it now rated-R instead?
Yeah, they changed it. And then they got rid of the X-rating altogether.
They replaced it with NC-17, right?
Yeah, basically, though NC-17 is basically a useless rating. It only exists to prevent films from being seen.
What do you mean by that?
Like, for example, you know the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker?
Yeah, I know of them. What's your point?
When they released Orgazmo in 1997, it received an NC-17 rating, so that basically no theaters would take it.
Of course, no one wants to be associated with a rating like that.
Well, two years later when they released their South Park movie, they got an R-rating despite that film being far more crude.
Maybe they did something different? Maybe it being a cartoon made all the difference?
No, the thing that made all the difference was by that time they had the backing of Paramount.
Paramount forced the MPAA to give the film an R-rating?
It was more like a "I scratch your back, you scratch mine" situation. They're one of the largest film companies in the world, and if the MPAA wanted to do business with them, they had to play by their rules.
That sounds pretty corrupt.
Pretty much, but that's business for you. The downside is that independent films get much harsher ratings for sillier things.
At least with the internet indie films can reach a wider audience without the MPAA, though.
That's true. Sure, Midnight Cowboy got the recognition it deserved, but a lot of other films probably wouldn't have that chance nowadays without the 'net.
Hopefully someday we'll have a better, more fair rating system.
