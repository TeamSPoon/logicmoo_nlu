Hey, do you remember the Nas and Jay battle?
Absolutely! Ether and the Takeover are two of my favorite songs.
Who do you think won the battle?
After going back and listening through out the years, i don't think there's a clear winner.
That might be true considering they both continued their careers and made a impact of the music industry.
I will say this, Jay-Z had a better overall career than Nas did.
Yeah he did, he even became the Def Jam president for a little while.
Wasn't Nas actually signed to Def Jam at the time?
Yeah he was, so you could say Jay-Z was his boss.
Yeah that is a bit funny. Who do you think is more lyrical?
I would have to say Nas on that Ether joint.
Yeah his lyrical assault on Jay-Z was nonstop from beginning to end.
Every about that song is fire. The lyrics, the chorus, even the beat.
The Takeover had a pretty dope beat as well. Who ever produced it did a great job.
Kanye West actually produced it.
No wonder why the musical samples were orchestrated so well.
Who produced Ether?
A guy called Ron Browz.
I never heard of him. Is he still around?
To be honest i have no idea.
