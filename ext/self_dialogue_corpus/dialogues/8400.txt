Who is your favorite hip-hop singer?
I really like Kanye West and most of his music.
I like Kanye, my favorite track is Power.
That is one of my favorites as well, but I think his track I wonder is underrated.
I had not heard that track but that is a good track, up there with through the wire.
Even if he is crazy he makes some excellent music.
More recently he has been growing his labels under Def Jam records.
I heard about that, as he signed Desiigner after sampling his track on his seventh album The Life of Pablo.
I see that he has gotten more into producing music now, much in the way that Dr. Dre moved into producing and brought in Eminem.
That does make sense, putting that crazy talent to work recognizing other crazy talent.
