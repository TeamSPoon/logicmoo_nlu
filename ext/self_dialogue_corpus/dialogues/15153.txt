Did you see that the new Lorde album, Melodrama, is out?
No way? Already? I love the song "Green Light."
I do too! But that's not the best song on the album.
What do you think is the best song on the album, then?
I really like the track, "Hard Feelings/Loveless." It's over 6 minutes long!
I'll have to listen to it. How do you think "Melodrama" compares to her last album?
Well, Lorde is defintiely growing up. "Pure Heroine" was written in the middle of being a teenager. This album feels more adult.
She was still a teenager when she wrote it though, right?
Yeah, she was 18 and 19 I think. She's 20 now. But she was 16 when "Pure Heroine" came out.
How does it feel more mature?
There's a lot more heartbreak on this album.There's still a sense of youthful recklessness, but she's more jaded.
She's always been a little jaded. Never your candy teenage pop.
Anything but! She did get some critcism on "Green Light" for being too similar to Taylor Swift, though.
They're good friends, aren't they?
They are. But did you see the comment Lorde just made about their relationship? A lot of people are quite angry.
No, I didn't. What did Lorde say?
She compared her friendship with T-Swift as like having a friend with an autoimmune disorder. As in, there's many things she can't do.
That's rather insensitive. Why did she say that?
I don't know! Lorde should know better. But here comes the public apology!
Why don't celebrities just think the first time around?
