If you had to pick a Star Wars film to remove from the genre, what would it be?
That is hard, I would have to say episode one.
Why is that? I like that one.
I did not like the character, ahem, Jar Jar Binks ring any bells?
I think he is underrated, he provided comic relief.
He was funny sure, but did he have to be in the movie for the plot to progress?
He did to go see the under water group.
No, Jar Jar was an outcast. They would have seen them either way.
Wow, you are right. Well, any other issues.
They focused on  a child too much, made it seem like a kid's film.
