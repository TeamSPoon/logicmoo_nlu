I've always had trouble with the Star Wars timeline.
It's really not that complicated.
Well the release screws me up, I just want to watch straight through the story.
Ok it's easy, for the story line just watch 1-3,Rogue one, 4-6, Force awakens, and finish with the latest movie.
Whoa it's so simple...how could I have missed it?
When in doubt, go with release date.
I just like being able to binge watch without having to keep notes about which side I'm on.
You're putting too much thought into it.
Says the guy that has four different copies of each movie for each order to watch them in.
Don't blame me that my hardest decision about which one to watch next is, "how late can I be to work tomorrow?"
