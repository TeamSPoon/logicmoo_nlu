Do you like the Disney movie Fantasia?
I do, it's so different from all the other Disney films.
It's so beautiful. For a movie that came out in 1999, the graphics are still incredible. So is the music.
What's your favorite scene?
I like the butterfly scene with Symphony No. 5 by Beethoven.
That's a great part. The colors and contrast of light and dark are awesome.
What is your favorite scene in Fantasia?
I like the awakening of the Firebird. That scene was intense.
It was cool. Angela Lansbury introduced that scene.
I didn't know that. I hated that the forest was destroyed, but the Sprite came through in the end.
