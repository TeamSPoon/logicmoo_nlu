Why did they auto-tune Belle so much in the last movie?
What do you mean?
I'm talking about how they destroyed Emma Watson's voice
Maybe she wasn't a good singer to begin with.
Well, destroyed isn't the right word.  Just made it sound too fake.
Yeah, because she's not a good singer.
She obviously had to be able to sing to some degree to get the role.
I'm not saying she's horrible, but she doesn't have the pipes.
Other than that, she was okay though.
Her performance was pretty good.  Helps that she's so pretty.
