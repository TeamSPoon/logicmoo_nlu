What do you think about the Chargers moving to LA?
I think it's cool. Closer to home for me.
What about the Rams? They were already in LA.
I'm a Charger fan for life.
They're temporary stadium is pretty small. Will you be going to any games?
Yeah, I hope so.
It will be hard to get tickets! They are expensive.
I enjoy watching Phillip Rivers on TV so I'm fine with that also.
Yeah he's good. They should have a better team this year.
Do you think they will make the playoffs?
Yes. The broncos and Chiefs won't be as good.
Do you like the Chargers new coach?
Yes, they needed a good change.
how many games do you think the Chargers will win?
At least 10.
Do you think they have a chance at the Super Bowl?
Yes, if they can avoid injuries.
Injuries are hard to avoid.
It takes a little bit of luck to get to the Super Bowl.
Bolt up!
