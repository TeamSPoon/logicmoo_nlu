I just saw John Q and it was amazing
Never seen it, who's in it?
Denzel Washington is the main character
Whats it about?
A father can't afford insurance to give his son heart surgery, so he takes the doctors hostage
Sounds intense!
It was very emotional
Denzel is really good at creating that drama in his films
Yea, I also liked him in Man On Fire.
That was a good movie too.
It had a very good drama feel in the beginning, but then it got really intense
What do you think makes an actor good versus average?
I think it is the dedication to their role
Yea, in many movies you really have to become that character for real
Training day was another great movie
Oh yea, an awesome cop movie
Ethan Hawke was a great addition to that movie
They worked well together, the acting made that movie.
I think they should figure out how to make a sequel to that movie
Even without Denzel it would be awesome
