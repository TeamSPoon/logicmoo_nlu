I suppose you're counting down the minutes until the new NFL season, am I right?
You bet! I can't wait.
Do you think the same old team will rise to the top? The Tom Brady team?
It;s a pretty good bet. He is a great player.
A great player that cheats.
He doesn't cheat.
Deflategate anyone?
They didn't prove it.
Oh please, he cheated. They all do.
What do you know about it?
I know that Brady is married to Giselle, that Ben Afflec seems to be in love with him, and that people cheat to get ahead.
Well, I can't argue with that logic.
You got that right!
I'm sure they even cheated at the very first Olympics games back in ancient Greece.
Probably. They found loaded dice on an acrhiological dig in the Holy Land. People always cheat.
I wouldn't doubt it.
Thing is, a skilled player is a skilled player even without cheating. So the NFL should really crack down.
Other than testing there's not much they can do.
They'd stop cheating so much if every time they were caught the indvidual player and the entire team had not be fined but have $5,000,000 per year taken out of their salaries in perpetuity.
That might just do it.
