You going to the Linkin Park concert?
Hell yeah I'm going to the Linkin Park concert. Wait, when and where is it?
August 26th at the Chesapeake Arena if I remember correctly.
Chesapeake Arena... didn't that used to be the Ford Center.
Yeah, like forever ago. It was still that when I saw my first concert there.
Oh! Who'd you see?
Metallica with Godsmack as the opening band.
Sweet! That had to be a killer concert!
Absolutely. What's your favorite concert so far?
That's a toughie. I really have fond memories of the first time I saw Buckcherry during freshman year but... probably Three Days Grace. You?
Remember how The Brew used to be The Buzz? My favorite concert and memory was one of the last Buzzfests.
Which one?
I don't remember the exact year but AFI, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Papa Roach, and Soasin were there. Oh my god it was incredible!
I bet. You always were a huge AFI and Papa Roach fan back in the day.
Totally! To this day Decemberunderground is one of my favorite AFI albums. Haven't kept up much after that though...
Thought they were dead to be honest. Not literally but the band split or something?
Nah, they actually had three new albums since then - one of which JUST came out not too long ago.
Really?
Yeah, I was completely surprised. Haven't given the other two albums a chance thus far but think I may actually check out their newest one that came out this year, AFI, next time I'm at the record store.
If you do let me know. I totally want to borrow the hell out of it for old time's sake.
