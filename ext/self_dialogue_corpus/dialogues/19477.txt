What's your favorite type of music?
For me it's classical.
How can you listen to that stuff?
It's a beautiful genre, it can express more feelings than any other genre can.
What are you talking about?
The point of classical is that the music is what tells you the story.
I never understood that.
You just need to embrace the melody and open your mind.
It's easier just hearing the words someone wants to say.
That's the problem right there?
What do you mean that's the problem?
Words are limited to those that understand their meaning about a specific intent.
Well that's how words generally work.
And that is why they are limiting.
You really aren't making sense.
Well depending how you hear the music, one song can have many meanings.
I'm not getting what you're talking about, sound is sound.
Like with me, if I hear Bach when I'm happy, it's uplifting, inspiring; but, if I'm sad then it mirrors my emotional state and allows me to grieve.
That seems like a lot to ask from a piece of music.
It's all about how you listen to it, I'll show you, let me play you a piece by Vivaldi.
