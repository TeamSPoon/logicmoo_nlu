Do you like the newer star wars movies?
Yeah I like them a lot!
Why do you like them so much?
The graphics are fantastic and the actors are really cool
Do you like the special effects of the older movies?
Like Episode 1 or Episode 4?
Older like episode 4
Not so much, they are good for the time but now it seems a little cheesy
Yeah that's true, I like the older storylines though
True, the new movies are based on smaller plots
