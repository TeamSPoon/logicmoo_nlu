I just finished the Deathly Hallows, Part 2.
What'd you think of the ending?
It was so sad when Harry was walking to the forest to die, but there was one part that I really loved.
Which part is that?
When Malfoy's mother goes to Harry and asks if her son is alive or not.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that part. What else happened?
Harry nods really subtly and tells her that Draco is still alive. Then, she announces to the rest of the Death Eaters that he's dead.
What do you think they would've done to him if she said he was alive?
They probably would've killed him. Maybe with a knife or another weapon rather than just a spell.
Harry Potter really is the boy who lived. He survived the killing curse twice in his life!
