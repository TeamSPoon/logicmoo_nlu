Have you heard Ed Sheeran's new album, Divide?
I have! I think that this is his best album yet!
Which song is your favorite out of them all?
I really like Shape Of You. Which is your favorite?
My favorite is probably Galway Girl. I do like them all very much, though.
Me too. Are you ready for Taylor Swift's next album to come out?
Yes! I have heard it is going to be just as good as 1989.
That is what I have heard too! It will be hard for her to top Wildest Dreams though.
I agree! She is such a good artist!
I know. Her and Ed Sheeran are my favorite pop artists.
