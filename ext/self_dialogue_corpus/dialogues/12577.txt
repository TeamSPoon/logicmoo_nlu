What in the world was that thing that Obi-Wan sliced his arm off in the bar?
You need to study up on your details dude. You really don't know?
No man I don't. It looked like some big walrus or something, really ugly.
That was Ponda Baba. He's an Aqualish and a smuggler.
Just like Han huh? What does he smuggle?
I don't know.....spices or something I think. He and the other dude worked for Jabba.
Man, Jabba had a real criminal empire going didn't he?
For sure, he was the Al Capone of Tatooine
Tatooine is one rough place. Either the sand people or one of the Hutts is going to get at you.
Yeah man, it's kind of like the country of Australia. Every living thing that's not human is deadly.
