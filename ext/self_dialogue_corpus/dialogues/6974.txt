Did you hear that Disney is making a fourth Toy Story movie?
I hadn't heard that. When is it coming out?
It'll be in theaters next July I think.
How long has it been since the last movie?
Toy Story 3 came out in 2010 I think.
Seven years seems like a long time to go between sequels.
Yeah, but I think an even longer period passed between when Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 came out.
That's true. Do you think it's a good idea for them to make another sequel?
I'm not sure. I thought Toy Story 3 wrapped up the franchise pretty well so I'm surprised they're doing another one.
I'm surprised too. I hope it's good but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
