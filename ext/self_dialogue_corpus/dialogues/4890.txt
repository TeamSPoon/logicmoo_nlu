Who is the best team in the early going?
Maybe the Astros, I love the way they play right now
Dallas Kuechel is really doing a good job.
What about in the NL?
I would say the Nationals
Whys that?
They just have a great record and have 3 weeks worth of games against really bad teams
Well they just got to feast on the Phillies.
I know but they play Mariners, Braves, and Giants.
I understand, how about the  Cardinals?
They are doing their usual surge which is impressive to be honest.
The Cubs and Red Sox have been slow to start.
Yeah and both will imrpove.
Chris Sale is killing it
Yeah and only getting hotter.
How about the Rockies?
The surprise team no doubt
I think they set a franchise record for wins so far
Yeah theyve never had a season start like this
Can they continue it for the season? I dont think so.
