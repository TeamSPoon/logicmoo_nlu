Some of the Beatles songs changed the face of music.
Yes, "Strawberry Fields Forever" was the start of the psychedelic rock movement.
I heard they also used a synthesizer in "Strawberry Fields Forever".
Yes, it was called a Mellotron.
"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" introduced the sitar to western audiences.
And then there is "Sgt. Pepperâ€™s Lonely Hearts Club Band".
Yes, it had quite an effect on the Beach Boys.
It actually caused Brian Wilson to have a nervous breakdown.
And we can't forget "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
Of course not since it is the song they played first on "Ed Sullivan".
