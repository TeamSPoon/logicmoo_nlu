Hey man, are you pumped about Fournette coming in?
No why would I be?
Well he's going to make the Jags a lot better.
No he isn't, he's just a running back.
Yeah but he is the best running back in the draft hands down.
Dude, running backs are the most dime a dozen commodity in the NFL.
No way, I'd trade half my team away for Peterson in his prime.
Bro, look at the best running backs in the NFL, many of them weren't even drafted.
Ok what about some of the best? Like Peterson or Elliot?
That's my point, it's a crapshoot.  They're only as good as their lines.
Adrian Peterson would make any O-line look good.
I would disagree, there are very few rbs that could do that.
Like who?
I would say Barry Sanders back in the day was one.  His line was terrible, but that guy just couldn't be corralled.
So you're just saying draft linemen and not running backs.
Right, I think some of them can offer a lot, like McCaffery  He might end up being really important.
What makes McCaffery different?
He's just so versatile.  Kind of like a Curtis Martin, or LaDanian Tomlinson.
Yeah he can run routes with the best of them.
Right, which I think is the direction the NFL is headed.
