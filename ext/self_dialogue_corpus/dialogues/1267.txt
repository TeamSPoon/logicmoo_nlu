Cool, I have heard great things about Baltimore.
It has its good points and bad points, just like any other place.

I will miss going to Baltimore Ravens games the most!
I did not know you were a ravens fan!
Yes, I have been a huge Ravens fan for as far back as I can remember.
Who is your all time favorite Ravens player?
That would easily be Ray Lewis!
I figured you would say him. I am sure many Ravens fans would share that opinion with you.
He was such a great leader for so many years for our team.
Many people consider him to be one of the best linebackers of all time.
I am one of those people!
