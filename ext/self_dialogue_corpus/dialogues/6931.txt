What do you think about classic Disney films like Cinderella?
I like the cartoon style of animation from those old movies.
I agree. There was something magical about them, everything from Neverland in Peter Pan to the castle in the animated Beauty and the Beast.
I can't quite put my finger on it, but they were more colorful than the recent flicks.
Yes, and the two dimensional style made them feel less real.
You're on the right track.
I don't know. The modern ones with three dimensional animation lack a fantasy element, even though I loved Finding Nemo.
Yes, Willem Dafoe was awesome as Gill; but the setting was too modern.
Yes, present-day settings and realistic effects hinder escapism.
And that's what Disney once stood for: transcendent movies that brought out the child in all of us.
