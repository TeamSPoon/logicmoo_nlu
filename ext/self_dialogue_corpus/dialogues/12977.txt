Did you like The Phantom Menace?
No; JarJar Binks was annoying and Young Anakin Skywalker didn't act very well.
Oh; I did think the acting of the Young Anakin was a little stiff, but JarJar was hilarious!
I guess, JarJar did get less annoying, to me, in the Clone Wars, mainly because he got less screen time.
Oh ya, I did realize that. Now that you mention that, JarJar did play a pretty big role in Episode one, and by Reveng of the Sith, he was barely in the film at all.
Ya. I wish we would have seen more of Jaba the Hutt and his backstory more.
Kind of like they did with Jenga Fett?
Exactly, though the Fetts were always more popular than the Hutts to the majority of the audience
Right. It was interesting finding out where all the Clones, and in turn Stormtroopers came from in The Clone Wars
Totally, and maybe that explains why the Stromtroopers had such bad aim, it had something to do with the cloning process being duplicated for generations. *haha*
