What did you think about last years NFL games?
I didn't watch last years season.
You didn't watch? You love football.
I was so disgusted with the Colin Kapernick crap I decided to protest the NFL.
You mean the kneeling down during the national anthem?
Yes. It was disgraceful and so disrespectful that I just didn't watch.
You didn't see a single game?
Nope I refused to support the NFL when they allow this blatant show of disrespect.
But weren't you in the military? Isn't free speech what you believe in?
Yes but these gentlemen are role models for the younger generations. They should find a different way to protest.
So you think they should follow different rules?
No but the NFL is an entity that represents things that the younger generations strive for. They have a moral and social responsibilities.
So you think it hurt the NFL for him to kneel?
Not just the NFL but society as well. People started doing it at all sport games. It spread like wildfire.
And you think this is more the NF's fault than the player?
Yes because as an entity that receives as much money as they do from the public they have a moral obligation to that public. The players have to follow a morality contract?
Do you think the players kneel went against that morality clause in their contract?
Yes because the level of disrespect they showed was not just to the flag but to every military person, every citizen in our great nation. And they make millions with no retribution for their disrespect.
So wouldn't they be showing their freedom of speech though?
If you are paid that much money to entertain the citizens of this amazing nation you are held to a higher moral, social and ethical standard. There were other ways he could have gotten his point across.
