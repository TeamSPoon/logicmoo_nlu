Do you like the artist Jay Z?
Eh he's alright. I don't listen to him much.
Yeah I've been listening to his older stuff lately.
I've heard that isn't too bad.
It's really not awful. He's a pretty good rapper.
I only know him as being married to Beyonce.
Nah he's got way more credit than that.
Isn't he a music producer?
He sure is. I'm not sure who he has produced though.
I bet he's done some great work.
Yeah you'll have to check out some of his stuff.
Yeah I guess I should.
It's really not too awful.
I just don't like pop rap music.
This is not like that at all.
Oh okay, good. Thats a relief.
Yeah I mean he had a couple radio songs but the rest is awesome.
Cool I'll have to check him out then.
A lot of his stuff can be found on spotify.
Oh awesome. I'll look up some stuff.
