Do you remember when Dumbledore died?
Of course how could I forget that.
I was just thinking about Harry mourning the loss.
Then everyone pointed there wands into the sky.
You read my mind it's like they did a eulogy.
Exactly.
Didn't the dark spot above them also go away when they did this?
I'm not sure but I believe so.
I wonder why that happened because there power in that moment was too strong?
Yeah i'm not sure that was confusing.
