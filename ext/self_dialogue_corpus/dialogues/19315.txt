Are you a big music fan?
I love music.
Me too,I'm always playing something.
What's your favorite type or genre?
I love rock and roll.
I do too.
Do you like heavy metal at all?
To a,certain point I like some songs but not a heavy dose.
I can't take the head banging to long.
Do you like CCR?
Yes,and I still listen to John Fogarty.
For the longest time he legally couldn't play his own music live.
That was a shame.
His own brother went against him.
They never reconciled before his brother died either.
I know,hard to believe.
I think cosmos factory was one of the best album out when it debuted.
So many hits off that album.
Looking out my back door is a favorite of mine.
That was a great tune.
