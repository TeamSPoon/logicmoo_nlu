What are you wearing?
I am not sure.
Can I look at the tag?
I guess so.
The tag has been removed,
I bought it at a thrift store.
You shop at those?
Yeah, when I'm short on money.
I could take you shopping.
You could?
Yes, it would be my treat.
That works for me.
Where should we start?
Maybe at the mall?
The mall it is.
How much can we spend?
How much does a new wardrobe cost.
About two thousand.
That sounds about right.
I'm going to be in style for once!
