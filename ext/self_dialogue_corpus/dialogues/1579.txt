Have you got your man cave done yet, the NFL season starts soon?
Yes, I got it painted, new lazyboy recliners and new big screen TV with surround sound done!
I can't wait for NFL Sundays to start back with the new set up.
Pre-season games start next month, I can't wait to break it in!
Me either, the kids will love watching the NFL games in the man cave too!
You think the Saints are gonna go all the way this year.
I hope! The Saints haven't been able to capture the magic they once had during the 2009 season.
Yes, the 2010 Saints super bowl win was magical for the team and the city of New Orleans.
That win really helped turn the city of New Orleans around after that devistating hurricane they had back in 2005.
Who is the Quarterback for the Saints.
Drew Brees is still the starting quarterback or at least has first dibs on the job.
Brees has been with the Saints for a long time now?
Yes, Drew Brees has been with the Saints since he came back from shoulder surgery back in 2006.
Who was Brees with before then?
Drew Brees originally played for the San Diego Chargers but they got rid of him after he had surgery.
That is funny since he went on to win the Super Bowl for the Saints.
Yes, and Brees will be a future hall of famer with all the stats he has put up with the Saints.
No doubt! Drew Brees has been great for the Saints and the city of New Orleans.
I hope the Saints have a great season!
I do to and hope it is another exciting year of NFL football in our new man cave!
