Did you watch the Friday the 13th movies growing up?
Not really.  I've probably seen them all though.
Oh, but you didn't like them?
No, I found that Jason was pretty boring.
He kills everyone.  How is that boring?
It's just a cycle of death.
What do you mean?
He only uses a machete.  Victims are all councilers.
Well, he did go to Manhatten that one time.
Oh, that one wasn't so bad!
