Who's your favorite Fast and Furious character?
Hobbs, without a doubt.
Hobbs is played by Ludacris?
No, Agent Hobbs, played by the Rock.  Who is your favorite?
Either Han or his girlfriend.
Yeah, she died to save him.
I cried so hard when both of them died.  I didn't know why they had to kill them off.
I can't wait to watch the new one
I wonder how they're going to deal with the Paul Walker situation.
But they already did.  In the last one he retired with the girl and his kid, that was the send.
