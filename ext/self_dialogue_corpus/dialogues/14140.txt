do you know angel down?
its from joanne?
yup, her newest album.
that song is stripped and beautiful.
it speaks on injustices and pain of losing someone.
yup, gaga seems like such a good person.
she sounds like she actually cares.
"i'd rather save an angel down"
everything seems to be getting worse. so many murders.
at least gaga cares
