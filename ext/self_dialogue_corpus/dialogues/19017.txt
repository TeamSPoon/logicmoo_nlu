Did I tell you that I was going to the symphony last night?
No, you didn't. That's cool. How was it?
It was really beautiful. Brahms and Rachmaninoff.
Sounds lovely. I've never even been to the symphony, sadly.
Oh, you should go. You'd really enjoy it. I mean, I know that you're really a music lover.
Definitely. I've been to the opera several times. But the symphony has eluded me.
Which operas have you seen?
I saw Rigoletto and I also saw a production of Carmen. Both were spectacular.
That sounds wonderful. I have to go see one someday soon .
I also went to a Luciano Pavarotti concert once and his voice was remarkable. I've never heard anything like it.
Oh, he was so talented. I used to love watching him on television.
I imagine singing opera is one of the most difficult types of performance to carry off.
Oh, for sure. There's a lot of power being put to work there.
Who have you seen in concert that you've liked?
I went to an amazing Barry Manilow concert back in the day. He puts on a great show.
I used to have a huge crush on him. I still think he's super talented.
I know, when you think about all the songs he's written, it's like classic after classic.
Well, he "Writes the Songs." Literally.
Yup, that he does. And he used to write the commercials, too.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. He wrote a lot of famous jingles.
