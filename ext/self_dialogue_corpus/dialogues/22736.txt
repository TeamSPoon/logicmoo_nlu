I just watched Frozen for the first time.
Have you been living under an iceberg?
I just refused to watch it because of the hype around it.
I get what you mean. I didn't give it a chance until a year after it came out.
Did you like it.
I did. Did you?
Yeah. I think it had the best songs from any Disney movie.
That's not true. But the songs were great.
Which Disney one has better songs?
Mulan.
No, Frozen wins hands down.
Which song is the best?
Let it go, of course.
I can't lie, I know all the words to that.
I hope there's like a remix or something in the next one.
There's going to be a new Frozen?
Yeah. I think its in 2018.
I'm not surprised. Its gonna be like a billion dollar release.
Probably. I hope Olaf is just as funny.
He will be. He's a huge draw for the kids.
