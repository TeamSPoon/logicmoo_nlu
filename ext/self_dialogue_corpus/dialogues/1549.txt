So, let's talk football. You're a Colts fan, right?
Yep, born and raised.
What do you think about the latest Peyton scandal?
You mean about how they might have used hearing aids twenty years ago?
That's the one. It's against the rules.
That depends largely on whether they were electronic or not.
So, you don't think they cheated?
Oh, I'm sure the Colts cheat as much as any other team.
Even the Patriots?
Well, the Pats just get caught cheating more often.
That's because they are winners. Nobody cares if losers cheat.
How true. If you cheat and still lose...
Well, the season they are talking about with Peyton was not a great one.
He has had several scandals now, though. The HGH 'for his wife's, the sexual assault in college, the hearing aids.
Yes, and now we have Brady's concussion scandal, as well.
I think that is an important one. The players shouldn't be playing with concussions.
Yeah, but it's also their brains to make that decision. They ought to know the consequences.
That's the power of the culture. Winning is everything.
Until they retire and lose the ability to walk.
The smart ones get in and make some money and leave before they get too beat up.
