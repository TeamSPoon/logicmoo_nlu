I just met a very handsome NFL player.
Oh yeah, where?
At the Shaker's Bar & Grill.
That place is known for NFL players.
I didn't know that!
I'm assuming you just wanted lunch?
That and dessert!
So was he cute?
Yes, he was.
Give up the name, girl.
Damon Woods.
He's a tight end?
You got it!
Wow, he's a catch.
I think so too!
His game comes on later.
I'll be watching.
Let's make it a party!
After I call him!
I shall wait, my dear!
