Hey remember that band Barenaked Ladies?
Yes, but it was years ago what happened to them?
I heard they're still touring
Didn't they loose their lead singer?
Oh yeah I think the band kicked him out
Wait.... didn't they also sing the Big Bang Theory theme song?
That was them? I didn't know that!
They also sang that song One Week that was a big hit
I remember that! They also sang that Brian Wilson Song
Yes, one of the best!
They're from Canada right?
Yes I think they are
I saw them play with Ben Folds Five once it was a great show!
I bet, I wish I could have seen that!
I like Ben Folds Five a lot, I wish they were still together
Both band broke up or lot a lead singer that's ad
Most of the great  ones do though
The Rolling Stones are still together!
But Journey lost their lead singer
But they still toured without him
