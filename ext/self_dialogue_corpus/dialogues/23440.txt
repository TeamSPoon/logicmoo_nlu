I haven´t seen movies in a long time. Which one would you recommend?
Do you like the actor Ben Affleck?
Of course I do! I have seen many movies of him.
Then you should see the movie Argo.
Great! I haven´t seen that one yet, and I heard good reviews. What is it about?
It´s a real story of how they rescue some americans from a foreign country that was at war.
Wow! That really sounds very interesting. Any other in case I have time to watch two?
Yes, watch the movie Gone Girl, you won´t be able to stop watching it.
Oh I already saw that one, really great acting! wow, I couldn't believe the story. Which other then?
Well there is always the classic Pearl Harbor.
Of course! I will watch it, can you believe I never saw it? Who else is in Pearl Harbor?
It has very good actors, like Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr, etc.
Wow! I love Cuba Gooding Jr. He is a very good actor!
Me too! Did you watch him in the movie Men on Honor and Jerry Maguire
Of course I did! Who hasn't watched those movies?
Oh by the way I forgot to tell you that Ben Affleck is the new Batman in the Batman series, he was in the last Batman movie.
Really? I haven´t watched them, I didn't even know there was a new Batman.
Yes there is. He is in the movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and he will be in one next year called The Batman.
Oh wow! I´ll be sure to watch the Batman v Superman, so next year I can watch The Batman.
Please do! Then we could go together to watch it at the movies.
