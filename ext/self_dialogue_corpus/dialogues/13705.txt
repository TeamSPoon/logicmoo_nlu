Out of all of Lady Gaga's songs, which one is your favorite?
I really like Alejandro, but Paparazzi is my favorite video. You?
I like Born This Way. It always lifts me up when I'm down.
Oh! I forgot about that. That's maybe mine, too.
Yes. Did I tell you it's helped my little cousin feel better about how she looks?
No. How?
She's been going through an awkward time. I let her listen to it, now it's her favorite.
Oh, wow. That's really cool.
Yeah. She listens to it when she gets ready in the morning.
That's great. I may start doing that as well.
