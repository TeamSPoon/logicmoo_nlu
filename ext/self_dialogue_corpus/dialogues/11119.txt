So, what do you think about this summers fashion?
Oh, i really like the fact that they're bringing back the off the shoulder looks.
Have you seen any of the new sandal trends?
No, i haven't seen any of them yet.  What are the styles this year?
Well, from what I've seen, they're bringing back the gladiator styles.
Really?  Like the small ankle high ones?
Yeah, I've seen the small ankle ones plus the calf length.
Oh, i don't like those at all.  They look too busy when you're wearing them.
Yeah, if you're not careful with what you pair them with, you could really have a massive train wreck ensemble.
I prefer my Birkenstocks over any designer shoe anywhere.
Oh, don't you like the fact that the department stores are using actual plus sized models now?
Yes!  Its beyond amazing that people in the upper echelons finally figured out that hardly anyone is a size zero.
I'm just glad that they're actually using a plus sized model, like she's a size 14-16.
Yeah, usually they call a gal who is a size 8-12 "plus size".  This is hardly the case.
I really appreciate the fashion commercial spots that Target has out there.  They were the first company to use a real woman in their spot.
Kinda changes the way I see Target now.  They're doing very well for women nowadays.
Want to know what I miss the most?  The long flowing full pesant skirts.
Well, you can still wear them! Be your own fashon statement!
Oh i plan on it, I'm just annoyed that I can't purchase any new ones.
Well, this summer hopefully will be full of awesome surprises with fun things to wear!
