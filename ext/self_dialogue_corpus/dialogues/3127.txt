The NFL draft should be coming up soon. Are you excited?
Yeah, though I don't know how my Saints are going to do this year.
Oh, I didn't know you were a Saints fan.
Yeah, Brees is arguably the best quarterback in the league so I represent them to the fullest!
Yeah, he's good but he's no Tom Brady. That's the team I'm looking forward to.
The Patriots are a force but I feel like their time is up. You wait, my Saints are going to do great this year.
I feel like Saints fans say that every year, but who knows.
That's funny, but yes I am excited for the season and ready to see what each team can bring this year.
Other than the Saints, what other teams do you like?
I'm a fan of the Seahawks, as Marshawn Lynch is a beast.
That he is, I'm sure even Brady was worried about facing him.
Well, now that he's back with the Raiders it's definitely going to be a problem.
Oh, I forgot all about that! The NFL just got more entertaining now.
Yeah, other than the Saints I'm definitely excited to watch him smash through defenses again.
That's always a highlight of the sport huh?
It certainly is. That and the way they can throw the ball so far down the field.
Well, I think we only have about a month before we can see other plays be drafted in.
Yeah, I always enjoy seeing fresh talent perform with the old ones. We saw how the Cowboys did with that.
Absolutely, and they only show signs of getting better.
Only time will tell, that's for sure.
