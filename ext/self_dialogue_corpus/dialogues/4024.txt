Ever seen the Usual Suspects?
Awesome movie with a classic ending.
Yeah, the whole time you thought that the cop guy was Kaiser Sosa, or he was made up.
It was so good.  You never knew what was real and what wasn't.
Yeah, and how Kevin Spacey just made all those things up on the fly.
He's such a good actor.  Everything he touches is gold.
That ending my jaw dropped when he started walking normal.
Yeah, like we all thought he was dumb but he was the mastermind the whole time.
Like he says, the Devils greatest trick was convicting the world he didn't exist.
I know, awesome movie.  Think maybe I'll watch that again this weekend.
