Are you a Star Wars fan?
Yes, I love the Star Wars movies!
So who is your favorite character?
I really like Boba Fett, I feel like he's the mercenary of the Star Wars Universe.
Oh I love Boba Fett too!!  It's sort of strange that he's my favorite and yet I know anothing about the actor.
I never thought of that, but you're right.  Who plays him?
Jeremy Bulloch has played him the majority of the time.
Just when I thought I knew everything about Star Wars I learn something new.
It's true, there's just so many characters and settings and everything!  I love it.
Me too, let's go have a movie marathon of all the movies in order!
