Do you think what Madison Bumgarner did was not right?
Its a tough line to toe
Can baseball contracts restrict what you do off the field
I think only for bad behavior
One could argue what he did was bad behavior.
Yes they could do that for sure.
And how about telling players as long as we pay you, you adhere to rules and standards that would preclude you from engaging in this stuff?
Thats where you become too much like a dictator.
I would be ok with a team saying no off roading.
Yeah but some guys have hurt themselves playing basketball
Well in baseball you have to protect your own body
Right but you cant just sit there and do nothing.
I would be OK if they told people that they forfeit money if they are found to have been doing something dangerous.
That again infringes on their rights.
During the season?
At any point.
Well if you are paying them to play and they arent playing then I think they should forfeit the money
So if a guy gets hurt he shouldnt get paid
If its during a game or team activity thats workmans comp.
I see  your side now
