All right another movie discussion lunch.  Today we were going to talk about Redford.
Well, before we get to that I wanted to say something about the new movie theater experience that I forgot to mention in our last discussion.
What's that?
Surround sound--I hate it.  For years you've adjusted to the sound on screen and now you're suppose to believe that the landslide is coming from the brick wall on your left.
Yeah, I think it's pretty silly too.  But what about Robert Redford--like him as anyone other than the Sundance Kid?
Well, that was an iconic role, but although I always like him, nothing stands out.
The Electric Horseman, All the Presidents Men?
He was solid but not iconic, at least not to me.
What about out of Africa?
You've always liked that movie and it completely bored me.
Meryl Streep.
I know-- she and Redford in a boring movie. She is great, but maybe he's just an average actor with great looks.
Maybe--has he won any acting awards?
As for as the oscar, I think he was nominated for the Sting--pretty good in that one--I don't know about the other award shows; I watch them but don't remember.
He did win won for directing didn't he?
Oh, you did your research before lunch; me too; it was for Ordinary People.
I think that movie was kind of a downer--I don't think I even saw it other than some scenes.
Same for me.
Well he has a new film, and just for you, it's on Netflix.  What's it about?
It's called Discovery, and I think he discovers there's an afterlife.  I'll see if I can tell you more next time.
