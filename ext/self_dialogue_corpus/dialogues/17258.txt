I've been trying to track down older Beatles albums. Which ones would you recommend me tracking down first?
My favorites been Abbey Road but Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is awesome too.
I did grab Abbey Road already. I look for the other.
Actually if you're getting into the Beatles now, you might as well get the discography sets. They have most of the top albums.
I actually want the full separate albums because I enjoy the band's artwork for the covers and booklets.
I see, if you're trying to be have a comprehensive set that is definitely a must.
I started going back and collecting true classics recently. I recently finished my Pink Floyd collection.
Oh that's great! I didn't know you were a Floyd fan. What's your favorite song?
Comfortably Numb! It's so mesmerizing and relaxing but yet speaks a lot to you.
That's a great song. The Dark Side of The Moon Album is probably their best, at least my personal favorite.
I agree. I loved that one and the Wall a lot. It gets so much play from me.
What other bands have you started collecting?
I'm also in the process of collecting the Led Zeppelin albums!
How far have you gotten along with the collection of Led Zeppelin albums?
I'm making good progress, but I can't find Presence!
I think I have that album lying around the house somewhere. I know back in the days I had doubles of all their albums. If I find it I can give it to you.
That would be great! Thanks a lot.
No worries at all. I appreciate sharing good music with someone who appreciates it!
It's been a fun adventure collecting these albums. I'm going to move into the 80's next!
That'll be fun, not as iconic as the 70's, I would go back to the 60's but the 80's have a lot of one hit wonders!
