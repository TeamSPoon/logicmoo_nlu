You have been wearing a lot of pink lately, Sammie.
Yes, that is because pink is in this year.
I thought green color was in this year. What do they call it?
They are calling it "Greenery".
That's right.  It is all the shades of green.
Yeah. I don't like wearing green and that is why I am wearing pink.
Why don't you like to wear green? A green top with a pair of black slacks would look good on you.
Green makes me look like Kermit the Frog.
No you didn't just say that. Really?
I am serious. I have pictures of me wearing green during my junior year in high school.
It has been nearly ten years since you were in high school.
Yes. I used to wear that green jumpsuit all of the time.  I know you remember it.
It was cute.
I looked like I was a human frog.
It wasn't that bad.
Yes it was. I used to get picked on everyday because of that jumpsuit.
I didn't know. I thought it was cute.
So did I until I looked really hard in my mirror.
