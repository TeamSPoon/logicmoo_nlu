Have you seen any Wes Anderson movies?
Yes, I love him.
Which ones have you seen?
I've seen Royal Tenenbaums, Moonlight Kingdom, Life Aquatic. Grand Budapest Hotel, and Darjeeling Limited.
Which one was your favorite?
The Royal Tenenbaums, definitely.
Awesome, that's my favorite one, too!
Yeah, the soundtrack is amazing, also.
Indeed. And Gwynyth Paltrow's character was great.
Yeah, they were all great. Amazing cast.
I used to watch it every night as I went to sleep.
Really? Do you have every line memorized?
Not really. I usually fell asleep after the introduction.
Oh, okay. That introduction was awesome.
Yeah, I bet it took them a long time to make the props.
I'm sure it did. It was very clever, though.
Yeah, All of his films are pretty clever.
What did you think about Life Aquatic?
It was pretty good. Anything with Bill Murray is going to be good, though.
This is true.
