I just discovered The Mars Volta and my life will never be the same.
Wow, are they still together?
I think so. Their last album was in 2012, though.
So how have they changed your life?
I just never realized rock music could be this sort of artistic and epic.
Progressive rock is like that! You should listen to more.
What kind of progressive rock band is like The Mars Volta?
Pink Floyd, for starters.
Hm, what about something with a more modern sound?
Try Tool, or Swans, or Radiohead.
