Hi
Hey.
How are you?
Doing good, you?
Doing okay.
Do you watch a lot of baseball?
I don't get to as much as I like.
Do you have a particular team that you go for?
I like a local team near me.
Oh, like a minor league team?
Yeah.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah they are great.
Are tickets expensive?
No not at all, we go all the time.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah it's a blast and the kids love it.
Very cool.
Take it easy.
You too.
