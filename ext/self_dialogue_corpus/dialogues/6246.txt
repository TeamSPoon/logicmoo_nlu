Are you a fan of Disney movies?
I sure am.
Which are your favorites, the older ones, or the newer ones
I think I like them both equally.  However, of the older ones, I think I life the little Mermaid best.
Me too!  The songs are the best in that one, remember "under the sea"?
Don't you think they should have had Robin Williams in that role?
I think that would have been a poor use of his skills. Although he was in the Aladdin one, right?
I know, but he would have been a great Sebastian
Agreed.  Now that I think about it, there was a great role for Robin Williams in EVERY Disney movie!
I think you are right.
