You're a big sports buff right? Which are your favorite sports?
I like soccer, football, and basketball.
I like watching those sports, and baseball too.
Baseball is too slow-paced for me.
What do you know about sports history?
I know the backgrounds of football and basketball.
Tell me a little something about football.
The U.S. has a national football league, the NFL which started in the 1920s.
I think that makes it younger than basketball.
Jim Thorpe was the first president, and at the time there were only 14 teams.
So a relatively small league.
That's true. Of the original 14 teams, the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals are left.
Interesting fact. Where did the league get its start?
In a Canton, Ohio automobile showroom.
That sounds a little like an American legend.
Well I think that original meeting place must have fit the bill.
And Ohio is somewhat in or near the heart of America.
We have American football, and then there are other versions of football.
Its an extremely popular sport.
And the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals are still big rivals!
