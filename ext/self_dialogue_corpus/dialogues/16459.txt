What kind of music are you in to?
A little bit of everything, why?
Just wondering what your opinion of the contestants on the Voice this season was.
Well I was pretty bummed when TSoul didn't make it to the finale. I love his soulful voice.
Me too!
What did you think of the finale?
Well if TSoul wasn't in it, I'm definitely glad Chris Blue won!
Yes, he's certainly a showman.
I'm really glad a soul musician won.
Yeah, soul music really needs to have a renaissance!
What did you think of the other finalists?
I liked Lauren a lot too.
Yeah same. I'm not a huge fan of country, but love folk Americana.
I liked Jesse a lot.
Yeah, that guy has some talent. He makes the guitars he plays too!
No way!?
Yeah, really. I know its crazy sounding.
That girl Aaliyah was amazing too, especially given her age.
Yeah, I don't know any 15 year old that anyone would voluntarily listen to singing.
That's funny!
