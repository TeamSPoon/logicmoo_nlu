It is universally acknowledged that "The Empire Strikes Back" is the best Star Wars movie.  Do you agree?
Yes, clearly.
What's the worst Star Wars movie?
The first 2 prequels.
I tend to agree, although recently I watched "The Return of the Jedi," and it was pretty bad.
Really, I remember liking it.  Of course, I was a kid.
It shares many of the bad tendencies of the prequels: cuteness, too much (bad) dialogue, fuzzy action.
I thought "The Force Awakens" was a return to form, and may even be the second or third best of the films.
You'd put it ahead of the original?
I think that argument could be made.
