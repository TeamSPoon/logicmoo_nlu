What tackle would you take to anchor your line?
Tackle?  I'd have to think about that one.
Well, don't take too long, the season will be here for before you know it.
Alright, I'm ready.  This might be controversial.
I'm ready for it.
I'd go with Tyron Smith.
How is that controversial?
I don't know.  I just thought you'd say somebody different.
No, Smith for sure.  He's still so young and seems like he's been in the league forever.
Yeah, it's nuts he's only 26.
He probably has another decade in front of him still.
The Cowboys drafted him very young out of USC.
The only player who echoes him talent wise is Joe Thomas.
Thomas is so steady and consistent.
And he's done it for a decade now.  Just day in and day out.
It bites he's on a bad team.
Yeah, Browns have never had talent around him.
Their line is getting better though.
Yeah, they made some good investments there, but Thomas will start regressing soon.
He needs a good RB to block for.
