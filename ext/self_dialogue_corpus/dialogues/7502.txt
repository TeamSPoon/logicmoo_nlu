Which of the Harry Potter movies was your favorite?
You know I really liked the Prisoner of Azkaban. That movie and book marked a poignant time in the characters direction.
Yeah, it definitely took a turn for the dark. I kind of think as far as the movies, the first was really good.
It was. The special effects were amazing. I really enjoyed seeing everything I imagine happening before me.
the special effects kept getting better and better I thought.
I thought so too.
My only question is that when they could do all these things and it look so good. Why did Voldemort look so lame?
I know right? He is not what I imagined either.
If they can put a dead guys face on someone else....
I know! And they've done it several times! I think they missed the mark on that one.
