I think it will be this coming Saturday.
Awesome! You know what I love most about hockey?
No, dude. What would that be?
When they slam into each other or into the sidelines & then burst into flames.
What?
Oh yeah! And sometimes, a tire flies into the audience & takes out a couple spectators. That is so great!
Uh, I think you might be a tad bit confused. I'm talking about ice hockey - you're talking about drag racing.
Yes sir! There's nothing North Carolina natives love more than hockey - especially when stuff blows up real good!
You're talking about NASCAR, you nitwit!
I also like it when they release the lions. The hungrier the lions are, the more sport, eh?
Dude! ICE HOCKEY!! Guys on skates using sticks to knock a puck around! On the ICE!!
Heh! Now having the lions on skates - THAT would be extra cool! I am so there!
Okay. You're either seriously mistaken or hopelessly brain-damaged. I don't want to talk to you any more.
The best part, though - the very best part - is when the English guy insults them for their bad singing!
*whimpers*
No! After jumping all these hoops, only to have some smarmy Brit tell them that they stink! It's awesome!!
Please. Just go away. You are not the least bit funny or interesting.
I'd love to see THAT guy crash & burn or get eaten by a lion. Better yet, deal with a sword thrust, right in the gut! HA!!
Goodbye.
Hey! Don't go! I've got two tickets for baseball & a bag full of squid!
