Did you watch teh game between the Warriors and Spurs last night?
Yeah I did, now they are down 3-0 right?
Yeah, its crazy they were up 25 in the first game then blew the lead.
Losing Kahwi hurt them.
You can say that again, now they are probably going to get swept.
It looks like the Celtics are going to also.
Yeah Cleveland has dominated them so far as well.
Its crazy that neither one of those teams have lost yet in the playoffs.
Yeah the Lakers are the only other team to start off the playoffs 11-0.
I hope both of them end up 12-0 when the finals start.
Its going to be a great finals if both of those teams make it.
The 3rd straight year of it being Cleveland and Golden state.
Last year's series was epic.
Yeah when Kyrie hit that shot I lost my mind.
So did I, I couldn't believe Cleveland came back from the 3-1 Deficit to win that series.
Neither could cleveland, that town went crazy.
I'm such a big Lebron fan after coming back home and winning a title there.
Yeah I dont know why everyone hates him so much.
Its because they are all old and Jordan fans.
I think Lebron is better to be honest, just never had the Hall of Fame teammates like he did.
