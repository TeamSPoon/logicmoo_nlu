What's a good action movie to watch?
I just saw London Has Fallen. I thought it was really good.
I saw Olympus Has Fallen and I liked that a lot. Is London Has Fallen similar?
I actually thought it was better than the first one.
Is Gerard Butler back in it?
He is and he's tough as nails.
Why did you think it was better than the first?
I just thought the premise of London Has Fallen was a bit more believable.
Yeah, some parts of Olympus Has Fallen seemed a bit far fetched.
Exactly. This one seemed much more plausible.
