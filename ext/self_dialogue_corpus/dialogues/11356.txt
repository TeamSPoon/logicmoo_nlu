Do you think the Beatles are the greatest band of all time.
Well they have to be  up there.
Other than The Stones and maybe the Who I'd say they are in the top 3.
So many great songs.
I used to come home to hear my sister playing Sargeant Pepper album over and over and over.
I think I have every song on that album memorized.
I like some of their psychedelic stuff.
Strawberry fields?
Eleanour Rigby used to really depress me.
It is such a sad song.
