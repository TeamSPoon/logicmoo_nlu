I watched a great movie last night!
Really?  What was it.
It was a documentary I found on Netflix
Cool.  What is the name of it?
It's called TalHotBlond.
What's it about?
I'm not sure I should say much about it.  It might ruin it for you.
Can you give me the gist of it?
It's about a man who murders someone over an online love triangle.
Wow!  That sounds so scandalous!
It is definitely scandalous, but not in the way you would assume.
Really?
I won't tell you any details, but you won't guess what happens.
It's that crazy?
Yes.  My mouth was on the floor at the end.
That sounds so exciting!  I will watch it tonight.
Oh you definitely should.  I couldn't believe it was real.  I looked it up after the movie and it was!
Do you think my husband will like it?
Yes, he'll like it.  It's not boring at all.  It is so weird you just can't stop watching.
Nice!  Ok I'll watch it tonight with my husband if there isn't sports on.
