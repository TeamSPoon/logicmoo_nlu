Did you ever like Lady Gaga's music?
Not when it was popular. I used to loathe the music and everyone else thought it was popular.
Do you still hate her music?
She's a good artist. After about 5 years, I started to listen to her music.
Which songs do you like?
Bad Romance, and Papparazi are good songs.
Are there any songs of hers that you don't care for?
Born this way. Sounds too much like a bad Madonna.
Yes, I agree. Some people think that she doesn't sound like Madonna.
She's just like Madonna. In sound and in antics.
