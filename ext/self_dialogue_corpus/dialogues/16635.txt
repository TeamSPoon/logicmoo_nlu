What TV show do you think as the best music?
Do you mean throughout, or a general soundtrack?
Surprise me!
Well, for the opening, it's got to be between Attack on Titan and Family Guy.
I thought you'd say The Simpsons; I know you love your Danny Elfman.
Family Guy has the same feel and energy but is much more on the self-parody. Have you heard Attack on Titan's?
No, what is that?
It's a Japanese anim√© show, and the them song is perfect for the high-intensity action.
Sounds good. Would you like to hear my choice?
No thanks.
Seriously?
Fine, go ahead, you know I'm kidding.
I love the music for Lost. Remember that?
I loved Lost! I watched every episode. What part of the music struck you so much?
When they got off the plane after their rescue; it was so beautiful.
You know the composer had themes for each person?
Really?
Yup, just like in most movies. Composers give each character their own theme.
Sweet!
I have the sheet music, if you'd like. I got it illegally, of course.
