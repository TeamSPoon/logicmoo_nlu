My boss use to have Season Tickets to the Bucs.
Wow, that's cool.
Yes, especially when he use to give us the tickets to go to Pre-season games and games he could not attend.
No way! Really?
Yes, we use to go all the time. Box Seats too.
That's wild. What was it like?
Well, it was kinda underwhelmining.
How so?
Well, for "Box Seats" i thought they would be more lavish. it was just regular seating.
Really? I had no clue!
Me either. I thought it would have been like a Rays game.
How was the Rays seating?
Well, thicker, more comfortable seats for starters.
So the Baseball seats were better than the Football seats.
Yes, but we still had fun and the balcont seats just covered us if it rained.
Well, that's not so bad.
No, it was pretty cool.
I bet.
I'd like to go to a game this year, i keep putting it off.
Same here and we are so close, we should make a plan to do so this year!
