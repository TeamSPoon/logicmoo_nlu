Have you ever heard of the band the Arctic Monkeys?
Of course, why do you ask?
Someone recommended them the other day. What can you tell me?
Well, they're from Sheffield.
In England?
Yeah, they broke onto the scene in 2006
That's what he mentioned. What kind of music is it?
I'd call it Alternative Rock, maybe BritRock
So they've been around for 10 years?
Yeah they're first album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I've Not" was pretty well received
That's a mouthful. How so?
It broke the record for fasting selling debut album for the band, beating out The Beatles.
Wow, that's pretty prestigious company.
Yeah, they've gone on to make a total of five albums but are on a break
What would you recommend.
Well, the one I mentioned, and their second album "Favorite Worst Nightmare" is also very good
And what about the others? Not as good?
They are, although their last album "AM" some felt was a little to mainstream
Oh, so made for the radio?
Yeah, but it's still pretty good. Their lead singer, Alex Turner, is a great lyricist - check them out!
