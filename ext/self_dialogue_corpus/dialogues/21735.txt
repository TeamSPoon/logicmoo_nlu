Did you see Deadpool?
That was funny, one of the best comic movies I've ever seen.
Right from the start, Ryan Reynalds cracked me up the whole time.
He was amazing in it.  During the opening fight scene "Oh right up main street!"
Then they showed the whole later haha.
And when he cut off his own hand and it had a middle finger.
Then when it was growing back and it was extra tiny.
Yes, and that was maybe the funniest one liner of the movie.
And that's saying something.  There were a lot of funny parts in that movie.
The action was awesome too.
Sure was.  Deadpool is one of my favorite heroes.
I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
I hope it's as good as the first but those are huge shoes to fill.
Tell me about it.  They picked the right person to play him.
I like when he was telling the cabby to kill that other guy.
That was cracking me up.
I like how his costume evolved.  It was so stupid looking at first.
Then it got to be the one we all know.
Never take anything seriously in Deadpool.
Except for chimmachangas.
