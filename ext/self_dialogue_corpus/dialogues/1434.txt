Who do you think wins the NFC East this year?
The Cowboys for sure.
What makes you think that.
They have the most well rounded team.
Their defense is terrible.
I know they have secondary problems.
Yeah but even their defensive line is depleted with drug suspensions.
Thats true but the offense is their best defense.
While that theory does hold some weight, I am not buying it.
What about the Redskins?
They have too much trouble with the QB position.
How so?
They dont know if they want Cousins there long term
I think that they do
Why havent they offered him a long term contract?
Because they want him to prove it.
How long thoug?
This year is the last he will play on a one year deal
That is not true he could get franchised again
He would make the most money in one year than any other player
