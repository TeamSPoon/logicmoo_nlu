Hey, have you ever listened to any electro-pop?
Maybe, I'm not sure what exactly it is, though. What exactly does that mean?
It's just pop or even rock music with an electronic influence.
Oh yeah, I'm sure I have then. I'm actually looking for something new to listen to anyway, what do you suggest?
Well recently I've been listening to this group called The 1975, you should give them a try.
The 1975? Are they electro-pop?
Yes I'd definitely say so. I know one of their songs got really popular, it's called "The Sound".
That sounds really familiar, but I'm not sure if I recall it. Are there any certain songs or albums you suggest?
They only have two albums, but I really like the song "Change of Heart."
Okay, I'll have to check it out. If I end up liking them it's a shame there's only two albums.
They are really good so I hope you like them. There is good news, though!
Yeah, what is the good news?
Well supposedly there is a new album in the works that is supposed to come out next year.
No kidding? Well I guess it's a good time to get into their music if they have more coming out soon.
Definitely. If you don't like them I can suggest loads more music.
Thank you! What else do you like?
I'm really into alternative music. I love Panic! at the Disco.
Oh yeah they are so great! They are getting really popular now, but I've always liked them.
I know! It sounds like we have similar tastes, so I hope you enjoy the new band.
Great! I look forward to it!
