What drives me nuts is when sound engineers don't know what they're doing.
Like what?
There are just hundreds of songs where the cymbals or the bass is recorded all wrong.
Well, cymbals are high-pitched "Treble" sounds, short waves, and the bass is deep, low-pitched, like long-wave radio.
Right. Like the long-wave radios they use on submarines, that can send a signal all the way around the globe.
And it's how Elephants and Whales communicate with each other. They hate those submarines.
And it's why you can hear your neighbor's stereo booming through YOUR walls. It's that bass wave.
They've got to record the bass fiddle with the microphone AWAY from the strings, not right next to it.
Absolutely, otherwise you can't really hear it in the recording, but you can FEEL it shaking the walls or the inside of your car.
I know what you mean. I heard an old instrumental from "The Wailers", from the 50's today, where the cymbals took over the whole recording.
It can drive you nuts. It sounds just like a continuous, old-fashioned tape hiss.
Dave Brubeck Quartet did a great job recording the string fiddle. I had their 25th anniversary album.
"Take 5" and "Blue Rondo a la Turk", long versions, recorded live.
It was amazing, with Paul Desmond on sax. He wrote the song.
I remember how sad it was when he lost his eyesight.
He did?
The Dave Brubeck Quartet was playing on stage somewhere, when Paul Desmond asked, "Hey, are the spotlights changing colors?"
Oh, no. What was wrong?
He had two detached retinas occur.
Oh, man. And I thought for years that Ray Orbison was blind, with those sunglasses. And Joe Cocker had some nerve disease, which he didn't.
