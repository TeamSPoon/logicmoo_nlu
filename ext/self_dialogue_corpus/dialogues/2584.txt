I can't wait football season is almost here!
You can say that again.
My wife gets annoyed when I watch too much football.
Mine doesn't. Maybe you can come to my house to watch games sometimes.
Yeah, that would be great!
Okay, we'll do it then.
I can bring some snacks. What do you like to eat?
Just about anything.
I make a pretty mean chili.
Love, love, love chili!
We can do a tailgate type thing sometimes too!
Yeah, burgers or ribs would be great!
I think this is going to be an exciting season.
Yes, lots of good players all around.
Yeah, there's Tom Brady, always good to watch.
I agree, he's great.
Then there's Von Miller.
I really enjoy watching him play too.
Here's to a great NFL season!
Hoping this will be a memorable year!
