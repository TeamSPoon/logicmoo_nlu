Are we still watching Disney movies tonight when everyone comes over?
Absolutely! I've got several of them picked out, so we've got plenty to choose from.
Cool, what have you gotten for tonight?
I've got The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Mulan, Frozen, The Princess and the Frog, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White.
Wow, that's quite the list.
Yep! I know everyone won't be here long enough to watch more than two or three, so I wanted a big enough list to choose from.
Well, you've definitely succeeded on that.
I hope so. I've also got some Disney themed snacks. Gummy frogs, apple bites, "glass" candy, gummy fish, little swords for the sandwiches, and some ice cream, too.
Well it all sounds amazing to me!
Thanks! I really hope the Disney night is a success.
