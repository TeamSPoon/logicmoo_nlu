Frozen is a really good disney movie.
It sure is.
My kids have watched it over and over again.
Mine too.
I am actually getting a little tired of it.
Yes and all they talk about and want are Anna and Elsa toys.
Yes I know. Disney makes a fortune off their movies.
They do.
My other favorites are Cinderella and Snow White.
Yes they are timeless classics!
