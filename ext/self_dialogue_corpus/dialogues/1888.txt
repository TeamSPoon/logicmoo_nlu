Whose your favorite NFL team?
That has to be the Lions.
Why the Lions?
Well mostly because they were my dads team growing up so it was natural for me to grow attached to them as well.
Whose your favorite player on the Lions?
Barry Sanders.
Now I understand.
He was a unique Running Back and outplayed everyone on the field.
His skill was beyond that of the players back then and likely still would be today.
I can't agree more he was a good Running Back.
I still remember watching the games back then and seeing him run from one side to the other of the field over and over until he found a gap to run through.
He could run and juke all day.
There was just something about his character that drew me to him as well.
He was a special running back that's for sure.
Do you think anyone compares to him now?
Not really but some are close?
Which one?
Adrian Peterson runs like him at times.
He is very good but also just runs liek a tank at times too.
Yep, he doesn't just rely on speed.
