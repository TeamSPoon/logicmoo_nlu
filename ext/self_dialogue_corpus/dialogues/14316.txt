Did you see game 2 between the Celtics and Cavs?
I did. It was a sad sight to behold.
What is going on with the Celtics?
I think that they were simply overmatched.
Lebron just did whatever he wanted to out there.
Yes. He gave them 30 points.
He also had 7 assists and only 1 turnover.
Kyrie also pitched in a respectable 23 points.
That is true. Kevin Love had 21 points as well.
Did you know the Celtics also had 20 turnovers.
I did and that is one of the main reasons they lost the game.
The Cavs also shut down the Celtics' star player.
Yes, Thomas only finished with only 2 points.
Wow, how can a team win when their star player plays so poorly.
The only way that can happen is everyone else has to pick up the scoring.
Well, that didn't happen for the Celtics.
That's right. Only 2 of the 5 starters scored in double figures.
As a plus for the Celtics, one of the bench players also scored in double figures.
The Celtics may have to make some line up changes if they want to increase their chances of winning.
Yes, I agree. I guess we will have to wait and see.
