Do you like Thriller movies?
I like some like The Dark Knight Rises does that count?
I think so it was very intense. that's a good one.
Inception too was another one I liked.
Oh ya that was such a confusing movie at first.
Ya I agree it really was.
What about ones that are a little scarier like The Silence of the Lambs.
Thats a great movie but it freaks me out a little.
Ya it's so intense with the kidnappings.
Exactly. It reminds me of the movie Seven.
