What did you think of the Giants v Rams games last year?
The one in London?
Yes, that one.
I thought it was great.
I think the Saints versus the Falcons was my favorite of the season
that was a fun matchup
The saints V the panthers was a terrible game though
Oh I know.
They both only got like 900 yards combined.
both the giants and the ravens were fun to watch last season
they have great quarterbacks.
I like that the panthers gave the raiders a run for their money
what was the score on that game?
32-24 I think
The saints gave the raiders a good game too
maybe next year those teams will do better
we can only hope
the nfc south has been dismal
I think the Panthers are going to pull out a better season
me too.
