What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
Return of the Jedi for sure!
Mine too! There are so many cool parts in that one.
What is your favorite part?
Of course it's when Princess Leia is held captive by Jabba the Hutt.
Whew! That is good, but I like when Luke gets trained by Yoda.
Train you, I will!
I love that little green creature. He can fight too!
Do you think they'll ever finish that saga?
I sure hope not.
