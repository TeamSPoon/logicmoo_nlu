What do you think of that new Kendrick Lamer single?
I don't know if I've heard it. What's it called?
I think it's just called "DNA."
Oh yeah. I heard some of that one on the radio the other day.
I think it's getting a lot of radio play.
I know I'd heard bits and pieces the past few weeks.
It's a pretty good track. You should listen to it.
Oh yeah? What do you like about it?
It's got a pretty good beat to it.
Most of his songs usually do.
Plus the lyrics are pretty solid.
Yeah, his bars are pretty solid most of the time. What makes this one different?
Well, the last minute just kind of turns things on their head.
What do you mean?
It's like, in the last minute or so, he just breaks it down.
With the lyrics?
Lyrics and the beat changes too. Tempo stays the same, but he just starts rapping and not stopping for breath
Sounds good.
Anyway, you ought to check it out
I will!
