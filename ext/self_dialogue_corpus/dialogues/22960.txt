Have you ever seen the movie Anchorman?
Who hasn't? It's one of my favorites!
The movie is just so funny!
Will Ferrel is at his peak in the movie.
I love Christina Applegate too.
She's such an attractive woman.
The two of them work well together.
Their fight scene is so funny.
I love that scene!
I also love Paul Rudd and his other crew members.
Yes! Steve Carrell in there as well.
Yup his character is too funny.
I love when he mentions the toilet store.
Ha! That scene is such a classic.
Wasn't that during the anchorman fight scene?
It was! All the other actors coming in at once.
I remember Ben Stiller in that scene!
That's right! Vine Vaugn was there too.
