Watched any good movies recently?
Yeah, I just saw the Belko Experiment last week, have you seen it?
Yeah I watched it when it first came out. What did you think?
It was pretty good, the story was something new, good acting too.
I liked it too, I like most thriller/mystery movies though. Some pretty good acting in it also.
Yeah, especially John C. McGinley!
I love his acting! Kind of weird seeing him in this role though. I'm used to seeing him in more funny roles.
Yeah, probably from the tv show Scrubs?
Exactly. I've only seen him in a couple of other things like Wall Street and Set It Off.
Yeah I remember those, they were really good.
I did think in the Belko Experiment that the tags in their heads were kind of stupid.
You're right, that wasn't very realistic. Who would actually sign up for something like that?
No job pays that much!
But I guess they had to figure out some way to threaten them without actually being in the building right?
Yeah that makes sense. The story overall wasn't that great, but I just like these types of thrillers.
Same here. Just a move you can chill and watch, doesn't require a lot of thinking.
Yeah, plus it had some comedy.
It did, John C. McGinley is always funny, even though he was kind of creepy in this one.
Ha, yeah. The security guard was kind of funny too.
Yeah, and the boss was insane!
