Do you like Justin Bieber's music?
Some of the newer songs are okay.
Have you heard his album "Purpose"?
I think I have heard a few songs off of it.
I love it. Skrillex helped make some of the songs on it.
Is that the one with "Sorry" on it?
Yeah, it also has "What Do You Mean".
I know that song. It's going to get stuck in my head now.
There's also a song called "I'll Show You". It has the best beat on the whole album.
I don't think I know that one. I'll check it out.
