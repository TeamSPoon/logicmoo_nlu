My friend keeps teasing me because I've never seen Dumb and Dumber.
As they should! It's a classic.
Who's in it?
Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. They're both really good in it.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I'm not sure if that's just me being nostalgic about it though because it's been one of my favourite movies since I was a kid.
Well we'll have to watch it sometime then.
Definitely. Then you'll understand the references we make in my family.
Oh boy, I can't wait.
There are a lot of funny scenes in it.
I'm not super familiar with Jim Carrey.
Oh, well I thought this was one of his funnier roles. He really plays up his facial expressions and vocal work in it.
Vocal work?
You'll see what I mean.
Is that the movie the line "pretty bird" is in that I keep hearing?
Yes. I'm sure once you see it you'll be using it, too.
I heard that there's a sequal called Dumb and Dumber To.
Yeah I haven't seen it though, I don't have high hopes for it.
Why not?
I just don't think after all these years they'll be able to recreate the same caliber of humor, plus sequels rarely turn out half as good as the originals.
