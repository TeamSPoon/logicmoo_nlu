Do you have a minute to talk about movies?
I'd rather tell you about this dream I seriously just had.
Is it movie related?
I one-hundred percent is movie related.
That sounds like a good jumping off point.
Listen up, then, because it's also a trivia question. I dreamed I was talking to Edward Norton, and I asked him if he was ever in a Woody Allen movie. He said he was, but one of the early one's. Like his black and white one's after he started making comedies, but I know that's niot right.
But he was in a Woody Allen movie.
Which one was it?
Everyone Says I love You.
Definitely not a black-and-white one. He was the prisoner dude that was in love with... I want to say Drew Barrymore?
Yeah I think so.
That was a musical, right?
It was. I don't remeber any of the songs, though.
Did Edward Norton sing in it?
It seems like he would have too, right, but I can't remember.
It's weird to picture him singing.
Yeah it is. But when we're done, I'm definitely going to see if he sings, on Youtube.
Yeah. I'll do that too.
Also, he was doing an impression of Woody Allen in Sausage Party. It was so good, I had to look up who was doing it.
Oh, wow. I remember that, and I did not think it would be him. Wild stuff.
