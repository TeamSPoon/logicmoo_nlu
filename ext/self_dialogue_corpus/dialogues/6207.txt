Have you seen the movie the Parent Trap?
No I have not, was it it about?
It´s very cool is about this two sister that did not know each other and met at camp.
Really, how is that possible?
They were separated at birth, they are identical twins.
That´s crazy!, why is it called the Parent Trap?
Because they trick their parents to love each other again.
Does it work?
Oh it does! They get married. Do you think you´ll like to see it?
Count me inn! I heard that they have a newer version also.
