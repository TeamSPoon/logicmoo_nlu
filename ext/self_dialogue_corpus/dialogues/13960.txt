What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?
I didn't like her old music but I like her new music.
I'm the opposite, I like her old music better.
It was just way to poppy for me.
Yes a lot of the focus was on the sound rather than her voice but that was good about it.
I like her voice and that's what I want to hear not a bunch of beats.
I noticed her newest album had more vocals.
Yes and now I can enjoy listening to her.
She is very versatile with her music.
I agree she has lots of styles.
