The Force awakens is not that good.
What? It's so cool, HAN, LEIA AND CHEWY, too cool.
You just named the problem, the old characters are more interesting that the new ones.
Jon Boyega was great as the deserting storm trooper.
You dont even remember his character's name? That is exctly the problem.
Well no, but that does not mean the movie's not that good.
I can remember the names of the characters from even some of the old Star Wars movies I did not like.
Rey, I remember Rey from the Force Awakens.
Who's the bad guy who killed Han?
Gee, I dont know. Darth Maul?
