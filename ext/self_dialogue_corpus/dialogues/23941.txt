Have you been to the movies lately?
No.  The last movie I saw in the theater was Ben Hur.
I saw that too back in the fall.
What did you think?
I liked it, but I thought the original was better.
I never saw the original, but I liked Morgan Freeman in the new one.
He was good, but I was disappointed that I didn't know most of the other actors.
I also thought a lot of the female characters in the beginning looked alike.
Yeah, it was hard to tell them apart.
They did a good job making you realize how bad things got for the main character.
They didn't use the name Ben-Hur much.
That's true.  You know, I never knew that Ben-Hur had an actual first name.
Did you like the ending?
No.  It was too perfect.
I have to agree there as well.
I like it when everyone lives happily ever after, but it was a little overboard.
Did you have a favorite part?
I guess the chariot race at the end.
It was predictable.
I agree.
