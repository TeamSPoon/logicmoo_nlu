Did you even like ICP when they were huge?
I think they had talent but I couldnt get into their songs
They were from Detroit, I think the same area as Eminem.
Yeah I think the clown makeup though was too much
The Great Milenko was not a bad ablum to start off with
No but they tried getting up to that level.
The Wraith was also a great album.
That was more progressively different than rap.
Yeah I think they touched on a new audience.
They needed to re-tell the stories of the joker cards.
