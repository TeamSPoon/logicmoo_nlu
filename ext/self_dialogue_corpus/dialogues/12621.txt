BB-8 is the greatest star wars sidekick of all time!
What are you talking about? Even the Ewoks are better than BB-8.
Those fluffy little teddy bears? I don't think so.
What about Chewbacca?
Chewbacca is no ones sidekick. He is his own man.
That's debatable, but even given that, there is no way you can claim BB-8 is a better droid sidekick than R2D2.
Sorry, BB-8 just looks cooler.
Maybe, but R2D2 has much more personality.
R2D2 is nothing without C3P0.
How can you say that? You are so wrong!
