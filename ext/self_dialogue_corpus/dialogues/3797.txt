Have you seen both Prisoners and the prestige?
Yes, both are great thrillers with Hugh Jackman.
That brings me to my question, which is a better performance by him?
Hard call. he is so great in both.
But if you had to pick.
I think prisoners because it is such a dark role. I think it took a lot.
I think he may have more screen time in prisoners , but not really sure.
Like I said hard call overall. I enjoy both films and both of his performances.
I think I would rather rewatch prestige to prisoners.
I think it makes for a more enjoyable rewatch once you know the end.
