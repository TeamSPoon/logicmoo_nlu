what's up with hollywood these days?
why? what happened?
why is it going crazy with superhero movies?
what do you mean by going crazy over superhero movies?
I mean there are so many superhero movies coming every year!
I don't see how that is a problem.
I mean they are increasing each and every year. Initially it was fun, but now it is getting repetitive and annoying.
Don't you think majority of people still enjoy it? may be that is the reason they are producing more superhero movies?
Well, it could be true, But I still feel that they are doing excessive of superhero movies!
What I would suggest is, why don't you watch some other genre movies?
well, can you tell me a name of any good movie these days that is not a superhero movies?
sure, how about fifty shades darker?
I am not into that genre. I find it disgusting!
okay, I am sorry, I didn't know that.
Tell me some good movie in comedy genre.
okay, so have you seen fist fight?
oh yes, I have seen it, it was horrible!
I guess hollywood is having hard time making you happy!
are you making fun of me?
no, no, I am just joking.
