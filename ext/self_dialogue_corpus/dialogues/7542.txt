Do you think the last Harry Potter movie ended well?
You mean with seeing the future of how things all turned out?
Yeah, I'm not sure that was a good idea. I almost would have liked the movie to end before the future scene with characters all grown up.
Yeah, those actors looked like they were playing dress up in grown up clothes.
It was weird for me. I could have done without that. And the creepy Voldemort baby. Yuck.
Yeah, I'm not sure what that was about. I really liked the story and wanted to see what JK Rowling's vision was for her characters, but...
I know. It just seemed like she was over it and then decided to go all Disney.
Well, if you're going to go all magical kingdom...
Yep Disney is where all the magic happens
But I wonder what could have been done if someone like Spielburg had done those movies...it's thought...
