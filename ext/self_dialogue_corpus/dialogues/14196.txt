Did you get Lady Gaga's newest album?
Yes, I got the digital download. What did you think?
It's okay.  I really thought her Bad Romance album was much better.
Yeah, Bad Romance was definitely the best.  Alejandro has to be my favorite song ever.  What's yours?
I love Alejandro. I especially like the video.  The storyline is so creative.
Yes, Lady Gaga really is an allover artist.  Her videos are so poetic.
What is your favorite video?
I really like the Poker Face video.
Why is that your favorite?
The dogs.
