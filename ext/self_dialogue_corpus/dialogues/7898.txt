Who is your favorite pop superstar?
If I had to pick, I would go with Micheal Jackson as his music is classic.
I can not really argue with that, I love thriller as it is such a great song to dance to.
I love thriller but Smooth criminal is my favorite song by Micheal Jackson.
Did you know that Micheal Jackson had his first solo hit when he was just 13 with the song "Got to Be There,"?
No I did not know that, though I do like his work with the Jackson five.
Yeah my favorite song of theirs is ABC.
You could certainly see one Micheal Jackson's talents even then.
Especially dancing and singing in his first complete of songs with the group.
Exactly, that he would go onto to make some of the most famous songs and dances (thriller and the moon walk). May he rest in peace, he will be missed.
