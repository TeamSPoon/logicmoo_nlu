Have you been to a ballgame recently?
Yeah, last week.
How was it?
It's the first time I've been since I was a kid. It was okay.
Did the Reds win?
No, they lost, but it was still a fun time.
I haven't been to many games since I was a kid too. I tried going recently, but it just didn't hold up.
It's definitely more comfortable to sit at home and watch.
Yeah, you don't have to pay for food and you can always see what's going on.
Not to mention you won't get rained on.
They could still call the game though.
It makes me wonder why they play in stadiums without roofs.
Yeah, it's not like someone is going to bounce a ball off the ceiling.
I suppose it would cost too much to upgrade current stadiums.
They would have to build new ones.
I'm surprised they can't, with what they charge for a hot dog.
Yeah, the cost to taste ratio is not good.
It's supposed to be sunny for the next game, though.
It doesn't matter. I'll be watching on TV.
Me too.
