Hey what's up?  Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, my husband and I watched something weird the other night.  It was called the Babadook.
Oh I heard about that!  How was it?
Well, it was strange, but I thought it was entertaining.
What was it about?
It was about a storybook character that came to life.  It was a horror movie.
Oh how spooky!  Yeah, the trailers kinda scared me a little bit.
Yeah, it was definitely scary.  The imagary really haunted me in that movie.
I was worried it looked like it might be corny.
My husband thought it was a little corny, but I was genuinely scared.  I was gripping his arm through the movie.
I love a good scary movie like that!  Did the ending turn out okay?
Yeah, it had a pretty decent ending.  I would recommend watching it.
Who was in it?
I didn't recognize any of the actors or actresses honestly.  There's a single mother and her son.
Those are the main characters?
Yes, but they weren't anyone I've ever seen before.  It seemed like a kinda low budget film.
Oh, well that's okay.  Those can still be amusing sometimes.
Yeah definitely!  I think you should watch this one.
I probably will.  I've been looking for another scary movie to watch.
Well this is the scariest I've seen in awhile.
