In Star Wars, what was the name of the ship that Luke escaped in?
Do you mean the Millennium Falcon?
Yeah that was it. It has been so long since I have seen the movie.
How could you forget the Millennium Falcon?
If you think that is bad I remember that there was a tall dog looking thing and a guy but I cannot remember who they were.
How can you not remember Hans Solo and Chewbacca?
I was probably 7 or 8 the last time I saw it, that was 40 years ago.
How could you not watch Star Wars at least once every couple of years or so?
We need to wast it again.
How does next weekend sound?
