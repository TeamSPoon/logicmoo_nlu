What kind of music do you like?
I like all kinds,  I don't know if I have a favorite
It's hard there's so much different music these days
There is. I like Bruno mars and Katy perry
They are good, I like the Disney stars like Selena gomez and demi Lovato.
They have such good voices.
I like Ariana grande too, I think she's from the Disney channel
Yea she is and Miley Cyrus was good back then too
The Disney Channel picks such good talent
Yea, I'm pretty sure you have to have a great voice to be on the Disney channel
Ashley Tisdale is another one
Oh uea, she was great in high school Musical.
She was.
I also like country
Me too. I love rascals Flatts and lonestar
I prefer newer stuff, like Kane brown
He's pretty good i heard a few of his songs.
I love him, and I love how he looks
No cowboy hat?
It's sterotypical
