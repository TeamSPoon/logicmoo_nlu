Did anyone get to see Jurassic World yet?
Yes, that was fantastic. I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park movies.
Colin Trevorrow the director did an amazing job in this movie.
I didn't realize it was Colin that directed it. Who was the leading woman in this one?
Bryce Dallas Howard played in this one.
That's right, she was great in leading The T rex out of the paddock to kill the one they manufactured!
They kept her running through the whole movie in heals no less!
They made over $529 million dollars on that movie alone.
That is incredible, I know it probably had some awards too.
I am sure they will make theme park rides of it!
