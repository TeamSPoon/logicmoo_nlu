Less than one month until some sort of football begins
It's about time.
Who do you think will get over the hump to the Superbowl this season?
I have a feeling that the Cowboys are going to finally reach the big game.
They probably should have made it there last year.
That pass rush they had wasn't god enough.
That was exposed mightily during the Green Bay game in the playoffs.
That was honestly the best game of the season.
I thought it was over when the Packers were blowing them out.
So did I. Then the Cowboys kept scoring and it was suddenly a close game.
I haven't looked at the draft too closely, so I don't know if they drafted on the defensive end last season.
Neither did I. I don't have time to watch a three day event every April.
They probably will have a better defense than last year.
That's all they really need. Everything else can remain the same
Yeah. Elliott, Dak and an unstoppable O-line equals success every time.
That offensive Jerry Jones built is insane.
Aren't all five of the starters first round picks?
I think they are and their backups are even pretty good.
Isn't Doug Free a backup yet he is actually pretty good.
Yeah, but he retired this year, so that depth isn't there anymore.
