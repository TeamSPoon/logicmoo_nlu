See you Nickelback and Corey Taylor are fighting?
Excuse me you're going to have to wait two seconds while I stop laughing.
Your reaction is the same as mine, what a ridiculous feud.
What's the fight about?
Nickelback made some statement about writing a hit and Corey Taylor responded by calling Chad Kroeger names.
Like, schoolyard names?
Yes he mentioned something about his face being ugly.
This is the best news I have ever heard.
I knew you'd enjoy it, two bands we hate going at it, what's not to love?
Maybe they'll reconcile by writing an album together that will end the world.
