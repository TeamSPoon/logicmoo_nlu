Did you see the deadpool movie?
I did and loved it.
Do  you remember who the actor was that played deadpool?
Ryan Reynolds I believe.
That was an awesome choice for the actor.
Yeah he did a great job.
Wasn't he trying to get Wolverine in the movie too.
I think he just wanted to get Hugh Jackmon in the movie.
I wonder why?
I'm not sure but he was pretty determined.
Sadly it didn't happen maybe in the next one.
Yeah maybe if we're lucky.
Do you think there will be more movies?
Definitely it was a big hit.
It's not really family friendly though you think it was that big?
$783 million I believe.
How much did it cost to make?
Around $60 million.
That's a big profit.
Sure is.
