Do you like whale music?
What is that?
Whales, humpbacks in particular are very vocal when they  speak to one another.
Really? But how could it sound like singing?
If you go look it up on the net you will see a lot of videos. Just pick one that say whale song. It is really amazing to hear.
I whale! I couldn't help myself!
Great! While you are looking there are some recordings of whale song that have other sounds and music mixed with it as whale!!
Nice! Touche! You got me back with one whale of a tail!
The whale song is incorporated into a lot of New Age music.
I could see why that would be. I am sure it is very relaxing?
You know they all sound so different. I mean each species.
Really? What other ones are there to listen to?
The killer whale has a very low slow horn like sound while the humpback is higher pitched and sounds more like talking/singing.
That's interesting. I want to know more or actually just hear them for myself.
Oh I would love to be in the ocean and feel the sound when it comes through the water.
That would be amazing to feel the music literally1
You know I wonder what it would be like to have different species of whale sound on  a mixing board and create a song using their voices.
Sounds intriguing. Do it!
Hey you know what I just might.
Make a whale choir or an orchestres .
