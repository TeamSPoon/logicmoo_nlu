Hey man, you think Dak Prescott is gonna win MVP this year?
No, I think the Cowboys are gonna be really disappointed with him.
Why? That guys is awesome!
No he's not, I mean he's ok.
So what are you talking about.
Dak did really good last year because the Cowboys running game was so strong.
I mean, he still was a good quarterback, and could be again?
Yeah but he caught teams by surprise.  They'll be more prepared this year.
I don't know how you can say that.
I mean, running quarterbacks like him, Kaeparnick, they almost always have a glaring weakness.
So why didn't other teams exploit it?
IT just takes time, you have to get film on them first.
I guess I see what you're saying.
Yeah, that's what makes guys like Cam Newton, or Aaron Rodgers so tough.
Yeah they don't really have as much of a passing weakness.
Right, but they can still run with the best of em.
Well I still think the Cowboys are gonna, 'run' away with the NFC!
Well you are a mindless, simple drone of the NFL hype machine.
Whatever bro, you just wish you had this good of a team.
The bucs are going all the way this year, I promise you.
