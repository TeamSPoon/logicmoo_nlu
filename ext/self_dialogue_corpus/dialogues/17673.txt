Have you ever heard of Out of the Grey?
No, who is that?
It's a husband and wife music duo. I used to listen to their music, long ago.
What's a song that you really liked?
It's kind of an older pop sound. One of my favorite songs is "So We Never Got to Paris."
What's that song about?
It's about married life.
That sounds boring. What do you mean?
The song is about how you may have many plans when you're young, but they don't pan out.
A depressing song!
No, I actually like it a lot. It's not depressing.
How so?
It's about how you may never do what you want, but you build a world together, and still have a wonderful life.
Oh, I guess that sounds sort of sweet.
It is. Another good song of theirs is "Gravity."
What's it about?
You can watch the old music video on YouTube. It's about judgment, I guess, about grace or grave.
I guess I'll go watch the video on YouTube to find out more.
They're a good group--they met in college, I believe. She sings, and he provides instrumental.
That sounds neat. I will check them out.
