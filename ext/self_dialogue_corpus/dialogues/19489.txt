Are you a fan of metal music?
Absolutely! My favorite band is Metallica.
Hey, same here! Do you have a favorite song?
I'd definitely have to go with One. I just love how the song goes from being so mellow to a barrage of thrash metal.
I really like that too, but it's not my favorite.
So then which song is your favorite?
I'd probably have to go with Sad But True. I like the more straightforward hard rock style.
So you're a fan of 90s Metallica?
I'm willing to say yes. I know that most aren't though.
I respect that. I'll admit that their 90s albums are a guilty pleasure of mine.
Why a guilty pleasure?
Because the majority of the people a hang around with hate those albums.
Oh, I see.
St. Anger is also a guilty pleasure of mine.
I hated St. Anger. The snare in that album makes it tough to get through.
I get that, but I still really like it. I think it's more raw than most other Metallica albums.
Since we're talking about Metallica, have you heard their last album?
Hardwired? Yeah, and I thought it was solid.
Same here. My favorite track was Atlas, Rise.
Mine was Spit Out the Bone.
