Did you ever see The Accountant?
Wasn't that the movie that came out with Ben Affleck?
Yep.  I saw it on a plane the other day.
What's the verdict?
Pretty forgettable.  He's not a very likeable hero and the action scenes were bland.
It kind of bombed at the box office if I remember correctly.
Ben Affleck is just not an action star.
I think he's a better director than actor personally.
Agreed.  He needs to stay out of the camera lens as his true talent lies elsewhere.
Hopefully his next movie will be better.
