Hello! How are you?
I am well, and you?
I'm good too, have you seen the new movie Boss Baby?
No, I haven't saw that one.
What kind of movies do you like?
I like comedy, romance and sometimes even horror movies.
When was the last time you went to a theatre?
It has been a while, probably 9 months.
Wow!  I go to the theatre atleast every three months!
Yes, I would rather watch movies when they come out at home.
I like going with my family.
Yeah, but I'm not married and usually just watch TV alone.
I see your point.  What was the last movie you saw in the theatre?
I went to see Secret Life of Pets with my niece and nephew.
Oh, I saw that movie!  It was great.
Yes, they loved it.  I thought it was cute.
Are there any movies out now that you would like to see?
By  myself or with my niece and nephew?
By yourself, what would you want to see?
Probably the new Baywatch movie, it looks funny.
