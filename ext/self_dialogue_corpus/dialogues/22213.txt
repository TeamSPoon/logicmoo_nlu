What comedies are coming out that look good?
None whatsoever they look basic.
What do you mean
They just look too generic.
Comedy films have fallen off of late.
Some of the best comedians have jumped ship
In terms of political correctness?
No I mean in terms of like wanting to do more in the genre.
So they are transcending the genre?
I think thats a bad word to use.
So they are selling out.
Yeah I like that phrase better.
What makes you believe they are selling out?
They want the money like most actors in Hollywood.
Its a shame, the 90s had some great films.
Adam Sandler ruled the roost.
You could say Saturday Night Live did it.
Oh yeah Farley was a hoot in his flicks.
Yeah so see it was a method now they arent doing that.
They have one film and then theyre done.
