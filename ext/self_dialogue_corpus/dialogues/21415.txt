What movie do you think is the best of all time?
2001: A Space Odyssey.
Is that your favorite too?
No, my favorite is Barry Lyndon.
Who is in that one?
Ryan O'neal. Stanley Kubrick directed it.
Didn't he also do 2001?
Yes
What is Barry Lyndon about?
A social climber who wants to gain a title.
Sounds good. What is so special about it to you?
The fact that Kubrick had a special lens made just for the film and it had such a wide aperture that the candlelit scenes had no other lighting than the candles.
That sounds very advanced.
Yes, the film is beautiful.
What else did Kubrick make?
He made The Shining and Dr. Strangelove and Eyes Wide Shut and a few more.
Is he your favorite director?
By far he is my favorite.
I will have to check out his films.
You definitely should. Watch 2001 first.
