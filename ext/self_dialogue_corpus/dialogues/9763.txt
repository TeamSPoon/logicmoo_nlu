Have you heard any good rap albums lately?
Kendrick Lamar's latest album is spectacular.
Really? I haven't listened to it yet.
What are you waiting for!? You need to hear it!
What makes it so special?
Every song is very well-executed. There isn't a weak song on the whole album.
Is it as good as his previous album?
Yes, but it's much different. The new album is leaner and more focused.
I'll have to check it out then.
Yes, please do. I think it might be even better than "To Pimp a Butterfly" in some ways.
