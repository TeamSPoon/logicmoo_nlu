I would love to find an awesome scary movie to watch!
Yeah me to, I am in the mood for something old school.
Are you talking about a movie from Hitchcock or something like that?
Not really, I am thinking perhaps the Shining.
Stephen King huh? I dont know, I have heard that one is really scary.
You mean, you have not ever watched The Shining?
Nope! I have always wanted to, but admittedly I am a bit of a chicken.
The Shining is definitely a must watch for anyone looking for a classic horror movie.
That is what I have heard! Who all stars in that one?
Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson are the two main stars.
Great, I have always been a fan of both of those actors, especially Jack!
In my opinion, this was by far the creepiest role he ever played!
I think I will take your word for it! I am nervous about watching this one.
I am not going to lie, there were a few parts that even made me jump!
What year did The Shining come out? Seems like it has been out forever.
It was released for the first time on May 23rd, 1980.
I am thinking this movie was by Wes Craven, correct?
Nope, this one was done by Stephen King. Without question one of his most famous works ever.
I think I am ready to quit being a chicken and watch it now!
Great, I will get the popcorn!
