Clive owens best movie is Shoot Em Up what do you think?
I would say that maybe it was his second best movie
What movie did you think was his best?
Children of Men of course you asked for Action movie so I would probably say Sin City
Oh my god I forgot about Sin City that Frank Miller comic was great
It was a comic?
Yeah it was a graphic novel before it was a movie
Kind of like the walking dead was a graphic novel first
yes exactly I highly recommend picking it up at the comic store
heading that way right after we are done here
