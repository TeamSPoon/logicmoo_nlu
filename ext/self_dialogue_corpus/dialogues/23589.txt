What's your favorite bad movie?
Favorite BAD movie?
Yeah, like one you know is not well done, but you enjoy watching it anyway.
Oh, I guess it's Grease 2, then.
There's a Grease 2?
Yes, and it's terrible, but so much fun to watch.  Catchy, but bizarre songs, silly plot, bad editing.
Sounds awesome.
It kind of is.  It has Michelle Pfeiffer singing about how she wants a Cool Rider.
Okay, you've sold me on this terribleness that I have to see.  I'll have to see if I can find it somewhere.
You should.  So, what's your favorite bad movie?
That's a tough call.  There's The Ice Pirates, which is a weird parody/rip-off of like Star Wars and other sci-fi movies.
The Ice Pirates.  I don't think I've ever heard of it.
They used to show it on TV, late.  It had Robert Urich and Joan Rivers, or at least her voice as a robot.
Joan Rivers?
Yeah.  The robot was also kind of styled like her.
I don't even know what to say to that.
Ha.  But I think I'd actually pick Cutthroat Island as my favorite.
That huge flop with Geena Davis?
Yes, and Matthew Modine.  It's incredibly ridiculous and I love it.
Okay, I guess bad pirate movies must really do it for you.
