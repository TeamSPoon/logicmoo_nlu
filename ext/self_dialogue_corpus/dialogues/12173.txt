Hey, what do you think about Jar Jar?
As little as possible! I don't think he was quite as bad as people say, though.
Oh, did you like him?
Not really, I just think some people took their dislike a little too seriously. They overthought it.
Don't you feel that he was over the top?
Yes, but he also fit the youthful theme on the first prequel. I think each movie had it's own feel.
How So?
Episode one was childhood, Episode two was our teen years. Episode 3 was becoming an adult.
Wow, now you are overthinking things.
Maybe so, but if you evaluate them individually, they work a lot better than if you compare them to the original trilogy.
