You know what movie we should watch that I haven't seen in ages?
That's not very helpful.  I could probably name a thousand movies.
Willow.  Do you remember Willow?
Oh yes.  The one with the midget.
That's a horrible description for the film.
Well, I'm not sure how else to put it really.
First off, he's not a midget, he's a dwarf.  Secondly, it was a period piece.
It wasn't a period piece.  It's fantasy, we never had a time of magic like that.
You get what I mean.  Anyway, that was a pretty solid film back in the late 80's.
Didn't Ron Howard direct that?
I think he did.  It was one of his bigger projects to that date.
I remember Val Kilmer was also in it.
Yeah, he played the hero swordsman.  That was 30 years ago when he was in much better shape.
He played the character pretty well as the character had a bit of an edge to him.
I always hated that scene where she was turning everyone into pigs.
I remember that!  Gave me nightmares as a child.
She kept saying "You're all PIGS!" and the soldiers are in agony turning into pigs.
Don't remind me.  I told you, it gives me nightmares.
You know what, maybe we shouldn't watch it now that I think about it.
Agreed.  I don't need to relive those nightmares.
