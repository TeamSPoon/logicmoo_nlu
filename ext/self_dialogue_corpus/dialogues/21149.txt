I miss parody films. I wish they'd come back.
We still have parody movies.
I mean good ones, like in the old days. Airplane and movies like that.
We just got Scary Movie 5 a few years ago.
And it was terrible, even compared to the other Movie films.
The other Scary Movie films weren't bad, were they?
No. Though, the first two had a different style from the third and fourth.
Why did they change?
After the first two movies, David Zucker who had worked on movies like Airplane and Top Secret! took over.
Oh, that guy. Didn't he also do the Naked Gun movies?
Yeah, along with Jim Abrahams. Personally, I always thought Abrahams was the better of the three.
The three? Who else was there?
There was also David Zucker's brother, Jerry Zucker. He made Rat Race.
Rat Race, huh? Yeah, I guess I can see his style in that.
Yeah, but like I said, Abrahams was the best of the three, even though they all worked together on a lot of their films.
What movies is he responsible for?
Only the two best spoof movies ever; Hot Shots!, and Hot Shots! Part Deux.
Heh. They definitely don't make them like that anymore.
No, instead we get things like Meet the Spartans, and we hardly even get movies like those anymore.
Maybe spoof movies are just a thing of the past.
