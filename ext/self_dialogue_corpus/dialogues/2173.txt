Did you hear about NFL losing more ads?
No, what happened?
Two of their major advertisers dropped out.
Wow, really? How come?
NFL ratings are tanking, it seems like. Either people aren't watching it or they're doing it and not watching the ads.
Well, we knew knew things like TiVo and the internet were gonna change. How's the NFL handling it?
More merch, I guess. I think they gotta get more exciting.
I mean, I don't know if you can get more exciting than last year's Super Bowl.
The comeback was amazing, but I think the fact that it was the Patriots left a sour taste in people's mouths.
Americans like the underdog.
That, and most of us are sick of Tom Brady.
I guess there aren't as many interesting teams any more.
There are some--I'd like a redemption story for the Falcons.
They had a really great season last year, despite their loss.
Yeah, they just choked at the end there.
Matt Ryan still their quarterback?
Yeah, him and Schaub. Both Matts though.
Mm. They don't really have any star players, I wouldn't say.
No, but they work together well as a team.
Well. Hopefully they can bring some fire back to the NFL.
