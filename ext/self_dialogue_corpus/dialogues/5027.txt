Baseball sure is a slow game. I don't recall it being so slow as a kid.
Yeah, it is a lot slower than it was, say, 20-30 years ago.
I wonder why that is?
I think, in part, it is due to the use of so many more specialist relievers.
What do you mean? How would that slow down the game.
Well, if you bring many more relievers into a game mid-inning, then they have to warm up and come in from the bullpen.
Oh, yeah, that would slow down the game. Why else is the game slower now than it used to be?
Well, also you have to factor in reviewing questionable plays and the time that takes.
Yeah, but they have cut down that review time.
And, advertisements between innings are a little longer on average then they used to be 30 years ago.
All of this adds up to a much longer game and given this attention deficit-type of society, I can't see baseball being around much longer.
Well, I don't know about that, but there are a few other ways they can speed up the game.
Like what?
Well, they could have advertisements only at the end of innings, not mid-inning.
I can't see that happen. The more revenue streams for broadcasts, the better. There not going to reduce their revenue.
Maybe that's true, but there's not really a way to enforce a quicker game as the game is played today.
Maybe it's the sports fan that has to adjust to devoting three-and-a-half hours to a game.
There's something to be said for that. Baseball is a past time, so we should take time out from our busy lives.
Who knows. It may be that they get rid of baserunning altogether, shaving game times by 30 minutes or so.
Only time will tell.
