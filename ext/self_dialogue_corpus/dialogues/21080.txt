Have you seen  Guardians  of the  galaxy 2 ?
I have not  yet is it as  good  as the first one ?
I think its  fairly  better  it has  a deeper  story
Do they  say who star lords  dad is ?
They do and  they also  focus alot  on Yondu in this one .
I think  there  should be    a Yondu Prequel film as he is one of the best  characters
I also  really  like  what they did  with baby groot in this one  too
Did  baby groot  grow up  any  at  all?
No he  stayed the same  size  he  was more or  less  a side  character  for jokes
Did  they show any more about  Rocket ?
No  but they did  show  him grow  closer  to the  team .
Do you think there will be a  third one ?
I think  we  will see  the  guardians  will  be  around a very long  time .
Did  any  characters  die ?
Yes one  does  but I dont  want  to spoil  it  for  you
Was  there  one  scene  that  stands out ?
There is a  scene  with Yondu and mary Poppins  that  will  be  around  for  a  very long  time
Were any  new  characters  introduced ?
They showed  starlords  dad   and they did  introduce   a new villian
I  am  going  to have to  go  see  it  tonight
