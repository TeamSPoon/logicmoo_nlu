I want to do watch a couple of movies from the same actor, which actor would you recommend?
Definitely Matt Damon, he has so many good movies.
Really? Like which ones? Which would you recommend?
The Great Wall, Interstellar, The Martian, The Bourne series, Elysium, The Informant!, The Departed, Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting just to name a few.
Wow! You were right, he definitely is in a lot of movies. I heard good reviews about The Martian, what do you think?
Well, the reviews are right, it´s an amazing movie, it takes you through a journey of survival and not giving up.
Wow! I will definitely consider it then. What about Interstellar?
It´s a Science fiction, he is not the main character, but the movie as a wholes is amazing. It´s another journey through space.
Really? Who else is in the movie then?
You have actors like Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain.
Oh wow! A whole good hollywood cast, then I must be really good!
It is! If you watch this two I just mentioned, you also have to see Good Will Hunting, it´s a classical.
I will! What is it about though?
It´s about this janitor who works at MIT but in reality is super smart, has a huge IQ, but he also has anger problems, and it shows how he deals with this once he is discovered by a professor.
Wow like you said, it´s a must see! What other actors are there in this movie?
You find Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, etc.
Wow! Minnie Driver! I haven´t seen her in movies lately.
Me either, the last I remember her is in Ella Enchanted a kid´s movie.
I really liked one of her earlier movies called Circle of Friends.
Me too! I hope she comes back, she is a good actress. I know she was also in a movie called Beyond The Lights.
