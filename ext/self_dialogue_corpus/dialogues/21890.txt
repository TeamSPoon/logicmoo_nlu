My husband and I watched a great movie last night.
Oh yeah?  What was it?
It's called No Country for Old Men.  It won an Emmy or something.
Oh yeah, I heard of that!  It has Tommy Lee Jones, right?
Yes!  I love Tommy Lee Jones.
Me too.  He's a great actor.
Yeah, totally.  This was a great movie, although definitely a bit strange.
What was strange about it?
Well, it wasn't your typical pace.  It moved very slow, although the suspense was ongoing.
Was it boring?
No, I wouldn't say boring.  But it was just different and unique in how it was presented.
It was kinda long if I remember correctly, right?
Yeah, I think almost two hours.  It did drag at some parts.
Hmm, do you think I should watch it?
Well overall it's worth seeing.  The cinematography is beautiful.
That's what I heard.
Yeah, and just the general quirkiness of it is interesting.  There's this really strange character.
Tommy Lee Jones' character?
No, it's the villain he's chasing.  He's very strange.
Okay, I will watch it tonight and see what I think!
