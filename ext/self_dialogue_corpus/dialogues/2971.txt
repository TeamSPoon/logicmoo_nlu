What do you think of the NFL's take on protecting the players now days?
What do you mean?
I mean all the rule changes with making the game less smash smouth.
Oh right, I'm not sure it's still football though.
Yes it is but a slower game than it was.
You have to admit things were getting out of control.
I can't argue with you.
People now days are so much faster and stronger on average than they were 20-30 years ago.
You think there are just too many good athletes now that it was becoming too dangerous?
It was always dangerous but when you have that many players on the field flying around it's over the top.
I see your point.
They might have taken it too far.
If the referees want to be jerks they could throw a flag every play.
That's true.
I just don't think that is a good thing.
Nobody wants to play hard only to be told that they need to tone it down.
Good point.
Who wants to be told by their boss to stop working so hard.
Just doesn't make sense.
I agree.
