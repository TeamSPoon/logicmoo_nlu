When I was a kid I remember going to see Lady and the Tramp.
Oh, that's a favorite Disney movie of mine!
I loved the opposites attract story line. So romantic.
Yeah, it's funny that an animated dog can be more romantic than the men I date!
Too true!
I also loved Peggy Lee singing the the iconic He's A Tramp.
Maybe that movie is why every man I've gone out with was also totally opposite of me.
Your love life was inspired by an animated dog?
Hey, there are far worse blueprints to follow!
That is true.
