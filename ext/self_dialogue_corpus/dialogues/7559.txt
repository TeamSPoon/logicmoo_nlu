Who is your all time favorite Harry Potter Character?
Harry, duh....
Really mine is Snape.
Oh you got to be kidding. Why Snape?
Because he is the ultimate conflicted character. He's bad and good.
No he's not. He just a jerk that has issues. And he cause the death of Harry's parents.
I suppose you would see it that way, but he did make up for past mistakes.
You think? Tell that to Harry...growing with the Dursley's and always having Voldemort trying to kill him. At least Voldemort let him finish school each year.
Yeah, it was good of him. That's what make Snape great, he didn't buy in to the Harry worship.
No he was just jealous....of Harry, James, everyone....bitter old man.
