I finally got around to watching Moana.
What did you think about it.
I absolutely loved it.
It looks beautiful and I hear that the soundtrack is awesome too.
Yes it was visually beautiful and also the music is so catchy.
Do you think you will by the movie?
It is one I would want to own for sure.
I think Disney is the best in animation.
Oh, no doubt about that.
I have never been disappointed in any Disney film.
