Lets talk about the 1st rao song you can remember.
for me it was the song that raped about bad food at a party.
That was Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang.
Yes that was in 1979 and I remember that the album had a candy like label on it.
That was a classic rap song.
Now I remember a rap called the revoloution will not be televised.
Yes that was Gilbert "Gil" Scott-Heron
I concider him the firest rapper.
He was before my time but I would have to say the first rap was the mack.
Yes everything he said was considered  rap in the early 70's.
