Have you seen any of the movies that Rob Zombie has made?
I do not know, isn't he a singer though?
Well yes, but he started making films as well.
What is one of his films.
Have you heard of The Devil's Rejects?
Yes I have, did he make that movie?
He did! His wife even starred in it.
No way, that movie was great!
I guess the budget on it was very  very small.
I never would of guessed, that movies was really good and kind of creepy as well.
Did you like the clown in it?
He was pretty creepy in his own way, gross too though.
I have not seen it in a long time, I would not mind watching it again.
I have the movie if you want to watch it together
Yes, sounds like a plan.
The movie even has some behind the scenes stuff.
Well, maybe we can learn something new about the movie.
He has some other movies I have not seen.
I can't remember the names, but I know there are more.
I will look into it, and we will watch his other movies.
