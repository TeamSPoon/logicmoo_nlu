Have you seen Pineapple Express yet?
I'm not sure I've heard of that one. Who is in it?
James Franco, Seth Rogen. A few others
Oh yeah! Oh I bet it is funny
It had me cracking up several times.
Is it worth it to go see?
for sure. I would not bring kids though.
Oh why not?
Quite a bit of drug use. Language, the usual Seth Rogen humor. ha!
Gotchya! Well I will ask some girlfriends to go. I love James Franco!
Me too! I need more movies he is in to watch.
He was great in Harvey Milk.
Yes! What a role that was to play.
I think he is more recently in "Why Him."
Is that where he plays the sketchy boyfriend?
Yes! Great part for him.
Agree! Loved him also in 127 hours
Oh gosh that one was hard to watch at times!
Yup I had to turn away when he cut his arm off.
Same here! yikes.
