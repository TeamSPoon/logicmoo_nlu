Did you like the movie Signs?
I didnt not like it if thats what you are asking.
I just didnt know if you thought the plot twist was great.
I thought it was good, I just think the ending was sort of lame.
It was a great film in my opinion.
All of his movies seem to follow a parallel.
What is that?
Some bizarre head scratching thing happens quickly in the movie.
Quick? I think his movies are deliberate.
You can tell half way through what is probably going to happen.
What about Split?
I did not see that.
Why not?
I think it was going to be the same as all his others.
It was pretty good.
Did the ending wrap the movie up?
I may be biased but I think the entire films he creates are just about perfect.
I think you dont have an opinion others share.
He is a good producer and can write a great suspense movie.
He can do eighty percent of it, the other twenty is mediocre as heck.
