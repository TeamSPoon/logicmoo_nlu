You know what team I like as a real darkhorse this year?
Who are you thinking?
Here's a hint: it's in the NFC.
The Cowboys?
No, that's too trendy.  I was thinking of the Bucs.
Ah yes, they made real strides last year.
I like Winston as QB.  Smart, accurate...
He threw some bad picks in some games, but he's young and learning.
It helps when you've got guys to throw to like Mike Evans.
If he could keep his emotions in check, he could be a top five receiver.
I think they added Desean Jackson.
He's lost a few steps, but could be a good slot guy.
They've also got one of my favorite DT's in McCoy.
He's a bit overrated.  Seems like everybody forgets him.
Sure, but he's got some talent.
What do you think of their running back situation?
I love Doug Martin, if he can stay healthy.
That's a big if.  He's taking a real pounding as of late.
If they can just feed him 15 carries a game, he can get through the season.
They just need to pass, pass, pass.
