Have you ever heard of Alkaline Trio?
No I dont think I have.
They play pop rock music.
Let me guess there are 3 of them?
How astute of you!
Where are they from
Mostly Chicago, sometimes they mention San Francisco.
Do they have a large discography?
They have been making music since 1997.
Oh wow! What label are they on.
They seem to change labels alot.
So is it a major one?
They once were but now they are on Epitaph Records.
OK I may have heard of that label.
They are run by Brett Guerwitz.
That name sounds very familiar.
He was a pioneer in the punk rock scene.
Oh ok, but back to Alkaline Trio, do they tour much?
One of the singers is also singing for Blink 182 right now.
OK I know who you are talking about!
