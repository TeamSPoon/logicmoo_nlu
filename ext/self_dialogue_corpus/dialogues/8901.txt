So, any bands you looking to see this Summer?
I don't know man, but I'm really dying to see Metallica. I heard they're gonna be in concert in Orlando.
Really man? What date are they going to play?
July 5th, I was thinking about ordering tickets on Stubhub.
Dude, I am so down to go, but I don't have money for a ticket.
That's alright man, I can buy you a ticket when I order mine, just pay me back when you get paid.
For real man? You're the best, this show is going to be awesome!
Hell yeah man, I can't wait to see them perform Master of Puppets live.
Dude, I hope they play Ride the Lightning. That's my favorite song.
Another great song too man, I am so hyped for this!
