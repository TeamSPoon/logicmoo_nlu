Did you ever see the movie Hairspray?
Which one? There have been several.
I'm talking about the one from 1988 that had Sonny Bono, Ruth Brown, and Divine in it.
Oh yeah!  That was the best for sure.
Yeah, I know there was another in 2007 or something wasn't there?
Yeah, it was the same story about Tracy Turnblad.  Did you not see it?
Nope, I just saw the original, probably over a dozen times.
Yeah it was one of my favorites as a kid too.  I loved the dancing.
Oh yeah.  That and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.
Those were the best!
Hairspray discussed some social issues too, though.  It had meaning and depth.
Yeah it really did.  I think it's also a musical?
Yeah it totally is.  It's on Broadway.
Is it still playing?
I'm not sure.  I'd love to see it if so.
Well I'd say it's a classic from the eighties for sure.
Yeah it is.  The soundtrack was great too.
I love all that old music.
Can you believe Ricki Lake played Traci?
No, that's crazy.  I used to love her show, too.
