Hey were you at the game last night?
Which game?
The Shiners and the Warriors game.
No!  I didn't know they were playing last night.
Yeah, the Shiners killed the Warriors.
Oh, that's kinda surprising.  I thought the Warriors were supposed to win.
That's what I had heard too but apparently not.
So what happened?
Well, it was pretty close at half time but towards the end Williams got several three pointers and then some free throws that really tipped things in their favor.
Williams always gets the long shots.
Yeah I know.  It was close though.
What was the final score?
I think it was like 78-75 or something like that.
Wow that is close.
Yeah!  So next week the Shiners are playing the Combats at home.
I'll probably go to that one.
Yeah, be sure to go early.  There was almost no parking left when I got there.
Where were they playing?
At the Johnson Center.
Oh, yeah their parking always sucks.
