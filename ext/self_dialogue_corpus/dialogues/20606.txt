You know what's on tonight? Check it out, "Avatar".
You mean the one about the blue-skinned people with the tails? Who's in that again?
Uhm, Sigorney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and Zoe Saldana. You want to watch it?
Of course! I love the beginning of it, when Worthington learns about the forest. Those cool spinning plant-things are fun.
Yeah, I like the ultraviolet feel of the plants, and those cool flying dragons they use are great!
Jarhead Clan, hah! It's funny that they like to incorporate the Marines, even out in space.
Why were they trying get the planet again? Some kind of ore, right?
Yeah, they had this need for the stuff for raw power, and that tree that the blue people lived in was right on top of a giant deposit of it.
But the ore was really the life-stuff that came from the tree and the people and their connection with it, right?
I don't know, I think so. what did you think about that telepathic stuff with the plants and animals?
I liked it, especially when they took their tails and attached their nerve fibers to things. Sort of like when Spock from Star Trek did a mind-meld.
Yeah, only a little more physical. What er the people of the planet called?
The Na'vi. I wish I could be one of them.
Yeah, to be able to have a tail like that and jump from tree to tree, and ride on dragons, that would be so cool!
Did you see that they started a park in Disneyland about "Avatar"? it's named after the planet...
Pandora was the name of the planet. I'd love to go there, but I figure it's kind of for kids.
Nah, they teach you the Na'vi language and stuff, and give you a little flying dragon to play with.
No kidding? Those were called flying banshee. I'd love one of those to play with.
Yeah, but you'd have to find the one that wants to kill you and master it before you could ride it!
Hum, that would be a little frustrating and dangerous, wouldn't it? Hah, let's just watch it, turn it on!
