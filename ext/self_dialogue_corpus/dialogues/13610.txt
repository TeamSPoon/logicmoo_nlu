Hey, what did you think of the Phantom Menace?
It was okay, but it's could've been better.
Yeah, it could've been. Did you know that's why Geroge Lucas started Star War's at Episode IV rather than I.
No, is that true?
Yes, George was afraid that Episode I wouldn't grab the audience strong enough to succeed, so he moved forawrd to Episode 4
Well, that seems to have been a smart move on his part.
Yeah, but I think part of Phantom Menace's problem was casting Anakin as a little kid.
Really, you think so?
Absolutley, when Obi-wan talks to Luke about his father, he was soupposed to have been "the best pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior".
Oh, I see. How could a nine year old slave kid be that?
