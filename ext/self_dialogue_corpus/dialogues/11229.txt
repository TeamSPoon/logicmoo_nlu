I heard eighties fashion is making a come back for the summer in 2017.
Really? I have to go check out some vintage clothing stores.
Exactly, ruffle skirts with wide buckle belts are a must to have for your closet, the Carrie Bradshaw look.
Another must is those wide power shoulder blouses, I think my mom has some thrown way back in her closet somewhere.
Bralettes too, which can be worn by themselves or with some sheer sparkly tops, the way MaDonna use too.
French bikinis are sure to bring attention at the beach as well, the ones with stripes and bright colors.
Yes, bright colors, sparkles, the more bling, the better this summer.
I remember Tom Cruise in Top Gun with those wayfarers which will definitely be a beach accessory.
I am a sucker for the eighties hair bands too, I love the spandex and larger than life hair.
the bigger the hair the better, and off the shoulder crop tops, mini skirt and thigh high boots.
The vintage concert shirts will certainly be a blast from the past.
I bet we could go on ebay and find some of those vintage concert t-shirts.
I bet we could, or the demnim jackets with all the concert buttons on them so retro chic.
The leather studded pants and jackets will definitely be a hit with the big leather studded hobo bags.
We will have to go find some desinger eighties inspired handbags as well.
Kate Spades new small striped Maya tote is influenced by the love of stripes in the eighties.
I know I love Michael Kors Saffiano black/metallic stud large tote bag, very eighties inspired.
Michael Kors was heavily inspired by Valentino and his Astor Uptown shoulder tote shows the flair of the eighties with the rivets.
I can't wait to look like Julia Roberts from Pretty Women in my spandex dress and thigh high boots and rock the eighties.
I prefer to look like Julia Roberts from Pretty Women in the red flowing silk gown and show my eighties elagance.
