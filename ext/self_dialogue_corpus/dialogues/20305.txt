What's your favorite superhero movie.
The Dark Knight.
That movie is so good that it's hard to even put that in the same tier as the more traditional superhero movies, such as Spiderman or Ironman.
Agreed. Everything about that movie from Christopher Nolan's direction to Heath Ledger's Joker is outstanding.
Yeah, Heath Ledger definitely deserved the Oscar for his performance, especially considering he was robbed for Brokeback Mountain.
You don't think that Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved it that year for Capote?
I think that he was good, but Ledger was better. However, now that your remind me that Phillip Seymour Hoffman won that year, I am not as mad.
Phillip Seymour Hoffman was such a versatile actor. I'd say my favorite of his movies were Magnolia and Almost Famous.
Not Doubt?
He gave an amazing performance in Doubt, although the film's subject matter made me very uncomfortable.
Very understandable. I just think that between him, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis, that is one of the best ensemble casts that we've ever seen in a film.
I never thought of it that way. However, I do think Meryl Streep is kind of overrated.
Really? She is one of the most versatile film actresses ever in my opinion.
I think that she might be reasonably considered the greatest film actress of all time. My problem is that this reputation allows her to receive Oscar nominations for films that don't warrant them, such as Florence Foster Jenkins.
That was a great comedic performance. I also liked her chemistry with Hugh Grant in that film.
She was good, although I think that I liked her more in The Devil Wears Prada.
Well that's one of the all time villains in film history.
That's a bit of an exaggeration. Kathy Bates in Misery was much better of a villain.
Forgot about her. I try not to watch films based on Stephen King stories.
You're missing some amazing films then like Carrie and The Shinning then.
