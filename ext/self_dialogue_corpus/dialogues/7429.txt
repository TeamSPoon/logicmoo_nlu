What's your favorite Disney movie?
Hands down The Lion King.
Nice that's my choice as well, such a classic film.
It really is and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I cried when Mufasa died.
It really hit you right in the heart, Scar was a great villain though.
Oh absolutely one if the best that Disney has ever had.
Couldn't agree more, but it was so nice when Simba got his revenge.
It was truly a feel good sort of moment.
I sometimes wish they would make a sequel, I know they have made a direct to video one, but a proper theatrical sequel.
My only concern would be, could they capture the same magic again?
