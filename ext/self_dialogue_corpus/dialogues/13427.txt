Do you think Leia is a Jedi?
Doesn't she have to be?
Well, being Force sensitive doesn't automatically make you a Jedi.
Force Awakens was the only movie in which Leia doesn't use a weapon.
But, that's because she didn't need to.
What if it's because her weapon is now a lightsaber, and that's the big reveal for Last Jedi?
That would be amazing, and would explain why Carrie had to get into shape.
And, Luke had plenty of time to train her if Force Awakens is 30 years later, and her son is in his 20s.
Do you think they will kill her character in Last Jedi?
If they do, it better be in an amazing lightsaber battle.
