Hey who is your favorite team?
The Carolina Panthers
Cool, I'm a Colts a fan
Nice, how do you think they'll do this year?
Ok, I'm not too thrilled about our defense
I see, I think we have the potential to go all the way
Do you think Cam will have a better year?
Yes, I think with his injury and concussion out of the way he will be back to MVP form
I feel the same way about Andrew Luck
Do you have any predictions for the superbowl?
I think the Patriots will probably win again
Yeah, they always seem to get better every year
Tom Brady is the ageless wonder
I agree, he might go down as the greatest ever if he's already not.
Do you think any teams in the NFC have a shot at beating the Pats?
Well Obviously I think the Panthers have a shot
Anyone other than the Panthers?
Maybe the Falcons if they can recover from that choke job in the super bowl
I think Seattle can do it
Hmm Im not sure I think their time has passed.
