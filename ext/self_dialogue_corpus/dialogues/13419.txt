What side of the force do you like better, dark or light?
I like the darkside better
I also do, I think the sith are cooler characters. Which sith lord would win in a duel?
I think Darth Maul would, judging by The Phantom Menace fight at the end
Do you think Kylo Ren will end up being a better sith?
He looked very weak in the Force Awakens
Yeah, but I bet in the Last Jedi he will fight Luke Skywalker and it'll be better
I don't know about that, he might have to fight Rey again
Yeah it could be a lot like the Empire Strikes Back
I hope so, but we need a Han Solo type character
