I just love jazz. I don't know a lot about it, but I love most of it.
Yeah, so do I. I loved all that "light" jazz in the 80s. Kenny G, Earl Klugh
Yeah, Kenny G was a bit cheesy, but I loved Earl Klugh and had all his albums.
Me too! What was your favorite piece?
Waiting for Kathy. I was probably around 18 and I remember listening to that over and over.
Do you like Modern Jazz Quartet?
Funny, back when I was in my early 20s, a family friend took me to see them. I was bored. Now I LOVE THEM.
Yes, yes. I love Milt Jackson. Bag's Groove is a fave!
Yes and I love that one too. Milt was already deceased when I saw them in a reunion concert.
I don't like that big band stuff very much.
Ohhh, I love it. You kind of have to dig deeper than Glenn Miller.
Yes, that's exactly who I think of when I think big band.
His stuff is great, but over-played, at least these days when people want to reminisce.
Who else do you like?
I've bought some Tommy Dorsey, some Harry James. Some Duke Ellington.
My Dad loves Harry James.
Check out Green Onion - fab!
I will! Who else should I try out?
Go to internet archive and listen to some of the old WWII weekly radio broadcasts for the troops - a lot of variety.
Cool! And it will sort of jump me back to the actual period.
