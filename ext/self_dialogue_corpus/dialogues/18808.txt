Hey, what is your favorite genre of music?
I like older country and bluegrass. I also like 1969's and 70's folk.
When you say older country, what do you mean,
I really connect with Johnny Cash, Ferlin  Huskey, Patsy Cline. Those were the good days of country... Great ballads and real music.
I agree. It's hard to compete with Ring of Fire, Crazy or Hello Walls.
I could listen to Cash all day. And real roots music... Just a bass, guitar, mandolin and fiddle.
