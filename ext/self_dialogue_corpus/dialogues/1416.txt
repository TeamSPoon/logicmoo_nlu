Do you think a woman will ever play for the NFL?
No, no way, never.
Why not?
Biology.
Not sexism?
No, basic biology.
Ok, Doctor. Tell me why not.
The only position women have been able to do somewhat well in in high school and Division 3 college is the extra-point kicker.
So? Put them there!
I worry the defensive tackles won't want to tackle them out of fear of hurting them.
So then they get a free extra point.
Yeah, but here's the other thing. The male kickers can kick it farther.
Not more consistently, though. Gender and aim don't go together.
True. But a 60-yard field goal? No way.
That's probably true.
I'm not saying don't use them for short extra points or field goals, but I don't see them competing anytime soon.
This still reeks of sexism. Give them a chance.
A woman wouldn't succeed in the NBA but that's not sexist. Baseball is possible, but not the NFL for sure.
I hope one day you're proven wrong.
Me too. It'd be fun to see but deep down seeing a female get tackled full-force by a 350 pound lineman hurts to think of.
