I always like to think that Grace Slick made Jefferson Airplane, but they actually had a lot of their sound before she got with them.
I know. She's so strange, you want to give it to her, but Marty was actually pretty weird and had some great songs already there.
Yeah, like Comin' Back to Me.
Her boyfriend wrote White Rabbit. I mean her husband -- before she joined Airplane.
What a song.  Did you know they played on a rooftop before the Beatles?
No, did they?
Totally.  I wonder if that's where the Beatles got the idea.
Maybe. The rooftop concert is great, though, isn't it?
Yeah, Paul and John look like they are having a blast!
They sound so amazing, too!
Paul's voice is so incredibly big and round at that time!
I know! Jim Morrison was the same way.  I wonder if it had something to do with their big beards then?
Ha ha! I don't know, but Morrison is the same way on L.A. Woman. Just this HUGE voice!
I know! Changeling always blows my mind.
Oh, I love that song.  It's just ALL THERE.
It totally is.  I don't think there's a bad song on that album.
It's my favorite Doors album.
What an album to go out on.
I totally agree.
He really died at the peak of his powers.
