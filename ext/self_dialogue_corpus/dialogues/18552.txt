What artists do you think should be inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall Of Fame?
The first one that comes to mind is Bad Company.  They were pretty much a pure rock 'n roll band in the 1970s.
I heard John Mellencamp say he was a big fan of Paul Rogers. Strange that John Mellencamp got inducted before Bad Company.
I think the Moody Blues should have been inducted a long time ago.
Agreed, they have a lot of songs that are constantly on classic rock stations.
It's weird that bands like Deep Purple kept getting passed over in favor of artists like Michael Jackson and Madonna.
You don't think Michael Jackson and Madonna should have been inducted? They have sold millions of records.
Sure, they were popular, but they're not rock 'n roll. They belong in a pop music Hall of Fame. If there is such a thing.
I can never understand why Abba was inducted. I don't even know why they were famous.
They were big in the late 1970s, music was changing. About the time that disco got big.
Do you think there were any truly rock 'n roll bands in the 80s?
There were some, most of them were labeled as heavy metal. Bands like Van Halen.
Van Halen? Did you prefer David Lee Roth, or Sammy Hagar?
Most people will disagree, but I preferred Sammy Hagar.
What was your favorite Van Halen song in the Sammy Hagar era?
Dreams. I remember watching the video of that song with the Navy's Blue Angels.
That was a great song. My favorite is always Why Can't This Be Love. Sammy Hagar was a great singer.
Have you heard anything he's done since leaving Van Halen?
No, I know he started a band and recruited the bass player from Van Halen.
I haven't heard anything of his lately either, hopefully there will be a Van Halen reunion with Sammy Hagar on vocals.
