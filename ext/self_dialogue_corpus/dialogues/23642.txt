So you said you like comedies?
Yeah!
Have you ever seen Tommy Boy?
No, not yet, but I'm always hearing references to it.
Well the whole thing is a vehicle for Chris Farley with David Spade playing the straight man.
No, I know that much.
First off, it actually has a plot.
That's good to know, sometimes those screwball comedies are weak on plot.
Tommy Callahan--the Chris Farley character--is a total screwup (he took 9 years to graduate college) but he has to go on a roadtrip with David Spade to save his familys company.
That sounds like a fun setup.
But there are so many humorous moments. In one scene, he puts on the David Spade character's tiny sportcoat.
Is that the fat guy in a little coat scene?
Yeah.
I've seen it on youtube.
It's great, it plays with both the size difference between farley and spade and farley's inherent physical comedy.
He was a comedic genius. It's a shame he died to soon.
There are so many moments in that movie that are hilarious, it would take me as long as the movie to tell you all.
I'll have to see it.
Come over some time, I have it on DVD.
Sounds good!
