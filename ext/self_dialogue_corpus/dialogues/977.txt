Who do you think will have great season in the NFL this year?
I think the Packers, Patriots, and Rams will have good years.
You think the Rams will be decent?
Yes, they have a new location and a decent QB now.
Their QB is unproven, but we will see.
I also think the Bengals has a shot.
That sounds iffy, too. Why do you think this?
Their defense has always been stout.
They also have a good home field advantage in the cold.
Yes they do, as do the Packers.
I think Aaron Rogers will win MVP.
We will see, I think Brady has a shot.
Brady has won it too many times!
But that is because he is so great!
Yes, he has definitely deserved them.
We will see I guess - anything is possible with Belichick.
I think the Raiders will be interesting this year.
Yeah they lost their QB at the wrong moment last year.
Hopefully he's healed up and ready to go.
I think he will be, but we will see. Go Raiders!
