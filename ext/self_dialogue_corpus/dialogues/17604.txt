Do you like 21 Pilots?
They are okay, but I don't listen to them on my own will
Why do you say that?
They have catchy songs but I don't care for the lyrics
What about the lyrics don't you like?
They seem to be too cool for school or they complain about adult life?
When did they complain about adult life?
In the song stressed out they said people make them wake up early and go earn money
Well they are rich as heck now, they don't need to worry about that I guess
Yeah, they have had enough hits to be rich for a long time!
Do you think they are one hit wonders?
It is tough to say but i don't think they are
Why do you say that?
They have a very unique style that nobody has been able to copy
How would you describe that style?
It's pretty dark but happy too. Their song Heathens was so cool
I dont think I know that song
It goes "All my friends are Heathens take it slow..."
Oh now I know that song! I liked it a lot before it was popular!
Yeah then it was on the radio way too much!
