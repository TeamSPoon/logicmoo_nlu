Do you like the new jerseys that Nike makes?
I think I preferred the old ones.
I don't know, there isn't much of a difference.
The Nike ones have those awful gloss stripes around the collar.
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
I prefer the old jerseys because they looked cleaner.
Personally, I wish there was just more differences when it came to jerseys when it switches brands.
I thought the old ones were fine. I don't know why they changed them
I think it's because Nike offered more money to sponsor the NFL.
Oh, that's right.
It makes sense, considering that Nike is the biggest sports company in the world.
That kind of makes it even worse. Shouldn't they then know how to make a good jersey.
I think the quality of the jerseys are top quality.
I mean, in terms of how the jerseys look.
Some people do like them. Some don't.
I'm one of those that don't.
Personally, I was never going to buy one anyway, so it doesn't matter.
I did buy one, and I can tell you that they aren't designed that great.
If they perform well on the field, that's the only design players care about.
Well, that's something I'll never find out.
