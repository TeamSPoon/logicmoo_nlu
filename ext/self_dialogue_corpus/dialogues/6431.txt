What do you think of Frozen?
Oh, I have so many opinions on Frozen.
Okay, let me hear them.
I like the songs in the movie, especially Let it Go...
It is a classic song, the others are catchy too.
But I'm not a fan of the overhype the movie got.
Like it's popularity?
I think it got very big, very fast.
So fast they're already making a sequel.
Yeah....I'm definetely going to watch it when it comes out too.
