I know Disney is known for its happy themes, but there are surprisingly disturbing moments.
You're right.  Which one is most disturbing for you?
I remember there was the Stegosaurus that was killed explicitly by a T-Rex in 'Fantasia.'
I know that scene.  That one was really disturbing to me too when I first saw it.
Do you have a particular one that comes to mind?
For me, it was when Scar kills Mufasa.
The fact that Mufasa was trampled by a herd was too graphic for me as a child.
It still makes me really sad to this day.
As sad as many of these scenes are, I think they add depth to these movies.
True, they are stronger movies for them.
