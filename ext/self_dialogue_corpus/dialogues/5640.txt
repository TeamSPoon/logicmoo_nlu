Did you ever see Dumbo?
Yes, many years ago
Did you like it?
Yes, I remember watching it a bunch as a kid.
I loved the theme of a magic feather and flying.
Oh right, the feather from the crows.
Yes, but it really was a farce
And Dumbo figure it's out in the end.
Yes, and he shows those clowns who's boss
Yes, with peanuts and all.
