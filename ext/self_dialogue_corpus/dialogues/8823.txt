I heard that Journey is on tour again.
Wow, I'd really like to see them live.  I had tickets to see them a couple years back, but they cancelled.
Yeah, one of their shows would be awesome.
They have so many good songs.  It would be amazing.
What's your favorite Journey song?
Maybe Lights or Separate Ways.
You don't like Don't Stop Believin?
It's okay.  Just over the years, I've heard it so many times.
Oh, it's just kind of stale.
You could say that.
