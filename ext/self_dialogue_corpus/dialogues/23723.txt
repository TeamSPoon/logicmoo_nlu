Have you seen any of the Godfather movies?
I only saw the first one and the third one, but never the second one.
I think it's the best one of the trilogy!
Am I missing anything vital to the storyline?
Well, if you saw the first one, you saw the rise of power for Michael Corleone.
Right, and he was trying to retire by the third one.
Well, the second movie shows how his empire crumbles, and how he loses the things he loves most.
Oh that's right, he was divorced in the last movie, wasn't he?
Right, and the movie also focuses on how much of a cold hearted man he has become.
Did he do something really heinous?
When his older brother tried to set him up, Michael had him killed!
My goodness, how could he have changed so much from the honest family man from the first and third movies?
Half of the movie also focuses on the rise of power of Michael's father, this time played by Robert DeNiro in flashbacks.
That sounds like an incredible performance!
It's my favorite part of the whole movie!
Doesn't it bother you knowing that everything is going to turn out okay for the character in the end?
No, because the journey is so incredible, and to see him overcome such odds is amazing!
So is the second Godfather movie something that stands the test of time?
It absolutely does, because the movie is so timeless!
I think I'll do a Godfather marathon this weekend based on your recommendation!
