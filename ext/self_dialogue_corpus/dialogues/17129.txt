I always thought 2Pac was better than Biggie.
You're crazy man, Biggie was an amazing rapper.
I think you're crazy man. Do you see the longevity Pac's discography? it's insane!
Yeah its a lot of filler man.
Filler? Are you insane dude. A lot of it is grade A material.
Yes filler. Biggie didn't have any of that.
That's because he had two records. You can count them, two!
Yes, but they were both classics.
His second album wasn't a classic. If it has Puffy talking in the background.
Haha, well Puffy added to the songs.
Puffy was awful man, he added too many dumb things to the song.
Enough about puffy. It's about Pac and Biggie. Biggie was way better.
Biggie's was good, don't get me wrong. But he never had the emotions that Pac had
Yeah ill give you that, but biggie had a better flow and rhyme sceme.
Yeah, i'll give you that. I also think Pac had a bigger global impact on everyone. Look at the popular rappers out, they're influenced by him.
Name some. I dont hear it in radio.
I can name two prominent ones. J Cole and Kendrick Lamar.
Oh true, that's very true.
So you're getting my point now?
Yeah 2pac might be better.
