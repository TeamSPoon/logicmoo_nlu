I miss hair metal from the '80s. There's just nothing quite like it being made nowadays.
Many of those bands are still around, and some are still making new music. You just have to look a little harder for them.
Oh really? Like who?
Styx just released a new album, so did Cheap Trick and Deep Purple.
Wow, I love all of those bands. I'll have to look into this!
You can always tune into Dee Snider's radio show too. Its called House of Hair, and it airs on many XM stations.
I'll have to check it out!
Yeah, if you're a fan of that genre of rock, you really should.
Do you  have any other recommendations?
You can always use Spotify to test out some of these new albums.
