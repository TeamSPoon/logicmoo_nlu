Do you remember the first Star Wars movie you saw?
I saw it at home with my family.
I liked the battle at the end.
Those were pretty neat special effects for the time.
Did George Lucas direct that one?
I think he did.
I think it was called "A new hope."
I didn't like the 3 prequels.
He directed those too.
I know.  They were awful.
