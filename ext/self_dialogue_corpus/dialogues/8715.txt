Have you ever heard of Metallica?
Yes, I use to listen to it alot.
I went to one of their concerts.
I never got that chance.
It is more heavy metal than rock.
I agree, although they do have rock songs.
Yeah I like some of the slow songs.
Their album Master of Muppets is my favorite.
I like that one but wasn't that the third album they released?
Yeah, it was released back in 1986.
