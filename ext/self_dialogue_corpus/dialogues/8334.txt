Shall we talk about pop music? Britney Spears is my favorite pop artist.
Oh! I love Britney, I actually got to see her at a show recently.
Yes I've loved her since I saw her her 2002 movie "Crossroads".
That's a great movie! I really liked her rendition of "I Love Rock 'n' Roll".
Me too! I'd say she probably did Joan Jett and the Blackhearts justice, do you agree?
Totally I really liked the way she sung it, I might even like it better than the original version!
What do you think of Lana Del Rey?
I think she's great, I really love her songs "Young and Beautiful" and "High By The Beach".
Those are some of my favorite songs by her too! I can't believe how much we have in common.
I know right! I really love pop music so it's cool to get to talk to someone with similar tastes about it, I don't get to very often.
