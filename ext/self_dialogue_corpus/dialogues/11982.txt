When did you first see Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope?
I saw it in 1977.
I wasn't even born then! Did you have a crush on either Han Solo or Luke Skywalker?
Neither, really.  But when I got older, I thought Harrison Ford was good looking.
I get that. But I think I would have liked Luke.
I did want to look like Princess Leia, though.
What about her appealed to you?
She was beautiful AND strong AND capable.
Yeah.  So sad that Carrie Fisher passed away, though.
Yeah. And it makes me feel old!
