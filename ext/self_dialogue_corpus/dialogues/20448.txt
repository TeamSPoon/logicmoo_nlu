Have you seen Smurfs the Lost Village?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It is basically for kids, but a fun one to see.
Tell me about it , I would like to take my daughter.
The smurf's adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) to find a mysterious village.
That sounds like it would fun for the kids.  Who stars in it?
Demi Lovatto, Rainn Wilson, Kelly Asbury, and Mandy Patinkin star in this kids movie.
Who is the director?
Kelly Asbury is the director for it.
How long is the movie? I want to go to a short one with the kids Friday.
It's one hour and 31 minutes.  I think the kids will be happy with all the smurfs activities on the trip.
That sounds perfect.
It has made over $192 million dollars already.
That sounds amazing. Sounds like other families loved it too.
Joe Manganiello also stars in it as one of the Smurfs, Hefty  I think.
I think the children will be excited.
Do you need me to come with you to help you with all the kids?
Well, only if you wanted to. We go on Friday.
I will come by your house and we can go from there with the kids.
Sounds like a plan!
