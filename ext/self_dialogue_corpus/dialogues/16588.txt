Do you like Queensryche?
You mean the band?
Yes, I was just listening to Operation Mindcrime.
I don't know that song.
It's a great album. It tells a story.
I heard a few songs from it, but didn't know it told anything.
Yes, the album tells a story about a junkie named Nikki.
Every song is part of the story?
Yes, there are so many great songs on that album. My favorite is called Speak.
I did hear that song, it is good.
The lead sinegr back then, Geoffe Tate, had such a great voice.
Isn't he with the band anymore?
Well the members had an argument. In other words he acted like an idiot and they kicked him out.
So do they still make music?
Yes, they got a new singer.
Are they as good?
Yes, and are working on music now.
Thats good. Did you ever see them in concert?
Yes. With Geoff Tate and without him.
I'll have to listen to the whole album. Didn't know the whole thing told a story.
