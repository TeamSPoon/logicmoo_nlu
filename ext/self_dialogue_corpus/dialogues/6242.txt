What are some Disney movies that are based on books? I'm writing an essay about adaptation.
That sounds like a good essay. Hmm. Let me think.
I know The Little Mermaid and Snow White are based on Fairy Tales, that sort of counts.
Isn't The Hunchback of Notre Dame a Victor Hugo novel?
Oh yeah! And One Hundred and One Dalmatians is based on a children's novel too.
It seems like there are a lot of them after all.
Is The Hunchback of Notre Dame anything like the movie.
I bet it's a lot darker. Disney usually makes things happier.
Well, they are children's movies after all.
I guess so. They have to make them kid friendly.
