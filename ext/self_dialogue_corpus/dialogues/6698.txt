What is one of your favorite Disney movies?
101 Dalmatians
Yes, I love that one.
I love the animation style.
Yeah, it was quite a departure from the usual Disney films.
I agree. Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella were drawn so elegantly.
Yes and 101 Dalmatians was very rough looking.
I liked how you could see the pencil in the art.
Yeah, it definitely added to the evil of Cruella de Vil.
Her song is so memorable.
