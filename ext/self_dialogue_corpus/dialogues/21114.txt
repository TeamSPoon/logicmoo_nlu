Do you ever watch old movies?
Not usually, but last week I watched two Gene Kelly Movies.
Which ones?  Anchors Aweigh?  Brigadoon?
No.  I watched An American In Paris and Singin' In The Rain.
I haven't seen either of them.  What did you think of them?
I enjoyed them both.  Gene Kelly was an incredible dancer!
I've heard that the rainstorm scene was amazing.
It was!  What makes it even more incredible was that Gene had a 103 degree fever that day, but he insisted on filming the scene anyway!  It was flawless!
Wow!  That takes major dedication!
Yes!  Actually, all three of the lead actors were excellent dancers.
Is there anything you didn't like about either movie?
The only thing I didn't like is that, in each movie, there was an extended dance scene that seemed to go on forever.  The one in An American In Paris went on for twenty minutes!
Were both of the movies comedies?
Yes, although An American In Paris was more of a romance.
Wasn't Donald O'Conner also in Singin' In The Rain?
Yes.  He's also a dedicated dancer.  He did a very demanding song called Make 'em Laugh.  After filming, he was covered in bruises and had to rest for four days.
That song must have featured a lot of physical comedy.
It did.  What's worse, while he was recovering, the film was water damaged.  He ended up having to film the entire routine again!
Dancing sounds like a tough way to make a living.
I agree!  I wouldn't mind being an actor, though!
