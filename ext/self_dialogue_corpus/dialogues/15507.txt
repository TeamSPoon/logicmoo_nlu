I seriously cannot live without music.
Me too. That's why I bought a bigger iPod.
I'm all about the playlists on my iPod now.
See I need to carry full albums. Have you heard the new Springsteen album?
I've heard the first single on the radio, but I didn't really like.
You should check out the full record.
Is it any better than High Hopes?
It's much better, actually. It reminds me a bit of John Fogerty.
I love John Fogerty! And Creedence Clearwater Revival.
I wish John would make amends with the others guys in the band.
Can you imagine them actually going out on tour?
That would be absolutely insane. I'd love to hear them play stuff from Mardi Gras.
That would be a trip, but do you people would remember it?
I'm not sure, but it would be such a treat for fans!
Speaking of concerts, I did just get tickets to The River Tour!
It's amazing that Bruce is actually still touring as hard as he does.
I swear the man does not slow down.
I saw him two years ago on the Wrecking Ball Tour. He was amazing.
He always plays for over three hours!
I hope I have that kind of energy when I'm 60.
