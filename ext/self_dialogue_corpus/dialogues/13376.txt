What do you think of the Star Wars music?
I think it's great, John Williams is a genius.
Yes I know, it really sets the mood of a space drama.
How do you feel about the death of Han Solo?
I feel it was necessary even though very sad.
Do you think this is because Harrison Ford didn't want to make any more movies?
I am not sure about that, but definitely think it was pertinent to the plot.
Do you think that Kylo Ren is going to become less evil?
I think since he is of a lineage of good and evil he may turn around.
He is related to Darth Vader so not sure will have to see!
