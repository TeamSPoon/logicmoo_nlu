Which team in the NFL is your favorite?
I live in New York City, so I should like the Giants or the Jets, but instead I like the Patriots.
Really?! Why don't you like the Giants?
I don't know... I just don't. I'm not a fan of Eli Manning or any other players on that team.
Well, I think Manning's just OK but they do have some superstars, actually.
Like who, for instance?
Odell Beckham, Jr., one of the greatest wide receivers in the league.
Yeah, all right. I guess you have a point there. Who else?
Weston Richburg and Jason Pierre-Paul.
OK, you've made your point. But whenever the Patriots play the Giants, you know who I'll be rooting for.
Is it tough to be a Patriots fan in New York?
Not really, no. You'd be surprised how many there are.
But the Jets are the Patriots' big rivals... not the Giants.
True, but the Patriots have faced the Giants in the Super Bowl.
Yeah, it's gotten ugly.
I mean, the Patriots are better than both of those teams, you have to admit.
I admit that the Patriots are better than the Jets.
That's pretty obvious.
The Jets have been terrible for a long time.
They actually had winning seasons in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2015, but they've been struggling overall for years and years.
