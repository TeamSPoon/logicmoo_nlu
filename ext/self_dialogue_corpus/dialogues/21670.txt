Have you ever seen the movie Dazed and Confused.
That was the one that really put Mathew Mchoney on the map right?
Yep, he had some good one liners in that one.
He has the sort of obsession with high school girls.
Right, but you know I noticed something about that movie.
What? That it is not that funny?
No, that nothing really happens.
There is no real story I mean, just sort of people.
I noticed there are a few other films like too.
Where nothing really happens?
Like the Breakfast club.
Stuff happens, they go to detention and then leave detention.
A few things happen, but really nothing worth noting.
I had never thought of it like that.
There is a bit of character growth. But, no real arc to the plot.
I had never even noticed. The events could happen in any order and still make sense.
Exactly, like a slacker film.
I think the Clerks movies are kind of like that.
But, they are meant to be sort of slacker funny.
An on purpose movie of nothing.
