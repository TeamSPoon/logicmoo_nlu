Who do you think will be the worst NFL team?
Probably the Browns or the Jets.
I would agree with the Jets for sure.
They just don't have a lot of talent.
No, hardly any at all.
I think it would be a shock if they win three games.
That is about what I would think too.
They had a pretty bad draft too.
I think the Browns draft was slightly better than the Jets.
I do too.
That is why I agreed with the Jets.
The Browns have some struggles ahead of them too.
I don't think they will win five games.
It would be a shocker to me.
It must be tough to be bad every year.
That is how it has seemed for them the past few years.
Hopefully they can turn it around eventually.
It would be nice to see the Browns be competitive.
It would.
Makes for better games to watch.
