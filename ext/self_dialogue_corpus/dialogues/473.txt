What do you think of Peyton Manning?
I loved him! He was such a great player.
He was such a good person off and on the field.
Yeah, I love his commercials.
He trained very hard, did you know that. Every summer, he would go with his brother to train at the Duke University.
oh wow, really? that sounds amazing.
Well, he couldn't just be good out of no where.
I supposed. But then tell me, why isn't Eli so good?
I think he's good. He won a superbowl after all.
Well, he got really good receivers.
No, I think he just need a couple more years and he will be in top shape.
If you say so.
Do you even like football?
Of course I do, I watched them since I was a kid.
Oh really? What's your favorite team?
Umm I like the Browns.
Haha, you like the Browns and you are making fun of Eli Manning.
Well yeah, he play for one of the worst team in the League.
You think the Giants are bad!?
Oh I though they were playing for the Jets...
