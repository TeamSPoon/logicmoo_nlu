What are your thoughts on Vitamin String Quartet?
I'm not really sure who they are. Tell me about them.
They are a string quartet that does really beautiful covers of pop music.
Oh, that sounds lovely. What are some songs they have covered?
They have great covers of Fight Song and Can't Feel My Face.
Oh I love those songs! What album are the covers on?
The album is called "VSQ Performs the Hits of 2015, Vol. 2."
That sounds so cool I'll have to take a listen.
I really think you'll like them. They have a few Taylor Swift covers too.
Oh I love Taylor Swift!
I know! 1989 was her best album in my opinion.
What is your favorite song from 1989?
Probably Wildest Dreams. What about you?
Either Blank Space or Shake It Off.
Both are great. The video to Blank Space is incredible!
Oh I know. The castle they filmed in is gorgeous.
So beautiful. If almost reminds me of Taylor Swift's video to Love Story all those years ago.
Oh, I know what you mean!
Right? She has a lot of great videos.
You Belong With Me also has a great video.
