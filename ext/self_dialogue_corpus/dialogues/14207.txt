So, Lady Gaga. What do you think of her?
She tries wayyyy too hard. She's always wearing some stupid costume to get attention and stay relevant.
No, no, I'm talking about her music dude.
I mean... I guess her music is okay? Most of it's just generic pop.
Then why do people keep saying she's groundbreaking and different?
Because she dresses in bizarre costumes and says weird stuff all the time.
Yeah but you have to admit. She has talent. At least her stuff sounds good.
Yeah, that's true. Her better songs tend to be the ones people aren't familiar with.
Well that's true with any artist.
Sure, sure. But I just wish she'd focus more on being weird and different with her music instead of doing that with her visual style.
