Have you seen the preview for the new Baywatch movie?
The one with the Rock?
Yeah, and Zac Efron.
I haven't, does it look good?
No it looks pretty awful to be honest.
That bad?
Normally they put the funnier parts of the movie into the previews, not in this case.
Yeah, well the Rock isn't exactly known to be the greatest actor ever.
Yeah, he's not going to be winning any Oscars anytime soon.
On the other hand, the Dunkirk previews look incredible.
They really do! I'm pretty excited.
They've said that the summer will be a pretty weak time for movies this year, but I believe that Dunkirk will be a standout.
I hope so, the previews really make me want to see it.
All I knew about it at first was that it was the movie with Harry Styles in it, and didn't think much of it.
Oh, thats right isn't it? I forgot he was in it.
Yeah, I don't think he has a major role though.
Oh, well that's probably for the better, haha.
Yeah, but it'll be directed by Christoper Nolan, so it should be pretty good.
Not to mention the score is from Hans Zimmer.
Oh wow, I didn't know that. Im excited!
