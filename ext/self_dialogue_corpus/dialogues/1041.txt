What did they before the Superbowl?
What do you mean?
Did they have national championship for the NFL?
Well, they didn't really have a national championship, per se. They had the National Football League and the American Football League
They had the championships individually?
Well, it's a little more complicated than that. The merger required some kind of championship.
When was the merger?
Merger was announced back in 1966, then they had their own seasons until 1969, and merged completely in 1970. That was the first superbowl season.
And the reson they merged?
They were competing aginst each other for college players, and the salaries went skyrocketing. They raided other conferences for players too.
Always it comes down to money.
Of course, so once they merged under the same rules, the raids stopped, they still traded players, of course.
I see. So the championbship between the leagues is basically what superbowl is?
Yes
Hm. I loved last years superbowl,. It was the biggest comeback win in history
25 points. That's Brady forya
Which is amazing because he wasn't drafted until round 6, pick 199.
Yeah, pick 199 out of 254 players picked that year. There was a reddit post while back about his resume
Haha, yeah I saw that.
He was an intern at Merryl Lynch. Good thing patriots picked him up,. otherwise, we woulnd't have our second 5 times Superbowl Champion
