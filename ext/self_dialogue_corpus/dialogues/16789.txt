Hey what are you up to tomorrow nigyt?
Not too much, you want to do something?
Yeah I have an extra ticket to see Richie Kotzen if you want to go. Won't cost you anything.
Do I know who that is?
I don't know but you will like him! He's a great musician.
What kind of music does he play?
Well he's a guitarist who also sings and writes. Mostly rock.
Yeah sounds good to me. I'm in.
Cool! He played with Poison while CC was out. He also plays in The Winery Dogs besides his solo career.
Oh, ok. I know the winery dogs. Didn't know he played with Poison.
Yeah it was a long time ago.he got kicked out for sleeping with Rikki''s wife.
Oh dang! That sucks.
Yeah like I said it was a long time ago. He was too good for Poison anyway if we're being honest.
CC was too.
Haha yeah I agree! Even though I do love Poison.
Yeah I do too.
Well listen to Remember from Richie. And also You Can't Save Me. Those are my two favorites from him.
Alright I will check them out now.
OK. Salting Earth is his new album too if you want to give it a listen.
Great. I will, thank you!
