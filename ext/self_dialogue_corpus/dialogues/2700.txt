Hey are you ready for football this year?
I sure am! I have my DVR set to record all the preseason games too.
Which team are you rooting for this year?
I always root for the Atlanta Falcons.
Me too! That's my home team.
Julio Jones is a beast and Matt Ryan has gotten so much better.
Yes. Dan Quinn really whipped them into shape.
Who do you think will make it to the Superbowl with them?
Maybe the Denver Broncos. They are also good.
They no longer have Peyton Manning so they may not be as great this year.
True. I can't wait until the September 17th game where the Falcons play against the Greenbay Packers.
Why is that?
The Greenbay Packers is my best friend's team. I want the Falcons to crush them!
The Falcons did beat them last year so I am sure they will beat them again this year.
Which game are you most excited to see this season?
The December 7th game when the Atlanta Falcons go against the New Orleans Saints.
Oh yea! That's going to be a good game since they are divisional rivals!
We are having a football party that day at my place to watch the game. Would you like to come?
Sure! What time should I be there?
Come around 6pm so we can pregame before the real game!
