Do you know when the preseason games start?
I do not but my  husband is already talking about it.
Are you guys going to any games this year?
Not to sure we might try for a preseason since they are cheaper.
Everyone in your household likes a different team right
Yes but the kids just pick opposite of my hubby to irritate him.
Most kids do
I know but he loves his Saints and i love rubbing it in that my Steelers have 6 superbowl win.
He was so disappointed last year when the Steelers went to the playoffs.
Yes iremember since his Saints lost again.
So i shouldnt bring up any information about the Patriots eigther.
Oh no he hates Bill Bellicheck
Why does he hate them so much i dont think they even play the Saints.
Thet dont he says Bellicheck is a cheated and Tom Brady gets handed everything.
Did you hear where Tom Brady had hihand on the Pens Stanley cup
Yes my hubby flipped about that he said Brady was jinxing the Pens
It was all over Twitter Steelers fans and Pens fans were outraged.
Yes i saw it on my page.
You and i should go to a Steelers game without the boys
That would be fun no men complaining just us girls having a sports night out.
