I finally watched 10 Cloverfield lane!
Did you like it?
Oh my goodness yes! It was amazing.
I loved it so much. I've seen it like 5 times.
I thought it was really cool how it was kind of like a horror movie inside another horror movie.
What do you mean.
You know how it was telling the story of the girl's abduction but outside the world had been taken over by aliens?
Yeah that was pretty cool.
I thought John Goodman was amazing.
Yeah, it was weird to see him play an evil character.
I know I always think of him as the dad from Roseanne.
Me too.
It's kind of like when the dad from Malcolm in the Middle played Walter White.
Yeah it's weird, but he did a great job.
What's the name of the actress that plays the girl in that movie?
The one who plays Michelle?
Yeah her.
I think her name is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was in the Die Hard Movies.
Oh, I knew I recognized her from somewhere. I just couldn't place her.
Yeah she's been in a lot of horror movies too.
