I have this theory that kids in America are really defined by which Disney movies come out when they're young enough to like them.
What do you mean?
Well, like, The Lion King came out when I was five, and that was when I liked Disney the most. So I think of it as my favorite.
Hmm. I like One Hundred and One Dalmatians though, but it came out way before I was a kid.
Okay, but what came out when you were five.
Beauty and the Beast.
Okay. Do you like Beauty and the Beast?
I love it!
See what I mean?
I guess you might be right.
