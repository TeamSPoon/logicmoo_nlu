I think I have watched all the horror movies on streaming! All that is left is zombie movies, which I do not like.
I know a zombie movie you would probably like.
Which one?
The Girl with All the Gifts. It has an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars.
I don't like zombie movies, though. How is this one different?
It s beautiful and haunting and a very fresh take on the genre. The main character is a young girl, very intelligent, and Glenn Close plays a lead role.
Glenn Close, in a zombie movie? What is the plot?
A fungus is taking over humans and turning them into mindless zombies. But children who were infected while still in the womb might be able to resist the fungus.
Is the young girl you mentioned one of those children who can resist it?
She might be. But if she is, Glenn Close's character wants to use her brain to make a vaccine.
