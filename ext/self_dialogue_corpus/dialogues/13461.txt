what did you think was better, return of the Jedi or the empire strikes back?
I actually liked return of the Jedi better
seriously, why?
without Jedi, there is no conclusion to the story, and therefore empire is pointless
yeah, but all of the best drama is in Empire
I disagree, the most eventful action takes place in Return of the Jedi
but the best light saber fight of the middle three happens in in empire
light saber fighting isn't the only thing that made me enjoy the serires
you are crazy for liking Return of the Jedi more than Empire Strikes Back
you are just saying that because of that scene in the movie clerks!
