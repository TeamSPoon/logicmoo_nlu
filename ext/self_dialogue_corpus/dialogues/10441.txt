Hi.  It's been a while.
Yea, what have you been up to?
Not too much.  I just watched 'Star Trek' for the first time.
Which 'Star Trek' movie?
I watched the one by J.J. Abrams.
The reboot?  I really liked that one.
You're a huge Star Trek fan right?  You've seen all the other movies and shows?
I've seen them all.  The first rebooted one was my favorite.
I enjoyed it.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk.
I agree.  He played off of Zachary Quinto's Spock, very well.
They are great together.  The rest of the cast was perfect for their roles too.
John Cho as Sulu is my favorite.  Can't believe he's the same actor from the 'Harold and Kumar' movies.
Do you think I'd enjoy the other two?
I think so.  'Star Trek Into The Darkness' had Benedict Cumberbatch play the villain.
He's one of my favorite actors, so I'm pretty excited now.  How about 'Beyond?"
'Beyond' wasn't as well-balanced as the second one.  But this time, the villain is Idris Elba's character.
He's another actor I really like!  They're doing a great job with casting.
I think the Star Trek universe has so many fans that every element has to be thought out carefully.
Want to watch the other two with me?
Yes I would.  I never get tired of those movies!
