I love watching women's beautiful dresses on any red carpet.
Yes, most of the women wear beautiful gowns.
Though some of them seem like they came from another planet, or they were still living in the 40's.
Yes, I think Hillary Swank was one of the worst dressed during Oscars 2016.
Did you see Jessica Alba wore this glittering gold Versace gown to the 78th Annual Academy Awards of, in think, 2006.
Yes, I loved her fawn or beige like long dress.
She was wearing the halter neck, the open back and the flower details make this look sophisticated.
She was looking sexy.
What about Jessica Chastain?  She looked exquisite at the 84th Annual Academy Awards.
I remember she was wearing strapless Alexander McQueen gown with $2 million worth of Harry Winston jewelry.
Her dress was black and gold, I think??
Yes, it was.  I remember she even made into the best-dressed lists.
What about Gwyneth Paltrow?  I really like her sense of dress.
I love her acting and her style.  She wears clothes, whether fashionable or not, with grace and dignity.  Don't you think?
Taraji Hanson was looking very nice in black figure hugging long dress.
Yes, I loved her necklace which went so well with her dress.
Talking 2017 Oscars I think Jessica Biel also looked nice.
Yes.  I loved her figure hugging golden dress.
What do you think of the always stylish Emma Stone's Tiffany & Co. jewels and a gold Givenchy Haute Couture gown?
I think it was overrated.  I didn't like the laying of her long dress, though media raved about how it matched the oscar statuette.
