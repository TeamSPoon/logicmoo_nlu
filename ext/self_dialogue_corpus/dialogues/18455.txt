Do you think Bruce Springsteen is overrated?
Oh heck yes
I do too, I dont think hes that great
He has put out a ton of albums
With a ton of filler on them
Yeah I tend to think the same
Why does he continue to sell stuff out?
I feel like his minions follow him everywhere.
Yeah he probably is still reeling off of his fanboys from forever ago
Do you think Billy Joel is overrated?
Not at all
He was a song writer just like Bruce.
Yeah but he actually writes stuff.
Bruce puts out new music
So I guess you think Joel is overrated too
No thats not what I Am saying
I like Joel's music better because its more piano driven
Yeah thats what drew me to him too
I think that he will last forever
He seems to tour like it!
