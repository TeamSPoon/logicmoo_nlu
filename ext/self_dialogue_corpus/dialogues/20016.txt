What's KPOP and JPOP?
KPOP is from Korea and split from Korean Pop right about 2007. JPOP is from Japan.
So it's like World Beat a.k.a. World Music?
I can't say for JPOP as I don't know it very well, but KPOP isn't !
What's it like then?
First of all it almost always has lyrics in Korean but either a chorus or catch-phrase in English.
What else?
It's got two main styles: Ballads & Pop
I'm not into those !
There are some songs that delve in to: alternative, Rap, Rock, Country, and Hip-Hop.
So it's only in Korea though right?
Actually it has large audiences in: Japan, Canada, The US and South America.
Then why have I never heard of it?
You may have never heard of it, but you probably heard it.
Like what for example
That dance everyone was doing a few years back, "Gangnam Style." That was KPOP, and the song "I am The Best" by 2NE1 was featured on ABC's The Bachelor and gets played sevaral times per day at Forever21 clothing stores.
I remember Gangnam Style!
Yep, it's still the biggest YouTube Music Video ever.
So how can I listen to it or find out more?
Try a podcast called "This Week in KPOP" and search KPOP on YouTube. That's mostly how I started!
