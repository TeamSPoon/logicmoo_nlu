Who won the game?
The Sharks!
I knew they would.
Yes, by a landslide!
They've got strong players.
Absolutely.
John Forte is thier best lineman.
Oh ok. Peter Crunks is too.
Yeah, he's good but slow.
No! Not my Peter!
Yes, he can barely hit a good touchdown!
Well, his last season wasn't his best!
John Forte is like a tank.
He's alright.
Who would win in a race?
I'd say Crunks.
No way!
Way!
Forte would run him over.
In his dreams!
