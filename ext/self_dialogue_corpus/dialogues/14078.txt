What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
I would say poker face.
Was that her first big hit?
I think Just dance may have been, I am not sure which was first.
Well they are for sure both form her first album,The fame.
That is right. Came out in 2008 I believe.
It is crazy it was that long ago. She still feels like a new artist to me.
I think she is super established at this stage.
I agree she is like an institution. But maybe just how she is always coming up with something new and different feels fresh.
I can see how she is a new artist in originality in that sense.
