Have you heard of the Arctic Monkeys?
I have. They are a great rock band.
Do you know where they are from?
They are from England, right?
Correct! They are from a town called Sheffield.
They have had a lot of success in the United States.
True! The alternative radio stations play their music all the time.
"R U Mine?" is my favorite song by the band.
That is a great one. But I prefer "Arabella"
That is an excellent song too. AM was a really fantastic album.
