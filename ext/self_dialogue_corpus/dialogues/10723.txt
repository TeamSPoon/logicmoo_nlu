Which movie from the Fast & Furious franchise did you enjoy the most?
I actually liked the first one the most.
Why is that one your favorite?
Well it's the first one so it was all new it had never been done before and we didn't know what to expect, plus they did an awesome job.
That's a good point, the first movie was a roller coaster for me.
I felt the same, after that you kind of knew what to expect.
Is it one of your favorite movies.
Yes, though it's not my most favorite movie.
Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be in that movie to be Dom or Brian?
I think I would have liked to be Dom he's such an interesting character.
