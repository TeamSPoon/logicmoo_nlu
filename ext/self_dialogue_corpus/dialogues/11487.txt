Hey, who's your favorite Beatle?
Wow, that's hard to choose. All four of them were extremely talented.
I know! There's Paul who was a great songwriter -- I mean, who can top songs like Hey Jude and Yesterday?
Well, John was an amazing songwriter too! He wrote In My life and Strawberry Fields Forever!
I know, it's so hard to pick. Speaking of songwriting -- don't forget George Harrison. He wrote Here Comes the Sun, one of my faves!
I didn't know George wrote that one? That's an awesome song.
Yeah, George Harrison wrote many songs but Paul and John usually didn't put many songs of his on the albums.
I didn't know that? What other songs did George write?
I believe he wrote, Good Day Sunshine too!
That's another great Beatles song. Wow, it's hard to pick my favorite -- I love them all!
