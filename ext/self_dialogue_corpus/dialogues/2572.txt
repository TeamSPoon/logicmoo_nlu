Who owes the Washington Redskins?
I think Daniel Snyder does.
Bruce Allen is the president.
They don't have a general manager right now.
Head coach is Jay Grunden.
I think they used to be the Boston Braves.
Then I think Boston Redskins.
The Skins is their nick name.
They have 5 League championships.
They have 2 NFL championships.
They won 3 Super Bowls.
They got 3 Conference championships.
And they have 14 Division championships.
Don't forget 24 playoff appearances.
Their first home field was Braves Field.
Then Fenway Park.
I miss Griggith Stadium.
RFK Stadium was cool.
They have played more than 1000 games since 1932.
That is a lot.
