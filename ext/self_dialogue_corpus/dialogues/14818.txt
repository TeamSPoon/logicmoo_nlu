Do you like Judd Apatow movies?
I do, actually, even though they're very silly and kind of crude, but also very much like real life.
I like Knocked Up. Even though it had some immature humor, it had some very sweet parts, too.
I agree. I think all of his movies are like that.
Yes, like Trainwreck, which I thought was really funny.
Amy Schumer was great in that. Apatow and Schumer make a great team.
And let's not forget 40-year-old Virgin!
Yes, that's a classic! I laughed so hard at that movie!
Steve Carell was perfect in that movie. He can make anything funny.
I also liked "This is 40." There must be something funny about being 40 years old to Judd.
