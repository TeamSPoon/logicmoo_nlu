Do you listen to Taylor Swift?
I don't think she's had an album out for a while, has she?
No, she sorta disappeared from the scene last year?
What happened to her?
Nobody is really sure, but after that last feud with Kanye West, she was gone.
Perhaps the pressure of the feud got to her.
Could be, because that video he did with all of those celebrities in bed with him, including her, went pretty viral.
I'm surprised no one sued Kanye over that.
I think Kanye West would make more money from a lawsuit than if he were left alone.
I don't know if that guy is a genius, but he sure knows how to manipulate.
He's another one that hasn't put out any music in a while.
Yeah, what's with these musicians lately?
I know, it's like they stopped making music because being socialites is their job now.
It's sad because when I was a kid, music was so important to everyone.
Seriously, what is the soundtrack of the current generation?
I guess anyone can be a musician thanks to YouTube and platforms like that.
I hear that's how Justin Bieber got his start, as well as Rebecca Black.
Those are another two that disappeared from the face of the earth!
Maybe that same thing will happen to Ariana Grande after the incident at her concert a couple of weeks ago.
That was horrible, but I hope it doesn't stop her from making more music.
