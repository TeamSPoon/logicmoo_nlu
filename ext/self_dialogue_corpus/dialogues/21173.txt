Are there any movies that you loved as a child which you still enjoy as an adult?
Quite a few, yes. I can happily watch The Princess Bride every couple of years.
I love that one! It had an amazing cast.
Indeed. It featured real actors like Mandy Patinkin, not just comedians.
Is that the one with Billy Crystal?
Yes. Also Andre the Giant and Fred Savage when he was a little boy.
I remember my parents shouting out quotes from The Princess Bride.
I still do that! "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya."
Oh, that's right! And the prince had a catch phrase.
"As you wish."  He was always saying it to Princess Buttercup.
Buttercup, ha ha! That name would never work in any film nowadays.
No, but it was the 80s. That decade was corny beyond belief.
My favourite was The Neverending Story.
With Atreyu and the luck dragon?
Yes. He was called Falcor.
I always thought he looked like a giant guinea pig.
Now that you mention it, yes he did. Ah well, the budget was very low.
The producers made sequels of Neverending Story.
They were terrible! Such a waste.
I'm pleased that The Princess Bride was never ruined with a sequel.
