In Star Wars, episode three, when is Anakin a real Sith.
Well, he starts it as soon as he killed innocents.
So, when he killed the younglings?
No, before, when he went to see his mom, then slaughtered the sand people, even the young.
So, he was a sith, more or less when he made Luke and Leai.
More or less, he was on the path to the dark side even then, far in the path.
So, maybe his darkness is in their force.
It is, Luke gets angry, but dark and light is in all Jedi.
But the Sith give in and the Jedi dont.
Right, some sith used to be Jedi.
