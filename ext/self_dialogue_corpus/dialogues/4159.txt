Do you like older movies?
Not really, how about you?
Not particularly, but there is one from 1976 that is stellar.
What is the name?
It is called Taxi Driver.
I have heard of that.
The reason you have heard of it, is because it is an awesome thriller.
Oh really?
Yes it builds from the beginning to the end and is quite thrilling.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
