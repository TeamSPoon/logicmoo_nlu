Do you remember when Metallica didn't suck?
What? Metallica has always been awesome!
Are you telling me Fuel was good?
What are you talking about?
The album, Fuel.
The last album Metallica made was Black.
Oh.  In that case, they are still great.
Are you just figuring that out?
One is is one of my favorite songs ever
I see what you did there.
The video is rough though.
I cannot live to see it again.
I cannot die if I did.
It was an absolute horror.
Trapped in by myself watching it
I must feel that would be a bad time.
I'm waking up, and cannot see it again.
Left me life in a hell of crappy new Metallica
Oh God please help me.
Cut this life off from me!
