Lets talk about music.  What is your favorite band/performer?
I love music.  Picking a favorite is difficult, but I would have to go with Black Eyed Peas.
Really.  What is so good about them?
All of their music has a good beat.  I love many of their songs too.
Nice.  What type of music do they perform?
They are more of an alternative rap, hip-hop, and dance.  It is good music to listen to to exercise and take your mind off of the day.
How many people are in their band?
There are three men and one woman.
When did they start singing?
In 1990.
Cool. Sounds like you know your music.
Yes, I have enjoyed music all my life.  Music really soothes the soul.
When do you listen to music?
I listen to it in my car and when I exercise.  I really love a good song to come on while driving.
Me too.  I really like to listen to Darius Rucker too.
I like him too.  He is country and his songs are very appealing.
I really enjoyed our conversation about music.
Me too. It was fun.
Let me know if you hear a good song lately. I am always adding to my music collection.
I sure will.  You do the same.
