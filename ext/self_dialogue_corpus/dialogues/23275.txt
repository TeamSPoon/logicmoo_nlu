Why dont we see more films that blend animation within it as well?
Give me an example of one.
Well this is an old one
Are you talking about a certain Bob Hoskins film?
Yes, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
I guess you could say the more updated version would be Ted.
I think thats dumb.
Ted was?
Yeah I think it was more of a stoner flick.
I can see your angle but it was definitely different.
But in a comedy I do not want to see an unbelievable plot part.
A talking teddy bear is original though.
Yes but not in a film for adults.
I think you need to expand your mind, the first one was funny.
And then it fell off on the 2nd one.
Well with the success you always do a sequel.
I wish that wasnt the pervasive thought.
Seth MacFarlane can make some good films.
I think thats really the only one hes done.
I guess so, lets say he can write some good entertainment then.
