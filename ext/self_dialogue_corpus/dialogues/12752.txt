How many Star Wars movies do you think will be made?
Thats a tough call
I think they keep developing them for as long as humanity is around.
At one point you have to stop.
They are going to CGI Carrie Fisher
Yeah and that seems bad.
Like morally wrong?
Not that, but just write her out.
Maybe thats what will happen
We will have to wait to see
