You think the Falcons will be really good again this year?
I don't know, they still have all the same pieces right?
Oh yeah, Julio Jones and company will be back.
I just feel like they peaked last year, and they won't be able to duplicate that success.
Yeah, I think Matt Ryan led the NFL in fantasy points right?
Is that what we're using to determine how good players are these days?
Well I know it sounds stupid, but fantasy points does kind of sum up a players performance.
Yeah i guess you're right.
I hear ya though, it's tough to repeat a stellar performance like last year.
Honestly I was just surprised they were good all year.
What do you mean?
I just thought that Freeman would get hurt or something, he's so small.
Yeah he is.  I mean Julio cooled off there at the end though.
Yeah that's true, he cooled off but they were still really good.
I think he was on pace to break all kinds of records.
Yeah, he had that one game where he got over 300 receiving yards.
Yeah that was insane, that's so many yards.
At some point, I feel like that's a bad thing though.
Why's that?
Wouldn't you be a little jealous and annoyed if your qb threw to one guy that much, and not you?
