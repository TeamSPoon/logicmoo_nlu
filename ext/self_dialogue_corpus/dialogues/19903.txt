What do you think of this oldie but goodie?
Queen - Another One Bites the Dust what an awesome song.
What an explosive beat.﻿
That bass line in this song is just killer.
Yeah, makes me wish I knew how to play the bass.
If I knew how, I would play this song all day long.
Wasn't this song in Iron Man 2?
I'm not sure.
I think it was in Iron Man 2.
I think that classic rock songs are the best, the modern songs are just crap!
Unless they're are classic rock band that are still together like Rush or AC/DC and so on.
I agree.
The new crap has no limits on cussing.
You're right too much cursing, too much profanity, just too much.
Reminds me of hip hop and not rock.
True, because that's all you hear in hip hop music is profanity.
I agree. Not all hip hop is like that but...
But the majority is and that is what makes the whole music genre look bad.
I think  Queen has made some of the best music in music in music history﻿.
Yes I agree.﻿
