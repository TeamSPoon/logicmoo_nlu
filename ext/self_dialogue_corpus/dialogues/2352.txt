Sir, I am a huge Vikings fan.
The Vikings? Of Minnesota?
The very same.
Well, it's great to meet another Vikings fan here in Florida.
Did you come down to retire too?
Yes sir, it's nice and warm here even in the dead of winter.
I would go back to see that playoff game, though.
Oh, I would too, in a heartbeat.
I just with Walsh could have made that kick.
Oh me too, I couldn't believe he shanked it to the left.
It was very cold that day.
He still should have made the kick.
Do you know he plays for Seattle now?
Oh, is that right?
He's competing for a spot on their roster now.
That isn't surprising. He practically gave the game away last year.
Seattle's kicker went rouge too.
He still hit a few in that Vikings game.
Yes, that is true.
Let's hope Blair Walsh plays for the Seahawks next year and cost them a playoff game.
