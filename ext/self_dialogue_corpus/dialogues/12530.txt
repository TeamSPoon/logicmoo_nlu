How do you think the Last Jedi will play out?
I think we might see the end of Luke.
In what way?
They may have him go into exile somewhere that cannot be found
You think thats how his character dies?
We wont ever see it happen
Could he come back in future films?
I think the plotline will allow for that.
Thats a sad ending to an iconic character
You never know with the way directors want to go now
