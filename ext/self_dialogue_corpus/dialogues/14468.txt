I can't believe these NBA playoffs.
What about them?
All the favorites are winning.
Yeah, it's been blowout city.
Do you think the Spurs even had a chance with Leonard playing?
I don't think they did.
Neither do I. The Warriors are just too good.
I know. They have four all stars in their starting line up alone!
It's insane. Maybe the best team ever?
I guess you could make the argument.
Think the Cavs can give them a run for their money in the Finals?
Maybe. They're also playing lights out.
It should be interesting. Lebron is an amazing player.
He sure is. Single handely beat the Celtics himself the other night.
What a blowout that game was is.
Yeah. 72-31 at the half!
I couldn't believe it. So embarrasing.
Yeah. NBA just needs the Finals to happen already.
Want to have a NBA Finals watch party?
Sure! That'd be awesome.
