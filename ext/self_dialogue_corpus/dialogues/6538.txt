Do you remember the movie "Babes in Toyland"?
No, not really. Who was in it?
It was one of Drew Barrymore's first movies. She was the star.
I really don't remember. What was it about again?
It's about this girl who cares for her family and acts like an adult, refusing to ever be treated as a child until she's transported to Toyland on Christmas Eve,
Wow, I can't say I've ever seen that.
That's crazy, but It is pretty old.
When did it come out?
The original came out in 1961, and the Drew Barrymore version came out in 1986.
Yeah, I really don't think I've seen it! I'll have to check it out.
