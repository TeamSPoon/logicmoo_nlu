Oh, man. That new Mummy...
There's a new Mummy too? Man, I haven't seen Brendan Fraser for a while.
No, man. He's not in it. It's... different.
He's not? So they rebooted another reboot? Like Spider-Man?
Yeah, I don't know why they do this. This is really bad.
Is it the same story? Same characters and everything?
No. I don't... know if it's the same as those old ones, but it's not like the Brendan Fraser ones.
What is it like, then?
Well, it's got Tom Cruise as a soldier in modern-day Iraq. And... uh, it's got Jekyll and Hyde.
What.
