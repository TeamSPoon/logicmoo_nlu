It's tough to be a football fan in the bay area.
Why? Didn't the 49ers do okay last year?
Yeah. But I mean, it's more because there are two teams out here.
The Raiders and the 49ers.
Right. And I feel like all of my friends are fans of one but not the other.
But they play in different conferences? I feel like this shouldn't be a problem.
It's not a huge problem or anything, but it's difficult to get people excited.
What do you mean?
It's like they have a rivalry but never play.
Hmm. I understand that, I think. I really do
It's just a little bit uncomfortable. Not a whole lot though.
Well, maybe we should find a weekend when they both play at different times, and have a big party.
I could get into that.
Do you know who to invite?
Kevin is really excited about the new season for the Raiders.
Then he should come.
And Molly and her dad both really like the 49ers.
They should come too!
Okay. This should be fun!
I think it will be!
