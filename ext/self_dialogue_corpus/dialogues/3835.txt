Have you ever seen The Conjuring?
It doesn't sound familiar. What's it about?
Well it's a paranormal thriller that takes place at some family's farmhouse and the characters are based on real people, The Warrens.
Ed and Lorraine Warren?
Yeah!
Oh I've heard of them, and seen some other thriller type stuff based on their work.
So it sound like something you'd be interested in?
Definitely, I've liked the other stuff I've seen and thriller is one of my favourite genres.
Well then you should like this. I like how it's not your typical thriller in that it takes you almost out of the story and references filming.
Almost like breaking the fourth wall.
