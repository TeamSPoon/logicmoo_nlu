How much did you like The Ring?
I thought it was an OK movie.
Why would you say that?
I just think the premise was boring.
In what manner?
Watching a video tape?
Yeah it was just new.
But they should have something different that was believable.
Oh ok yeah I get where youre coming from
But the villain so to speak was pretty cool in that she was scary.
