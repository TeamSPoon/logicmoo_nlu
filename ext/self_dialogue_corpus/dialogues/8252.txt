You know what I think is so great about pop music?
What is that?
I think that it is great how you can really watch an artist grow up through it.
I can see that. Like Justin Bieber.
Oh yeah, he was just a child when he became popular. Now he is a full grown man.
Or look at Gwen Steffani. She has been in the spotlight for over twenty years.
True. I really miss music from her band No Doubt.
Yeah, I haven't heard anything new from them in awhile.
I think she is doing more solo things now.
Well she certainly is talented enough for it.
