What kind of music do you like?
Oh, I like metal music mostly.
I don't listen to much metal, so I'm not familiar with it.
It's mainly guitar driven.
What does that mean?
Most of the "metal" sound revolves around a distorted guitar sound and the music the guitarists play.
Oh ok, so it's kind of like rock?
Similar, but there's a stronger feeling of aggression and power.
That sounds kind of scary.
Some metal is actually pretty tame and melodic.
Wow, I had no idea.
Yeah some metal is even Christian, that kind is called White Metal.
That's very interesting, what other kinds are there?
There are some kinds of metal that are super fast, some kinds that are slow and heavy.
I didn't know that there were so many different kinds.
There weren't that many in the beginning really.
What was the beginning of metal like?
It was kind of thrash-y stuff that had a lot of rock style singing.
Is Metallica a classic metal band from around the beginning era? I've heard of them at least.
I would say so, though they have all kinds of different styles of metal that they play.
