Have you seen any good thriller movies lately?
Are you talking about new or old?
It doesn't matter I just want to find a decent thriller to watch.
Silence of the  Lambs was good. Did you ever see Hannibal?
No I missed that one and I really like Anthony Hopkins.
It was pretty good as well
Maybe I will give it a try. I know Jodie Foster isn't in this one.
Yes but Julianne Moore is really good as FBI agent Starling.
Well I gotta scoot. My cat is in the window being harassed by some noisy little birds.
Tootles to you. Until we meet again.
