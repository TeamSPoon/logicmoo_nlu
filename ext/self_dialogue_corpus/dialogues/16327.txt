Now that many of the female singers, I guess so-called divas, of earlier eras are gone, do you think there's anyone current who can take their place?
Take their place? Definitely not, but fill the diva role? Yes, I think so.
Who is out there now though that even comes close?
Well you still have Celine Dion for starters.
Yes, but she's been around a long time. I'd consider her more one of the earlier divas.
Well, how about Adele?
Oh, that's a good point. I didn't think about that.
I'd say she's the closest thing this generation has.
She is really amazing.
I know. Her voice manages to be powerful and bold, but still unique.
It amazes me that I thought she originally was going to be a one hit wonder with her first album.
That's right. What was that song called?
Chasing Pavements. She released it as Adele Adkins.
I remember that. I don't think I know anything else off of that first album.
You probably aren't alone, but her second two turned into huge hits.
They did! There are so many good songs on both of them.
I didn't think anything could get better than what she did on the 21 album, but I think 25 might be even better.
Hello was obviously the song that blew up first, but am in love with Water Under the Bridge.
That's a good one, but I really like When We Were Young.
I like it too. But I think I prefer when she's more upbeat because we don't hear it often!
