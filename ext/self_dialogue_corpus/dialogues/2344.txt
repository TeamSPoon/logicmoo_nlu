Hey, you into football at all?
Yeah, I watch it some.
Do you watch pro or college most times?
I'm a NFL fan. Don't watch much college. What about you?
I'm an NFL fan too.  Can't wait for the season to start.
Me either.  Who's your favorite team?
I'm a cowboy fan from way back in the day.  What about you?
Bronco's.  Been one since Elway started for them.
So you were there for their back to back wins?
Best times of my life.  I still get chills watching him dive for the TD in his last superbowl.
Yeah he definetly went out on top.  But he really had Tarell Davis to thank for their being there both those years.
That's for sure and probably would have been a third year if he didn't get hurt.
That's something Denver has always had, a strong running game.
Always seems they can churn quality backs out of there no matter when they were drafted.
Or if they were drafted.  Of course can't talk about Dallas and Denver and not mention the Cowboy win in '78
Well, can't win them all I guess.
That was the start of four superbowl losses for your team.
But they came back with a couple wins.  Your team lost some superbowls too you know.
True, true.  I'd just like to see Dallas in another superbowl again.  It's been a long dry spell now.
Not so much for the Bronco's I guess.
