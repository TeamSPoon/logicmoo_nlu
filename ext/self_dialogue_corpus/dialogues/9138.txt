Do you like rock music?
Yes I do, especially classic rock!
I am big on classic rock myself. I am a big fan of the Rolling Stones.
Hey they are awesome.  One of my all time favorite songs is "Brown Sugar"
Brown Sugar is a great dance song!  I also like "Satisfaction".
Yeah that's practically a rock anthem.
Yeah really! They played that multiple times when I saw them in concert and the crowd went nuts!
Wow what an experience!  Back in the day I went to lots of rock concerts.
Me too! One of my first concerts was the Doors, but the best rock concert I saw was the Beach Boys.
Yeah they can really rev up the crowd with "Good Vibrations!"
