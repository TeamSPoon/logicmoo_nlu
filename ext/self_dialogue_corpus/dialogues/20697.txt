Hey friend! Who's your favorite actor?
That's out of the blue.  Um, I guess Jackie Chan.
Really? I guess he is pretty good isn't he.
Yeah!  I think I've seen all of his movies and I love them all.
What do you think is his best movie?
Comedy wise you can't beat the Rush Hour movies.
What about overall?
I think my favorite Jackie Chan movie is probably Rumble in the Bronx.
I've never seen that one. What's it about?
Jackie Chan comes to America and ends up fighting some gangs.
Haha, sounds pretty good, a lot of action?
Yeah man, it's a Jackie Chan movie!
I think I'll check that one out, is it on netflix?
I don't think so, but I've got a copy of it on DVD if you want to borrow it.
Sure, I'll pick it up at work tomorrow.
Alright, you won't regret it. What's your favorite Jackie Chan movie?
I really like Shanghai Noon, it always cracks me up.
I completely forgot about that one! I'm gonna have to watch it tonight.
Well, thanks for the info man!
No problem, see you tomorrow.
