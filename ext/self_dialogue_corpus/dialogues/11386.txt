Do you have a favorite Beatles song?
Not really, maybe Let It Be, what about you?
I really like Helter Skelter.
Well I guess we're both McCartney fans!
Ha, absolutely. They were all so talented
Even Ringo?
Yeah, even Ringo!
I actually think George Harrison was the most talented
I agree, he's so underrated
Brilliant guitarist - he was just a laid back guy and personality compared to the rest
