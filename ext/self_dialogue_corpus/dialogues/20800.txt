I Love A Sister Act!
Wow! Me too! It's absolutely "a hilariously divine comedy," as ABC Radio Network said.
It sure is! Whoopi is great in her starring role!
Whoopi? Who is Whoopi?
Seriously? You don't know who Whoopi is?
No, I don't. Who's Whoopi?
It's Whoopi Goldberg silly! Whoopi Goldberg!
Oh I know now, I think I've seen her on television before.
Yes, probably. She's been everywhere!
Who else did that movie star?
It starred Maggie Smith too, in probably her most prominent role ever.
I haven't heard of her, certainly.
It's rated PG and was published in Dolby Surround sound.
That's a nice viewing experience.
I know, right? I had it on VHS the second it came out.
Did you see it in theaters too?
No, just on VHS. It's really great. I must watch it once a month.
You like it that much?
Yes, yes I do. And I'm proud.
Go get it! So happy for you!
