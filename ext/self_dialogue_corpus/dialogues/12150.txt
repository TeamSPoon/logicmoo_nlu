Who is the better obi wan kenobi?
Hands down I have to say Alec Guinness.
I do agree, but did feel ewan mcgregor was very good casting.
That he was he just can't compete with Alec.
Ya, it would be like an untrained luke against darth vader.
Ha, maybe true. I loved the training sessions with Yoda in the swamp.
That is such a good section of the film, I prefer the intro to yoda when luke has no clue it is him.
I think luke comes off as such twit and rude in that section.
I think that is the point, he has far to go on his journey and development.
True and also shows the dark side in him that was present with his father , shows his struggle.
