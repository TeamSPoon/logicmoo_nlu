Have you ever seen the movie, Borat?
I love that movie! it is hilarious.
A lot of foreign people really hate it because they think it mocks their culture and is an improper representation of foreigners.
That's what makes it so funny though! I feel like if you cant enjoy it for its humor you are just stuck up.
Definitely, I feel the same way.
I mean, I could see how someone can be offended by it.
Me too, but if you are, its probably because you know some of that stuff actually is true.
Yeah, if it was a complete facade then people would know it doesn't represent them.
Agreed. The way they make it over the top clearly shows its just a goof.
If anything though, they could have had less male nudity. I wasn't a fan of that, haha.
