Do you think another Batman v. Superman film will be produced?
No way. The first one was horrible.
I know. I wonder how they messed up such great potential.
Yeah, it was tough to watch.
Suicide Squad was similar if you ask me.
I haven't seen that film but I know people were not pleased with it.
It was just too predictable. Nothing will top The Dark Knight.
I doubt it. That is one of the best films ever.
Maybe if Christopher Nolan made another film, but he's the only one who can top it.
Agreed. He is a great superhero film director.
