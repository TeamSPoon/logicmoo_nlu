Are you a lady Gaga fan?
Yes I am, She is a hell of a singer.
I heard her sing live the other day on a talk show.  She sounded amazing.
I love her newer song million reasons.
I love some of her older stuff like "Bad Romance" and "Poker Face"
"Just Dance" is one of my all time favorties
I like that also.  I can't wait for her next album.
She is coming to my town in a few months.  I am going to see her live when she comes.
I would love to go with you.
Lady Gaga is one of the best artist since Madonna.
