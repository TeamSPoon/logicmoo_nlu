What do you think about all these NFL players who have been getting neurological disabilities after their careers.
It's really scary.
Yeah, it's so odd how that these kind of things weren't really taken seriously.
I think that it was just so new considering the NFL as the sport it is today hasn't been around that long.
I definitely don't think they took stuff like concussions as serious as they do today.
Yeah, it seems like back then, quarterbacks were allowed to go back into a game even after getting one.
It's scary to think what might happen to the quarterbacks from just even a few decades ago.
I agree. You would think that they might suffer some issues.
I hope not. Some of them are some of my favorite players.
Me too. I hope that they're the lucky ones and don't suffer any medical issues years after their careers ended.
I'm just glad the NFL started taking the issue seriously. Their new policies make it safer for players.
Yeah. I also think that they have better technology today, too, like better helmets.
I agree. Some of those helmets look a lot safer.
The only thing I don't like is some of the new rules that they put into place when it comes to playing.
Why don't you like it?
I think it kind of handicaps defensive players a bit. Some of the rules seem a bit soft.
Yeah, I can see that. But I think the NFL has too look at these players' long term health.
I just wish there was a way for them to play like they used to and still have better medical resources to prevent issues later.
I don't think that's possible but hopefully they figure out how to make the NFL safer without sacrificing the game.
I agree with that.
