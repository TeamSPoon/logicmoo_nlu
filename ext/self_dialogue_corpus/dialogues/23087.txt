So we were talking about John Cusack movies earlier.
Yes, i am a major John Cusack fan.
What was the first movie you saw him in?
Well, my first JC movie was Better off Dead.
Right on, i remember that movie.
Stand By me was next and then he did a movie called Hot Persuit. The girl that was his girlfriend i had a crush on.
That's cool. I think i remember that movie. Wasnt it where they were going on vacation in the carribean and crazyness ensues?
Yes. It wasnt the usual "Brat Pack" movie he was doing. Although, Ben Stiller was in it as the bad guy.
I remember he did a slew of movies in the 90's.
Yeah, him and Tim Robbins did Tapeheads and that was a different character then what he usually played.
Oh yeah, he was a sleazy video maker.
Yeah. Then he did Say Anything. His character's name was Lloyd and since my name is Lloyd, i was hooked.
HA, that's crazy. But after One Crazy Summer, he started doin more Adult Roles like in Eight Men Out and such.
Yeah but that started to fizzle his image. It wasnt until Grosse Point Blank and Con Air did he jump back on the map.
True. When did High Fidelity come into play?
Oh, right after Pushing Tin and that crazy movie, Being John Malkovich.
OMG, that was the CRAZIEST movie i had ever seen in those days.
Yes, it was an original to say the least.
He kinda slipped out of the lime light but kept working untill Hot Tub Time Machine.
YES! That movie was crazy, i loved it!
