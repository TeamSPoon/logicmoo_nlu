Who do you think is the best pop artist of all time?
I think some people would say Madonna, but I'm still gonna say Britney.
Britney Spears? She doesn't have the durability of Madonna!
She may not, but I think she will still be forever the world's best and most popular.
Well, she does have commercial value, I just don't know if her music can really be called great.
Well, music tastes are always subjective, but I bet everyone can sing along to her music.
More people than can sing "Like a Virgin"?
Sure, sure. But "Hit me Baby" and "Oops I did it again" will get there in another ten years.
I still don't see them lasting the test of time.
They have already lasted almost twenty years. That's a long time for music.
