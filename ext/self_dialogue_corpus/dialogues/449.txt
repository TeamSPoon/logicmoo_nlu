Do you know what the most watched TV event is?
Is it the Academy Awards?
Good guess, but no.
How about the Presidential Inauguration?
That isn't it, either.
OK, I give up. What is it?
Superbowl.
Oh! I see where that makes sense.
According to NBC, the 8 most watched television broadcasts in history have all been Superbowl games.
I'm not a big football fan, but I always catch that game.
I do, too and it's usually at someone's house who's having a Superbowl party.
I had one once, but there was just too much yelling going on during the game.
I know. Some people just totally get into it/
Well, the games are usually good and I really like a lot of the commercials they show.
True. They also always have such great halftime shows.
That's one of the main reasons I watch the game. So many good performers have performed there.
I though Lady Gaga was so good last year.
Me, too. Then I also liked Beyonce the year before.
The halftime shows have had a lot of huge stars.
They sure have.
