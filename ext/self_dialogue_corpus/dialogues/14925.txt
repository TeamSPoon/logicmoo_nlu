What's the funniest movie you ever saw?
"Blazing Saddles." I've never laughed so hard.
That movie gave a whole new meaning to sitting around the campfire!
I really liked Cleavon Little as the sheriff. The part where he rides into town and everyone is happy to see him, until they realize that he's not what they expected.
How about when his family had to create their own wagon train circle?
Great scene. Everybody in it was good. I liked Alex Karras, or should I say Mongo?
Even when he punched the horse?
Even then. What's the funniest movie you ever saw?
"Airplane."
Another gem. Why aren't there any funny movies like that anymore?
