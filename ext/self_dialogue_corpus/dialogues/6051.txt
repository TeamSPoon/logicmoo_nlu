So many people know Disney for their princess movies, but other ones are great as well.
I know what you mean. I really liked The Lion King, for instance.
Yes, that one is such a classic! I'd say it is one of my favorites, especially since James Earl Jones voices Mufasa.
Did you know that it is based on Shakespeare's play Hamlet?
I hadn't heard that before. But now that I think about it, it makes sense.
Yes, since his father Mufasa is dead and his uncle Scar tries to take over.
You know, I really enjoyed the sequels to The Lion King as well.
Which one did you like better, The Lion King 2 or The Lion King 1 1/2?
I liked The Lion King 1 1/2. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious, and I like the whole concept of seeing their side.
Yeah, it was funny how it was like they were watching the movie with us.
