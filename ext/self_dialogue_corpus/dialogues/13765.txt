Did you know that Lady Gaga was a songwriter and a performer?
Yes! I heard that she used to write songs for other people before she became a star herself.
She is so talented. I am impressed by both her singing and her dancing.
Have you heard her new album yet?
I have! It has a very different style than her last record.
That's true. But I still love. What is your favorite song on the record?
I think that A-Yo is my favorite. It's so fun.
That's a good pick. But that's not my favorite.
What is your favorite?
I love Million Reasons. It is such a beautiful song. That one is my favorite.
