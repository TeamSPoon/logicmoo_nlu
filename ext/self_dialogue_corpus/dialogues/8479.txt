Do you want to go see Justin Bieber with me?
Sure, I'm really starting to like his music.
Me too. I love the song "Sorry" I was just listening to it actually.
Now that he's grown up, his talent is really starting to show.
I know that you mean. I used to think he was such a spoiled brat.
I think its a lot to become as famous a he did, basically overnight.
True. He was only 14 when he really hit it big.
Exactly. I really commend the fact that he's done public apologies for his behavior.
Yeah, it takes a lot to go on live television and admit you were wrong.
Yeah, I don't know it I could do that.
