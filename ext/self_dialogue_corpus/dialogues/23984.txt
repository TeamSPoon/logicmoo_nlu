Did you like Jurassic Park?
It was okay
What was your favorite part
I liked it when the trex was chasing the jeep
It would be cool to have a dino zoo.
I have a hard time believing the animals would be that hard to control
Yes, but I would not want to be the one to control them
There are already big animals in zoos.
The bigger dinosuars would be the coolest ones
It would be expensive to feed them
Would you go to extra lengths to fence them in?
You would not lose electricity if you had multiple redundancies.
I'm not sure that simply not having electricity would make a difference
It seemed really unsafe to have the trexes behind those flimsy electric fences
That was like the electric fence you use to keep animals out of your garden
You would want some kind of barrier
In Jurrasic World they almost make the park right
The birds were the main problem in that
If the birds were well fed I don't think they would go after the people
They make the predators scary
