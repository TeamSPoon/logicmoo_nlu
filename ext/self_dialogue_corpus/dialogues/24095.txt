Do you want to go watch Alien:Covenant?
You know I do. I love those movies.
You even liked Prometheus?
Of course I did. The only people who didn't were the ones who thought it was going to be a straight prequel.
I thought it was alright, but I'm not sure about how it fits into the Alien series.
What's not to understand? It shows the creators of that particular race in the very beginning.
I get that much, but what were they trying to make?
It's obvious isn't it? They were trying to make the perfect being.
How do you figure that?
They were described as the architects or something like that, right?
Well yeah, I remember that.
So that should indicate that they were creating all kinds of things and that they were trying to narrow it all down to one, perfect creation.
I guess I can see that. But how they are going to tie this new one into that?
It's pretty clear cut that Weyland Yutani knew for quite some time that there was something on that planet that they wanted.
Of course there is. That's always been the central point.
So, they knew about the possibility from the very beginning and it's been compounding ever since. This seems to be the point where the Xenomorph has finally evolved to that final form.
And of course the company would know that based on information being sent back to Earth.
Exactly.
So this is the first real crew to try to answer to the distress beacon?
More or less, yes. And it will be the first crew to really face the Alien creature as it is supposed to be.
