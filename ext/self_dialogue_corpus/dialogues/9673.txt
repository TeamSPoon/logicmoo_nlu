Know what I love about foreign hip hop?
Not being able to understand a word of it?
Very funny. But seriously.
No, what?
Well american rap can get a bit predictable, I hate to say. I love that with the new accents and slang and everything it opens up a lot more opportunity for unextpected word combinations and things.
You're planning a trip to Ireland, right? That gives you something to talk about with people, the local rap scene.
And, it gives me new slang with which to discuss it!
There you go. I'm guessing they talk about the culture and social stuff in the music, too.
Absolutely, that's actually probably where I first hear about a lot of important issues from overseas. I wouldn't know what stuff to investigate had I not heard it referenced in the songs.
That's a really valuable part of the music right there, whether about foreign places or right here at home.
