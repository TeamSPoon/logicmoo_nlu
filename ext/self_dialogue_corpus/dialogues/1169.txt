Who's the best team in the NFL?
No doubt the Cowboys!
That's just your opinion.
No, it's the truth!
No, the Eagles are the best!
Who can top Dak Prescott?
Carson Wentz can.
I don't know about that.
Sure, he had almost 4000 yards in 2016.
Yes, but Prescott got the same or more.
You have to admit they are a tight match up.
Both are superstars.
I can't wait to see them play.
Me too.
They will be both top prospects for the Super Bowl.
I love the Super Bowl.
Especially the commercials and entertainment are incredible.
I don't know any other sport with such great entertainment.
It is hard to top.
Let's go to a game together this year.
