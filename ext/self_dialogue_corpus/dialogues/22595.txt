So my favorite movie is the Matrix what about you
I like the Matrix too but I'm more of a comedy fan
Did you see all three of The Matrix
There's three I thought there was only two
Yeah the first one is called The Matrix then the second is called The Matrix Revolution and then the third called The Matrix Reloaded
Oh cool I think I'm going to check that last one out was it pretty good
It's not as good as the second one I think the second one is the best
Which one was that the Matrix Reloaded or revolution
I'm not mistaken I think the Matrix Reloaded is the second one
Yeah I think you're right too I think the reloaded one is the second evolution is the third
Yeah you're right so what kind of comedy movies do you like or do you like certain actors
What is a few actors that I like but mainly just comedy in general something to make me laugh
