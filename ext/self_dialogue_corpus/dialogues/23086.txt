Did you ever see 127 hours?
I don't think so. What's it about?
The guy that had his arm caught in between rocks in Utah.
Oh yeah, James Franco was the star.
Yes, that's the one.
I never saw it. I heard it was pretty gruesome at the end.
Yeah, when he cuts his arm off it was pretty bad.
I don't do well with those types of scenes
Yeah, I had to fast forward through that part
I bet. What were some of the other big movies that year?
There was Black Swan
Oh, the one with Natalie Portman?
Yeah, that's it
I didn't care for that one.
And the True Grit
Oh, that was good. With Jeff Bridges?
Yes, that's the one.
That was a remake right?
Yes, original one had John Wayne
Yeah, I liked that one as well.
