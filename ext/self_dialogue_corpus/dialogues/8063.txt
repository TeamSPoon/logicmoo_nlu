In your opinion, who is the best female pop singer right now?
I would have to go with either Beyonce or Taylor Swift.
Really, Taylor Swift?
Yes, why not Taylor Swift?
She is good, don't get me wrong, I just think there are so many better.
Well do you at least agree with Beyonce?
Oh definitely, who wouldn't?
It would be hard to argue.
Taylor Swift is good as well. She has had many hits recently.
Right, which is why I put her on the level of Beyonce.
