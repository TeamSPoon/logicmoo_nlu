Do you think its possible for Jay Z to make a bad song?
I don't think I can recall any bad ones
His album with Linkin Park was so good
I've listened to that album too many times to remember
I was at his concert recently and it was so fun
Beyonce and him make a really good team in terms of music.
I think he is my favorite rapper
99 problems is a really good song
I think that song is when I started to listen.
I'm looking forward to his new stuff
