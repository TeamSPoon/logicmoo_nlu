I heard that you like horror movies. Have you seen anything new lately?
Yeah I do, I recently watched Get Out.
Oh yeah! I've been wanting to watch it. Is it any good?
It's very good. Such a new concept for a movie.
What was your favorite thing about it?
I really liked the plot. It was very thought-provoking.
I hear that it has really good ratings. Lots of people have been raving about it.
For good reasons too, when you get a chance you should check it out.
Is it out to rent now?
I think so.
