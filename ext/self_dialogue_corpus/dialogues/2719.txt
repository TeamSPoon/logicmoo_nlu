Do you follow NFL?
Only when my team plays, really.
Who is your team?
Used to be the Dolphins but now I like the Panthers.
I don't mind the Panthers, but the quarterback is such a cry baby!
No he is not and he can play!
Not so much last season, the season before he was good though...
Who is your team?
Still the Cards!
Man, they came close but never got the title!
Yeah, too close one time against the Steelers...
That was a bum game!
I thought the refs were totally biased!
I can't stand the Steelers!
Me either! Them Steelers and the patriots!
Ugh, yup Pats are another one!
What about the Raiders?
Oh my gosh! They really surprised us huh?
Totally! And they are going to Las Vegas?
So I hear! I think it fits, though.
