Jason Momoa is the perfect casting for Aquaman.
If you've seen Game Of Thrones then you know how great he is going to be.
The Dark Knight has the perfect ending to a superhero movie.
Nolan did something magical with that movie.
Harley Quinn stole the movie for me.
Margot Robbie was perfect as Harley.
What was the best part in Captain America: Civil War for you?
Easy. When Ant-man got so big that they all paused for a second to realise what was happening.
So Logan was Hugh Jackman's last performance as Wolverine?
Yeah, i teared up just a bit at the end.
