Do you ever listen to classical guitar?
You mean like Andre Segovia?
Yes.
I've heard it occasionally on classical radio, but I don't buy any for my own collection.
Do you like it?
Actually, yes. I think the guitar is a beautiful instrument. It has a certain intimacy that touches your soul.
I agree.
What songs do you like for the guitar?
Actually, when speaking about classical guitar, instrumental pieces are not songs.
I see. What do you call it then?
You could refer to it as a "piece" or "work" if you want to use a general term. A song only refers to a vocal work with instrumental accompaniment.
I see. Then what piece do you think is good?
My personal favorites are "La Catedral" by Agustin Barrios and "Asturias" by Albeniz.
That sounds Spanish. Is it Flamenco music?
No, it is more serious than Flamenco music. Flamenco is more of a folk/dance type of music, while classical guitar is in the realm of fine art.
That's interesting. So are they Spanish composers?
A lot of the important classical guitar composers were from Spain, but Barrios, one of the most important, was a Peruvian composer.
I see. Are there any other types of classical guitar compositions that don't have a Spanish origin?
There are many exceptions. It's quite common for classical guitarists to transcribe the works of Johan Sebastian Bach for the guitar. There are also important guitar pieces written by modern composers such as William Walton.
That's cool. I think you've sparked an interest in me to seek out some classical guitar music and learn more about it.
