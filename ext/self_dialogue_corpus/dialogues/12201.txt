What did you think of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope?
It was amazing when it came out. I think audiences were looking for something different in the movie sector.
You're right. The characters and the story were so different than anything that had been done.
I know. Who would think that robots talking to each other would make a good part of the story!
Yeah, and what about Chewie's character? It's a good thing that Luke and everyone always translated for him.
It was different to cast Mark Hamill as the hero. He certainly didn't look the part of a glalactic warrior!
I know, but that made it more interesting. Luke's character was so anxious to get into the war with all his friends, though.
Casting Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor was a good move. He played the part of Obi Wan great!
And what about the light saber? That was an unusual weapon to have.
Yeah, and it was interesting that only certain people could use it.
