Do you think they should release the original unaltered version of Star Wars?
Yes, because all you can see now are the special editions.
Yeah, I want to see it when it was just Star Wars and not A New Hope.
I doubt people know that it was originally released not as Episode 4.
The original is much different than the new updated ones.
Yes, there is the werewolf in the space port scene and so many other things.
Also, there was no Jabba.
Yes, the movie works much better without him.
What is your favorite scene in the first movie?
The R2-D2 scene where he gets captured.
