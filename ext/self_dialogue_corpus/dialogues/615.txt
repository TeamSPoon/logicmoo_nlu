Hey, what do you think about football?
I don't really follow it
Oh, come on!
No, really.  I don't follow it
Not even casually?
What do you mean by casually?
I mean you watch the occasional game
You mean just one game a year is casually?
Yea, sure!
Okay I watched the Super Bowl
What did you think of the game?
It was OK
Just OK?
Yea I really didn't understand what was going on
Oh I see.  So you never watch it enough to even understand the rules?
Yea pretty much
Why did you watch it then?
My brother was having a party
Oh so you went?
Yea, I like the pizza
