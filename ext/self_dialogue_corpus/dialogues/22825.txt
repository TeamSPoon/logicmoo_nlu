Do you think 'The Dark Knight' was the best Batman movie?
That is a tough question to answer.  There were so many good Batman movies.
Well, unless you exclude 'Batman Forever.'
Of course.  I assumed that was a given.
So besides that one, which would you choose?
I think my favorite was 'Batman Begins.'  It made Batman cool again.
It did redeem the franchise after 'Batman Forever.'
I guess yours is 'The Dark Knight?'
Yes.  I thought Christopher Nolan was such a perfect director.
I liked that the whole trilogy was based on realism.
It also kept the darkness that was set as precedent during the first Batman movie.
You mean the one with Michael Keaton?  I agree.
While Nolan's movies get my vote, I will give an honorable mention to Ben Affleck as Batman.
But 'Batman v Superman' was so bad.
It was bad.  But I think that their Batman was the truest to form, in regards to the comics.
I am unfamiliar with the comics.
Well like Ben Affleck portrayed him in the movie, comic book Batman is crazier and more obsessed with the war against crime.
Well, the only thing then that wasn't true to the comics with Ben Affleck's Batman was that he killed criminals.
Good point.  That's like Batman's most important rule.
His one rule in fact.  Regardless, I'm excited to see what the studios have in store for Batman next.
