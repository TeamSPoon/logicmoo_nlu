Do you know Lady Gaga's music?
Yes.
do you like it?
Yes.  I really like her song "bad romance."
me, too.
I heard once how she explained it, such as with the chorus.  Very interesting!
right.  I had not known that  either.
I thought she had been just making up certain sounds, but it is really words.
Yep.  Same, here.
It was not until I saw her  explain it on a TV show, where I then learned the true words and meaning behind it.
