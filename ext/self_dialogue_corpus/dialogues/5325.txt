Have you seen Mulan?
Yes when I was younger. I liked it.
I loved that movie. I loved that she was so empowered.
I think it has a joan of ark theme to it.
How so? Didn't joan her the voice of god?
She did. I think they are similar in a female dresses up as a male to be in a combat situation.
That is very true. Never thought of that.
I wonder if Disney drew directly on joan for this Mulan character plot.
It was actually based on the legend of Hua Mulan.
I never realized that. Pretty neat. Maybe lots of women had to conceal themselves to have more rights back in the day.
