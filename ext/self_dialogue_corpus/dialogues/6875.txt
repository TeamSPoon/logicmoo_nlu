What Disney movie would you like to watch?
We can watch Beauty and The Beast.
I haven't seen that yet, was it good?
It was beautiful! I almost cried I was so moved by it.
Wow. Who is your favorite character?
Belle, for sure. Emma Watson really grabbed that role and made it her own.
I'd heard that she turned down La La Land, so she could do Beauty and the Beast.
I didn't know that.
What's funnier is Ryan Gosling was offered the Beast role, but turned it down for La La Land.
Oh wow, that's really something!
