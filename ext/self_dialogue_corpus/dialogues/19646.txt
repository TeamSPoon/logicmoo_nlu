Hey J.D did you think about that concert invite I sent?
Was that the Hot Chip invite on Facebook?
Yeah man exactly!
I'm a big fan of Hot Chip but there is no space to dance at the Mint venue.
I know but we can still see them on the West Coast and that is worth it.
I really only hope they play songs from the Ready for the Floor era.
You always talk about those Hot Chip years like they were the best, I must disagree.
That is when they were at their creative peak, I Feel Better is a legendary tune that they haven't topped.
They've become more dance ready with beats and harmonies, less lyrics.
I miss the lead vocalist being funky and jamming with the soft vocals.
It was all synth back then, it is more organic sound now.
Does Hot Chip have an under card performance?
I think Crookers might be performing nearby in Downtown.
Oh wow Crookers was incredible back in the day!
I remember those old school raves, that is kind of why I want to go to Hot Chip.
I get that completely, I will get a ticket for both.
Salmon Dance is one of the best remixes ever made!
I love that track and miss the old times, this show will be for nostalgia's sake.
Let's do it bud, and jam that Crookers and Hot Chip all day!
Let's do it!
