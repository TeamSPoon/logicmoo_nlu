Does the NFL have a concussion problem?
Yes, they definitely do. They have admitted it.
Wow, that's scary!
It is. Many of the players are at risk -- especially in the long term.
Even after they have played?
Yes, it appears to be a life-long risk.
What are the risks?
Retired players are at risk for brain disease. This disease may cause them to become suicidal.
It's even worse than I thought!
I know, but they can take steps to prevent concussions.
How so?
First, they need to change the game.
What do you mean?
The game needs to move away from impact and towards skill.
What else can be done?
The equipment needs to be upgraded. While it has become safer, much work remains.
Anything else?
The most important thing is information.
Information?
Yes, the players need to be made aware of the risks. And, they need to better report their symptoms.
