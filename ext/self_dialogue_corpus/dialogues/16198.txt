What are you thoughts on musicals?
I love them!
Who is your favorite composer for them?
Stephen sondheim is among the best to me.
He has so many good ones; A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Sweeney Todd,
Out of those ones my favorite is Sweeney Todd Barber of Fleet Street.
I saw it live once. It is so impressive to hear it live.
Sondheim is kind of know for his complicated scores. Sweeney is among those.
Yes, so much in the layering and timing.
The fact that each actor has to be so precise or all will be thrown off is an immense undertaking.
I really loved the johanna song they have throughout. Such a beautiful melody.
It is and is such a good driver in the action.  I love the meat pie song.
The Worst Pies in London is the title. It is so good.
Angela lansbury played that role on stage.
Yes and it was helen boham carter in the movie.
I like her but prefer angela lansbury and the stage version in general more.
I feel like musicals are usually much more impressive in person.
Well yes any live performance always takes more skill no second cut or take like in a studio.
Agreed. I have so much respect for the actors singing craft.
Especially on a sondheim show. Most complicated composer for musicals bar none.
