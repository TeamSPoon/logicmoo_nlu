I just found out they're making a sequel!
Oh that's gonna be dope. I love that movie!
Me too. I feel like it was really underrated.
I wonder what the plot is going to be?
From what I understand, they start exploring the internet.
The whole video game world is full potential. There are a ton of fun ideas to play with in that mythology.
I agree, Wreck It Ralph was actually one of the few animated films that I felt really lent itself to the possibility of sequels.
I wonder if eventually he'll evolve like Donkey Kong did?
What do you mean?
Think of how Donkey Kong was essentially the villain in the begining, but eventually everything changed and he got his own set of games.
