Which is better: Episode I or II?
Wow, they're both awful.
Awfully entertaining!
No, they're just bad.
So, which is worse, hater?
Episode I for sure. Two has awful dialogue, but One has no actual use.
They found Anakin.
Yeah, and that's it. Plus, he's obnoxious.
You know he got bullied so hard he quit acting, right?
Guess the Force wasn't strong with him, was it?
