Trivia time.
Ok. Fine,bring it.
Who had the most homeruns over his career?
Easy. Barry Bonds. 762. He passed Hank Aaron's record in 2007.
yes, but who has the most homeruns in a single season and how many?
Easy again. Barry Bonds. 73. the year of our good lord, 2001.
Ok. I'm going to stump you sooner or later. Let's see. Most strikeouts in his career?
That's even easier than the homerun count. Nolan Ryan with 5714. The Second is Randy Johnson, but 839 less than Ryan
Most strikeouts in a single season.
This is actually pretty interesting. It's Matt Kilroy, but from the year 1886, in the 20th century, again, Nolan Ryan with 383 in 1973
Who stole the most bases?
Rickey Henderson 1406.
Who stole the most bases in a single season?
Rickety Henderson again with 130 stolen bases in the 1982 season. But that's limiting ourselves to the 20th century. Hugh Nicol had 138 in 1887.
Ok, then who stole the most home base? Over the entire career
Stealing home isn't common, so this number is pretty small. And it's not kept as a record separately from the other steals.
You've been stumped
Maybe.
Admit it.
No. Ty Cobb has 54 home steals. But it's not an official stat from the MLB. it's not that I don't know, but rather it's not kept a record of.
