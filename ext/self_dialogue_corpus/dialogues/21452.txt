Did you watch the last Avengers film?
Yeah I thought it was awesome.
I was a bigger fan of Civil war.
I agree that was also an awesome film.
So who is the best actor in the marvel universe.
I think I would give it to Captain America
Some of his dialogue is weak
I dont think so.
He acts in campy situations as well.
I think he is a great character.
What about villains?
I dont know about them, they arent in enough movies.
I found Ultron to be annoying.
It was a bit odd to see his persona.
Yeah it seemed like he was fake.
How about Thor?
He is super bad.
Like as an actor?
He just seems to be all brawn.
His movies are boring.
