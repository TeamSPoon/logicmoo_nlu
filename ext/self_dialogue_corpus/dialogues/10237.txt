You remember that True Lies movie?
From way back when.  1994 I think.
Yeah.  That was a pretty solid movie though.
I remember Jamie Lee Curtis was in it as his wife.
Which seems weird as she doesn't seem like a sex symbol.
She actually looked pretty good in it where she had to wear that dress.Which
I appreciated that the movie had a bit of campiness.
Especially at the end.  The main bad guy died by getting stuck on a missile.
That's what I'm saying.  It poked fun at itself.
Better thrillers usually do.
