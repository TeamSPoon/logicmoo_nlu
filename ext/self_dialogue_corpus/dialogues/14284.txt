The Warriors and Cavs sure are dominating the playoffs so far.
Yeah, nobody has been a challenge, they've both won every game so far.
I guess the rest paid off for Lebron.
Yeah, he's as dominant in these playoffs as ever before.
What about Durant? Looks like the warriors made a good move in picking him up.
Yeah, seems like he was worth giving up some of the depth they had.
They still have some good role players. Javale Magee is playing great.
Yeah, he's great on the boards and I love when he dunks those lobs.
David West has been giving the Warriors good minutes lately too.
Yeah, well, seems like they just have too much talent to lose this year.
True, even if Curry or Thompson aren't playing well Durant and Green can take over the game.
Yeah, it helps that Durant doesn't rely on the three as much.
Cleveland made some good acquisitions this year as well.
Yes, Korver and Williams have become a major part of their regular rotation.
Korver had 18 points in the last game against the Raptors.
Yeah, signing Bogut didn't work out too well though.
No, can't believe he broke his leg right away. I think they're still set up pretty well though.
Yeah, it's hard to imagine anyone can stop either the Cavs or the Warriors.
No, especially since the other teams look like they could both be in seven game series.
Yeah, once they advance, the Cavs and Warriors will be waiting and well rested.
