Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes I saw it at the Drive-in!
How did you think Chris Pratt did?
His acting was great!
I think he really fits the role as Star Lord.
I agree.  I think he did even better in this movie!
Who is your favorite character from the series?
I really like Gamora's character, she just seems so complex.
Yeah, she definitely is, but I think Groot is my favorite!
Why is Groot your favorite?
I just think he brings a perfect amount of comedy in the tough situations.
I definitely get that, but I think Rocket kind of does that too.
To some extent, but I'm impressed by Groot, because he doesn't really even talk.
Well he does talk, just hardly anyone can understand him.
I still can't believe that Groot sacrificed himself in the first movie to save the others.
Yeah, that makes him really awesome and such a great character.
I also couldn't believe he was voiced by Vin Deisel
I thought that was a great choice!
Definitely, because he was super big and awesome before going back to being baby Groot
That's true! He's definitely super cool as a character!
