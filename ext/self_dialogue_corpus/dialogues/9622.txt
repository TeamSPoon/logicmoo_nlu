Who do you think is the greatest female rapper of all time?
Hands down Missy Elliott. I've always loved her style of music.
Yes, she really is an individual and very identifiable. No other female rapper has the same sound as her.
Exactly. People always say Lil Kim or Foxy Brown, and I ask them what is the difference.
True, they have similar sounds and used to have a similar sexy look back in the day.
I think Da Brat is also really talented. I'm not sure if she raps anymore though
I haven't heard much from her for a while but she really used to be one of my favorites. Her and Trina.
Trina? I remember the name but can't remember what song she sang
She had this big song about 10 years ago called "Here we Go"
Oh yes, featuring Kelly Rowland. I liked that song actually.
