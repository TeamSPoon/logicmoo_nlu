The new Stephen King looks so creepy.
What movie are you talking about, Dark Tower?
No, I'm talking about It.
Oh yeah, the remake!
Yep.  I remember seeing the miniseries on TV.
I think this one's quite a bit different.
How so?
I don't believe in this one, any of them grow up.
You mean they are kids throughout the movie?
That's what I heard, but again, not 100% sure.
That's an interesting take.  I actually preferred them as kids in the first one.
The clown is so creepy.
All clowns are creepy.
Yeah, but dial that creepiness up 1000% for this one.
Do you think they'll switch the ending around?
I imagine they might revise it somewhat.
Probably to leave it open-ended for future films?
Yeah.  A lot of these low-budget horror movies do that since they are cheap to make and box office gold.
Well, I'll go see it and midnight and scare myself to death.
I'll be right there with you.
