Hey, what your favorite music?
I went through a lot of phases of music.
What was your favorite phase of music?
Probably the phase I'm going through right now.
What's the phase you're going through right now?
I've recently ben enjoying pop electronic music.
Pop electronic music? What's an example of that.
Music like Down by Mariann hill, or 4U by Blackbear.
I think I've heard of the songs. They're pretty unique
They're not super mainstream, but I enjoy it.
I think the best songs are not mainstream, what do you think?
I agree, it seems like the most popular ones are the catchy ones.
Yeah the one's that get stuck in your head right?
Yeah. Like Ride by twenty one pilots.
Isn't it weird how the entire radio industry just wants to get songs stuck in your head?
Yeah it's like clickbait. quality goes down for Quantity.
You're right. I never really thought about that.
We're just being used by big entertainment companies.
Should we boycott?
Nah. I'm just gunna listen to my tunes.
