Do you think the jaguars improve this year.
Yes I do.
I do too.
I think to coughlin will help the team.
He's a smart man.
Yes,and he's tough.
He's a disciplinarian.
They have some good talent.
I know they do.
They added Leonard fournette and Dede Westbrook.
Very good additions.
Fournette will help Blake bortles.
Yes he will.
A.J. Boule and Jalen Ramsey are great corners.
Yes they are.
Cam Robinson adds power in the run game.
I forgot about him.
Run blocking should be better.
