What do you think about going to an NFL game this season?
I would love to see the Seattle Seahawks play.
Really, why that team?
They have a strong defense with Jarran Reed.
He is an amazing player.
Yes, he carried the team and led defensively.
He didn't let anyone get by him.
I know, it was fantastic to watch him.
What other teams should we look out for?
The Ravens Joe Flacco will put on a great show again.
He is a standout as well.
He is paid quite well I hear too.
The NFL players make a lot of dough.
I wish I were one.
Yes, but your body takes a beating.
That's for sure.
But, the muscle power is standout.
I wish I had those muscles.
Being on TV wouldn't be so bad, too.
That would be a blast.
