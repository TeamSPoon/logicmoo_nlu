Have you been to any good concerts lately?
Yes, I just saw Twenty One Pilots a couple weeks ago.
I've heard a lot about them but haven't listened to them much. What made them so good?
Everything! But to be more specific, their showmanship made their songs even better than they already were!
In what way? Are they a lot different than other bands live?
Yes! They are very active and are running and jumping all over the place. They were even in a giant hamster ball at one point!
Wow! That is definitely unique. Could you describe their music to me?
It has to be heard to understand, but I'll try. They incorporate a lot of things from different genres but they're mostly pop-punk,
Okay! I've heard that they're Christian, would I not get a lot out of their lyrics if I'm not?
Not at all! There's that extra layer of meaning if you can relate to it, but pretty much every song is still relatable even if you aren't religious.
That's really good to know. What kind of people go to their concerts?
Oh, just about everyone! Kids, teenagers, adults, and even older adults that aren't just there to take their kids.
Really? Are they that popular?
Oh, yes. They're really just that unique but not in an off-putting way.
Wow, well I guess I will have to check them out. I have one more question, though.
What?
Can I go to a show of theirs with you next time they're in town?
Absolutely! I'd love to see them with you.
Good! Thank you for telling me more about them.
You're welcome! They are amazing.
