Have you ever seen disney's rescuers down under?
Yes, I feel like it is often forgotten about completely.
I was going to say that, funny.
I love the mouse that reminds of zsa zsa gabor.
I think she may have voiced that role, no?
That would make sense so much alike.
Or rather one in the same. I liked the kangaroo.
He was a good guy. The seagull was really funny too.
Interesting disney uses seagulls in that way in The little mermaid too!
Never thought of that before, but true scuttle is also very funny.
