Hey darlin' would you get me a beer?
Sure I will, honey.
Thank you sweetheart.
You are most welcome.
Do you want to watch the game with me?
*laughs*  Not really.  The only thing that interests me are the uniforms.  Who the heck is playing?
Oh, this is Miami.
Why are the uniforms periwinkle blue?
I think they are more like seafoam blue.
No, that is definitely periwinkle.
You could be right, you know that stuff better than I do.
It seems an odd choice for a football team.  Like, you know, it's not an extremely manly color or anything.
Well I don't know but the uniforms are different based on whether the team is home or away.
You know whose uniforms have gotten a lot better over the years?
Who.
Tampa.
Oh yeah.
Remember, years ago?  They used to be like, bright pumpkin orange.
I know.  That was based on what?  Pumpkin colored pirates?  What?
Exactly!
