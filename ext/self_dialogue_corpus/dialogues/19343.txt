What do you consider the top live albums of all time?
Let's see.  I would say REO Speedwagon 's You Get What You Play For.  Bob Seger Live Bullet.  Cheap Trick's Live at the Budokan.
Very Nice.  Have you ever seen any of those artists live?
I saw Bob Seger on his Against the Wind Tour. I saw REO twice.
Seger has been around so long.
I enjoy his music from the Smokin OP's right up through Makin' Thunderbirds and Like a Rock.
You seem to be a 70's and 80's person.
There was some really good music back then.
Did you see a lot of live shows?
Yes.  They had shows at the Mississippi River Festival that brought in a lot of groups.
Sounds like fun.
The groups liked it because the stage was air conditioned.  It was outside.  We liked it because it was general admission seats.
REO Speedwagon changed during that time.
It broke my heart.  They went from hard rock to pop.  It was sad.
Did you ever catch Lynryd Skynyrd?
Unfortunately no.  I wanted to see them and the Eagles.  Saw neither.
The Eagles have reunited several times.
I know.  I still haven't caught one of their shows.
Would they be the show you want to see most?
You better believe it.
