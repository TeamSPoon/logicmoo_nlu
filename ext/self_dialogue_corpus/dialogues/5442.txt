So what's your favorite Disney song?
I don't know, there are so many. How about you?
Well, since you asked; I would have to say the entire soundtrack of "The Little Mermaid!"
Well, you said which "song". Not which soundtrack. Just reminding you.
Okay, well then; I liked "Part of Your World"  best.  She was so sad down beneath the sea with her collection of sunken treasures.
Your right.  Maybe too sad for me though. I liked " Under the Sea".  Sebastian and all of the other sea creatures were jamming out.
Yeah, but Sebastian was too worried all of the time.
That's because Ariel was such a rebel.
You're right. That's why I like her.  She reminds me of , well, me!
You wish!
