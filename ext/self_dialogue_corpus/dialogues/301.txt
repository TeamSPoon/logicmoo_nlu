I imagine you love Marvel movies the best.
They've been doing a great job the past ten years.  Iron Man was such a good starter.
I agree.  The special effects were killer.
And the casting was so perfect.  Robert Downey Jr. playing a recovering alcoholic!
They never mention him being an alcoholic in the movies though, do they?
Yeah, that's true.  I just mostly remember it from the comics.
Yeah, none of them are super faithful to the comics.
True.  There's a lot of mixing and matching.
And Civil War isn't exactly like the original Civil War plot.
That's true, although it would have been in poor taste since I think a school in Connecticut got blown up.
