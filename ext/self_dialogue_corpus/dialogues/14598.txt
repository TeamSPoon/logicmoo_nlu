Did you see the game between the Kings and the Lakers?
Yeah they were really intense.
Those teams really hate each other!
Yeah it's been a big rivalry since like... forever.
Even back in the 90s?
Yeah of course in the 90s!
Why do you say that?
Well back them it was Shaq and Kobe vs Webber and Bibby!
Oh yeah, I remember Shaq and Kobe but not the other two.
Yeah they aren't as famous but they are arguably as good as them
Are their jerseys like hanging up at the King's stadium?
I know Webber's number is retired though.
What about Bibby?
I don't think his is retired.
Do you think they will be rivals forever?
Oh yeah, it's basically a NorCal and SoCal thing.
True, Norcal and Socal think they are both the best.
That's how a lot of rivalries happen, just depending on location.
Sometimes it is within one state, or across the whole country!
True. I think a lot of people just like to find a team to hate!
