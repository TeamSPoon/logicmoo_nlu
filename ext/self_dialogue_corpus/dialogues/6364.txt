Have you seen Moana yet?
No, I haven't but I really want to.
It is out on Netflix now, you need to watch it!
Really? I guess I have no excuse.
Yeah the music in it is great.
I know! I love listening to the songs.
You know they were written by the same guy who did Hamilton?
No, I didn't know that. No wonder they are so good.
And the movie is pretty great too.
Well, I will need to watch it soon!
