Hey, were you ever a Guns n Roses fan?
Are you serious?  I loved them!
I still do.  Axl Rose is an amazing artist.
Yeah, he totally was.  They've had great music from the get go.
When did they first come out?
I think their first release was in 1987.  It was Appetite for Destruction.
Oh that was an awesome album.  That had Sweet Child Of Mine.
Yeah, and Paradise City.  The whole album was great.
I think Sweet Child Of Mine was their first Billboard Hit.
Yeah it was.  After that, they had that Lies album.
Yeah, that wasn't quite as good as Appetite For Destruction, but I still liked it.
Yes I agree.  Who was in the band aside from Axl Rose?
Well, there was Slash, Izzy, Duff, and then the drummer.  I forgot his name.
They were all great.  I wonder what they're up to now.
I don't know.  The last albums I bought were the Use Your Illusion albums.
Oh I loved those too!  That had November Rain, right?
Yeah, that was a beautiful song.
Yes, a little softer than their original stuff but it was still amazing.
I liked the soft quality of it.
Yes, it managed to be soft but still be a hard rock song.
