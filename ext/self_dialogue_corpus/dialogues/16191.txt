Do you go to a lot of concerts?
Not as many as I used to.
Not a lot of good live music anymore.
I know. Still some old timers that are still touring.
Yes,like Sir Paul McCartney!
Man he plays for three hours.
Yes he does. No breaks either.
He does a ton of Beatles songs.
Well, he has a ton of them.
Boy does he ever.
He opens with A Hard Day's Night now.
I saw that on You Tube.
Sounds like it did fifty years ago.
It's unreal how good it sounds.
Unreal how good he still sounds.
His music will live on forever.
His solo stuff is classic too.
My favorite solo,work is Maybe I'm Amazed.
First single,out after the Beatles split up.
Number one hit.
