Are you a fan of horror movies?
I think they're kind of fun once in a while.
What's your favorite one?
I'm not sure. If I had to pick, I'd have to say that one movie where the people think they're being haunted by ghosts, but the people actually are the ghosts in the end.
I've seen that movie too! I think it's called The Others.
Yeah, that's it! I love that movie.
I like it too! I never saw that twist coming.
I didn't either! Unfortunately, it's not the best movie to watch over and over because of that though.
Yeah, it kind of reminds me of Shutter Island in that way.
I know what you mean. Shutter Island was so good though!
I really liked it the first time I saw it, but the next time it wasn't nearly as scary.
I agree. I think I've only seen it twice because of that.
Remember the movie The Village?
Yeah, that one had such a crazy twist!
I kind of liked it even though no one else I knew did.
I liked it too. It was original at least.
Yeah, I guess I could see how some people might have found the ending a let down though.
It kind of ended up being a scary movie that wasn't really a scary movie in a way.
I think it was only scary the first time and then it's just funning watching it for the foreshadowing.
We should watch that soon. I haven't seen it in forever!
