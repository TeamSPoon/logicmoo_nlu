Have you seen the new Star Wars movie The Force Awakens?
Yes, I am not a big Star Wars fan but I thought it was really good.
What was your favorite part?
I really liked the main character, Rey.
I agree, I thought she was a good example of a strong female lead.
I liked the addition of BB8 too.
Me too! And I was so happy that C3PO made an appearance.
What do you think is going to happen in the next movie?
I don't know - but I cannot wait to find out.
I hope we find out where Luke Skywalker is.
