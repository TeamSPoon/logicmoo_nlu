Do you think the NFL is losing popularity?
I don't think so.
I do.
Why is that?
Well with esports growing and kids not playing sports as much these days I think it is slowly losing popularity.
I never thought about that.
Yeah sadly I think eventually it won't be nearly as big as it is now.
That's a little sad.
That's being said I think ti will always hold a good popularity.
I can't see it ever dying out.
Me either.
Do you think the game will change much in say fifty years?
That's too hard to say.
I think it will, there have been so many rules since the early 90s as is.
Do you think it will be more easy going?
What do you mean?
I mean do you think it won't be smash mouth football anymore?
Definitely.
That's sad.
It protects the players.
