So what do you think about Lady Gaga in general?
I think she is super talented.
I agree but sometimes she seems a bit extra.
Yes what was going on with the meat dress?
I am glad that she is now focused on her talent.
I loved how she sang with Tony Bennet.
I also loved when she did the tribute to Julie Andrews.
I think that is where she first showed her operatic side.
I know what a difference than when she first came out.
The beginning she was just an electronic artist.
