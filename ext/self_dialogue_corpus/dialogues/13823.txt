Did you hear Lady Gaga's new song?
Which one is that?
It's called The Cure. She sang it live at Coachella and it's just kind of blown up.
I haven't heard it.  I really liked A Million Reasons though from her album Joanne.
I feel like this may be her time to come back.  She came out with a bang in the late 2000s with The Fame but then she kind of fizzled out.
You didn't like Born This Way or Artpop?
No, none of the songs were very catchy.  The only catchy song was Born This Way.
I really liked Applause but you're right, there weren't as many stand alone hits.
I heard she did a jazz album at some point.  I'll have to check that out but I don't really like jazz.
I listened to one or two songs.  It was pretty good.
