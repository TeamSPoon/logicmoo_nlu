Have you seen Moana?
Like a hundreded times my kids loved that movie.
I really like the fact that Disney is telling real stories from around the world.
They are also really focused on female leads.
Yes that is amazing isn't it.
Hey who played Maui in the movie?
Dwayne Johnson.  You know "The Rock" from wrestling.
Oh yeah.  Do you smell what the rock is cooking?
Yeah that's him.  If you pay attention when he meets Moana he gives her the 'people's brow'
That's hilarious I'm going to have to go watch it again.
