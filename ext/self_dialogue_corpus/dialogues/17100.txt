Quick! What's your favorite theme song ever?
There's so many. My favorite is the Friends theme song, I'll be there with you.
Lame, but a classic. Lame though.
Har Har. What's your favorite?
Hmm. Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
Spongebob Squarepants. Is that really your favorite?
Probably not, but it's near and dear to my heart.
I also love the George Lopez theme song.
Yeah that one is dope, with the cowbell.
There are just so many theme songs that I like, and they all feel nostalgic.
You know what other theme songs are great. The ones from movies?
Like what?
The Harry potter theme song for example.
Oh that one is great, with the bells. It sounds so mysterious, and magical.
Just hearing it makes me excited about the magical world.
Some of them can be beautiful, like the Lord of the Rings theme song.
That one is pretty epic and gives me the chills.
Or the titanic theme song?
Lame. A classic, but lame.
You got me there.
