You ready for football season?
Man, I can't wait. Ready to see these Bills get it going.
Hopefully, they got a good reboot in during the offseason.
Hopefully. I'm glad Rex Ryan is gone.
Me too. You know how much I hate him.
He is the worst. All he thinks about are the Pats.
Yeah, right? Like, dude, focus on your OWN team.
And his brother's defense was, of course, trash.
Certified trash. How many games did they lose?
I think at least 9.
It's a shame. Tyrod Taylor looks like he has some potential.
I know, right? It's criminal!
And then, of course, y'all have Watkins and McCoy.
Is McCoy still there?
I think so, but maybe not. But still... Watkins and Taylor.
Yeah, that's a deadly duo.
But Watkins needs to stay healthy.
Heck, so does Tyrod.
That's true too.
Yeah, but I think they can make the playoffs this year, for sure.
