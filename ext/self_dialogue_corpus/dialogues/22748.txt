Have you watched anything good recently?
Yeah, I watched Moana last night. It's on Netflix now!
Oh really? I shouldn't have bothered going to the theater and paying for it then!
Yeah, everything comes to Netflix eventually.
Did you like it?
So much! I cried.
I always cry during Disney movies.
Me too. That one theme song was really good.
Yeah, totally crying.
What about you? See anything good recently?
I went to Wonder Woman last week.
How was it? Over hyped?
Oh, I loved it. I particularly liked that they let the Amazons be visibly old. They were strong and sexy and fierce, but they didn't try to hide any wrinkles.
Awesome, I should check it out. Vote with my dollars, as it were.
Definitely recommend.
I so rarely GO to the movies though. They're so expensive here.
Yeah, I definitely miss the matinee pricing that you can get outside of NYC.
Right? I don't always want to pay $15 for a ticket.
Remember dollar movies? Did your home town have those?
Yes! If I was going to a movie, it was likely a dollar movie.
