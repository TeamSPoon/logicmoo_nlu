Have you heard about the Knuckleballer who is the 1st woman in West Coast League?
"Now would it be sexist if we slap her butt after a good outing, Dee?"
Come on man. I'm serious.
Really/ I thought you were joking.
No, I am dead serious.
Awesome! If a woman ever makes it to MLB, this is how it'll happen.
I hope to see it someday.
And I hope she succeeds unless she plays for the Cardinals, in which case I hope she's awful.
I'm sorry, did you just imply that a pitcher that came up with the Cardinals that should otherwise have only an outside chance at being on an MLB roster would be unaffected by our devil magic?
You know Jackie Mitchell was the first female player to play professional baseball.
I know. Legend has it that she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the same inning.
And the next day the commissioner voided her contract and declared that women were not fit to play baseball because it would take too much of a toll on their bodies or something like that.
Yeah. They banned us women from the MLB until the '90s.
You know what he was probably thinking at the time.
"Women need to say in the kitchen where they belong"
Not to be sexist or anything but I don't see why women would want to play professional baseball. All of that pitching isn't good for men.
So you think Babe Ruth was right?
What did he say?
Babe Ruth said something to the effect that women were too delicate and liable to get hurt if they played baseball.
I think baseball is hard on anybody's body. Man or woman.
