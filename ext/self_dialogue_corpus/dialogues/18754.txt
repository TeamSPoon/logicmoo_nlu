So, we've got most of the details settled, but what kind of music should our new burger shop play?
What kind of music makes customers want to eat more?
I'm less worried about that and more about making customers relaxed.
So you want something downtempo then?
Maybe. Or at least that isn't intrusive.
I'm worried we'll end up with, like, muzak covers of Beatles songs then.
Well what would you suggest?
I was thinking something people can really get into. Like Madonna or Nirvana.
Nirvana? In a burger shop?
What's wrong with that?
I feel like it'll be too intense. It might be distracting.
Do you have any other ideas then?
What about jazz?
That could work. But I feel like our decor isn't classy enough for jazz to be a safe choice.
I guess classical is out too then.
It's gotta be.
Well, the only suggestion I have left is that we could find a good radio station.
I bet we could find something fitting. Maybe something contemporary?
So not NPR?
Definitely not.
