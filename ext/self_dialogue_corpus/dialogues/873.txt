The Buffalo Bills.
What about them?
7 and 9 last season, didnt make the playoffs.
Yes, but how do they look this season?
Well, they didn't get any good draft pics.
They did get Anquan Boldin.
Yes, and he is a good wide reciever but a team needs more than just that.
True. Hopefully it will bring up their stats.
Well, after twelve interceptions last year they need him to work with the QB to reduce those numbers.
We'll know in 90 or so days.
Yes, hopefully they are working on their blockers as well.
They need to get their qb up in to Winston class.
HA, i dont see that happening but thats the same problem the bucs have, good QB bad recievers.
I agree.
Adolphus Washington needs to keep the rushers awah from their QB.
Well, Adolphus was crushing it last season.
He was but again, one or two people cant run an entire team.
Yeah, but every bit helps.
I still think of that time Giants crushed them.
They played at the old Tampa stadium then, right?
