Do you like any of the artists that have made it big because of music talent shows?
Sure. There are some who are really good?
But most don't really do much after the show is over.
Well, for some that might be true, but Carrie Underwood and Kelly Clarkson both started with American Idol.
That's true. I do like both of them. Is there anyone else even worth listening to though?
Well, I think so. I really like Kelly Pickler and Chris Daughtry.
They didn't win though.
No, they didn't, but they still got their start on the show.
I wish the winners of the Voice would do more.
I know. I think that Jordan Smith and Alisan Porter have extraordinary talent.
I think so too. Jordan singing Chandelier by Sia was jaw-dropping.
It was definitely a surprise. He has shifted more into the Gospel genre I think.
I think he has his roots in Gospel so that wouldn't surprise me.
Taking on a Sia song is no joke. She has quite the power and voice herself.
I agree. I don't think I've heard anything she sings that isn't impressive.
I do think that some of her more recent songs, like The Greatest, don't show off her talent as much.
I can see that. But it is really hard to top Chandelier.
True. That was such a powerful song with a huge range.
I'd be interested to see some of the American Idol or Voice stars that on that.
Well, I'm sure at least some of them would do it justice!
