Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?
The one called Divide?
Yes! It's so good!
I know. There's so many catchy song son the album and so many different melodies.
I love the one that sounds like an Irish jig. It's called Nancy Mulligan.
That one's so good. But my favorite is Shape of you.
It does have a good beat. It's much more modern than  lot of the other songs.
What about Castle on a hill. Did you like that one?
Yeah. It's really deep and makes me think of my childhood. I really get lost in his music.
I feel the same way. All of his albums have been really good, I think.
And isn't it cool the way he names his albums?
Yeah. First it was Plus, then Multiply, and now the third album is called divide.
I like to think the last one will be called subtraction.
It probably will. I wonder if the next album will be more country and jig-like like his latest album or if it will have more pop songs.
It will probably have a lot of pop songs. Those seem to hit the top charts more often.
Yeah. Shape of you and Don't got really popular.
But so did his slower love songs like Photograph and Thinking Out Loud.
That's true. I guess every album he makes has a hit or two on it.
Well, I don't care what kind of song it is as long as he keeps making them. He always makes great music.
I agree! I hope he just keeps writing new songs and releasing albums!
