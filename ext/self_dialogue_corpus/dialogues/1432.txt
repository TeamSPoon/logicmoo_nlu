Do you like sport?
Of course I do, Go Bucks!
Eww you like the Bucs?
Born and raise in Florida, got to love them.
I appreciate that, they seem to be doing better.
Yeah there last season was amazing!
I like watching their receiver making big plays.
Well, just Mike tyson for the moment, but I hope they can do better.
I hope so, too. There's one thing I still don't understand though...
What's that?
Why would they ever draft a kicker for their first pick?
Oh my gosh, please never speak of that again.
Haha, I'm just kidding.
It's okay we make a lot of dumb choice.
Like when you would trade that one corner back after paying 96$ million.
I hope they would traded...
OH, they didn't trade, they just release him.
yepp....
It's okay, I think with that new quarterback, I think they can turn it around.
Yes. I hope so to. Go Jameis Winston.
