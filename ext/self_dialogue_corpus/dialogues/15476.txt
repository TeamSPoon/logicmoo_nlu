What is the greatest love song ever written?
That's difficult to answer. So many great love songs!
I know, it's one of the most common themes in music.
I guess you could say there are two kinds of love songs: happy ones, and sad ones.
That's true. Some of the best songs about love have been about loss of love.
A song that was immensely moving to me was 'LLorando', a Spanish cover of the song 'Crying' by Roy Orbison.
Where have I heard that song? It sound familiar.
Did you ever see the movie 'Mullholland Drive'?
Yes, that's where I'd heard it!
That's where I first heard it too. It was an incredibly moving scene.
What a great song, and what a wonderful voice the woman singing it has.
That's an extremely sad song about love.
What about the other side of it - a happy love song?
To be honest, I've always preferred the sad love songs.
Music has a lot of functions, and making you feel better when you're down is definitely one of them!
I've always like the song 'I Will Always Love you' by Whitney Houston.
Ah, that's a great song, and another performer with a magnificent voice.
And another song very strongly associated with a movie.
Maybe there's something to be said for pairing a medium like music with the visual immersion of film.
True, I think there's a multiplicative effect in that pairing.
