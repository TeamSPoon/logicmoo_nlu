Have you seen Dr.Strange yet?
Yes, I have.
I loved it, though it wasn't quite what I expected.
How so?
I guess I was expecting less of the "how he got that way", more about after.
Yeah, I thought that a bit, too, but I didn't really know the character's backstory at all, so I appreciated it.
That's true; one of those movies that is setting up for the sequel.
What about the special effects?
They were wonderful! Of course, the cape settling itself on his shoulders is bound to be iconic.
Nice cape to have on your side!
No kidding! Some of the special effects took "Inception" to the next level.
Loved the wandering through dimensions, too.
Benedict Cumberbatch was terrific as Strange.
He was perfect! As a skilled and arrogant surgeon, to lose his ability to use that skill.
And what he was willing to do to get that skill back.
I liked the Benjamin Bratt cameo, too.
Yes! Don't forget Tilda Swinton; it was so easy to believe her character.
All the actors seemed so well chosen, they all seemed to belong.
I sure hope there's a sequel coming out!
Oh, so do I! won't be fast enough!
