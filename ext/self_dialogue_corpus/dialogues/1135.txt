I loved Superbowl 49.
I bet you did.  You're from Boston, right?
Yes.  A great victory.
Brady didn't do that well, with two interceptions.
They were down by ten points in the fourth quarter.
It looked pretty scary.
I felt better when they scored a touchdown to be only three down.
Then they got the ball back.
A quick pass to Edelman and they had a four point lead.
But still some time on the clock.
Yes, with a Russell Wilson getting hot.
I just cannot believe Kearse's catch.
I thought the ball had fallen to the ground.
It did not look good for the Pats.
Everyone was thinking Marshawn Lynch would punch it in.
The beast mode.
But then, the miracle.
The Malcolm Butler interception.
I loved the look on Richard Sherman's face.
He shook Brady's hand as a measure of good sportsmanship.
