Do you like Western movies?
Yes, especially with the Duke, John Waynr.
He did great movies.  What is your favorite ?
It's got to be Big Jake.
Surprising.  A lot of people choose The Searchers.
I like that one also but I would put The Shootist ahead of The Searchers.
Do you have The Searchers at number three.  What else do you like?
I like True Grit if course.
He won the Academy award for that one.
He was also nominated for The Sands of Iwo Jima. He didn't win though.
His first big role was Stagecoach in 1939.
Another great one.  I think it holds up well despite its age.
He did two movies that were almost identical.
Rio Bravo and El Dorado.  I think El Dorado was the better of the two.
How many of his films had Maureen O'Hara?
A lot.  McClintock, Big Jake, The Quiet Man to name just a few.
The Quiet Man was a little outside his western persona.
Yes, but Replace the old west with Ireland and there you go.
What do you consider his worst film?
Big Jim McLain without a doubt.  I've never been able to see the whole film it's so bad.
