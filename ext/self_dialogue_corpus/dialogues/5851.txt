Do you have a favorite DIsney movie couple?
I don't think so. Do you?
I like Aladdin and Jasmine.
Oh yeah, they're pretty cute together.
Remember when he goes up to her balcony on the Magic Carpet dressed like a prince?
Yes! When she tells him to go jump off a bridge or something and "falls" off the balcony ledge onto Carpet below.
Yeah, and then that leads into that beautiful song...
"A Whole New World"!
Yes! Didn't you just want to be on that magic carpet ride?
I would still jump at the chance!
