What do you think of the NFL?
I think it's a great sport with some issues.
What kind of issues?
Mostly just with the referees and business model of it.
Can you explain a bit more?
Well I think the referees are a lot more biased these days than they used to be.
I imagine it would be difficult to be a referee.
I agree but the issue is still their.
Do you think it makes that much of a deal?
I think it does.
Why?
Mostly because it's always in your mind while you watch the games and wonder if a referee did something to make a team win.
That's a good point.
Plus there are always questionable calls everygame.
How many referees do you think are biased?
I would guess at least 50% or more.
Do you really think it's that many?
I do, referees are sports fans too they love the game.
Why else would they be a referee.
That's a good point.
