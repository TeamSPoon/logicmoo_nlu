Who directed that movie The Killing?
That was Stanley Kubrick
Wow. It is really good.
Yes. The end where the money flies out of the suitcase is intense.
I agree. I felt bad for Sterling Hayden's character.
That movie was unlike any other for that time.
Yeah. The shots were good and the suspense was great
Did it come out in the 60's?
No, the 50's
The 50's had some good thrillers.
