So what is your favorite type of rock music?
I really like glam rock.
Me too.  I love Queen.
Queen is the best I have been listening to a lot of their music lately.
I disovered a beautiful song of theirs.
What is the song called?
It's called Love of My Life.
I love that song and it is not as popular as their others.
I still love their hits like Bohemian Rhapsody and Bicylce though.
Me too, always a classic.
