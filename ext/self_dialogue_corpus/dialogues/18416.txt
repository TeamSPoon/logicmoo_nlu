Do you like any of the new artists out today?
Ummm, I like a few.
You hate more than you like, right?
Yes!  I can't stand a lot of the artists out now.
I don't know what it is, but I feel the same way.
We've become our parents.
I definitely try to keep up with songs that are out nowadays, but it's just not like it used to be.
I know, music has changed for the worst.
When you have reality stars making albums, you know music is trash now.
Don't get me started on reality stars making albums.
It's like "We lack relevancy, let's make music to stay in the spotlight!"
I did like Paris HIlton's album when she put one out.
Oh yeah, her album was really good.
Heidi Montag's though, terrible!
Yes, I can agree with you on that one.
Did you hear that she's having a baby?
Spencer actually created a baby?  Incredible!
I know, it's wild right?  Her face has changed so much.
I think plastic surgery is sad and you see it more and more with musical artists.
They all lack self esteem.  It's really heartbreaking.
