Did you hear Chris Cornnell died?
No. What happened?!
He hung himself after a concert.
No way. That's so sad.
Yeah, I'm pretty bummed.
I didn't know he was even still touring.
Yeah, he was touring with Sound Garden.
I love that band.
Me too.
Looks like another grunge front man down.
Yeah, that's so weird. Like Cobain.
Man, this is depressing.
I just don't understand.
Must be a lot of pressure being a rock 'n roller.
I guess.
Anonymity has it's advantages.
Well, I guess I'm giving up on the dream of being a star.
Oh, yeah. You play an instrument.
I play a wicked kazoo.
Don't thing you would have realized your dream anyway!
