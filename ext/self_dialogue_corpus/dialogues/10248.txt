Did you see The Great Wall?
No, it looked pretty cheesy to me.
It was ok.  Some of the action scenes were cool.
I couldn't believe Matt Damon was in it.  I like his movies ususally.
Did you see all of the Bourne movies?
Yeah, those are some of my favorite action movies.
I really didn't like the Bourne Legacy though.
No, me either.  Bourne has got to be Matt Damon for sure.
Jeremy Renner isn't bad really though.  I liked him in The Hurt Locker.
I think he did good playing Hawkeye in the Avengers movies.
