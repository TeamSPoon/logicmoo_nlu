Are there any new thriller movies that are good?
I thought Split was pretty good.
Is that the one with James McAvoy?
Yeah, he has over 20 split personalities in that movie.
I remember seeing the trailer for that. So it's good?
Yeah, he actual does very well at making the personalities believable.
I guess that would be a really hard role to take on.
I'm sure it was. That's like accepting over 20 roles.
Was it scary enough to make you jump, or was it just creepy?
I thought it was a really good balance of scary and interesting. There were definitely some "jump" moments.
