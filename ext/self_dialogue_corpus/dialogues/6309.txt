Have you read the story The Little Mermaid was based on?
No, I haven't.
Lucky, it's so sad! The Disney movie is way more upbeat.
Oh, well it makes sense that they changed it for a kid's movie then.
Yeah, in the original story she dies.
Who dies?
Ariel! She goes to heaven, though.
Oh yeah, thank goodness they changed it. That would never have worked.
Yeah, and it worked out for the best. I love The Little Mermaid.
Me too. Part Of Your World is a classic karaoke number.
