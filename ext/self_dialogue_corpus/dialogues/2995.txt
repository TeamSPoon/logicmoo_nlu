What a fan of the Los Angeles Rams I am!
Me too! At least I was a fan.
Oh no! What happened?
They left Saint Louis.
Yes, yes they did. Are members of your family still fans?
Some are, some aren't. I couldn't imagine still being a fan.
That must be hard on the family.
Not really, it's not as hard as some other things.
How do you think Geoff will do?
I hope well. We spent a first round pick on him.
How has he done so far?
Not well. He has a losing record overall.
Is that his fault or Fisher's?
It could be the coach but I think it's more his fault than anything else.
He can run the plays, Fisher cannot.
Yes. Is he a good game manager?
I think he's more of a leader than a Russel Wilson manager type.
Should they be a run-first team?
I don't know. The running back isn't good either.
I certainly wish them the best, even with Gurley as a running back.
