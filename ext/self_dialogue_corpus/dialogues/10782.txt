WOuld you like to come over tonight and watch Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift?
I'd love to as Tokyo Drift is my favorite of the series.
What is your favorite thing about F&F TD?
I love the cars and how they are tricked out.
My favorite part is the close up view of life in Tokyo.
Though I do find it a bit of a stretch to view Lucas Black as a teenager considering he was 24 when he made the movie.
I know but his character was great and I enjoyed seeing him learn how to drift.
The parking garage drift sequence was pretty impressive!
It was especially how they drifted around the spiral ramps.
I look forward to coming over and I'll bring the popcorn!
