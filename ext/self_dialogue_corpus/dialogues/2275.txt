So how do you think the Pats will be this year?
Outstanding.  Already were the best team in the NFL and just got better.
Yeah, they are the gold standard in all of American Sports.
Yes, year after year they just win and win.
I know, Brady old as he is, still the best.
Plus don't forget Jimmy G is pretty lights out himself.
Yeah, watching him play last year was awesome.
I know, it wasn't game managing either.  He made big time NFL throws.
He also shredded some good defenses.
Yeah, people overlook Miami is a good team.
They are.  Too bad he got hurt.
Yeah, if Brady still looks good Jimmy could have good trade value.
Or as much as I hate to say it so does Brady.  Could be like a Montana to KC thing.
Yeah, I don't know what San Fran got for that though.
Neither do I.  But I do know Steve Young turned out pretty good.
He sure did.  One of the only lefties to be lights out.
Yeah, most lefties struggle.  But if you can find a good one it poses problems for the defense.
So you think the Pats will repeat?
I think they certainly can.  It's just a matter of doing it.
I know what you're saying.  To many x-factors.
