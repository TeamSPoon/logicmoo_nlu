Did you see Lady Gaga's Super bowl performance this year?
I saw some of it - I wasn't that impressed, actually.
Oh really? Why?
I just expected a bit more drama and showmanship from here. She's quite campy.
Yes, she's moved on a bit though. She's more of a serious singer now.
I remember doing a few songs at a grand piano during that performance.
She has a really great voice when she uses it.
Yes, she does. She's a talented songwriter too.
People forget that it takes talent to write catchy pop songs, and Lady Gaga wrote tons of them.
Exactly - she was absolutely everywhere a few years ago.
