My sister loves the singer of Buck Cherry.
Really. You mean the dirty looking guy?
Yes. His name is Josh Todd.
Doesn't seem like it would be his name. The tattoos really throw you off with him.
Yes, but appearances don't mean anything.
You're right. He does sing good.
Crazy Bitch is a fantastic song. How could someone not like it.
It is a catchy song.
The album called Rock "N" Roll was pretty good.
If you have it, maybe I could listen to it.
