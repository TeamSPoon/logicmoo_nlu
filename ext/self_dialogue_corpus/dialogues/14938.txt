Are they ever going to make another Austin Powers movie?
I think they were planning to at one time.
Seems kind of pointless though.
Yeah, those movies have come and gone.
Mike Myers hasn't done jack in how many years now?
Well, pretty much since Austin Powers.
If they did do one, he'd be another 20 years old or so I think.
I'd rather him make another Wayne's World before this.
Totally agree with you.  Party on, Wayne!
Party on, Garth!
