How do you feel about Kevin Smith?
I like him more as a person than as a filmmaker.
I can kind of understand that.
His initial work was pretty great though.
Yeah, I agree. He had a good run in the beginning.
What's your favorite Kevin Smith film?
Probably Dogma.
Yeah, that's a good one.
I grew up Catholic, so it struck a chord with me.
The cast of that movie was great.
Chris Rock, Matt and Ben, Alan Rickmanâ€¦
George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Jason Lee, and he even had Alanis Morissette.
What's your favorite film of his?
I still think Clerks is his best.
Really?
Even though it's obviously pretty amateurish and the acting isn't that great, I just love what it represents.
What do you mean?
It's a true indie film. He made it in his hometown with his friends, and it ended up launching his career.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing what he was able to accomplish with that film.
I still find it inspiring whenever I think about it all these years later.
