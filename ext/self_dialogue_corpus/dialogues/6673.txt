I have A Whole New World stuck in my head.
Is that the Disney song?
Yeah, that's the one from Aladdin.
That's one of my all-time favorite Disney Movies.
But which one is your favorite?
Fern Gully I think.
Fern Gully isn't actually a Disney film!
Really? I always thought it was!
Nope! My favorite is The Rescuers.
Oh my God, the little mice in that movie are so cute!
