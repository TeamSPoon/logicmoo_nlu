What do you think of the Chargers?
They are from San Diego right?
Right
They are decent
Do you think they can win it this year?
Anyone has a shot
True
They have a good offense, but I question their defense
I feel the opposite
I think they have a shot based on how good they are
They have a strong quarterback.
He is good
I am not sure they can beat the top teams though
They were last place in their division last year
I know, but they are better than that
Hopefully they can top the division this year
Do you think they can beat the Chiefs?
Yes I do
What about the Raiders?
The Raiders are not gonna be as good this year.
