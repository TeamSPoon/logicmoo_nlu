Of the Beatles' later albums, which is your favorite?
Abbey Road, without a doubt. It really displays the strengths of each member.
Yes, there's a lot to like on that record, but overall, I think I'm put off by the slickness of it. It's like you can hear the 1970s looming ahead.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with that! I love that side 2 medley.
There are lots of high points, but still I prefer the rough edges and inconsistency of Let It Be--I think I'm the only one!
But that album is such a downer.
I don't know, it just feels more human to me somehow. And who doesn't love the title track and Hey Jude?
What do you think of the stripped down version that came out a few years ago, the one without the Phil Spector production?
I gave it a listen. I like how it gives some insight into what they were thinking at the time, but you can't really go back in time and re-experience it as new.
I know what you mean--a lot of water under the bridge since then!
