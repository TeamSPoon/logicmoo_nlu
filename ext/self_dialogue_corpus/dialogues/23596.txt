I am so bored of his movies
Whose movies
Peter jacksons
Why his movies are usually awesome
Eh i think they are overrated
I mean they are still great regardless of them being overrated
Well they can use some more streamlining
What do you mean
They are often badly paced and drag
Well some people enjoy long movies
It is not that they are long
What do you mean then
Well i mean that it feels like it takes forever for the plot to move
I like the building of the world though
I mean it is nice but it feels like i want something to happen
I can understand that
Who do you think is overrated
I think Michael Bay is overrated
I can agree
I actually think he is awful.
