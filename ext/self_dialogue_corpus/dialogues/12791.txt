Who was the worst Star Wars character ever?
No question for me: Jar Jar Binks.
You win.  Just a horrible idea.
And offensive too.  They made him so annoying.
I believe many were upset that they made him try and sound Jamaican.
There was some backlash that he was culturally insensitive.
I didn't see that myself, it was everything else that was annoying to me.
Remember the way he spoke?
How can I forget?  Made me want to pull my hair out.
Just another bad idea from George Lucas when doing the prequels.
