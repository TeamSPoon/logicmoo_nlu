We are going to watch the Disney movie Holes tonight.
Really? I heard that was a great movie.
We heard that too.
My son watched it years ago and loved it.
That was out about ten or twelve years ago wasn't it?
Actually I think it's more like fourteen years.
Well, I know there are a lot of good actors in it.
Yes, I think Sogourney Weaver is in it.
She's a good actress.
Yeah, she's been in a lot of good movies.
