I feel like Elton John is the top pop performer of the 70s.
You could almost say the 80s too!
I think that goes to Madonna.
OK so round it out, how about the 90s?
That was a boy band era, so N Sync.
No Backstreet Boy love, huh?
No I just dont think they were as good as N Sync.
How did you feel about R Kelly?
He was pop, but didnt have the influence of the boy bands.
Yeah but I think he left a mark for sure.
