Hey, can you play Beatles songs on your guitar?
Yeah, a few.
What's the hardest one to play?
Hmm, there are some tough ones. I'm learning Here Comes the Sun, and it's pretty tricky.
Oh really? It sounds so pretty.
Yeah, the guitar part is tricky, you have to capo really high on the fret board â€” I usually just play it in open tuning though.
What else?
Come together is pretty tricky too. It's not horrible, but it's not easy either.
It's such a cool song though.
Yeah, I love singing it! Generally, most of the George Harrison songs are tough because he was such a good guitar player.
