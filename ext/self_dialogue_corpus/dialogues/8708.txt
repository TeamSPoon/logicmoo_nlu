What would you say is your favorite rock band?
I would have to go with Muse. You?
I would say Coldplay. The British know their stuff nowadays.
What's your favorite song from them?
It would have to be "Talk." What's your favorite from Muse?
I'd say that "Supermassive Black Hole" is their best song. It's funky and epic.
Ah. I love that one!
Did you ever go to a Coldplay concert?
No. I want to, but I never found the time.
That's a shame. They put on a good show!
