Are you excited for the upcoming season?
I always am.
Who do you think breaks out this year as a quarterback?
Marcus Mariota is my pick.
I will admit I thought coming out of Oregon he would have been a bust.
I think the Titans are glad they didnt trade the pick.
I agree and I think he has turned out to be a nice player
He just has to stay healthy.
Besides him, who else is primed for a huge year?
Not many because this year was not a great year for quarterbacks.
You mean in the draft?
Yeah there was no one who was a game changer.
Do you think Eli Manning is nearing the end?
Yes but he has OBJ to help ease that pain
I agree with you that it could happen.
The NFC East has alot of good quarterback this year.
Kirk Cousins does nothing for me
Theres a reason he keeps getting franchised
I mean yeah he does have alot of good qualities
But he doesnt win games that matter.
