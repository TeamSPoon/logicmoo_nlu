Have you seen Force Awakens yet?
Yea my dad and I went to see it in the theatres.
I just bought it on DVD and can't wait to see it.
What did you think when Snook was introduced?
I was confused be cause I did not know who he was.
The movie didn't explain who he was but it should be revealed in the next movie.
I think he might be a version of Darth Vader.
I thought the same thing, hopefully he will get revenge on the Jedi.
I hope not, the Jedi are good people.
I belong with the dark side.
