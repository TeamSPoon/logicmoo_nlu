Are you a Woody Allen fan?
The guy with glasses?
Um, yeah. He wears glasses.
I haven't seen many of his movies.
Have you seen Annie Hall?
I've heard of it.
But you've never seen it?
No. Any good?
It's a classic comedy.
Didn't it win an Oscar?
Yeah. A few.
And didn't Allen refuse to go to the ceremony?
Well, he was in this jazz band and didn't want to miss a performance.
Really?
Yes, he's an accomplished clarinet player.
I hope he plays better than he can act.
Yeah, his acting can get a little annoying.
Or a lot.
But he's a good director and a great writer.
I'll check out Annie Hall.
