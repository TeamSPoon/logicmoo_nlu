Hey are you stoked about the new Lorde concert?
What? I didn't know she is going on tour!
Yeah, after 2 years of hiatus, she came out with a new album!
Really? What does it call?
Melodrama, and the music are really good.
Well, I wouldn't doubt that, she has always made good music.
Yeah, and this album she's a lot happier, like the songs are not as sad.
That's good to hear, I do like her older stuffs too, though.
What is your favorite song from her?
I love Royals and Team.
