What recent movie do you like best?
I loved the movie called, "Monster Trucks."
That was cool.
It was fun because it was so unexpected.
The title should have given it away but it didn't.
Yes, it was fun the ironic twist.
The actors were very entertaining.
The creativity as well was great.
I liked that my tweens enjoyed the movie.
You bet.  It's hard to please them sometimes with movies.
My daughter wasn't too thrilled, but my son loved it.
My son watched it 5 times when we rented it.
We got to go to the free summer movie series in town and they played it yesterday.
That's fun.  Did you get some popcorn?
We went all out.
We always need popcorn for a movie.
I don't think it's a movie unless you have some popcorn.
I know, that's what the kids think.
I will have to take the kids if Monster Truck II comes out.
Let me know if you hear about it.
