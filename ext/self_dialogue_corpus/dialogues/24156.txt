So have you felt super hero fatigue with all of the Marvel movies yet?
Honestly, I expected to, but not really.
Oh wow that is not the answer I was expecting.
It's mostly because Marvel has done a great job of making me care.
Explain what you mean please.
Well with the connected universe, it feels like one giant big budget television show.
Oh yeah I guess I never saw it that way.
Oh definitely, knowing that after I finish a movie, I'll get to see those characters progress into another movie, years ahead is great.
I never really looked at it as a TV show, just kind of bombarding us with the same movie.
That's what is so exciting, knowing that Guardians of the Galaxy is happening in the same universe as Spiderman and we will get to see them cross.
That is definitely really cool now that I think about it.
And it's been really neat to see less popular heroes get center stage, like Dr. Strange.
And to see lesser ones like Guardians become mega hits, definitely agree.
Exactly, Guardians of the Galaxy was a super niche super hero group until now.
Yeah now we can't escape Groot, he's like the Minions.
Hey you take that back, baby Groot is precious.
Oh he totally is, it's just crazy how good Marvel is at marketing their product.
They're the best in the business, and it's crazy to watch DC struggle to try and catch up.
Oh definitely is, it's almost sad.
Though they got their hit with Wonder Woman, so that's exciting.
