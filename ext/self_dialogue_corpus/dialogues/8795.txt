Who are some of your favorite rock bands?
One of my favorite is Aerosmith.
What are some of their best songs?
I love dream on, walk this way, Janie's got a gun, etc
Aerosmith has been around forever.
I know, but not as long as the Rolling Stones
Do you like the Stones?
I respect what they have done, but I was never a big fan.
What about old school Rock?  Do you like any older artist?
Well like most people, I think the Beatles and Elvis were the best their ever were.
