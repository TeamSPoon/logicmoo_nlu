I was reading an article about the band 5th Harmony yesterday about why they're not changing their name.
Why would they want to change it anyways?
Well, one of the members left for a solo career, so there's only four in the band now.
And they didn't want to change it to Four Harmonies?
No, they said it's their brand. The fans helped pick the name, and it's what they're used to.
Maybe they will get a new member?
It didn't say they were looking for someone. They just figured out a corny angle to it.
What was corny?
They said since the fans named them, the fans would be the fifth member.
Well, at least they appreciate their fans.
