Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
Yeah, it was awesome.  Gal Gadot was the best.
She was, easy on the eyes too.  But all jokes aside that was the best DC movie yet.
I agree, I loved the World War One theme.
Chris Pine was really good too.  I wish they didn't kill his character off.
It was also interesting that Bruce Wayne sent her the photo before the movie started.
Yes, foreshadowing for Justice league no doubt.
I know I can't wait.  So what did you think of Ares?
I thought they did a great job.  I like the idea of having really good acting in super hero movies.
Yeah, he was good.  The fight scene at the end was epic.
I know, but the best part was when she went through no man's land.
It was, that was one of the most exciting scenes I've ever seen.
It showed the destructiveness of the first World War.
Yeah, I think World War One movies are underrated.  They should have more.
I know what you mean.  So what did you think of her armor?
I thought it was awesome.  An improvement over the stars and stripes of Linda Carter.
Yeah, these movies have made things a little more real looking lately.
I think it's better that way.  What works in a comic doesn't always work in live action.
And vice versa.
I just hope they make a sequel to Wonder Woman.
