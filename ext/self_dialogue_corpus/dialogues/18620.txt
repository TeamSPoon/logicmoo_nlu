I grew up listening to Motown music because my mom loved it.
Me too.
Lots of the supremes and four tops and stuff like that.
Yep. The Jackson Five was my favorite.
Oh yeah. Want you back is great.
I love covers of that song
Who has a good cover?
Prince actually did one
Oh I bet that was good
It was. Also Janelle Monae
What? I bet that's good.
Gloria Gaynor did a cover of never can say goodbye
She really made that her own
For sure.
I actually like Alien Ant Farm's cover of Smooth Criminal
Me too. but the original is still better
Well it's hard to top MJ
Willie Nelson covered she's out of my life
That's interesting.
I liked it. his voice carries it well.
