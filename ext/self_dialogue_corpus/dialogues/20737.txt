Did you see Moonlight yet?
I did. It was pretty decent. Don't think it deserved to win Best Picture though.
Yeah, I would have picked La La Land.
Me too.
Though I do think Moonlight deserved to be nominated.
Yeah, I can see that.
I personally don't get too hung up on who wins though.
Me neither. I just like to try and catch as many of the nominees as I can.
So do I. I find that I have caught a lot of great movies that way.
Right? I don't think I would have watched Hell Or High Water if not for it being nominated.
Same with me and Lion.
It's a great way to help some less mainstream films get attention.
I agree. Still, it's fun when the one you're rooting for wins.
I know, but that is rarely what happens.
They pick the right movie sometimes.
Such as?
The Silence of the Lambs? The Departed?
Those were pretty solid picks.
It's interesting how rarely best picture is also a hit film anymore though.
Well I think that has a lot to do with the volume of movies being produced these days.
