So I guess the next Avengers movie is actually two parts.  Is that right?
You mean Infinity War?
Yep, that's the one I'm talking about.
I think it's the last Avengers movie so they're going out big.
Well, anything would beat Age of Ultron.  Such a disappointment.
Definitely was not a good follow-up to the original.
I don't understand why it's so hard for them to put together a good plot.  They totally blew it.
I think it was rushed into production.
I'm sure they'll learn their listen on this next one.
I hope so.  The series needs to go out on a high note.
