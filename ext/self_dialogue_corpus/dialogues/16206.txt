This year has been crazy for music releases, huh?
Yeah man, lots of good stuff out there recently.
2017 has already been way better for me than 2016 in terms of solid albums.
Me too, easily. What are some of your favorites so far?
That album by Jay Som is excellent; have you heard it?
No, but I keep hearing that name pop up.
Jay Som is the name that this songwriter named Melina Duterte records and performs under; it's basically like indie rock/pop I guess.
OK. Who would you compare her to?
Uh, I'm not sure, I'm kind of bad with comparisons. She writes really solid guitar based songs that are really tuneful and melodic.
Sounds right up my alley; I'll check her out. What else?
Another indie rock album: the new one by Alex G.
Oh, you mean (SANDY) Alex G?
Ha, yeah, I heard that that's what he's going by now. Fair enough.
I've heard a couple of songs from that one. It's a little folkier, right?
Uh, kind of. Some of it is borderline country, but other songs are like Elliott Smith.
I hear the Elliott Smith comparisons a lot.
What about you man, what are you digging?
That Spoon album is good. Hot Thoughts?
Oh yeah, I like that one too. Those guys don't put out bad albums.
I know. They're got a pretty insane discography by now.
