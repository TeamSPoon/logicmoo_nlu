Can you believe the season the Pacers are having?
Oh I can believe it. They haven't been the same since Reggie left.
I agree. Did you catch the score against the Lakers?
I think it was something like 92-85. Disappointing.
They have only won one game this season. Super disappointing.
I just don't think their offense is what it used to be.
Or defense, for that matter!
I agree. Really miss the days of Larry Bird coaching.
Me too. When is the next game?
Next Friday against the Chicago Bulls.
Another team that once was so great and now are mediocre.
I doubt they ever come back to where they were with Jordan.
We need more basketball stars. More big names, more big talent.
Yes, other than Lebron James. Not a fan of his.
What team does he play for?
The Cavs.
Have they played the Pacers this year?
Yes, and the Pacers lost pretty badly.
Would be nice to see them in tourney again some day.
One can hope.
