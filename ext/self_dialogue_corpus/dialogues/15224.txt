Which band is better, the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?
Oh man, the age old question of Classic Rock!
Yep, this is the big one! I know what I'd say, but curious about your opinion.
I've got to go with the Beatles.
Interesting. I'd say the Stones were better.
Heres why I say Beatles - With the Beatles, you've got Lennon and McCarthy, two of the greatest songwriters of all time.
It's true that the Beatles benefited from their separate geniuses, but for me the Stones were more consistently great.
The Beatles turned out some weird stuff, but you can just ignore it if you want to. Their hits, though, can't be topped.
You want hits? The Rolling Stones have a few hits of their own.
They do, but I don't think they match the Beatles for range.
Sympathy for the Devil, Satisfaction, Brown Sugar - the list goes on.
Sure, but did they ever make a song like Eleanor Rigby?
Maybe not, but they made a lot of great songs.
So did the Beatles, and I'd argue their songs were greater.
The Beatles are a great band who is also overhyped.
I don't think it's possible to be overhyped when you're the greatest band ever!
Says you! I'm going with the Rolling Stones.
The Stones are Top 5, for sure Maybe Top 3.
Same for the Beatles. Great, but not the greatest.
We'll have to agree to disagree.
