I loved the movie Fargo. Have you seen it?
Yes! I still haven't figured out all the symbols.
Well, there was the giant lumberjack statue. Paul Bunyan in the snow.
Yeah. The good giant towering over the scene of murder and mayhem.
Then there was the stamp that the detective's husband got to design. Was it a three cent stamp?
I think so. Wow! I just thought about the 2 cent stamp in the current Fargo TV season.
There you go! There's no end to the resonance with the Coen brothers.
I loved Barton Fink for that. How the guy, the traveling salesman couldn't hear...but neither could Barton.
Right. Barton missed the whole truth about the traveling salesman, when it was right under his nose.
That last scene...the fire in the lobby of the hotel. What a scene!
John Goodman thundering down the hallway surrounded by flames shouting "I'll show you the life of the mind."
Wonder how they did that? With the flames I mean.
How come they didn't actually get burned?
That was filmed in Chateau Marmont . Have you ever been there?
No, but what a great setting for that film.
Yep, the Coen brothers are real artists. There's no doubt about it.
I also loved Raising Arizona. I can't think of a funnier scene than the one where he robs the convenience store and has a diaper on his head.
The sets were so authentic. Remember the trailer where they lived?The afghan with the orange and avacado squares.
Excellent! And there was real heartbreak in it too. The bunny in the road. The same road with the motorcycles.
In spite of it all, with them, I always feel better about life.
