I feel like you can't talk about metal without bringing up Slayer.
That's hard to dispute. They're one of the best ever.
Yup. Especially Reign in Blood.
That album was an instant classic.
With songs like Raining Blood and Angel of Death, you bet it was!
I actually have an older relative who bought the album when it came out.
Now way. That's awesome!
Not to mention that he still has the record to this day. He framed it and put it on his wall.
That's so cool. I'll have to do something like that in the future.
Enough about the past, though. What do you think of their newer albums?
They're still killing it even at their age.
I wish I could say the same.
You don't like their newer material?
Not really. To me, it just doesn't feel the same.
I loved Repentless. For them being as old as they are, I thought it sounded great.
I thought it was alright. Again, it's just not the same to me.
Is it because of Jeff's passing?
Maybe. That left a huge void in the band that I didn't see how they could possibly go on.
I understand that feeling. You should still give them a chance, though.
You're right. I just need to give it time to grow on me.
