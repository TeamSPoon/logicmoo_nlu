I did not know Robert Downey Jr. was in a few thriller movies.
There is one called Zodiac.
I seen that one today.
It is a real thriller, kept me on the edge of my seat.
He seemed so smart in the film.
Always so close to figuring the ciphers out.
I did not even know that was based on true events.
Yep, that is what made the movie so raw.
I wonder if they will ever make a sequel to that.
I do not think so, as they have never caught the bad guy.
