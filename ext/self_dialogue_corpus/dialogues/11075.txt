Did you see Game 1 of the Penguins/Senators series?
Yeah I was pleasantly surprised that Ottawa won.
Playoff hockey is the best, especially when it goes to overtime.
True, I just wish it lasted longer. It was only like 5 minutes of OT!
Fair enough. Hopefully the rest of the series will be this competitive.
I really hope so. I'm not much of a Penguins fan so I'm cautiously optimistic.
You don't like Sidney Crosby?
Nope, he's so overrated.
That's a strong take!
He's good and all that, but he's always had such a great team around him too.
Sure, but he's a big part in making those around him better.
To an extent, but he's only on the ice for like 18 minutes per game.
So who are you rooting for in the Anaheim/Nashville series?
The Predators for sure.
This is the deepest in the playoffs they've ever gone, it's pretty cool for that town.
Nashville had a lot of slightly better than average teams when Barry Trotz was coaching there, but this year they're finally a legitimate contender.
Of course they are, since they're in the conference finals. It would still be an upset to beat the Ducks.
The Ducks have more firepower on offense but I think their defense is vulnerable.
It'll be exciting to see who ends up winning the Cup.
Let's go Senators!
