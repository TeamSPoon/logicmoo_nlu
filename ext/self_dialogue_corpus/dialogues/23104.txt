Why do you think the movie Child's Play started out as serious horror and then became a horror comedy?
Probably because a killing doll can only scare you so many times before you start to see the ending before the movie starts.
How so? It worked for Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.
Oh come on, by the 3rd movie on each of those you knew they were going to be killed off somehow.
Not necessarily.
What do you mean?
Did either really die in Freddy Vs Jason?
Freddy got his head chopped off and Jason went back in the lake.
Exactly and when he came out of the lake he was holding Freddy's head and Freddy winked.  That sounds alive to me.
Okay, you got me there.
And Nightmare On Elm Street part 1 and 2, Freddy wins even when they think he's dead and the movie ends.
True.
And it was said that Jason can't die in one of the movies.
Don't you find it funny that they don't tell us that until the 9th Jason movie?  That information would have been a lot more helpful a couple decades and movies sooner.
But wait, Jason's mom was the original killer in Friday The 13th and when she died, she stayed dead.
And she was the star of one movie.  Not a series of movies.
Which brings me back to my original question. Why did they turn Child's Play into more comedy than horror and suspense?
I told you.  Probably to change it up and not be the same stuff all the time.
It worked for Jason and Freddy.
They had better agents.
