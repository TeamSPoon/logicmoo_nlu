Wanna play a game?
Sure.
Best comedy of all time... Go!
Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Best comic book movie?
Captain America 3: Civil War. Best parody film?
Civil War was good but overrated in my opinion. Ant-Man was way better overall.
Blasphemy! Civil War is only second to the upcoming Infinity War.
Civil War is second to Deadpool.
I... actually no, I'll conceed to that. Deadpool was smegging hilarious.
Space Balls by the way. Favorite 80s film?
Farris Bueller's Day Off. I would have went with Blazing Saddles.
Ah, another great Mel Brooks film. Good choice.
What'd you think of Young Frankenstine?
It was okay. The black and white killed it for me.
Same. Don't know why my friend is so obsessed with it.
I know exactly who you're talking about, and if I watched any film repeatedly as much as her and Young Frankenstein it'd have to be Robin Hood: Men In Tights.
That was my first Mel Gibson movie! Speaking Blazing Saddles though, did you hear about his newest film?
No, what is it?
Blazing Samurai... it's animated but has a great cast with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson AND Michael Cera so still totally worth it. Think it comes out sometime in August maybe?
Can't wait!
