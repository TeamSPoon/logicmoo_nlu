What albums were the most meaningful for your teen years?
I always tie my highschool years to Jewel and Britney Spears.
Both strong women but very different.
Well jewel at the time was very folky still. Britney was just emerging with her first album.
I recall the late 90s time well too.
Where you also in highschool during the britney craze?
Yes, and all the boys were obsessed. I was slightly jealous.
That is funny. I am sure some guy was jealous of Justin.
'Nsync was huge then too. Bye bye bye was at every school dance for me.
Ya, and he and britney were like a power couple.
Until she cheated on him and they broke up.
I think she had cheated with her choreographer wade robson.
Yes  it was Wade. he also had worked with nsync too.
Ya that is pretty awful.
Agreed, but we got some good revenge songs from it.
True. What was the song with britney in the shower, or the britney like girl?
Cry me a river. Oh god that was a good one.
It was great. Feel bad their pain had to be so public. But happy for that song.
I think Britney had written Everytime about him.
Not nearly as good. But they have both gone on to strong careers.
