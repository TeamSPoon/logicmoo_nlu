Were you ever into the Halloween movies?
Yes but I only like part 1. They get kind of repetitive and silly after that.
I agree with you. Jamie Lee Curtis did a fantastic job as the Scream Queen in all her horror roles?
Which one was it where she was finally killed by Michael Myers?
I believe that was in Halloween: Resurrection.
Right, the one with Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. Even though it was silly I kind of liked it.
I liked it too. I also liked Halloween:H20 when she was the dean of the school and Josh Hartnett was her son.
That was well done too. I loved the part where she sent her son and girlfriend off and battled Michael by herself.
That scene really showed that she'd had enough.
It was just a shame that she was killed off in the next one. I would have loved to see her survive the series.
