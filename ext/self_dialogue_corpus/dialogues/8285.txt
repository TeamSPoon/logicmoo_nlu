I have recently gotten into pop music.
Oh yea, like what?
I am a fan of Taylor Swift, her pop stuff.
She does really good songs. Her song Bad Blood was so good.
That is the one that got me into her. I like the beat of her songs.
She writes most her lyrics as well.
I just learned that, did you know she wrote some stuff for a few country singers?
The "Better Man Song", I knew that.
Well she did. I like her song "Style" too.
I think that was about Harry Styles, most her songs are about love.
