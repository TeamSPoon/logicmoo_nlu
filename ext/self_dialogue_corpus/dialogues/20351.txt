Do you like Marvel movies?
Yeah of course I do!
They are my favorite type of movies.
Me too!  I can't believe how well Marvel has taken the comic book ideas to the big screen.
Which is your favorite movie?
I really like Iron Man, the first one.
That one is good, do you like Robert Downey Jr.?
Yes!  I though Iron Man was a great turn around for his career.
I didn't think that Iron Man 2 or Iron Man 3 were as good, though.
I agree, but I did like the Iron Man character in the Avengers.
Indeed!  The Avengers movies are some of the best movies ever filmed.
I don't know about ever filmed, but they are pretty good.
Would you agree that they are some of the best super hero movies?
Yes, some of the best, but maybe not the best.
What super hero movies are better?
I think the best super hero movies are The Dark Knight trilogy, directed by Christopher Nolan.
Yes, those were very good, but I didn't particularly care for Christian Bale.
Really? I thought that he was a great Bat Man.
He was very good, but Michael Keaton was the best.
I disagree, but they were both good.
