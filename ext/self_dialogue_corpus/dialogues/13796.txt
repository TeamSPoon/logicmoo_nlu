Have you been listening to any Lady Gaga recently?
Yeah I like her Fame Monster album.
What songs do you like from that?
I like the song Speechless.
That is a very underrated song.
I totally agree. She is fantastic on that.
I like the song Teeth.
That is kind of a weird song though.
Perhaps, but not for me.
Maybe I will give it another shot then.
