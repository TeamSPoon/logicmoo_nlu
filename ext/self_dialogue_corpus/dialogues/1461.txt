Hey when does the NFL pre-season start this year?
The first week of August.
Ok, That is good to know.
Who are you rooting for this year?
The same team I root for every year, the Chicago Bears.
Ha Ha. You do that. I don't see them doing anything this year.
Really, every team has a chance to go to the superbowl.
Yeah, but last year Chicago team only 3 times.
I know, you don't have to remind me.  I'm just one of those loyal fans
There's nothing wrong with that.
What team are you interested in this year?
I like the New Orleans Saints.
They didn't do too bad last year.  I think they finished the season 7-9.
That's right, they finished the last three seasons 7-9.
That's crazy, isn't it?
Yeah. I hear 2017 can be good for them, they have some pretty good draft picks.
Oh yeah, like who?
Can't recall the names, but I know the positions involved cornerback, safety, linebacker and a running back.
Well hopefully they are an asset to the team.
Yes. It would be nice to see the get to the Superbowl this year.
