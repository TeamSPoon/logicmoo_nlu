I am ready to watch me some NFL football!
Me too. I love watching my favorite teams.
They had a rule change.
Really what was it.
When they celebrate from scoring they have to be easy on the flags.
Good I am glad that rule changed.
I am too. I would be excited to score a point.
I think everyone would.
Agreed. Roger Goodell announced it would be less harsh.
That is good.
I hope a few other rules change too.
I do too.
So many rules change every year.
It is hard to keep up sometimes.
Yeah I would be watching and think something is wrong but it wasn't because of a rule.
I agree. Sometimes it gets so confusing.
They need to be firm in all teams though.
I agree. Refs should not take sides.
Sometimes you can tell who the refs are for.
I agree. I hate when they are one sided.
