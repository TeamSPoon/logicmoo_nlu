Hey, what are you up to?
Hey, I almost didn't hear you.  I was listening to music.
It's no problem at all.  What are you listening to?
I'm listening to Rihanna's greatest hits.
I had no idea you were such a fan.
She's one of my favorites.
I remember when her album, 'Good Girl Gone Bad' first came out.
You know that was exactly a decade ago?
Wow, time really flies.
She's done so much since then.
Her sound has evolved so much.
Even the difference between 'Good Girl Gone Bad' and 'Loud' was so significant, but only a few years apart.
Even track by track, she can go from delicate to intense.  Her 'Anti' album has some great examples of this.
What's your favorite track from 'Anti?'
'Desperado' is the coolest track on the album.
I can listen to that song all day.
I really love the Western style of it.
I want to see her in concert.
We'll have to get tickets for her next tour, because I'd go to that too.
It's settled.  Next album Rihanna releases, we'll be there.
