Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
I think the question is how many times I have seen each Star Wars movie.
OK then, I guess you are a fan. I gather you loved them all.
I have enjoyed them all and sincerely loved some. The Force Awakens was amazing.
I agree. It was my favorite, hands down.
I was sorry to see Han Solo killed off, and by his son no less.
I know, that was brutal. I was not expecting that at all.
I was in shock. I avoid spoilers and gossip so I had no idea.
I think avoiding spoilers makes those moments all the more powerful.
I agree. That moment was a heartbreaker for sure.
