What's your favorite Harry Potter film?
I really enjoy the Sorcerer's Stone
Really? Why's that?
Because! Its the first in the series and it begins it all.
Very true, if it wasn't for that first movie, we wouldn't have been able to see any of the rest.
Sure but at least there was still the books.
Yea, but I personally prefer movies.
Why? So many people like the books more.
Because through the movies you can see all the magic and action. It's amazing.
Well sure, the books you kinda have to use your imagination.
