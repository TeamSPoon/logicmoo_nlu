Do you collect football memoribilia?
Yes, how about you?
Sure, it's fun.
What is your favorite memoribilia?
I'd have to say my signed Franco Harris football.
That's incredible!
I was so lucky to get that piece.
You bet.
My other favorite piece is the signed Joe Namath jersey.
Wow, you're kidding me?
It was very expensive, but I got it.
My favorite memoribilia is my signed Ron Jaworski jersey.
Wow, how did you get that?
I got that at a sporting event years ago.
You must be lucky.
Yeah, I won that one.
I like auctions because you can get a lot of stuff there.
Those are exciting.
I love bidding!
Me too!
