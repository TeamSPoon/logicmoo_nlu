Are you getting excited for the NFL Preseason?
I'll probably watch some, but I look forward to the real games.
Do you think anybody can stop the Patriots?
I keep expecting Tom Brady to show signs of his age, but it hasn't happened yet.
What's your favorite team?
The Chicago Bears.
How do you think they'll do this year?
They're still in rebuilding mode and I don't see them doing much this year.
What did you think of the Mitch Trubisky trade?
I absolutely hated it.
Why did you hate it?
I think they paid too much to get him and I think he'll be a bust.
Do you think they should start him right away or let him sit and learn?
I think they should let him sit and learn for part of the season, but he should eventually start.
Do you think that will be their strategy this season?
I think the Bears will try to avoid playing him, but I'm not sure they'll be able to avoid it.
Excluding the Patriots, who do you think could win the Super Bowl next year?
I know they collapsed against the Patriots, but I could see the Falcons winning it.
What makes you say that?
The collapse makes people forget how close they were to winning the Super Bowl. They're a good team.
