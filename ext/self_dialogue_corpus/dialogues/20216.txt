Hey! What is your favorite movie?
Hmm. That is a tough one. I really like the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
I have never heard of that. What is it about?
It is so good! It is about a man who decides he wants to have a procedure done to erase his memory.
Why does he want to erase his memory?
Because he had a bad breakup and he is trying to move on with his life and forget it.
Wow, that is intense.
Yeah. But then in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind. Since he is asleep, he cannot tell them to stop the procedure so he tries to hide his memories in other memories.
That is a very cool concept for a movie.
Yeah, it is very interesting. The movie really makes you think.
Sounds like it! Who stars in the movie?
The main characters are Jim Carey and Kate Winslet.
Oh I love Kate Winslet!
Same, she is a very talented actress.
She was Rose in the Titanic right?
Yes! She was so good in that movie.
Is she good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind too?
She is amazing. Her character is very quirky and unique.
Nice. That movie sounds very good.
You should definitely watch it.
