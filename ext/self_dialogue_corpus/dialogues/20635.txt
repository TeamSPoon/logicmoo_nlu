What is your favorite movie of all time?
I would have to say Beauty and the Beast, the original Disney movie.
Did you see the newly released one with Emma Watson?
Yes I watched last week, it was really good.
What did you think of Emma Watson as Belle?
I thought she was pretty good, she does have quite a resemblance if you look at her and the animated Belle side by side.
I would have to say my favorite movie is The Chronicles of Narnia.
Yes that was a good one too.
I didn't like the sequel as much though.
I know, i tried to sit through it one time and got bored and couldn't eve finish it.
I feel like movies aren't as good as they used to be in the last couple of years.
You're right, it seems like everything has been done, now it is just remakes.
There are a lot less romantic comedies now for sure.
Definitely. It seems like it is a lot of animated and special effects kinds of movies.
I can't remember the last time I saw a really good movies within the last 10 years.
I think shows and series have taken over.
Also, movie theater tickets are so expensive now. You can only see a few a month.
I feel the same way. I would actually rather stay home and stream a movie anyway.
I like to watch 90's movies on netflix.
Me too, the 90's was a good decade for movies.
