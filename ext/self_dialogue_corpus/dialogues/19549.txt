So, what are some other "feel good" music titles you like?
Well, one I really enjoy is "Reach Out" by Cheap Trick
Dunno if I've heard that one.
Well, I'm only aware of it because it was on the movie Heavy Metal.
Wasn't that the weird animated movie from the early 80s?
Exactly.  It's really nice and upbeat and got the whole "you can take on the world" type beat to it.
That's neat.
Sadly, most like that just doesn't seem as popular today as it was.  I suppose there's just too much cynicism going on in today's world.
Well, I don't know, we got Katie Perry's, "Firework" .
Oh, yeah, that's another song you could add to the list. Oh, and "The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World
Ahhh. yeah, that was big when I graduated high school.  "It's just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride..."
Hehe... "Everything, everything, will be just fine..."
That reminds me, did they ever had a hit besides that song?
Uh... probably, but I really couldn't tell you what it is.  That can be a problem when you have a REAL popular song you're known for.
Yeah, cause everyone keeps comparing all your next songs to that one.
Yep. and you can get stuck in this rote of not being able to "break out" of that one hit.
I've heard there's some artists that got so sick of their hit songs that they actually REFUSE to play them anymore in concert.
Yeah, I've heard that story as well.
For instance, I'm told the Beastie Boy REALLY hate their song “(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)”
Wow, didn't know that.
