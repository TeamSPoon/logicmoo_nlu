If you could be any Disney character which character would you be?
I'd pick the princess from Frozen. The one with the ice powers.
That's a good choice. You get to be queen and you get cool powers. Who would you pick?
I would pick the Genie from Aladdin.
I'd forgotten about him. He's really powerful and he's really funny.
You could do almost anything you want if you were Genie.
Is there another character that you would like to be?
Hercules. I'd like to be a hero.
A lot of bad things happened to him in the myths. He's much happier in the movies.
Exactly. You get his powers but not the sad parts.
