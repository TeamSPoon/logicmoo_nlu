So I heard a rumor the other day that I don't think is true.
Okay.  What's the rumor?
Apparently, Yoda was going to be played by a monkey originally.
A monkey?  That can't be real.
No, it's completely true.  A monkey was going to be Yoda.
Well, what made them change their mind?
I guess they thought the monkey might not pay attention on site.
Well, he is a monkey so I could see that happen.
That would have been crazy to see a monkey playing Yoda.  Just can't picture it.
Neither can I.  Glad they made the right choice.
