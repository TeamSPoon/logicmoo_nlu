TIm!  Are you coming over to watch the game tonight?
I can't, I'm sorry Bob.  I've got the kids unexpectedly.  Homework and such.
Lets do it at your place then!
I could probably do that, they both love the Raiders too.
Ew more Raiders fans.
Broncos fans are any better?
We are!  Gonna take that division title tonight and kick the raiders to the curb.
We still have a chance at the wild card!
So you admit Broncos are superior?
Laughs.  No!
But you just admitted they were gonna lose.
We're down most our front line because of injury.  Yes I think the broncos will take this one.
They are on quite the winning streak.
Yup, reminds me of Elways days behind the reigns.
He was king.
that i'll agree with.
He just had this presence about him.
Yup, He knew he was the man.
So what time you want me there with wings?
WINGS?  About 6.
