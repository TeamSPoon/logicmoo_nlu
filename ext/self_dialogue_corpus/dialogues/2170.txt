have you seen the packers' schedule for this season?
not yet. why, what's up?
they have a tough schedule this season.
why you say that?
they play seattle, the falcons, bengals, and dallas all within the first five weeks of the season.
didn't all four of those teams make the playoffs last season?
i think so. i'm not sure about the bengals.
well it looks like the packers might have their hands full this year.
i know. i just love aaron rogers though. he's a beast.
i know right. i just can't wait for the season to start.
well the pack play the eagles in preseason on august tenth.
that's right around the corner.
i think that the uh training camps start in two weeks.
yeah they do.
i might try to get tickets this season for when the packers play the saints.
when is that?
they play on a sunday night on october twenty-second.
if you get tickets i want to go too.
yeah, late october, it shouldn't be that cold.
yeah right.
