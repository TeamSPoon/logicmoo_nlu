Are you ready for some football!?
Not at all with the way my Jets are poised.
What do you think they are going to do? I can't see them winning more than 3-4 games.
I know and that doesn't put us in the best place for next years draft.
You guys desperately need a quarter back.
You think? Hackenberg is a bum.
Yeah but you don't have any other options. It would be best if they just lost every game this year to get a good pick.
There are some great quarterbacks poised to come out of the draft next year.
Sam Darnold may be NFL ready and if you guys land him you might be poised for a winning season.
Your right! Same thing with Rosen. He might be NFL ready also.
There's no guarantee though. How do you ask professional athletes to purposely tank a season?
You can't it's not going to happen. They're going to try to win as they should, but it's not going to put us in a good position.
At least they're not Cleaveland.
They might as well be the Browns, I wouldn't be surprised if we lost to them this year.
Well anything can happen. Maybe Hackenberg can turn things around.
I don't know. We got rid of almost every player that helped us get close to the post season in 2015.
Hope Hackenberg has a better year, and that talented defensive back field is conditioned.
Yeah I have a feeling they are going to spend a lot of time on the field.
They better start running sprints now or you guys are going to get scored on in the second half all year long.
Tell me about it.
