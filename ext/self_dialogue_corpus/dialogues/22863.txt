Have you seen John Wick 2
No not yet.
Yes   My family and i loved it so did some of my friends
Im not a big Keanu Reeves fan
He does an excellant job in both John Wick movies.
Really whats it about?
Actually John Wick is a top assasin that gives up that life for the love of his life.
See i dont like sappy movies
Its not she dies and he is forced to return to his old ways.
So who directs it
Chad Stahelski is the director for John Wick 2
Has he done any other movies
He did direct both John Wick movies and he did V for Vendetta but he was also a stunt man
I have not seen any of his movies then.
Still the Physical training and firearm training Keanu Reeves had to do paid off the move is flawless
Really you military friends couldnt pick out any mistakes?
Not many It is really good The actors all do awsome jobs
I may need to check it out then i do love a good action movie
It also has a great continueing story line You should come see it at the bargin theater with us tomorrow
Maybe i will let me check to see if i have any other plans.
