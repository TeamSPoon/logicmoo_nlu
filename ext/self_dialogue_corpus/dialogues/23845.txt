Hey, did you ever see the movie Hustle and Flow?
With Terrence Howard and Taryn Manning?
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, that was a great movie!  I saw it in the theatre.
It came out when, back in 2005?
Yes I remember because I was pregnant with my daughter when I saw it.  The soundtrack was great.
Yeah it had some great songs in it.  Plus it was a good movie overall.
I enjoyed the plot.  Did you know Ludacris was in it too?
Oh, the rapper?
Yes!  He had a role in the movie.
No, I didn't even recognize him.  Huh, that's interesting.
Yeah.  I thought it was a pretty realistic movie as far as the hip hop culture.
It seemed that way to me, although I wouldn't really know.
Yeah, parts of it were sad but it also had some upbeat parts too.
Yeah, it definitely made me feel sad at parts.  I felt bad for the women in the movie.
They were definitely degraded a lot.  That part was discouraging.
But overall it was a great movie and I think it realistically portrayed the rap and hiphop culture.
I guess it did.  So it had some social value as well.
Yes, I would say it had a message.
It's not as well known as I would think it would be.
