So James Bond movies, which ones are best?
I loved the older ones.
Like true Ian Fleming ones?
Yes, set closer to the time he was actually like a secret agent.
I love the action in them. So much all the time.
Did you like the newer one, the Casino Royal?
No, I do not like Daniel Craig as bond.
I think he was a bit too scruffy for the role.
Exactly, Sean Connery was the real bond for me.
That smooth talker. I loved he and Money Penny's interactions.
