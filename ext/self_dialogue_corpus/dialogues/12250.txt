Who is the best fighter in all of the Star Wars galaxy?
Yoda of course!
Would he beat Vader in a fight?
I'd love to see that! I dont know who would win
I think yoda would win, but after a long right
Why do you say that?
Vader is stronger but Yoda is more agile
True, Vader would be better at first but then get tired
Yeah that's why Yoda can only win in a long battle
I wish I could see a fight like that!
