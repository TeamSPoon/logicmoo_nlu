Have you seen the departed?
Yep sure have. Martin Scorsese is a great director.
He certainly was great on this thriller.
He has lots of good ones. But the departed is one I will always watch if playing on TV.
It is very rewatchable,even knowing everything. Maybe that is the mark of truly good thriller.
Perhaps it fits a lot of other great thrillers. I also think strong acting is key.
true, leo and damon are wonderful in everything as well as deniro.
They had a super strong cast for the departed. Don't forget vera farminga as well.
Jack Nicholson, martin sheen, they really loaded up here with the talent.
So magic thriller formula now great director, cast and script.
