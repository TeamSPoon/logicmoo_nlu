Hey, how did you like that Carolina game last night?
Oh my! It was so intense!
I know, I can't stand Duke and it was so nice to see them lose.
Yeah it was. I could not believe Butler did that to Hansbrough
Yeah that was so cheap!
I hope he gets suspended from a few games for that one
Me too! Hansbrough is going to have to play through the whole tournament with that guard over his face now
Yeah hopefully it wont interfere with his playing ability
I doubt it will since he is so good anyway. He can still power through from inside the paint.
Yeah that's true. Do you think they're going to win the tournament?
I always have UNC down to win the NCAA!
Me too, but we will see this year. It always scares me!
Yeah but the team is so strong, no one can stop them.
That is true, Lawson is such a good point guard
Yeah he is.I will be so sad when they all go to the NBA
Me too but hopefully a few will stay around to finish up college first.
yeah that is the smart thing to do but when the money calls, you gotta take it while you can.
This is true!
Well, Fingers crossed that we win the tournament over the next few weeks!
Exactly! I have my toes crossed too.
