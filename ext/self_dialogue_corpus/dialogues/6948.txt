What did you think about the new Beauty and the Beast?
I liked it. It was neat to see an old favorite with live action.
I didn't think they changed much.
They didn't really. The songs and stuff were the same.
Belle was the inventor this time and they made a point of her being educated.
I missed the bookshop scene. The ladder that moved in the original was my favorite.
Yes, but it emphasized the difference so when she gets to the library at the castle, she is blown away.
I also really liked the Harry Potter Easter egg in the beginning
Who doesn't love a good Harry Potter reference?
I think Emma Watson did a really good job, but her role was still similar to Hermione.
