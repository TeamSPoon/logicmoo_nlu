Hey I just saw the NFL draft a few weeks ago. You ready for the season?
Yeah, I am going with my team as always - Washington!
They lost too many players like Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. They won't be able to replace them.
Maybe - but we have some good young players coming up like Josh Doctson.
True - and that Kirk Cousins is the man at QB.
Yeah he is good. Hope they can keep him under contract and get him signed long term.
that would be good for y'all.
Who you rooting for? I know you like Dallas but...
Nah I am still a Cowboys fan always. Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott are the Boys these days.
yeah the rookies turned that mess around in Dallas. I'm glad Tony Romo is gone.
I think we got an upgrade with Dak - hope he avoids the sophomore slump
Yeah thats what you have to hope - that he can produce like he did this year.
Well I hope I can get to the Dallas / Washington game this year. Tickets are going quick.
We should go - you know its going to be a battle.
Yeah it will be - I am down for going if the tickets aren't super crazy expensive.
You know they will be - but I will keep my ear to the ground and if I hear of some cheap ones I'll get them so we can go.
Bet. I would like that a lot. And I will pay you back.
I am looking forward to the games this season - there is always a new team on top. Like where did the Oakland Raiders come from last year?
I know - I hope its just my team.
Well my team is already there!
