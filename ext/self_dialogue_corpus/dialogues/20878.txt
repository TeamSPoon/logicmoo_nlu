Did you like Passengers?
It was pretty good.
How did you feel about Chris Pratt waking Jennifer Lawrence up?
You would not do that in real life, but it's was just done for the movie.
Did you think that that was something that might happen later on?
I think it's more likely to have generational ships than to have the going to sleep for years.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I liked it when he showed Jennifer Lawrence how to space walk.
Did you think he would wake her up when you first watched it through?
I thought he would, since I knew she was a main character in the movie.
Do you think she ship design was realistic?
It seems to be really spread out and like it might break apart too easy.
What should the sequel be about.
They could have them have kids later on in the voyage or their kids go on another voyage.
Do you think a planet could be colonized by a company?
I think it would be more likely to have people wanting to leave.
What part of the movie did you not like?
I did not like him flying around at the end. It looked fake.
Do you think people should watch it.
It's a good sci-fi movie, but not a good love story.
