Hi! Are you guys getting ready for your winter concert?
Yeah, the marching band has been working really hard this year.
Did you get to go anywhere interesting to play during marching band season?
I can't believe it, but we got to go to New York and march in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.
I saw you leading it off.  You earned your name "The Pride of West Virginia" because we sure were proud of you guys.
It was a long march, but we had a great time.  We played our usual standards.
My favorite that you play is "Simple Gifts"
It's kind of fun to make the circles and come in and out with that one.
How many years have they been playing that with the band?
I don't know.  I should ask one of the "old timers".
Aren't you getting to be one.
I've only been with the band for 5 years.  "Granny" has been marching for about 20.
I bet she has some good stories.
I'm sure she does.  She also knows a lot of music and stays in shape since she marches every fall.
What do you think the fans like best of the music you guys play?
They like the current, contemporary tunes.  But we don't play many of those.
I thought there was ONE particular song that really got the crowd going?
You wouldn't be talking about "Almost Heaven, West Virginia"?
Yup!  I love the way you guys make the shape of the state.
Have you been able to locate me where I told you I stand in the state outline yet?
