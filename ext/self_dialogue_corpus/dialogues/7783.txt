So which was your least favorite harry potter?
I would say the first one.  I mean it was still good, but a little childish.
Yeah I know what you mean.  I like the later ones where people start to die, and they start dealing with crushes.
I did like however how they made it to grow up with the child.  As the movies go on they deal with more adult issues.
Like jealousy between Rob and Harry over Harmine, even though her and Harry never have anything going on.
Or the death of friends, showing that not everyone gets out alive when it comes to all out wizard wars.
The best one I thought though was the Goblet of Fire.
Yes, I like when Voldemort came back.  The guy is ten kinds of creepy.
Especially with that snake of his.
I know, the snake is pretty tough in it's own right tough.
