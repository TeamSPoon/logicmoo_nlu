So, to me the greatest thriller of all time was Silence of the Lambs.
Oh, I loved that movie!  Especially Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.
He was awesome.  Crazily enough, he's so memorable even though he's only in like twenty minutes of the entire movie.
But you know what I find kind of interesting about that movie?
What's that?
It won an Academy Award for best movie of the year, but what's interesting is they labelled it as a "thriller" instead of a horror film.
So, you think it should have been labelled a horror film?
Yeah, of course.  It has a guy going around killing wearing so he can wear their skin.  Yeah, that sounds like horror movie to me.
Why do you think they called it a thriller though?
Well, cause horror movies in general aren't popular with the Hollywood Elite.  They're considered "low art" by many.
