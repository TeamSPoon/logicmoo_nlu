Who do you think was the best dressed James Bond?
Wow, that's a tough one.  However, I would go with Thunderball the midnight blue dinner jacket he wore was a very classic look.
Fine, any other favorite Bond outfits?
In Skyfall Daniel Craig wore a shawl collar jacket that while stylish worked well with the darker tones of the movie.
There have also been some pretty badly dressed characters in the movies though.
Yes indeed, at least every film set in warm weather seems to feature someone with a mismatched tropical outfit of some kind.
Bond sure has evolved his style over the years.
It's been interesting he's worn everything from ivory jackets to tweed.
I feel like a lot of men like to sometimes copy his style don't you think?
Definitely would agree with that, many of my friends have worn a peacoat or in the summer tried the shorter swim trunks popular after Casino Royale.
I must say some of the villains have had some interesting style choices as well.
Hugo Drax in moonraker had an intresting style with the all caramel colored jacket.
Fashion usually says a lot about the villains, I usually can tell what their motives are by their outfit.
Not necessarily true, a lot of them of been disguised in everything from spacesuits to old 1940's ear maid outfits.
What would you tell someone who wanted to copy just a single item form Bond's style?
The black tuxedo in any cut that's modern really goes a long way.
Bond also often wears a bow tie and not a tie I always wondered why not a tie?
Probably because the tie would clash with the outfit a lot and the bow tie is a subtle and unique fashion statement.
I also really like the outfits the ladies of Bond wear which one is your favorite?
The original bond girl of course! Ursula Andress, and her white bikini she looks beautiful!
