what is your most memorable song?
It is actually from u2, with or without you.
That is a great song.
Ya I feel super nostalgic whenever I hear it.
What does it remind you of? If you don't mind my asking.
No problem, it brings me back to my highschool romance.
Ah, makes sense.
It always seemed to be on the radio when we were having a fight.
wow , weird.
ya it became like our break up anthem.
So it was a very on and off romance?
ya and this song was so fitting for our relationship.
It certainly sounds like it.
It is funny how strongly memories are linked to music or certain songs.
Very true. for me this u2 song brings up friends.
That's right. It was on friends.
I can vividly see rachel looking out the window at the rain.
Yes totally. But obviously my past is my direct memory.
Of course.
I love that we both have such strong memories linked to this song.
