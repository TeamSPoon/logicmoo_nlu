what beatles song do you feel is underappreciated?
Well that is hard to say they have so many good ones I often forget some that are worthy of attention.
I find the same thing. SO many great songs it is hard to give them enough attention or play time.
I would say one that I overlook then appreciate when I hear it is Beautiful Boy.
I forgot all about that song. which beatle wrote that one?
It was john lennon , he wrote it for his son I think.
That makes sense. Such a good song to celebrate a son.
Yes it is so touching. I especially like the lyric; The monster's gone, He's on the run And your daddy's here, ...
Aww that is really sweet. i did not realize how adorable the lyrics were.
They really are, what a nice show of affection to have if you are his son, or any son really.
