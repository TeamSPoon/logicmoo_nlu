Who is your favorite actor in star wars?
I really like Harrison Ford.
Oh me too.
I was very happy Han Solo returned in the Force Awakens.
He did such a great job with Han Solo.
I agree.
What  other actors do you like?
I like James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader.
He made Vader so creepy.
He definitely did.
