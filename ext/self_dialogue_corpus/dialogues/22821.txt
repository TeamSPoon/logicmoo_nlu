Did you see The Boss Baby?
Yeah.
Did you take your kids to see it?
Nope.
Me neither.
That thing was funny.
I liked it too.
Do you watch a lot of animated movies?
It all depends.
I won't watch like Cars # but I know what you mean.
Yeah. Now something like those Lego Movies...
Yeah. That Lego Batman is a character.
What was the name of that flick with the dogs, Max and Kevin Hart did a voice?
You talking about A Pet's Life.
Yeah. That one was good, did you see it?
Yep.
Did you take your kids?
Nope.
You are rotten.
Naw. I don't have a problem going to the movies by myself.
