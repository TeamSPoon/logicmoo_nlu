Do you think they'll do a live action of The Little Mermaid now that they've done one for Beauty and the Beast?
Under water?
It wouldn't be the first underwater movie to exist.
Good point. I don't know! I would definitely see it.
Did you see the Broadway musical?
I didn't! Did you?
Yeah! It was so good and so creative. Makes me want to see a live action movie!
Oh, I would definitely see it if it existed. I've just never thought about it.
I hope they would keep some of the songs from the musical.
As long as Part of Your World is in it, I'd see it.
