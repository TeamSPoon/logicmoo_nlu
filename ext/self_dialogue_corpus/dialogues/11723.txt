One of my favorite musicals of all time was, West Side Story.
What was that about?
You never saw it?
No.
It was about this white guy, who fell in love with a Puerto Rican chic.
Doesn't sound like much of a musical.
It was set during the fifties, and the guy was a gang member in an all-white gang. The girl was sister of a rival gang leader.
Sounds like the typical Romeo and Juliet story.
Yeah, except with singing and dancing.
Nice.
