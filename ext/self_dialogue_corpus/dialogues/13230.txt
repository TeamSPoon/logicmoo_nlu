Remember when Luke trained with Yoda?
Yeah, that was a weird planet
Dagoba system. Very remote location.
Yes, and full of all kinds of weird creatures.
And then there was that one scene where Luke encounters Darth Vader
Oh yeah and he chops off his head.
Right, and then it shows his face as Darth Vader
I never understood that scene.
Maybe it was a foreshadowing of things to come?
Perhaps, I guess Yoda was just screwing with him.
