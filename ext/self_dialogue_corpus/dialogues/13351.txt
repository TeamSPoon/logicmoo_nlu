Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Yes I've seen them all.  Who do you think Rey's father is?
I'm not sure? Maybe she is Kylo Ren's twin?
Wouldn't that be a great twist!
Yes, but I also saw an interview where they had her name listed as Rey Kenobi.
Well, that could have been someone's wishful thinking.
True.  We will know more when the next movie comes out.
It's fun to speculate though.
Yes, it is.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter?
Possibly, that would be too obvious though.
