Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I'll have to think about that one for a minute. Who's yours?
It's easy to say Luke Skywalker, since he's clearly the hero. But my favorite character is Yoda.
Oh, he's so cute! I kind of have a hard time taking him seriously.
Are you kidding? He's a Jedi master!
I know, but he's so small and green.
He can levitate things. He teaches Luke so much!
Ok, I guess I see your point.
Did you decide who your favorite character is?
You're going to laugh. I really like Jobba the Hutt.
