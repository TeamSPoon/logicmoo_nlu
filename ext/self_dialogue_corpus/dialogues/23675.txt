Of course, I just wish they'd play in local theaters.
Got any off the top of your head you can recommend?
Wait, you want just independent movies?
Yeah, I don't want to give big studios any more money.
Let me guess, you like current music printed on vinyl?
How'd you know?
Just a guess. Anyway, try out Safety Not Guaranteed.
Who's in it?
It starts Aubrey Plaza, my future wife, Mark Duplass, and Jake Johnson.
Those are all big names. You sure it's independent?
Yeah, it actually won awards from the Independent Spirit Awards.
What's it about?
Two reporters find and interview a guy who is looking for a partner to travel back in time with, claiming it's only worked once before.
That sounds interesting.
It's got a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Every independent movie has a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Did you just criticize Independent movies?
No, just saying they're all amazing.
You hipsters are insanely irritating. Just go watch it.
