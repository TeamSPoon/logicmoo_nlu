whats your favorite movie genre?
I would have a hard time choosing between thriller and horror
I love the old thrillers, now everything is mostly gore and blood with no story
Oh I agree, whats your favorite?
I would have to go to an old favorite, I love "Psycho"
you cant go wrong with that one, everyone feels something with that one
Bateman is so freaky in that, keeping his mother all those years
And that shower scene, I still hate taking a shower with a curtain
Thats funny, but I can see why
Lets go watch it
