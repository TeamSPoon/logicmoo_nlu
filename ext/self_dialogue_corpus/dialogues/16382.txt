Did you see Straight Out of Compton?
Yeah, that was a pretty good flick.
Did you know that was Ice Cube's son playing him?
I didn't! Thats why he looked the part.
Yeah, pretty interesting, but I've gotta beleive there was some bias in there.
How do you mean?
Well, Cube (I believe) wrote and produced it.
Yeah, there might have be a little bias in there!
Would have been better if they had more outside influence.
I agree, but it was still good.
I didn't say it wasn't, but the historical facts might need investigated.
I love the part we Cube says "Bye, Felicia".
I know! I about lost it.
Well appart from historal accuracy, It was wildly entertaining.
Yeah, gave me a bit of perspective on the whole NWA controversey.
Yeah, I remeber hearing about it all when I was a kid.
Don't date yourself there Gramps!
Shut up! Were the same age.
I know. Just like to get your goat.
Totally Gangsta!
