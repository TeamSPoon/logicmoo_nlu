Hey, have you been to the movies lately?
No, I haven't, why?
I wanted to go to the theater and just find something to watch.
Hah, you could do that on television for free!
You know what I mean; is there anything good out?
I think A Cure for Wellness might be out but I'm not sure.
What's that about?
It's like this horror or something like that.
Horror?
Yeah, it hosts a rehabilitation center where everything is just kinda weird.
Do you have the trailer on your phone?
Yeah, let me bring it up for you.
That was a little weird.
Yeah, it is weird.
I don't think I'd like that movie.
I want to see it just to answer questions, you know?
Yeah I get what you mean.
Maybe that Wonder Woman movie?
When is it out?
June 2!
