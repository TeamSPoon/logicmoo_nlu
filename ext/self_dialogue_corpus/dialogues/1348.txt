Have you heard of Henry Pines?
Of course!
He plays for the Indians now.
He does?
Yes, he was switched last month.
That may be a good match.
I think it will.
How's it going so far?
He's doing well.
Is he adjusted?
I think so.
It hasn't been long.
Right.  I'll give him 6 months and check back.
That team has had changes lately.
Yes, 3 new players.
That's a big change.
I hope they come out strong!
The new players seem to fit well.
Good.
Yes, they lucked out!
