Hey dude, how are you?
I am great!
I just saw the best movie in the theaters the other night.
Oh yea, what was it?
It was Baywatch.
Oh yeah?  I heard about that.  Who stars in it?
Dwayne Johnson is the main character and Zach Efron is in it as well.
OMG I love Dwayne Johnson.
I do too, he was hysterical in it.
I will have to go see it sometime then.
I recommend that you do, it was a comical movie and was worth the money.
How long was the running time?
It was around 100 minutes long.
That's not bad.  I hate movies that drag on and wastes my time.
Well this movie certainly doesn't do any of that!
Oh yea?
Yea, it is full of laughs and action as well.
Does Zach Efron have a major role in it?
He is one of the main characters as well, so if you like him you will be pleased.
Awesome, thanks for the info!
