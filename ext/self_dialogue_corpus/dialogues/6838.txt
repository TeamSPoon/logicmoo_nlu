Did you ever watch Tangled?
Is Tangled the one with Elsa and Anna?
No - Tangled has Rapunzel and Mother Gothel.
I never saw it. Was it good?
We loved it. The music was fun and story was fast-paced.
Who voiced the characters?
I know Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel.
I haven't seen a movie with Mandy Moore in it for ages.
I know, right? Anyway, you should check it out.
I will see if it's on Netflix.
