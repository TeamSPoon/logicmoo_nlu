Are you planning to go see the Tupac movie All Eyez on Me?
Yes I heard it's really good. The guy playing 2Pac really looks like him.
Looks like him, sounds like him, everything. I heard they really nailed it with him.
That's good. You know fans would be disappointed if he didn't embody 2Pac as much as possible.
That's right. Did you see Straight Outta Compton?
You know what, I started watching it but only made it halfway through.
Now that's a movie where the actor embodied the character fully.
Right because Ice Cube's son O'shea Jackson played him right?
Yes! He looks more like Ice Cube than Ice Cube does.
I heard that. It's a movie that surprised a lot of people by how well done it was.
Yes we don't have a lot of good urban movies these days.
Boyz in the Hood will always be an urban classic. It still holds up to this day.
That scene where Ricky was shot and killed. That still affects me to this day.
Yes the scene with his mom and girlfriend after that is really hard to watch.
Cuba Gooding Jr. really made a name for himself after that.
He did. I think he did Jerry Maguire, Radio, and a few other notable movies.
Right but he's sort of disappeared out of the limelight. He's been gone for a minute.
I just barely saw him in As Good as it Gets. I'd never seen it before.
Oh that's a great movie, it's hilarious. Jack Nicholson played that part so well.
Oh he definitely has a great flair for the dramatic. Just look at him in The Shining.
