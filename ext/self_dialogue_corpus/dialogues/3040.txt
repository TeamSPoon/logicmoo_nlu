Will the league go to 18 games?
Not any time soon
Why do you think that?
I think the NFL Players association does not want it
But they would make more money
Right but they would be playing alot longer too
That would cut down on careers too
I think it would invalidate alot of records as well
Used to be 14 games and they upped it
And so the records are incomplete before then
We didnt live in an era of Social media either so it wasnt relevant
Brady would def break Mannings record if they did that
I dont know if anyone knows thats for sure
Yeah but hes already close then gets 2 more games? Take it to the bank.
So every record would get broken?
Probably a new role call would be made.
I love records to get broken so I am all about this
What about if it was your record about to be boken
Yeah I would be upset, the NFL and its PA always get their way though
Yeah they are a strong union
