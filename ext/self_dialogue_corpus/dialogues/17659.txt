What was the last thing you listened to?
I had a Fleetwood Mac playlist going all the way to work today.
Good one. Stevie Nicks is timeless.
I agree. With all of the new pop music these days, I still go back to the older music all of the time.
I know at least 2 people with daughters named Rhiannon, that really says something about the music.
I know someone who named her daughter Rhiannon too.  It is a really beautiful song.
Their music has been covered by countless bands too.
You are right. I remember The Smashing Pumpkins covering Landslide.
I think The Dixie Chicks covered the same song.
They did. What is your favorite Fleetwood Mac song?
There are so many to pick from, I guess I would say The Chain.
Did you know The Chain is the only song credited to all five band members?
No, I had no idea.
The song was written in bits and pieces. It actually almost got scrapped.
That is really interesting. I know a lot of the Fleetwood Mac music has a story behind it.
Yes, it does.  The Chain is actually referred to as a frankensteins monster by Stevie Nicks
How funny.
I think it really says something about her ability as an artist to be able to piece a song together the way she did.
You're right. She is one of my favorite singers ever.
She is up there on my list too.  I think I am going to listen to some more.
