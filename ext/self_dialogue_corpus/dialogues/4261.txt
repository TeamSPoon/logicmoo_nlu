I watched the best thriller the other day it was called The Mummy.
Oh, is that the one with Tom Cruise?
Yes, and it is my new all time favorite thriller movie!
Who plays the princess in this one?
Sofia Boutella is the perfect princess character with real depth and likeability.
Oh fun, Was it as scary as the original one?
I like thrillers so it was not too scary for me and it was far better than the original in my opinion.
I love thrillers that keep you at the edge of your seat. That's how I felt about the original.
Okay, then I know you would love the new one. Tom Cruise is such a great actor and so believable.
Im convinced it is a must see this weekend!
