Hey guess what!?
What?
NFL Training camp starts in three weeks!
I know! It feels like the season just ended!
I'm excited to see what happens with the Giants this year.
Me too. They didn't improve their offensive line in the off season though.
I'm not too worried about it. We made it to the playoffs with a terrible offensive line last season.
Your right! And Eli's legs appear to be made of stone, because he doesn't move in the pocket.
It's amazing they got as far as they did.
I think Eli's a smart quarter back and that's what carried them through the season.
Eli is a smart quarter back, but I honestly feel like he only shines in the post season.
Do you think he's saving it all for when it really counts.
No. I just think he performs better under pressure.
Yeah, he's pretty clutch.
He's also got OBJ catching his passes.
That dude is a beast! Definitely one of the best in the NFL.
Do you think he's one of the top three receivers?
Might be the best receiver in the league.
He's also got Marshall and Shepard.
Might be the best receiving core in the league!
