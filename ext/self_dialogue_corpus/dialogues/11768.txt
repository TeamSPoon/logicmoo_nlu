Who is your favorite Beatle?
I don't actually know much about them.
Well, there's John, Paul, Ringo, and George!
What did each of them do?
John and Paul wrote most of the songs.
I think I knew that. What instruments did they play?
John and George played guitar. Paul played bass, and Ringo played drums!
They must have all been very good musicians!
Actually, Paul said that Ringo wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles!
Wow, crazy that they got so popular then!
