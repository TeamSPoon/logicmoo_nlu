I feel like Return of the Jedi was the best film in the series.
I cant say that is true.
Why not?
I thought it had too haphazard of a story line.
How so?
Luke's character seemed stale.
So you think Mark Hamill underperformed?
I wouldnt say that completely.
You said it was stale
I think there could have been better writing thats all
