Hey, do you ever listen to Jazz music? I just started to and I'm amazed I like it,
Really? I'm not such a fan. It feels like old people music.
No, it's not.  There is really a lot going on in it.
Is it like what the guy in the movie La La Land was talking about when he was trying to explain jazz?
Yes! That is exactly what I'm talking about. It can be complex but also amazingly melodic.
Hmm. I haven't really thought about it like that. Maybe we could go to a Jazz concert and decide if we do like it?
Well, I'm not sure about that.  A concert could be a little long if we hate it.
You may be right. That might be a little to much for an intro education.
How about I buy a couple of CD's of jazz that are a contemporary Jazz style and one that is more a Blues style.
Ok. We can listen to them and see which style we really prefer.
I have to say I think I'm going to lean to the more Contemporary side. I heard Mindi Abair play the saxophone and I was so impressed.
Yea, I'd say the saxophone and the trombone are my favorite instruments for this type of music.
I heard on the radio this kid play the trombone and then the piano and I was blown away.
I agree I like that but when it goes back and forth sometimes and they riff off of each other it gets a little boring for me.
I know. I am not a real traditional jazz fan but maybe if we educate ourselves we can appreciate the music more.
It could be interesting.  I really however am a country western music fan so this could be difficult.
Yuk. I hate country western music. It is so hokey with ridiculous lyrics and stories.
But that is the whole point. Country music is telling a story. Sometimes, the stories are sad and a little ridiculous.
It sounds so twangy. I think I'll keep my music lessons to the jazz right now.  Since, I'm a rock fan I think I can only take it one step at a time.
Okay. I'm with you. We will just start with the jazz. Maybe, we could go to a jazz club and see what we think.
