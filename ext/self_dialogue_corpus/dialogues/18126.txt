Do you like Billy Joel?
I love Billy.  He has a lot of great songs.
Yeah, people forget about him but not all that long ago he was the man.
Yeah, kind of the grandfather of alternative today.
At least the coffee house variety.
So what do you like from him?
Well the obvious is Piano Man.
Yeah of course.  That was his most famous.
It was super relaxing too.
What about My Life?
Very good song.  Don't forget Uptown Girl.
Oh man, I haven't heard that in forever but it's a good one.
New York State of Mine.
Isn't that like the official song of New York?
Something like that.  That's pretty cool.
Man why do poeple forget about him?  So many good hits.
Like The Entertainer.
The Longest Time.
He's a good performer too.
Yeah I heard that.  Especially when he went out with Elton John.
