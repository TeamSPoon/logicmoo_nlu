Have you seen Central Intelligence with The Rock?
I think so. That one also has Kevin Hart in it, right?
Yeah they're both in it.
I just saw it last week!
Did you like it?
I did! It was so funny.
I know. The Rock and Kevin are both hilarious.
I love the part when Bob slaps Jet during the therapy session.
That scene was great. There were so many good ones.
Right? Just the two of them standing side by side was cracking me up with their size difference.
