In the disney movie Cinderlla, do you know the names of her two step sisters?
I believe their names are Drucilla and Anastasia.
That's correct.  Do you know the names of the two main mice that helped Cinderella?
Jaq and Gus Gus.
Do you like the part when the fairy god mother came down and sang her song?
It was bibbity boppity boo, and the glass slippers are amazing.
The scene where she is racing away in her carriage against time and everything is turning back was exciting.  What about you?
I think the part when the duke is trying on the slipper to the sisters and Cinderella locked in her was terrifying.
What is your favorite part in the disney movie Lion King?
I liked the singing.  When simba and nala were singing just can't wait to be king
