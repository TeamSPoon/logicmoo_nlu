Have you ever seen Gone with the Wind?
Yes, I love that movie.
It is one of my favorites.  I recently saw it at the theater.
At the theater?  How was that possible?
They had a 75th anniversary re-showing.
That is so cool.  What was it like?
It was amazing.  It was so much better than seeing it on tv.
I bet.  What did you like best?
There were so many great scenes.  The one with all of the confederate soldiers lying on the ground was really impactful.
That is one of the most famous scenes in movie history.  The fact that they were able to acheive it in 1938 was impressive.
Yes, it really was.  But the scene with Scarlett and Rhett trying to escape during the burning of Atlanta, was amazing.
If I remember correctly, they set a soundstage on fire to create that scene.
Yes, there weren't computers around to generate things like that, so they actually had to create a huge fire.  I think they had one chance to get the scene right.
I bet that was really cool on the big screen.  I really like the scene with Scarlett, Melanie, India, and Mrs. Meade waiting for the men to get back from the camp raid.
I love that scene.  The tension is palpable, and Olivia de Havilland was brilliant as Melanie, reading David Copperfield to the ladies at the table.
I think the casting was spot on for most of the characters.
Yes, Vivien Leigh was Scarlett.  No one else could have played her as well, in my opinon.
Yes, and Clark Gable was the perfect Rhett Butler.
I read that the two of them didn't necessarily get along very well in real life.
Well, if that is true, it created the perfect chemistry between the two.
