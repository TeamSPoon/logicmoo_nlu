Which Rocky movie is the best, in your opinion?
Rocky V, hands down.
Very funny, try again.
Haha, sorry about that. I'd have to say either Rocky II, Rocky IV, or Creed.
Saying IV surprises me, as all it does is bank off of the US-Russian conflicts in the late 80's.
Okay, professor. I like it because it has the most action by far and the biggest villain to bring down, and he does suffer the consequences in the future.
Yeah, but Paulie and his robot.
Let's not talk about that. They're awful.
Yeah, it's pretty bad. Why don't you include the original Rocky?
Well, that's not a boxing movie. It's a movie about a guy wearing sweatpants that contains occasional boxing. Even when there IS boxing, it's not very much.
True, but the drama is top-notch.
I really liked Creed because while Michael Jordan did a great job, Rocky as a mentor was awesome.
Yeah, he really came through.
So what's your favorite?
Rocky III.
That's such a bad choice. Why?
I mark out for Hulk Hogan any day, and Mr. T absolutely destroys Rocky.
Hulk's movies were awful.
Maybe so, but it had the fastest-paced action of all the movies.
At least we agree that V should be removed from the Universe.
