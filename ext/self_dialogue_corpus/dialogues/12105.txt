What was the last Star Wars movie to come out?
Rouge One (A new hope)
Yeah.  I liked that one.  Did you?
Yes, but it was really sad.
Ha!  Yes, you can't get attached to any of the characters.  I do mean, you can't get attached to any of the characters!
Yeah.  That was rough.  How many movies have you seen when pretty much all of the characters die?
Not many.  I have to say, that was very unique for a Star Wars movie.  It's one of the few that I actually did like.
Wait, what?  You didn't like the other Star Wars movies?
No.  I think they are just overblown.  Lucas stole most of that from Joseph Campbell.  It's just "Hero with 1000 Faces" all over again.
well, I guess it has mainstreamed.  EVERYONE likes it now, and Disney is a freakin' evil marketing machine.
