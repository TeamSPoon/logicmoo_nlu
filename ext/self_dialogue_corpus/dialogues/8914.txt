One of my favorite singers of rock and roll is Elvis Presley.
Oh, I absolutely loved Elvis!  Heartbreak Hotel was one of my favorites.
He had such a beautiful voice and so good looking!  Yes, Heartbreak Hotel was a great song.
I use to have most of his records.
I had a lot of his records and played them all the time.  Rock n Roll is the best music ever.
It sure is - the music that we could hear the words and the words made sense, so unlike what the kids play now.  Elvis had so many beautiful songs that it is hard to pick my favorite.
I have quite a few favorites - Hey Jude is one of them.
Oh, yes, Hey Jude was a good one - I didn't know he recorded that song until years after his death.
That was one of the saddest days of my life.  I remember what I was doing when I heard he died.
A lot of people remember that day with so much sadness.  That reminds me of another good song - "The Day The Music Died"..
