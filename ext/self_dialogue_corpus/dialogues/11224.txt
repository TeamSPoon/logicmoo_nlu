Have you seen t 2017 New Womens Fashion Shoes Black Sexy high heel sandals? It's in black.
The heel that looks like it has your foot making the letter L?
Not exactly.
Yes, exactly. I saw that shoe and it made my foot hurt just by looking at it.
Those heels will go good with my red dress I just bought.
You may as well buy you some pain killers then.
Come on. You were heels.
I know but I don't wear heels over 3 inches and I definitely don't wear high heels that look they are going to cause problems for my feet down the line.
Well, I guess you're right now that I think about it.
I know I am right. I mean if it wasn't for the slight curve in them, they would form a straight L on your foot.
Yeah but they do look good on me.
I can't tell you what to do with your money. Buy them if you want them.
I just bought that High Low Formal Dress with those sandals heels in mind.
The dress with the flirty high low hem? That dress is so pretty.
I know. I saw an ad for it online and I had to order it.
I just saw an ad for it this morning and I was like I have to have it. Have you tried it on?
Yes!  It is so perfect. It hits me in all of the right spots.
With the way the hem goes from high to low, I bet that would be a great salsa dress.
Exactly. It would be perfect for a lot of twirling.
I need that dress in my life.
