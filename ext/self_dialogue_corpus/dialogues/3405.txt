Have you ever seen Nosferatu?
What in the world is that?
It's a vampire movie.
Did it just come out?
Oh, no.  It's actually a silent film.
How did you come across that?
I don't remember, but it was pretty creepy.
How could something that old be creepy?
I don't know.  I think it's because of what I read about the actor before.
Wow.  It's starting to sound interesting.
