Do you know what my favorite Disney animated film is?
No. But I know it has to be a kids film because you always take your grandkids.
You are right!  It was Rapunzel.
That is a go.od one. I love how Rapunzel falls in love with Flynn
Me too! The mother was so mean.
Well,she turned out not to be her mother afterall.
That is true. Rapunzel was really the daughter of a king and queen.
Yes she was. She sure had some adventures though trying to see the lanterns.
She did, and she finally did get to see them.
Yes, it was on her birthday.
