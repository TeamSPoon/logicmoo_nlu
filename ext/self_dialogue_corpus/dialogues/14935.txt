How did you like Ghostbusters?
I used to like it growing up.
How did you like the remake?
I actually didn't see it.
Oh, did you plan on seeing it?
Well, I don't really like a lot of the remakes of classics.
I know what you mean.
I wish they had just done a sequel with the actors now.
Well, the guy that played Egon had died.
They could have worked on it earlier though.  He had died right around the time it was released.
