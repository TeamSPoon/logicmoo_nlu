What's your favorite Beatles song?
I really liked Let it Be.
Oh man that song was and still is great.
It just has a relaxed tone to it.  Something that touches your soul.
That and Hey Jude.
Yes for sure.  Did you see Paul McCartney sing that at the Olympics?
Yes!  That was an awesome opening ceremony.
He still looks good for his age.
Yeah he does.
How about While my Guitar Gently Weeps?
Great song.  Kind of mind opening and sad.
Or in the other direction something fun like Norwegian Wood.
Yeah that was a little off but I liked it.
We actually played that in my high school marching band.
Ha!  Sounds like a good time.
It wasn't bad.  Although it took us a while to figure out what the song was about.
You know what I always thought was over rated?  I wanna hold your hand.
Yeah, I never was into that one.  And everyone seems to love it.
I think it's a bit of looking back and nostalgia.
I know.  Like today's music is bad and that one is so pure.
