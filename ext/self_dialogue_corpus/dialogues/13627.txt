Who do you think the better Vader was?  Hayden or Jones?
James Earl Jones for sure, such a better actor.
I'm not sure, Anikan in the prequels has more scree time.  Jones is just a fear factor. Not to mention voice only.
Dude you're crazy.  Hayden was a winey little punk in episode 2.  And not as good an actor.
You're right about the acting.  But his fighting was much better.
You mean the stunt double with the same hair cut?
Sorry, I just enjoyed watching Vader develop.
Yeah, that was cool.  I just wish they would have chosen a better actor.
Lets agree on this.  Jar Jar binks was the low part of the franchise.
Oh man don't get me started.
