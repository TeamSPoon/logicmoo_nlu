I love the song Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Eurythmics.
Me too. Do you like any of their other songs?
Yes. I like their song Here Comes The Rain Again.
I like that one, too.
Annie Lennox has such a unique voice.
You know who else has a unique voice?
Who?
Celine Dion.
Wow, you're right.
I think she is one of the greatest singers of all time.
Really? I think Madonna is the greatest singer of all time.
I like a few of her songs, but I don't think her voice is that great.
Are you crazy? Her voice sounds amazing, especially in her song Like A Prayer.
That song is good, but it doesn't compare to Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On.
Fair enough, but I like Madonna's edgy style.
Yes, her edginess is what made her very popular back in the day.
Do you think Lady Gaga copied Madonna's style?
Hm. I think she was influenced by her, but I wouldn't say she copied her.
Yeah, you're right. Lady Gaga's early style was much more dramatic than Madonna's ever was.
Exactly. Lady Gaga is probably the most outlandish music artist out there.
