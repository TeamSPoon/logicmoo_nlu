Hey I heard a great new band the other night.
what are they named? Where did you see them?
They are called Fuck Off and Die. I saw them at Woody's.
Interesting name. Are they punk?
Yeah they are. A little like the Sex Pistols.
Very throwback then. I could be into that.
You should come see them with me next Friday. They will be at the Pit.
Great, I'd like that. I am always looking for new bands to get into.
Well you can listen to their CD beforehand. Here's the newest one.
Cool. I'll let you know what I think. Do they have any others?
They had 2 others for sale the other night. This is the newest.
I guess they are trying to get a local following then, no?
Yeah they are local - I just happened to be at the bar the night they played.
I bet it was a great set - live music is always great no matter what.
It was - loud but fun.
I like that a lot. I am looking forward to going with you now.
It will be a great time - there is an opening act too.
nice. we will get there early and have a few before the show
For sure. I am so in and can't wait.
Me too. Thanks for telling me about this group.
