Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
That's a hard question,  but I think it is Return of the Jedi
Oh really?  Why did you like that one?
I liked how they were able to redeem Darth Vader's character.
Ha ha I thought you were going to say it was because of the Ewoks.
Well they are adorable, but seeing Vader with Obi Wan and Yoda at the end was wonderful
Yeah especially after learning the backstory in the prequels it is nice to have him back on the light side.
So do you agree that Return of the Jedi is best?
No I think that the Empire Strikes Back is really the movie where we get to know the characters including Vader and that development is what made the story matter.
At least we agree that the best movies are in the original trilogy.
