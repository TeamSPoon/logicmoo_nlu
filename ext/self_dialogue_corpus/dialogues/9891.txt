I think hip hop music are bloody awesome!
yeah, I like the way people express their ideas so ruthlessly
exactly, it's like breaking an invisible social confinement ever so elegantly
even though the song itself can be violent, right?
Yeah, but you know, they're an important part of black culture, and I appreciate that
yea, about that, I'm not trying to be racist or something, but I feel only black guys can do hip hop
Yeah, it's kinda true, punch lines just come out from their mouth smoothly, even without too much thinking
so what hip hop songs you are recently listening to?
They all sound similar to be honest, I just like the ruthless vibe
I can't agree more
