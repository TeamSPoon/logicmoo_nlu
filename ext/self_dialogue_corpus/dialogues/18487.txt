What do you think the best TV theme song is?
My favorite is the Boy Meets World intro.
That show had 3, which is the best?
The 2nd one is the most memorable.
For sure. That's the one that actually had lyrics.
Yeah, the other two were just some instrumentals.
My favorite is probably Dexter's.
I love that show and the opening.
Yeah, its been stuck in my head since I started watching.
I never really thought about how good TV intros are.
They are a huge part of what makes a good show.
TV songs in general, not just the intro are important.
Yeah, like the background music.
Exactly. I can think of a few melodies that are always played in the back of shows.
Yeah. I wonder how much pressure is on creators to focus on music.
Its not as important as the acting, but I bet its high on the list.
Sure, I can see that.
Same with video games.
Yeah, video game soundtracks are more memorable than even TV
Some of them hire actual symphonies.
