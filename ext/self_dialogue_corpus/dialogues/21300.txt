I saw a great movie yesterday!
What was it?
It was called "The Girl With All The Gifts".
What genre was it?
It's a kind of zombie movie. Actually, it's totally a zombie  movie, but much more interesting than a typical one.
How so?
Well, the characters were really well developed. And the story was really moving.
Moving as in touching? Or fast paced?
Well both, but I meant emotional. Because you get to know one of the zombies.
Is it a really gory movie?
Not that much, although there are some bloody scenes.
I have a hard time with that usually.
Yeah, me too, but when it's not too gratuitous I can live with it.
Are there any well know actors in it?
Well, the only one I knew was Glenn Close.
Was she any good?
She was fantastic. Like the part was written for her.
I kind of like her.
Yes, I think we don't see her enough these days.
True - I usually love what she does.
