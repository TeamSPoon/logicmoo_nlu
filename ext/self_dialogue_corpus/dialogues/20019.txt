Did you know that the Beach Boy's "Surfin' USA" is the same song as Chuck berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen?"
What? You're kidding.
No. There was even a lawsuit, and Chuck Berry's name was added to the credits of "Surfin USA" around 1966.
A lot of Chuck Berry's songs sound like the same song, played over and over again.
Right. Just like Bo Diddly's beat.
I think the Beach Boys actually played some of Chuck Berry's music in their early concert tours. With Glen Campbell filling in for Brian Wilson!
They did. "Surfin' USA" came out in 1963, I think, and Berry's song had been out since 1958.
I remember George Harrison getting sued for supposedly copying "He's So Fine".
I remember that too, but I never hear the similarity.
So if I play "Sweet Little Sixteen" and then play "Surfin' USA" back to back, they sound the same?
Absolutely. I heard some Canadian disk jockey mention it in the late '90s.
I think Johnny Cash was sued for infringement, and lost.
Was that for "My Name Is Sue" or "Ring of Fire"?
No. It was "Folsom Prison Blues". I can't remember the name of the other singer, though.
What was the name of the other song in the lawsuit?
I think it was "Crescent City Blues". I think they mean New Orleans, not the town in northern California.
I'll have to look that one up. I remember Johnny Cash's "Live From Folsom Prison" album.
Yeah, Johnny Cash was a jailbird off and on.
Funny I never really liked Johnny Cash's music at first, but began to like it years later.
I know what you mean.
