Did you see there is a new Pirates coming out?
Yeah, I saw the trailers. It looks OK.
OK?!
Yeah, just a little too much CGI for my taste.
Yeah, studios are getting a little heavy handed with that these days.
Some times it's a really good thing, when it enhances and isn't so front and center.
I concur.
Like the movie Troy?
Whoa, set back the time machine!
Ha! I just mean that there is hardly any there.
Was there any at all?
Yes. One scene in particular. The "thousand" ships.
What did they do.
Well, it wasn't cost effective to build all those ship, so they built some and filled in with CGI.
That makes sense.
I would even know, other that I saw a behind-the-scenes thing.
That is interesting.
Like I said, enhancement is good when you can't tell.
You're such a movie snob!
I know, right?!
