Do you remember that band Puddle of Mudd?
I think so. Name one of their songs.
One of my favorites was "She Hates Me."
I remember that one!
It was different but good.
I agree. The lyrics were pretty good.
I think I would have to say they were very good.
I must agree with you.
Did you like Creed?
Oh yes! They were popular when I was in middle school.
