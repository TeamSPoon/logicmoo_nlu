I just can't get into raw footage horror movies.
Seriously?! They're like some of my favorites.
Oh god, really? Like Blair Witch Project?
Okay well Blair Witch wasn't great, but it was a good start.
Okay, stop there.
No! You should give them a shot. Have you heard of Ti West?
Mmm... rings a bell.
He did this movie called The Sacrament. It's basically a fictionalized version of the Jonestown massacre.
Isn't there a documentary out on that?
Yeah, but trust me. This one's worth watching.
I just hate the shaky camera work.
I get that but when you watch it on a smaller screen it's fine.
If you say so...
I do. But also, my favorite raw footage movies are ones where the people filming are supposed to be a documentary crew.
Oh so it's not like phone cameras like Cloverfield?
Ugh, no. Cloverfield was nauseating.
Blair Witch was pretty similar.
Yeah but it was still better than Cloverfield. I promise you The Sacrament is better with the camera than either though.
Okay, maybe I'll give it a shot.
You should - it's great. The Last Exorcism is along the same lines, too, just FYI.
