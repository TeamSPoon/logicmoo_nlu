Do you think the Celtics have a chance tonight?
No.
I heard they might be better off without Isaiah Thomas
That's nonsense. He's their best player
So how did they finish with a better record than the Cavs?
Lebron wasn't really trying, and his season doesn't start until the Finals.
They need to do something about that. It's not fun to have everything be meaningless until the Finals.
What can they do?
At least make sure the players play every night
But how do you do that?
Fine them if they sit out games?
You can't do that unless you want to start policing injuries.
What about refunding fans who go to games where stars don't play?
No team will ever do that.
The NBA needs to figure something out. Fans will lose faith in the sport.
I don't think so. It's more popular than ever.
Not really. I think lots of people think it's gotten too boring
But there are so many great players, even outside of the Cavs and Warriors.
Who won't win championships unless they team up with Lebron or a superteam.
Still it's fun to watch these guys play
