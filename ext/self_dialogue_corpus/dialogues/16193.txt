I HEAR THEY ARE STARTING THE MUSIC IN THE PARK PROGRAMS AGAIN.
I LOVE THOSE PROGRAMS!  ARE THEY DOING GLENN MILLER?
OH I LOVE HIS MUSIC! ESPECIALLY "LITTLE BROWN JUG"
I LOVE THAT ONE TOO EXCEPT IT ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY. IT REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE " THE GLENN MILLER STORY"
GREAT MOVIE!  WHAT ELSE ARE THEY PLAYING?
NEXT WEEK THEY ARE DOING SWING MUSIC. THERE WILL BE LOTS OF PEOPLE DANCING AT THAT CONCERT!
I LOVE THE PATRIOTIC CONCERT THEY DO BEFORE THE FIREWORKS.
LAST YEAR THEY TRIED DOING MODERN SONGS TOO BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT. THEY SHOULD STICK TO STUFF THEY KNOW.
HOW ABOUT THE "1812 OVERTURE" IT ALWAYS STARTS THE FIREWORKS!
THIS YEAR THEY ARE PLAYING "THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC" TO START THE FIREWORKS.
OH NO!  THAT'S NOT HOW THEY DO IT EVERY YEAR! WON'T BE THE SAME!
THEN DON'T GO IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUSIC!
I LOVE THE MUSIC SO I AM GOING.  THE SERIES ENDS WITH JAZZ.
I BET THEY PLAY LOUIS ARMSTRONG SONGS." HELLO, DOLLY" AND "NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN ARE CLASSICS!
DON'T FORGET DUKE ELLINGTON AND COUNT BASIE.
TWO GREAT JAZZ MASTERS!
ONE WEEK IS MUSIC AROUND THE WORLD.  I LOVE HEARING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC.
I LOVE THE IRISH BALLADS! " WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING" IS MY FAVORITE.
SO YOU ARE GOING TO ALL THE CONCERTS?  EVEN THE MODERN MUSIC CONCERTS?
MAYBE, IF I CAN FIND MY EAR PLUGS! I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH I WILL ENJOY LADY GAGA PLAYED BY A BAND!
