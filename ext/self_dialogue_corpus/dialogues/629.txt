My boy Zeke is going to tear it up this year.
Who's Zeke?
Ezekiel Elliott.
Ah, that Zeke.  Yeah, hard to see him not doing good.
He was a rookie last year and led the league in rushing.
Well, he did play behind a good line.
Yeah, his line is good, but he made tons of plays after contact.
I still think on another team, he maybe breaks 1,000 yards if he's lucky.
You're just a hater.
Not hating, just stating a fact.
That's funny that you think it's a fact when it's unproven.
Just saying, probably a bit overrated.
Okay, so what RB would you take over him?
Le'Veon Bell for one.
Not saying he's not a good player, but he's no Zeke.
Yeah, for one, he's a more patient runner.
Okay, but why else?
He's also a better pass catcher.
But Zeke is younger and more durable.
All it takes is one hit and he's riding pine this year.
