Who are the best teams in the AFC going into this season?
Well, Denver has the best defense, but no franchise quarterback. So their good but not top contenders.
Who else?
Without injury the Oakland Riders would have done even better this year.
Does Oakland still have a team?
Yeah, but Las Vegas is building a tow billion dollar stadium for them to play in within the next three years.
But right now they're still in Oakland?
That's right and they have a good team.  If Carr had not gotten hurt, they might have been in the AFC championship game.
What other teams are good?
Kansas City is consistently good and Baltimore should not be counted out. But they're not the best teams.
Who are the best teams?
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots?
Why?
Both teams have franchise quarterbacks which is one of the most important factors.
I agree, you need at least a good quarterback to win in the playoffs.  What else makes them good.
Both teams are proven winners and both teams are well coached.
So who comes out on top?
Well, New England is the team to beat, but the Steelers have an even better chance than they did last year.
And don't forget about Las Vegas, I mean Oakland right?
Yeah, I would not count out the Raiders, might come down to the inevitable, whoever stays the healthiest.
