Hi.
Hello.
How's it going today?
Not bad, you?
Same.
Cool.
We're supposed to chat about music right?
Yeah that's right.
What is some stuff that you're listening to?
Now?
Yeah sure.  What are you listening to lately?
I really like Childish Gambino lately.
Oh Donald Glover right?  That guy can do it all.
Yeah I loved him in Community, but he is also a talented musician.
I love that one track that is getting a lot of play on the radio now.
Redbone.
Yeah that's it.  Man that is a great track.
It's so good.
Yeah like old school funk and smooth r and b.
Kind of reminds me of Prince as well.
