What do you think of Nick Jonas?
The guy from the Jonas Brothers band?
Yes! But he has a solo career now.
Does he really? Is his solo music any good?
I actually think it is much better than the Jonas Brothers.
What style is it?
It is definitely pop, but it has some r&b influence for sure.
Do you have any favorite songs?
Yes, I would say my two favorites are Chains & Jealous.
Did those songs get a lot of radio play?
They did. One of them went to #1 on the charts.
That's amazing. I had no idea his solo career was so successful.
He has been playing huge arenas on his own too.
Really? Did he play in Los Angeles?
I believe he did. I think he played at the Staples Center.
That is enormous. Good for him!
He has definitely made a comeback and had a great run as a solo artist.
I'll have to check out some of his tracks. I haven't heard any yet.
You should also listen to "Levels." I love that song too
Thanks for the tip. Will do!
