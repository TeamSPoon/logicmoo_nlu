Did you watch the destruction of the Celtics the other night?
Unfortunately, I did. They need a whole new team to thwart LeBron!
Yes, and it isn't just Lebron, either. Kevin Love and Kyrie are both top 15 players!
Irving may even be top five himself.He is amazing.
Well, James went 7 for 7 in the 1st quarter in Game 1. He looked like a man against boys!
Yes, the Celtics are certainly overmatched.There is really nothing they can do!
They finally got lucky with the ping-pong balls in the draft.
It is a relief! Who are they going to take? Lorenzo Ball?
He is awesome, but I think they are leaning towards the kid from Washington.
Felt. He is a 6' 4" guard. How can he help?
His arms are really long.Although a streaky shooter, he can ball!
Okay, will that put them in the conversation?
Against Cleveland?, ..no way! But he is a good piece. Crowder should be traded.I see his limitations.
They ALL have limits. They are an excellent team already.It is just that James may be the Greatest of all Time. What can you do?
I guess we can reminisce. Larry Bird, DJ< McHale and Parish! Now, that was a team.
They might not be able to beat this Cleveland team!
Sorry, I have to disagree. The Celtics were 10 deep! This Cleveland team is not like that!
Maybe you are right! It is an answer we will never have.
Just enjoy the Celts for what they are. A team that can improve, too!
Gordon Hayward....would you come and play for the Celtics?
