What's your favorite Adam Sandler movie?
This might sound weird, but Punch Drunk Love is my favorite of his.
I haven't seen that film in years but you're right, it was really good.
Yeah, it's a drama with some subtle, dysfunctional comedy.
Philip Seymour Hoffman has played a lot of weird roles but his mattress man role was even weird for him.
Yeah, you really start to feel sorry for Sandler's character because almost everyone around him treats him like garbage, especially the mattress man.
Yeah, or just flat out tries to take advantage of him.
Who played the British girl? His love interest, I forget her name.
Emily Watson.
That's right, she's been in a bunch of good films.
What up with the pudding obsession anyway?
Frequent flyer miles dude, he was the first extreme couponer.
Personally Billy Madison is my favorite.
Yeah, that was a funny movie. Norm MacDonald and then Steve Buscemi comes out of nowhere to save the day.
Wasn't the pretty teacher married to Pete Sampras in real life?
They are still married. Have been for a long time now.
You know Happy Gilmore kind of disappointed me. I've never been a big fan.
What about the fight with Bob Barker?
That's definitely the best part of the entire movie.
Bob ends up kicking Happy's butt pretty good doesn't he?
