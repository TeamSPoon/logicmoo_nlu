I loved Happy Gilmore
I loved every part of the writing
Christopher McDonald was a perfect villain
Yeah the cadence he used with his lines.
And Chubs Peterson also was a great role.
Sandler paid attention to details with this one
I think it stands passed the Spade/Farley films to be honest
It definitely does
And I still hear people quoting some of the script
Oh how can you not
This was Sandler's finest work
The Wedding Singer was not bad either
No it wasnt but some of the people who see that film dont get the 80s references.
I understand that.
Billy Madison also was a close first as far as his best
I even liked Big Daddy.
He often used the same actors in his films
Yeah he was cool with alot of the SNL cast as well.
Im glad he didnt sing in any of them.
He always was singing in the Wedding Singer
