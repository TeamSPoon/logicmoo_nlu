Do you like Radiohead?
Yeah they're great, did you see their Glastonbury performance the other day?
I saw a bit of it but I haven't had time to watch all of it yet.
I see, you should watch it, they really are incredible live, they performed the song No Surprises.
Oh, I love that song, so sombre and simple but just perfect.
Yeah, the whole crowd was singing along to it, looked really special!
I'd love to see them perform live but I've never had the chance, have you?
Yeah I did, I saw them at Leeds festival a few years back.
Oh, I saw that on the television, it looked really lively!
It was yeah, people were going crazy, they always put on a good light show!
Did you like their latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool?
Yeah, I haven't fully taken it in yet though, I like the Burn The Witch song, have you heard it?
That's one of the best, I like how they keep transforming their music.
Yeah, they don't just produce the same old rubbish like other bands.
Right, it seems like they are always thinking of new ideas and transforming together as a band.
I hope they keep making great records, they're getting older now!
Yeah, Thom Yorke is starting to look like an old man!
I thought that, in the video where it's just him dancing, he looks so old.
That is so funny, really love Radiohead though!
They are possibly the best band on earth.
