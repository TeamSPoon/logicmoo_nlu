Hey, you planning to go to any concerts this summer?
No, but Roger Waters is touring, I would love to see him. Tickets are really expensive though.
Oh man, that would be a sweet show. Is he doing more Pink Floyd or his own work?
I would think more Pink Floyd because that's what the fans want. I think his previous tour was The Wall, but this one is broader.
Yeah, that would be awesome to see in person. I've probably listened to Dark Side of the Moon like 1000 times.
Me too. It's crazy to think that it's been around for 40 years but still never gets old.
For sure, some of those classic rock albums hold up amazingly well. Just great music.
The Rolling Stones are still touring, I think. They're well into their 70s and still rock.
Haha, those tickets are even more expensive.
If you can afford it, I doubt you would regret paying for the tickets. It must be an unforgettable concert.
Yeah, I'll probably try to go to a few festivals.
Those are fun, depending on what bands are playing.
But the cool thing is there's usually something for everyone. You can go with a big group and split off to see different groups if people have different tastes.
Absolutely, the variety is what makes those so much fun.
The crowds can be a bit overwhelming though. I think I prefer assigned seats.
Yeah, you might end up with the girl on her boyfriend's shoulders right in front of you.
That would be super annoying. At least you could still hear the tunes.
True, and that's the most important part.
The music and the atmosphere. There's something about the live shows that makes it sound so much better.
I'm 100% with you on that one. The energy of the band and crowd are better than any home stereo ever could be.
