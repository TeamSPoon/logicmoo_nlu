I think Seattle is going to win the NFC this year.
Probably as much of a chance as anybody I reckon.
With Wilson at QB, you can never count them out.
They had a pretty good RB with him in Rawls too.
Yeah, he was a pleasant surprise last year for them.
They have one major sticking point though.
What's that?
Their offensive line.  It might be the worst in the league.
Yeah, the thing about Pete Carroll is they're all in on the defense at the expense of their line.
It really hurts them though.
You can't rely on Wilson to have to scramble all the time.
He's great on the run though.
Sure, but you'd rather him not risk injury running for his life.
How do you think their defense will be?
They get Earl Thomas back which is a huge plus.
Do you think Sherman will be as good?
He will have a chip on his shoulder with all the trade speculation.
I wonder if that will hurt their vaunted team chemistry.
Won't help it.  They should have kept their mouth shut.
Will be interesting to see how they progress this year.
