Did you see the new live-action Beauty and the Beast?
Yeah, I did see it, but I wasn't the biggest fan.
Why didn't you like it?
It didn't seem to have the same magic as the animated version.
I thought it did. Why did you think that?
The songs just weren't the same and I think Emma Watson's acting was a bit flat.
I loved Emma Watson in it!
She just didn't capture Belle from the animated version very well.
I still think she did a decent job. Oh well, I guess you'll always have the original then.
Yeah, I won't be adding the new one to my collection anytime soon.
