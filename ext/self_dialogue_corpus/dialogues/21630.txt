Do you want to go to the movies with me on Friday night?
Eh I don't know what are you planning to see?
Wonder Woman of course!
Oh I forgot that was coming out this month.
Yeah it came out June 2nd.
Wow I can't believe you waited this long to see it, I thought you would be there on the day it was released
I know right!
Well at least you will see it before it leaves the theatres.
Oh I'm going, I have to see it.
So who is playing Wonder Woman?
Gal Gadot, I've never heard of her.
Me either, but if she is playing Wonder Woman she has got to be pretty and tough.
Oh you know it, I want to see Chris Pine.
Oh he's in it too, he's so hot.
Yeah he plays Steve Trevor an American pilot.
Oh he fits that role well.
Yeah., he meets her on a island paradise
I wish I could meet him on one too!
He is the one who convinces her to leave her home and come fight in the "war to end all wars".
Well you have sole me, I'm in!
