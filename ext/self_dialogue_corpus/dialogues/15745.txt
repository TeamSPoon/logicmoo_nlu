Do you remember the early 2000s rock scene?
What do you mean exactly? Nu metal?
Nah, I'm talking about the rock revival stuff.
Oh, so like The Strokes, The White Stripes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Franz Ferdinand, Jet, et cetera.?
Yes, exactly what I'm talking about. How do you look back on that time period.
It's strange. It's strange that these bands all got huge kind of out of nowhere.
Agreed. For sure some of them had the aesthetic, I'm thinking The Strokes and The Killers, but there wasn't any clear precedent to them in mainstream pop.
I wish the rock scene had stayed strong. It definitely gave a boost to indie rock, but the popularity of bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes waned.
For sure. It is interesting to note, however, that Jack White has had many bands and remains a household name.
Yeah, he had Death Weather and the Racontuers right?
Yeah, and super recently he co-wrote and co-performed a song on Beyonce's most recent album.
Wow, didn't realize that! What song?
It's called Don't Hurt Yourself. He even sings on it!
Wow! That has to be some of the highest profile stuff anyone from that rock revival is doing now.
Yeah, I think the average pop music consumer knows about the Yeah Yeah Yeah's because of Rock Band.
Yeah, "Maps" is on that.
It must have been tough for all those bands, to be young and rise in fame so quickly.
And then to have it all go away so fast!
It's a shame. I think there is nothing wrong with good bands making money.
Agreed, those who claim that bands sell out by putting their song on commercials are ridiculous. Bands gotta pay the bills.
