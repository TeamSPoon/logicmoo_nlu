What was your favorite part about The Revenge Of The Sith?
Well I really liked the Wookie Battle on Kashyyyk. I just thought it was way too short.
You know one of the best parts about the original trilogy was that the fights lasted a good long time.
They just used up all their screen time on an Anakin Padme romance.
I really feel like that was a bit of a mistake.
Yeah, kind of made the movies less awesome. But the Anakin versus Obi Wan battle was very cool.
It's true. They seemed very evenly matched, but I feel like Anakin had a bit of an edge.
But Obi Wan seems to have the best luck in the galaxy! He always escapes sticky situations.
I hope that in upcoming movies if they have a battle, it's longer than 30 seconds. They definitely did really well with that in Rogue One.
Oh, Rogue One was freaking amazing! Disney hasn't let me down yet with any of their productions.
