Hey, what's up?
Not much, how are you?
Pretty good. Have any plans for this coming weekend?
Not yet, why?
Wanna get together and watch a movie or two?
Yeah, sounds fun!
What kind of movies do you like?
Pretty much anything, except Westerns!
Oh don't worry, that wasn't even an option to start with!
Were you thinking of going to see a movie in a theater?
Maybe, but I also have an extensive Netflix queue.
Any good dramas?
Yeah, of course! How about you joing me and you can pick the movie from my queue!?
Sounds good. I'll bring the popcorn.
It's a date then!
Sounds good. Anything else I should bring?
Nah, popcorn's perfect.
Great, looking forward to it! I'll browse Netflix when I get home to see if anyhting sticke out for me in the meantime.
Great, see you this weekend!
See ya!
