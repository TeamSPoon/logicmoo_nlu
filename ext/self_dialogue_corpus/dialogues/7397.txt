Did you watch The Lion King?
Yes, I remember Rafiki
He was some kind of medicine man
He was brutally honest with Simba
He put pressure on Simba that Nala may not have been able to do
I would have liked to see Simba stay in the jungle. At the point he returns, he was not aware of what was going on
There seemed to be a lack of male lions in that area
I think Rafiki gets credit for reconnecting Simba with his father
Simba's father was a positional leader to some extent
Yeah, he did not have a backup plan in place
