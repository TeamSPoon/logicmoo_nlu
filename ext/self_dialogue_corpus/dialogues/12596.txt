So what color lightsaber is the best?
I would have to go with green
Why do you say that?
Because it was the new one unveiled by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi
Okay, but didn't they have green ones in the prequels
Yes, but that was after Return of the Jedi
I thought they were supposed to take place before
Well, they came out after the original three
But they were prequels
I don't think they should be part of the storyline they were so bad.
