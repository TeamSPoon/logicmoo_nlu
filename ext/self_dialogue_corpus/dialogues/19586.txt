Alright, let's switch gears and talk about covers you HATE.
oh, boy this will be fun!  So many, don't know where to start...
Just take your time, they'll come to you.
Okay, well, one of the WORSE has got to be MCR's "Under Pressure"
MCR?
My Chemical Romance
Oh, god, they did a cover of that?  NO ONE should do that song but Queen and Bowie
I know, and the sucky part is, it's not too bad for the first thirty seconds or so, but it just get progressively worse as they go along.
My brain hurts just thinking about it.
Again, I'm biased, I've never really liked any of MCR's stuff, but.. you know.
Okay, what's another one?
Alright, get ready for this... "You Shook Me All Night Long" by... Celine Dion.
Oh, dear God, no!!
Yes!  one of the most rocking, hardcore songs sung by someone who LEAST personifies rock and hardcore.
Oh, good, I'm nauseous just thinking about it.
Yeah, I've heard they use that song to torture prisoners at Gitmo...
HAHAHAH! That's horrible!
I know, but hey, I wouldn't doubt it.  I read somewhere they use Red Hot Chilli Peppers?
What they make them eat them?
No, I mean, the band.  The literally play RHCP songs over and over to drink them nuts.
