What do you think of when you think of Rock music?
Drums, bass, really loud music, screaming, and the like.
That's so general -- rock music can refer to all kinds of things.
Oh really? Like what?
Indie rock, alternative rock, acoustic rock, christian rock -- there are so many options!
Maybe I'm thinking something more like metal.
Maybe. Do you enjoy the rock music you have listened to?
Some. It's not my favorite.
That's unfortunate. Rock music is so good!
I'll take your word for it.
