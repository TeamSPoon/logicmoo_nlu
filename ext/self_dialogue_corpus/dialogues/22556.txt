My favorite movie of all time is "Blazing Saddles".
Oh my gosh that movie is hilarious, I can't even decide which part is my favorite.
There's so many good quotable parts in there, it's non stop funny.
Remember when Mongo punched that horse?
Yeah, or Howard Johnson and his 1 flavor ice cream parlor.
Or that lady in church who starts her speech off quietly...
Yeah, and someone complains that they can't hear her so she gets loud and scares the entire congregation.
Ha yes, but really, if you had to pick, what would be your favorite scene?
The one scene that makes me laugh like an idiot for several minutes, no matter how many times I see it, is the campfire scene.
Oh with the beans?
Yes, it cracks me up every time.
Because they're all passing gas?
I don't know why that's funny, it just is.
Are you 5?
When it comes to that scene, yes, I'm 5, because it's hilarious.
And then when Taggert comes out of the tent and says he thinks they've had enough.
"What in the wide, wide, world of sports is going on around here?"
"Howard Johnson is right!"
That movie is a classic.
They don't make them that good anymore.
