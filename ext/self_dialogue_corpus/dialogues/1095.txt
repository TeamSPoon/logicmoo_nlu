When do you think Tom Brady will retire?
I mean at this point, probably 50.
You think he can hold up that long?
No not at all.
So why would he do that?
He could probably back up for the last part of his career.
So we still have about 10 more years of Brady?
I wouldnt be shocked if we did.
He has still been competitive.
But how many Super Bowls can you win?
For him he might want to have the most ever
Doesnt he already?
I think there have been a couple of players that have won 6 or 7
But no quarterback
No these were players who were role players on their team
But he already has his legacy cemented
He wants to make sure he cant ever have his records broken
Do you think he wants to overtake Peyton's records?
Yeah that plays a role too
So his drive is really to leave no doubt he was the best ever.
