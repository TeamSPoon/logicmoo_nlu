Are you going to watch the Spurs game on Monday?
Yes I am, I want to see if GS will rest some players.
Do you think the Spurs are looking at the long term picture rather than the now?
Yeah, if not they would be playing Leonard now.
If you had to pick one to start a team around, right now....Lebron or Curry.
This is a hard one but Lebron, he is still the best and most dominate.
Do you ever think the draft is rigged?
All the time how else do you explain how some teams end up with the top 3 pick when it just seems to "fit".
I understand it but I can't believe they took  Kanters passport away and detained him.
Crazy right, I don't think a terrorist would be 7 feet tall.
Did Lebron get snubbed?
Yeah, but I think he's at the point that he cares much more about the NBA Championship.
Should the 76ers trade down?
Yeah, they are rebuilding and can get a lot more with say 2-3 major picks than just 1.
Out of d James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard  who do you think will win?
Russell - its a numbers game and they seem to want to spread the MVP around now.
LeBron is a lot like Shaq; you can give him the award every year if you wanted to.
Yeah, but I feel like you should still give it to the most deserving even if its the same person over and over.
He's going to be a man on a mission now.
Oh yeah, Lebron is definitely going to be playing to prove something.
