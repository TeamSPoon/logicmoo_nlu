So have you seen the movie Shrek?
What? The cartoon?
Yes! That´s the one!
Of course I have, it´s very funny!, who has not seen it?
Which was you favorite scene?
When the princess was signing and the bird exploded.
Oh that sounds cruel.
It does! But in the movie looks very funny.
I never got to see the movie, so that´s why I was asking. I am not sure if I want to see it now.
No, no, no, you have to see it, believe me, you will like it.
What else is in the movie?
Well I think they were making fun of fantasy characters and it´s a fantasy world and the ugly troll falls in love with the princess.
Um, that sounds interesting. I read that there was more than 1 movie.
Yes, there is a second one, a third one and I think they made some tv specials. Also one of the characters made it´s own movie.
Wow I did not know they were so popular. Do you know some of the actors that portray the voices.
Oh yes, you have Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Cody Cameron, Chris Miller, etc.
Oh wow! what a cast. I love Eddie Murphy. Who is he in the movie?
Oh he portrays one of the most populars characters, he is the talking donkey.
Oh wow! I heard it all, now I have to see it. Does the movie have any good songs?
Yes it has one that I like very much that is called Accidentally in Love from the sending movie. The first one has a lot of songs too.
