Have you seen the new beauty and beast movie?
No not yet. Is it like the original?
In some ways. The original is better in my opinion.
I figured it would not be as good as the first, sequels never are as good as originals.
The story line is close to the same though.
That's good. I will have to just watch it and compare.
It was worth the watch.
Cool.  Are all the characters the same?
Yes. There's bell, the beast, gustan, the candle stick, and the others.
Good. I don't like when characters are changed.  Thanks
