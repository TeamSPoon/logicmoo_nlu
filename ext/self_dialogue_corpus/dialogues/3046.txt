Thursday Night Football. Necessary?
Absolutely not.
Why do you think that?
Well, before "Monday Night Football" and Saturday night sometimes there were more games on sunday.
Yeah, but it was harder to watch all the games on sunday.
Yes, but now with DVR's and NFL Red Zone, you can wach most of the games.
Can't you do the same with the games on different nights?
Yes, but those games cut into other programming i may be recording on those nights.
Hm, interesting point.
If the NFL wants to do different days, push more Pro games on Saturday. College sucks anyway.
College is an industry, i doube they are gonna give up that real estate.
NFL is a bigger industry tho.
True but that's why they divided the weekend up so they can rake in the bucks for the weekend.
Yeah, doesn't mean i have to like it.
So you don't watch any college football?
Nope, doesn't excite me one bit.
That's too bad, there are some good college games out there.
Sorry, the scores and the plays are unrealistic.
You think?
I really do.
