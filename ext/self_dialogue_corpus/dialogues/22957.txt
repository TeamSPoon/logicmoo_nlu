I like FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF the best.
Ferris borrowed that car.
That was a cool car.
They drive around a lot.
All through Chicago.
They pick Sloane up from school.
They go many placed in the movie.
They go to the Sears Tower.
They also go to Wrigley Field.
They get on a parade float.
And Ferris sings.
He sings DANKE SCHOEN.
He also sings TWIST AND SHOUT.
The principle goes to Ferris' home.
He wants to prove Ferris is not sick.
But Ferris sister goes home.
She hears someone trying to break in.
She gets arrested for false reporting.
At the police station she meets a boy.
They kiss.
