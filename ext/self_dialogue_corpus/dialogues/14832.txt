Did you like the Hangover movies?
I only saw the first one.
Why didn't you see them all?
I actually didn't like it.
I thought everyone like the Hangover!
Everyone else in the room was killing themself laughing.  I just didn't thing the movie was funny.
Did you like anything about the movie?
I thought the guy with the beard was funny?
That Zach guy?
Yeah, Zach Galifianakis.  The movie overall sucked though.
