Did you ever see the re-releases of the Star Wars movies?
You mean the ones they put out in the theatres?
Yeah.
I saw the first one, but it didn't really seem worth my time.
I was kind of strange.
The stuff they added was just weird.
I agree. Guess they were just trying to make an extra buck.
Leave it to the studios to make something worse.
How about George Lucas?
True. Probably as much his fault.
