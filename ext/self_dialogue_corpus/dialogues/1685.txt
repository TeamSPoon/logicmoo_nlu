Think Adrian Peterson is going to be good on the Saints?
He had most of last season off he should be ok if he's healthy.
Having him should help Bres a lot too.
I don't know if they even need him to be the main part of the offense they have Ingram too.
Yeah he can get a little less carries but be healthy for the whole season.
They got him for a decent price too.
It seemed nobody wanted to take a chance on him.
The Vikings wanted to move on and I don't blame them.
They got a few good players now. They picked up a free agent too didn't they?
Yeah they got Murray from the Raiders.
He should give them a boost for sure.
With Lynch coming back the raiders didn't need him anymore.
Peterson should be fine though I think he works hard enough.
Eventually he's going to wear down though he's past 30 already.
Look at frank Gore though, he's over 30 and still going.
He's not what he once was though.
The colts are saying he's going to be the starter still though.
They need to look for a younger RB.
They will find one soon they need to help out Luck.
If they had a good running game they would be a really good team.
