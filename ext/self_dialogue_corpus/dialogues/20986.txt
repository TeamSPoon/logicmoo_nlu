Have you seen the latest Disney movie?
Beauty and the Beast? I watched that last night!
I thought it was okay, what did you think of it?
I enjoyed the animations and thought Emma Watson was great.
I think for me, I had a more enjoyable experience with Cinderella, but that's not to say Beauty and the Beast was bad in any way.
I enjoyed Beauty and the Beast more, it was fun, light, it had great musical pieces too.
Oh, I agree the musical pieces were well executed but I'm not really a big musical type of person, but I did enjoy the movie.
Which scene did you think was the best in the movie?
I think the best scene in the movie for me was the action sequence in the final act, which scene was your favorite?
I loved the ballroom scene as well as the set up before with all the castle decor pieces helping them set up along with the musical piece.
I do have to admit the animation was top notch, seeing all those things turn into real life action, compared to the previous animated version.
I thought they did an exceptional job with it, especially with the candle and clocks movements, and their actions, I loved it.
Did you think Emma did a good job in her role as Belle?
I found her charming, she was cute, and a very believable Belle.
She definitely nailed the role, but I found her excuses on skipping past movies presented to her and accepting Beauty and the Beast, a bit off putting.
Which other movies did she turn down to take this movie?
Well, she turned down Cinderella, stating she couldn't relate to the main character, also turned down La La Land.
Wow, I didn't know she did that. I guess she really wanted the part that she felt fit her best.
Yeah, she probably did, and it seem to be a great decision as Beauty and the Beast definitely was a winner for audiences.
No doubt! I'll probably watch it again sometime soon, one of the best Disney movies, they've really been putting out great movies of late.
