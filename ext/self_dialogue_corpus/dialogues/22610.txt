Do you like Baby Boy?
The song by Beyonce?
No, the movie with Tyrese.
Man that's my flick.
It's on BET right now.
Hold on, imma put it on.
Look at Tyrese and his fine self.
Naw girl, Ving Rhames.
Yes girl, when he was cooking breakfast naked in the kitchen.
That backside was looking good.
Man Taraji was a young buck back then.
She down aged a bit from then until Empire.
Yeah, I don't watch Empire.
How about that flick with her and Idris Elba?
You talking about No Good Deed.
I saw that. Actually, I think that was a remake.
I don't know if it was a remake but it had the same name as another movie made earlier.
I think I might watch that next.
Well if you do let me know and I'll be on my way.
I know all about it girl, you love you some Idris.
