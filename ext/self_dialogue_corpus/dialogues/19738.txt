just saw a video interview of adraina comparing herself and her music with the late whitney houston
whitney what?
hahaha oh yes
adraina should take a chill pill please
so i thought,all her song put together can be compared to one of whitney's greatest hits.
it's just not comparable and to think she actually say that.
of course she did...let me send you  the youtube link.
please do
here you go yajsshddhdn
wow,seen it,adraina's confused, she sound nothing like whitney
like nothing at all
can you imagine,she's even saying she is a pop artist, was whitney a pop artist.
no way she didn't say that
oh i thought you seen the full video before sending me the link
no i haven't, was so stunned by her first comment i had to purse and text you what she said hahaha
hahaha oh i see
so she claims to model whitney yet she never knew whitney wasn't doing pop music rather soul and rnb.
i had wonder what she's on during the interview.
she does pop music that i give to her because she is good at it,but saying whitney does pop music and she sounded and sing like whitney is quite absorbed
you can say that again.
