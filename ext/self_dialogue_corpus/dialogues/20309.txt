Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just recently watched Finding Dory.
Really? That has been out for a long time.
Ya I know I just barely got around to it.
Did you like it?
Ya I liked it a lot. It was really good.
Me too. I loved all the characters.
Baby Dory was adorable and it actually got me emotional.
Me too. I thought it was a good second movie in the series.
Have you seen anything good lately?
I just seen Cars 3.
Oh my gosh. I want to see that so bad.
It was so good. I didn't have high hopes because of number two.
Ya I was worried about that.
It definitely did not disappoint though. There were so many twists and turns.
I love a movie like that.
It was really emotional too.
Did it have all of the main characters.
Ya for the most part.
I need to see it this weekend.
