Hey, what do you think of the Colts?
I don't know, are they any good?
Of course! They keep taking the division every year.
So have they won a Superbowl?
Once. We're going to get it again this year, I just know it.
Has their performance been good this season?
Yeah, they were good last season, but with the new players, they're unstoppable.
Do they have a new runningback?
Yeah, they just got a new guy from Miami that's looking really promising.
Oh, I forgot his name, but wasn't he the starring player at his college?
Yeah, and he killed the trials too.
So it looks like it's going to be a running year?
Yeah, but not just that, our quarterback can pass too.
Can he fill Peyton's shoes?
Better than that, he had no interceptions last year.
What about fumbles?
Yeah, but just the one though, against Jacksonville.
Well yeah, their tightend is really something.
Maybe, but our center is going to shut them down.
We'll see about that. Go Colts!
