Hey, have you got my Bowling for Soup CD?
Sorry, you're what?
Bowling for Soup? I had the CD right here and it's gone, did you borrow it?
Sorry, never even heard of it before.
Oh! Well, it's a rock group, kind of alternative.
Oh? What songs?
Eh... I like No Hablo Ingles or the Girl all the Bad Guys want.
Hmm... sounds familiar?
Most popular one was 1985.
Oh hey, I know that song!
Yeah, it's good stuff. Well.. I mean it's an indie feel with a mainstream budget.
Sure, sounds neat.
Yeah, they do a lot of fun songs. Definitely give them a listen.
Sure, I'll pick up your CD when I find it.
Just ah... bring it back, alright?
Of course. Any other songs I should look for?
Listen to all of their stuff, trust me. It's fun.
I can do that...
Do that, buy em on itunes and give me back my CD!
Right, of course, ah.. .going to look for it now!
