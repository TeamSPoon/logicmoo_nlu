Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I actually just watched that movie with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt.
Passengers?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
I've been wanting to see that one, he's one of my favorite actors.
Yeah, I haven't watched much with him in it, just Passengers and the first Guardians of the Galaxy.
You should really watch Parks and Recreation, it's hilarious.
I've never heard of that.
It's a comedy show with him and Amy Pohler, I like it a lot.
Cool, I'll have to check it out.
Anyways, how was passengers?
It was really good actually, I liked the whole premise behind it.
It looks good, and all the reviews for it are pretty good too.
Yeah, they weren't wrong.
I really want to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy too.
Me too, Groot makes me laugh.
Yeah, it's funny, but I'm more of a fan of the action in the movies, I never thought Chris Pratt would turn into an action star.
I guess I didn't either, but I never really saw him in his comedy roles.
You should definitely check them out.
I probably will now.
