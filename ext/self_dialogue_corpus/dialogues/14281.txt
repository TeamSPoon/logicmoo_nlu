Do you think the Spurs will win it this year?
I dont know Kawhi is on fire.
Yeah I think the Pop always knows what to do in crunch time
The loss of Parker is not a big of a deal as it was in the past
Him and Ginobli are part time at this point
Yeah its a shame but the wheel keeps on spinning for Spurs
Pop knows what hes doing
Surprised none of that went with Brett Brown to Philly
What can you say? He hasnt been given talent
True but they got a bunch of guys
Who said they would be healthy?
No one, but they more than likely cant stay hurt
Embiid hasnt played 40 games yet!
All things even out
No reason to believe he will play this year
Doesnt matter, LeBron runs the East until he retires
Or goes out west
Could end up on the Spurs if he wants to win a few as a bench player
Nah he wont even come off the bench I bet
You are right
