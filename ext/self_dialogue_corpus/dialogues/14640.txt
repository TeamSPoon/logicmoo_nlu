DID YOU WATCH THE SPURS AND WARRIORS GAME TODAY?
NO UNFORTUNATELY NOT I HAD TO WORK BUT HOW WAS IT?
IT WAS THE GREATEST COMEBACK EVER IN AN NBA GAME?
IN WHAT SENSE WAS IT THE GREATEST COMEBACK?
WELL THE WARRIORS ON THEIR HOMECOURT WERE DOWN BY AT LEAST 28 POINTS LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND STILL CAME BACK TO WIN.
WOW TOO BAD I MISSED THE GAME. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?
THE GAME TURNED AROUND IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHEN THE SPURS BEST PLAYER LEONARD TWISTED HIS ANKLE.
DID HE GET HURT BADLY?
YEP HE DID NOT PLAY THE REST OF THE GAME AND THE WARRIORS WENT ON A HOT STREAK AND SCORED 20 STRAIGHT POINTS.
WOW SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT COMEBACK FOR THE WARRIORS.
YES IT SURE WAS AND THAT CURRY DUDE KEPT DRAINING THE THREES.
YEP CURRY IS A GREAT PLAYER AND SO IS DURRANT.
IT BASICALLY CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE AND WAS SO EXCITING INDEED.
NOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SERIES MATCH UP.
YEP TWO OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE WILL NOT FAIL TO ENTERTAIN.
HAHA THAT'S FOR SURE ANY GAME WITH THE WARRIORS IS ALWAYS HIGH SPEED.
WELL NEXT TIME COME OVER TO THE HOUSE AND WATCH ON MY BIG SCREEN.
HAHA NOW THAT'S A FOR SURE HAHA
OK I WILL GET THE BEER COLD FOR THE GAME.
COOL REMEMBER I ONLY DRINK THE GOOD STUFF HAHA. OK SEE YOU FRIEND AT THE NEXT SERIES GAME.
