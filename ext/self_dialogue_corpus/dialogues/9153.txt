What band have you been listening to recently?
I've been listening to The Pixies a lot.
They're great but I've only heard their last album. What was it called?
Their last album was called Trompe le Monde. It's a great album but it's probably not their best.
Well which of their albums do you think is their best?
That's a very difficult choice because all of their albums are fantastic. If I had to choose just one, I'd go with Surfer Rosa though.
Are there any songs on that album that I would know?
The song Where Is My Mind is probably the most popular from that album, it's been in movies and TV shows. It was in the movie Fight Club so a lot of people know that song.
Don't The Pixies have a female bass player?
Yes, her name is Kim Deal and she also sing harmonies with Frank Black in many of their songs. It's part of their signature sound.
