Anna is one of my favorite songs from "Please please me."
Did you one that's it's not an original Beatles song?
Who wrote it then?
I don't recall the name of the guy who wrote it, but I do know that the Beatles didn't write it.
They used to play that song on the AM radio when I was kid.
The classic rock station that I listen to only plays songs from "Sgt. Pepper" and "Let it be", they completely ignore early Beatle songs.
I used to listen to the oldies station in Phoenix; they played songs from the early years, but they only played hits like "Help" and "Yesterday."
So you don't listen to that station anymore?
No I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.
Me too.
