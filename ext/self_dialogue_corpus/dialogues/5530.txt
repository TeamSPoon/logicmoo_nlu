have you seen the new Cars 3 movie?
I have , I hated that he crashed though.
I know. but he did get a nice new paint job in the end !
His coach really did help him though.
she did, it was due time for him to retire though I think.
Mater is my favorite character in this movie.
I know, he has bog teeth , I wonder why they made his teeth so bog
lol I know that is so funny, he is so rusty
I wish I had a friend like Mater and McQueen!
haha I wish I had a car like Mcqueen as well!
