Does your family have any traditional movies you watch around Halloween?
We don't really celebrate much, but sometimes we'll curl up with snacks and watch Halloween.
The original in the series?
Yeah. I still can't see Jamie Lee Curtis today without picturing her in that role.
Sounds like good scary times.
Yeah it's kind of a long standing tradition, too. I can remember just hearing the classic music from that or if somebody would make similar sounds and as a kid it would give me goosebumps.
Who knew that music would become so famous and such a trademark?
It's kind of like that morbid children's rhyme in the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
Don't even start with that. One time I had to turn the movie off in the middle of that song.
You gotta love the impact of those well crafted thriller movie songs.
