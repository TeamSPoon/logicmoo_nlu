I really hope The Gaslight Anthem get back together, I need to see them live again.
Oh definitely, there's something missing without that Jersey sound in the Summer months.
What have you been listening to to fill the gap?
Going back to old favorites like The Bouncing Souls mostly.
Have you ever listened to AM Taxi?
No I haven't, are they good?
They're very reminiscent of The Gaslight Anthem, gravely voice, catchy guitar hooks.
Oh wow I will have to check them out, where are they from?
They're based in Chicago.
Jersey Shore punk rock based in Chicago, I can dig it.
