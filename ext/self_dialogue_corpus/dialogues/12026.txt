Do you like Star Wars or Star Trek?
I'm definitely more of a Star Wars guy.
Really? Why do you like it so much. I love the tech, and the futuristic points in Star Trek.
They are really different shows. I like both, but the fantasy in Star Wars gets me.
Yeah I see that.
Especially since I've really grown with the characters through the Universe.
The Star Wars characters are really unique, and all have interesting, wacky storylines.
Star trek has more tragedy, more of an alien, sci-fi component to it.
But aren't all the Star Wars characters weird enough to be aliens.
Aren't we all aliens?
