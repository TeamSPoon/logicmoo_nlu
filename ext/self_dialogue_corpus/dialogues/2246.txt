Who do you think the best tight end is?
Of course, Rob Gronkowski.
Hard to argue with that one - 25 Touchdowns in the last 3 years.
Yeah, and he missed half of last season - he's awesome.
He reminds me a lot of Mark Bavaro.
The old Giants Tight End?
Yeah, Bavaro was the best tight end for a short time, but he kept getting injured.
True Gronk is a sure fire hall of famer if he can stay healty.
I like Travis Kelce, he's an up and coming young tight end.
He catches a lot of balls but doesn't seem to score as much as Gronk.
Yeah, look at who's throwing to him.
True, Gronk has Brady; Kelce has Alex Smith!
An underrated tight end is Greg Olsen.
He's had three straight 1,000 yard seasons and 16 touchdowns.
He is a consistent player.
I also like Jordan Reed for Washington.
He is way too injury prone for me.
How about Jimmy Graham?
Jimmy is a great tight end; who is finally learning the system in Seattle.
I thought he career was over when he blew out his knee.  But, he's come back to be one of the best again!
