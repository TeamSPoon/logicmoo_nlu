What team do you think has the best defense in the league?
Well for a while it was the Broncos
Yeah I'd agree but I'm not sure if they still are
I think they are top 3 without a doubt
I think that the falcons also have a really good defense
They have one of the best offenses too
Who do you think has the worst defense in the league?
Well statistically I think the Browns do
I think the Packers also have a horrible defense
Yeah I think their offense props them up a lot
I think they are working on it though
They need to get rid of their defensive coordinator
Yeah but hes been there for so long I doubt it
One can only dream!
I think the seahawks also have a pretty good defense
They have an excellent defensive line
And secondary too with Richard Sherman
They were unable to win the superbowl last year
I think that because their coaching isn't very good
Maybe they will make a change soon
