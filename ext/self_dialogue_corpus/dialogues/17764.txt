Have you ever heard of Willy Nelson before?
Of course! He is a legend in music.
My mom was playing some of his music the other day and I really liked it.
What songs were you listening to?
I am not sure. One was about Georgia I think.
Yeah, that's the song Georgia on My Mind.
Did he write that song it so beautiful?
No he did not. The song was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrel.
I have never heard of them. They write great music.
Yeah they do but Willie Nelson's cover really brought the song to life.
Yeah it was so good but I felt like I had heard it before by someone else.
You probably heard the version by Ray Charles.
That name sounds familiar. Who was he?
He was a blind musician from Florida. He had a lot of hits.
I know who you are talking about. I love his music. What other songs does he have?
Hit the Road Jack is one of his most famous songs.
I love that song. It's really catchy.
Yeah that song and What'd I Say are really great.
His music is so timeless I need to go pickup some of his albums.
For sure. There was also a great movie about him starring Jamie Foxx.
