Another one of my favorite Disney movies is Hercules.
I like that one too. It has a great story line.
Yeah. I love the story between him and Megara especially.
It is so romantic how she sacrifices herself to help him.
I also liked the character Hades. He is a funny villain.
True. James Woods does good with the dry humor for his character.
Plus the music for Hercules is really good.
I liked the song Hero to Zero.
Really? my favorite one was I won't say I am in love.
All their songs are good honestly.
