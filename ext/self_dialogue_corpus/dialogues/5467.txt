What do you think of disney's Lady and the Tramp?
I find that one somewhat boring.
Really? I always loved it.
I think the best part was the song of the two ctas.
We are siamese. I love that tune, so funny. they are such menacing evil kitties.
They really caused a lot of trouble for Lady.
I felt so badly for her. I really loved her journey.
I will say I do love the iconic italian spaghetti scene.
I feel like everybody tries to recreate that at some point.
I know I did try once,lol.
