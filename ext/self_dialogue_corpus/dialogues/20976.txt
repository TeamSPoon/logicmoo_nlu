Did you ever see Frontier Gal?
I'm not sure. What was it about?
It's a western with Yvonne DeCarlo.
Really? I absolutely love her!
This was one of her first big roles. She's really young and adorable in it!
It must be from the 30's?
I think the early 40's. She plays a fiesty saloon owner.
It sort of sounds familiar. What was it about?
Her husband comes back from jail and tries to get her back.
Did she have a kid who liked him?
Yes, their daughter. He ended up taking her away from Yvonne.
I think I might have seen it a long time ago.
She's was so cute at that age!
I liked her in Salome! She was gorgeous!
I haven't seen that. Was it good?
It was okay, but she really made the whole movie!
I loved her in Slave Girl too. Did you see that?
Yes, another great role for her!
I miss seeing her. I think I'll look for some I haven't seen yet.
Casbah was pretty good.
