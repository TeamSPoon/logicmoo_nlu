How many types of music do you listen to regularly?
Three, I guess.
What are they?
I listen to country music quite a bit. Mostly older stuff but some newer.
What else?
I listen to Jazz. Mostly what I think of as Smooth Jazz. No words, just music.
Why no words?
It's soothing but it's not distracting. It's good for when I'm reading or writing. I don't find myself singing along with the music.
I guess that makes sense. So what's the third type of music you listen to?
A lot of music from the eighties.
Why the Eighties?
That's when I got into music. I turned eleven years old in nineteen-eighty. It's when I became me.
Do you listen to anything else?
At different times, I'll listen to almost anything. Except Rap.
Not a fan of rap?
Nope. Never seen the beauty to it. Just don't like it.
So what else do you listen to?
They do music channels on cable TV. They have a Rat Pack channel.
Rat Pack?
Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jr. That bunch. I'll listen to that sometimes.
