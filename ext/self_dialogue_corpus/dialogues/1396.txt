HI! Are you ready for the NFL football season to start?
I'm ready. How about you?
I'm ready as well. Will you go to the Cardinals team practices before the season starts?
Yes. Those are open to the public, right?
Yes. I'm not sure where the open practices will be this year.
They'll be at University of Phoenix Stadium like last year.
Oh! I didn't go to them last year.
You probably thought the San Diego Chargers would stay in San Diego.
Should I go to the Chargers practices in Los Angeles?
No. I've heard the actual Chargers games will be held in a soccer stadium.
Do you plan to get season tickets for the Chargers games?
I've heard Chargers season tickets are already sold out.
Will the Chargers play the Cardinals this year?
No, I checked the schedule. The Chargers will not play the Cardinals, but the Los Angeles Rams will.
I'd hoped to see Philip Rivers and Antonio Gates.
You'll have to see them when the NFL games are broadcast.
Will you keep your Chargers jerseys?
I think I burned the number 17 jersey, which is River's, at the protest.
I may have to pick a new favorite NFL team.
I've heard the New England Patriots or Cleveland Browns are available.
