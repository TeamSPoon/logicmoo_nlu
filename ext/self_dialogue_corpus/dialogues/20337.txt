What do you think about singers that delve into acting?
To be honest, I wish they would stick with singing.
I have to agree with you.
Evem though Carrie Underwood had a very small role in Soul Surfer, she was still very bad.
I agree. She came off as too cheerful and her speech wasn't natural.
However, I do have to say that Mariah Carey was great in Precious.
She was almost unrecognizable in that role.
I was so pleasantly surprised how she held her own with Mo'Nique in the scene near the end of the movie.
Mo'Nique's performance was amazing.
She definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
I agree. I wish she would get more roles.
Me too. It's been a long time since I've seen her in anything.
I think the last big thing she starred in was Bessie.
I believe that movie won four Emmy Awards.
That's amazing for a television movie.
I know. Going back to what we were talking about earlier.. Queen Latifah was in that movie, too.
You know what?
What?
I think music artists that turn to acting aren't so bad after all.
Yeah, you're right. There are some pretty talented actors that started off as singers.
