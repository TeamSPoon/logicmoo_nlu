Did you get to see Manchester By the Sea?
I was a little hesitant due to some of the things I heard about Casey Affleck.
I read about that too. Maybe he's not the greatest guy, but he sure can act.
So, you thought highly of the movie?
Definitely! It's one of those films you could watch a hundred times and see something different every time.
What's Casey Affleck like in the movie?
He's like the guy next to you at the gas station, but someone who can actually portray that person.
So a very normal guy?
For sure. No movie magic going on here with the character's personality or his persona.
I think it must actually be harder to play a normal person than a glamorous celebrity.
I agree. That type of acting requires so much more nuance.
Michelle Williams is in Manchester By the Sea, right? I think she's such a talented actor.
And she was incredible in Manchester By the Sea.
What's her character like?
Well I wish she had more screen time. She's actually not in the film too much. She plays Affleck's character's ex-wife.
She speaks in an Boston accent doesn't she?
Yeah, she and Affleck both do. And they nail it. I think that's one of the best parts of the film.
Maybe not the prettiest accent to listen to, but necessary for the geography.
Even if Casey Affleck might be a questionable person, I'd say it's still worth watching the movie.
I got my Woody Allen goggles ready to go.
