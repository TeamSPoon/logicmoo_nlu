Do you like the Doors?
Yes!  I learned about them watching that Oliver Stone move when I was a kid!
I couldn't believe how much Kilmer sounded like Jim.  What's your favorite album?
I like L.A. Woman.
Me too.  My favorite is The Soft Parade.
I haven't listened to that one much.  I heard a lot of people don't like it.
It's definitely one that some people don't like.  Some people think it's too orchestral.
I'll have to check it out.
I also like Absolutely Live.
Isn't that the one with Celebration of the Lizard on it.
Yes.  I think that performance is classic Jim!
What do you think of American Prayer?
It's a little too much for me.  While interesting, it's more cacophony than music.
I have that albumn; but, I don't listen to it much.
The Doors were before my time; but, it isn't uncommon for a lot of my peers to like them.
Thy were way before my time too; but, I think it'll be a long time before people stop listening to them.
Jim gets most of the attention; but, I think Manzarek is appreciated a lot too.
I was surprised his passing didn't get more attention.  Everyone always comments about that tiny organ he played.
I think that organ went a long way toward defining the Doors sound.
No doubt!  Jim may have been the star; but, it took all four.
