Ok, we are going to do something different. I'm going to name quarterbacks and you give me your thoughts on them.
Ok - sounds cool!
Tom Bradt
The greatest QB of all-time, champion, sure fire Hall of Famer
Drew Brees
Accurate, tough competitor, Hall of Famer
Aaron Rodgers
Talented QB, selfish, great arm
Andrew Luck
I think Luck is talented, but injury prone.  He'll be a guy that will never reach his full potential.
Cam Newton
Very selfish player, he's a running back trying to play QB.
Matt Ryan
Solid QB, but he will never reach the Super Bowl again.
Ben Roethlisberger
Tough as nails, good passer and hard for defenders to bring down.
Philip Rivers
Underrated player, one of the best QB's in the league.
Derek Carr
Up and coming superstar. Will get to the Super Bowl and win it before he retires.  This is fun, can we do more????
