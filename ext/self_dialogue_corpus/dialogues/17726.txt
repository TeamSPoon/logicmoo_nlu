That's one if my favorites as well
They have so many hits!
I love walk this way, love on an elevator, and Janie's got a gun.
Those are some great songs. When they did walk this way would run DMC it was groundbreaking.
What do you think about Pearl Jam?  Are you a fan of Aaron.
I was in high school when they broke big. They had some awesome songs too.
Songs like Jeremy and don't call me daughter are two of my favorites.
Whatever happened to limp biscuit.
I don't know, Fred Durst was the heat for a while.
That song " I did it all for the nooki" was huge.
Are there any new artist that you really like?
I like the group Mumford and Sons. I think they have an awesome sound.
I likeMaroon 5.
I also think Adele has an amazing voice.
Lady Gaga is pretty good too. Not a huge fan but I respect her talent.
My wife saw her in concert a few months ago. She said it was a great show.
I saw her sing live on a TV show the other day.  She sounded as good as her album
