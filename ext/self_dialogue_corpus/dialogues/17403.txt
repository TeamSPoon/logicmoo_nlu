What do you think of Streetlight Manifesto?
They're a great band to be honest.
I agree, have you been to any of their concerts?
Yes, I was just at their show in Philadelphia earlier this year.
That's cool, I last went two years ago. They played with Reel Big Fish.
Did Thomas play anything early from his new album? He sometimes does that.
He actually did, he played the new song off of The Hands That Thieve.
That's neat. Do you remember his last band?
What was it, Catch 22 right?
Yeah, I really think Keasby Nights is the best album ever made.
I have to say it does include two of my favorite songs, but I like the remake better.
The remake was okay, but the grittiness of the original can't be matched.
Yeah it was pretty funny that Tom went on to start streetlight.
Catch 22 kept going and released a few more albums, some of them are very good.
Woah, I didn't know that. What other ska bands do you like?
Well Less Than Jake is cool.
They're good, I think they have a lot of catchy tunes.
I think so too, the trumpet solos are off the chain.
Well ska has a good variety of music I think, there's something for everyone.
There definitely was for me, I didn't find out about it until a couple  of years ago.
