Seems like there's a pretty good group of safeties in the league right now.
Some real good players for sure.
Maybe not a Lonnie Rott, but some good ones.
Well, the position has changed so much.  Can't hit guys like you used to.
That's probably why nobody wants a safety in the box anymore.
It helps to have good run skills, but you need to force turnovers.
That's why I would probably take Eric Berry.
Great choice and a total inspiration.
Yeah, the way he came back cancer is simply incredible.
And came back better!
He's a true ballhawk for sure.  Wish he was on my team.
What do you think about Landon Collins?
Great pick by the Giants.  Just seems to be around the ball.
I remember him falling in the draft a bit too.
He's just skilled in all facets of the game with tons of room to grown.
I'd also be remiss to not include Earl Thomas.
Didn't he get injured though?
Yeah, he did, but he completes that secondary.
Seattle really suffered without him.
Yep, they need him back healthy.
