Do you like football?
Yeah, NFL, not college, so much.
Same here! What's your team?
Seahawks, you?
Your rival, Cardinals.
Haha, we beat you every time!
Hopefully not this season...although we are in need of some new players.
We still got Wilson!
He's okay, I guess...
Better than Palmer!
Palmer is getting a bit old, but I think he can still play and so can Fitz!
Yeah better than the Browns!
Anyone is better than the Browns! Man, they were bad last season.
I think they won one game?
Pretty embarrassing! I feel sorry for them.
All I want is for Patriots to not to win!
Yup, and the cheeseheads!
And the Steelers!
I know I can't stand them either!
Well, either the Seahawks or the Cards will have to beat them then.
