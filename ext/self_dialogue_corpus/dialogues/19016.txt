Ever heard of Weather Report?
Of course! "Morning clouds will make way for clear skies and temperatures into the mid-70s with lows into the 60s overnight."
No, dork. I mean the band.
You mean those fusion guys?
Yes. Ever listen to their music?
The early stuff. It was a little out there for me.
They really found their voice with "Black Market."
Haven't heard that one.
That's when Jaco Pastorius came on board.
That guy is legendary!
He can do anything. Even played with Joni Mitchell in the late '70s.
I need to listen to more of his stuff.
He revolutionized the bass; topped DownBeat's "Best Bassist" several times.
What's he doing now?
He had a horrible end.
Drugs?
Not exactly. A bouncer beat him up outside some club in Florida.
What !?
Jaco was a musical genius, but he was bi-polar. He got into with the guy, who likely had no idea who he was...
That sucks big time! What a loss!
