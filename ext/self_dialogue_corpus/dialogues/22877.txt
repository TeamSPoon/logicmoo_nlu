What's your favorite comedy?
Oh so many hard to decide.  Maybe Caddy Shack.
Meh, I didn't like that one.
What?  You're crazy, what did you like?
I liked Super Troopers.
That was a good one.  What about Beer Fest?
Also funny, all the same guys.
You know what was good?  Euro trip.
Oh man that was funny, just well written jokes.
Like Scotty Doesn't know always playing.
Also when he was with the soccer hooligans and knew the song by accident.
Or the worst twins ever.
How about Something About Mary.
Ok, I want to change my answer that's my favorite comedy.
Not only was it funny but it was a feel good story too.
Yeah, it was great when woogie was after the shoes.
And the part about franks and beans.
Oh man don't remind me it's painful to think of.
And the hair gel scene.
Oh yeah, one of the best comedy moments ever.
