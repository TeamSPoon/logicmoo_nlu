Who are the best starting pitchers in the league right now?
Loaded question. If you go by stats right now Ervin Santana is dominating.
Yeah must be back on the stuff.
He was always up and down with the Angels but when he gets dialed in he's tough to hit.
He'll come back down to earth.
For my money I still ride with the proven guys like Scherzer, Bumgarner, etc.
What's with Greinke?
Yeah Greinke's numbers haven't been great since moving to AZ. He's not getting lit up though.
Sabathia actually isn't terrible this year.
Not as terrible as he was, but still past his expiration date IMO. Yankees need some SP help.
Agree. Wang doesn't look good either.
Wang?
LOL Tanaka I mean. Not Wang.
They'll be in the market at the deadline most likely, need something.
Who's even available for SP's?
Won't know until some teams fall out of contention. Chatwood would be a target but Rockies are winning ballgames.
Always liked Chatwood, never got to see him come up to the Angels before he got traded.
He's one of those guys where you look at what he's done in Colorado and think maybe he'd be even better on my team.
So who else is available besides Chatwood though?
IDK I'd look at guys who are free agents at the end of the year and are on teams that might tank.
