Have you heard of the band My Chemical Romance?
No, I haven't. What kind of music do they perform?
Punk rock, I think they are great! Want to listen to their music with me?
Sure, I'd love to.
Have you heard about Kesha?
Kesha? Who is that?
She's a singer. She performed the song Tik Tok.
Oh, I see. Well I never listened to her before.
Until now! Let's see what you think of her.
Okay, sure. Sounds amazing.
Do you like Bruno Mars?
Bruno who?
Wait, really? He performed, let's see...Grenade, That's What I Like, and The Lazy Song.
Hm, it doesn't ring any bells.
Well, come over so we can listen to his music!
Okay, I'll be on my way after lunch.
Hey, do you like rap music?
Rap? Not really. I haven't heard any good rap songs.
How about Eminem? He performed Mocking Bird and Rap God.
No, but I'll try it. I'm always looking for new things to listen to.
