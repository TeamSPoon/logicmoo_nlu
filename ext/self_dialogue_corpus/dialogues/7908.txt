What are your thoughts on the Biebs?
Ah, the Biebs.  He's quite a character.
Yeah, but is he talented?
I would say that he is quite talented.  Some music is better than other stuff.
He has really been able to ride waves well.
Yes, somehow he gets ahead of the wave and profits well.
Some of his stuff is garbage.
I agree, but some of his younger material was more relevant to that time period.
Would you let your young daughter listen to him?
Now, that's a whole other conversation for another time.
