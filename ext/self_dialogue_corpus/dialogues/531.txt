Are you excited about football season?
I sure am.
Are you more into college football or NFL football?
I'm an NFL guy all the way.
Who is your favorite team?
I'm a Carolina Panther fan.
But you are from Wisconsin?
I know, but I love Cam Newton!
He is a great quarterback.
Yea, he had a rough year last year though.
I think he'll bounce back.
I do too.
Think the Panthers can win the division?
It's probably a bit of a long shot but maybe.
How many games do you think they win this year?
I'm guessing 9, but I'm hoping for many more.
They are an exciting team to watch.
This is true.
I think they win 11!
I think you are an optimist.
