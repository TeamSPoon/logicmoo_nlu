What did you think of the musical adaptations of the Beatles songs in the movie "Across the Universe"?
I really enjoyed them actually.
Yea me too.
I was nice to hear different people sing the songs, like when the girl was singing "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
Yea, they slowed the song down and make it less rockish and more intense.
I also really liked Evan Rachel Wood's adaptation of "Blackbird".
Yea? I wasn't such a fan of that one.
Why not?
I mean it sounded good, but I just don't think it was better than the original.
Yea, I can see that. The original had the guitar and I think in the movie they had some instrument that sounded like an accordion.
