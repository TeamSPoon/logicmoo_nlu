Man, now I'm all hyped up for the season. i can't wait until September, It's still 2 months away...
August 10 is the preseason. So we only have one more month left.
Preseason games kinda suck
Well,l they're not really games as much as a show case
Show case for what?
For the new recruits. They show off what they can do how they fit with the teamm etc.
Honestly, we don't need that.
Um. Yes we do. It helps us to prepare for the games. See how much improvements new people bring.
They don't really play seriously.
Because they're interested in showcasing.
It seems silly to me. Anyway, I wonder who will be the most improved team this year
People say Titans, but will see. I love Mariota so seeing him get one of the best WR is a good thing.
I hink Patriots will improve and be even more dominant
Why?
They got revamped on WR, RB, TE and DE positions. Their depth is amazing
Eh. maybe.
I think Ravens will improve a lot this year too
How's that?
Ravens D is gonna be even more dominant now this year with all the new players they picked up.
Eh, guess we'll see. I kinda also liked Texans. Deshaun Watson. Enough said.
