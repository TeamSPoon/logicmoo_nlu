Did you like the Beatles anthology series?
I loved it.
I remember it was on ABC and ran for maybe one night a week for a month.
It was really cool. Couldn't wait for the next week.
Yes,we learned a lot about the Beatles that we didn't know before.
I thought I knew,it all until that came out
To hear some studio cuts and,outtakes were awesome
It gave me chills.
Me too.
And two new songs
