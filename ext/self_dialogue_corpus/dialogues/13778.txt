I am frustrated
Why are you frustrated
Because i want Gaga to explore another genre
What do you mean
She is so much more talented than just doing pop music
But is she not good at it
Her music is god tier but i want more
Well maybe she might collab with metallica
That is what i am hoping
Well it might happen
