Whats your favorite team?
I like the Minnesota Vikings.
Really, thats a rare one.
What do you mean?
I don't know many people who like them.
They honestly aren't they bad.
Thats not what their records say....
You know they've been to the Superbowl 4 times.
Yeah, and lost all of them.
Well, they are my favorite team.
Why?
I feel like one day they'll get it together and win a Superbowl.
Hey, anything is possible.
Yeah, my mom likes them too.
Oh, so you like to follow them together.
Yeah, exactly.
You don't like any of the Florida teams?
Not really, I mean just cause I live in Florida doesn't mean I have to like them.
Sure, but it's weird when someone doesn't.
Not weird, just not conventional.
