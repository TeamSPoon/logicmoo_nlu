Have you ever seen Lady Gaga in concert?
Yes, I have! I saw her show in Austin, Texas.
I went to her Pittsburgh concert- it was great!
Her outfit changes were incredible. What was your favorite song?
Definitely "Poker Face." You?
I loved "Telephone."
Oh, that's her best video by far.
You're right, Lady Gaga was such a good actor in that one.
It was fun to see her and Beyonce together, too.
I think "Telephone" is my all-time favorite Gaga song.
