I don't like much pop but there were some artists I really liked when I listened to the radio the other day.
Any examples?
Whoever sings that 'Call me Maybe' song. Her voice wasn't bad.
No, and that song is fun and upbeat.
I find myself singing it sometimes.
It is definitely not your type of song.
I agree. Normally I find pop lyrics banal.
They can definitely be that.
Plus there's that auto tune.
Ug, that's horrible. It sounds bad.
