Did you like the beginning of the original Fast and the Furious movie?
Yes. The car chase was intense.
I wondered who those people were with the cars.
It was a heart pounding scene.
They filmed that chase really good.
Yes. That film was directed well.
What was the most suspenseful part of the scene to you?
When they were about to go into that construction zone.
I remember that.
That was a really cool intro.
