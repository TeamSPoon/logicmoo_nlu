I just read where Michael Jackson's Thriller is going to be released this summer.
Why is it being rereleased?
Because it's being turned into a 3D movie.
Is his family OK with that?
Two of his kids are involved in the project.
Who's making it?
John Landis who directed the original video is overseeing the project.
I loved the original Thriller. If this is going to be in 3D, I'll definitely want to see it.
It's going to be shown at IMAX theaters.
We should go.
