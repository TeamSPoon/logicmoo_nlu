So basically I am like obsessed with Ed Sheeran at the moment.
I can understand why, he is pretty awesome.
His songs are so meaningful and he has great catchy melodies.
He also writes stuff for other people too.
I know!  Did you know he helped write Love Yourself for Justin Beiber?
I think he even sings on the track too!
That is so cool!  I loved the song Everything Has Changed that he sang and wrote with Taylor Swift.
The music video for that song was so cute!
He seems like he is pretty funny and down to earth in real life too.
Yeah I saw him on a talk show once and it was hilarious.
