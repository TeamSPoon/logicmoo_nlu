Getting excited about NFL football camps opening soon?
Absolutely. I plan to get to the Green Bay Packer camp in Depere, Wisconsin next month.
I am guessing you a Packer fan?
Yep, I bleed green & gold.
Are you planning on seeing any regular season games this year.
Yes, my buddy and I are going to the December 3rd game in Tampa.
How long have you been a Packer fan.
Since 1950.
Have you been to any Superbowl games the packers played in?
Yes, I was lucky enough to see Superbowl XXXI in New Orleans.
What team is the biggest Packer rival?
Has always been the Bears but, the Vikings are moving up.
Do you have a favorite player from the Packer past?
Yes, that would have to be Bart Starr for me.
How closely do you follow the NFL during the season?
I watch a couple games each week and if the Packers are on, I never miss it.
Who is your favorite current Packer?
That would be Aaron Rodgers as he is an amazing quarterback.
How are the Packers going to do this year.
I can see them at 12-4 with some luck and few injuries. If Rodgers goes down, we are in major trouble.
