Did you know that Daniel Craig was in The Force Awakens?
I didn't see him.
That's 'cause he was a storm trooper.
Too cool.
You remember when Rey uses the Jedi Mind Trick?
And gets that trooper to release her?
Yup, that was him.
I never would have guessed.
That he was in it?
That he was a geek deep down!
