I like movies that are a little weird, like in a trippy surprising way.

Yeah, I liked that one a lot. How about the one that came out in 2015, The Visit?
No, I haven't seen that one yet. Was it good?
I haven't seen it yet either. We should see if it's on Netflix or buy it and watch it together.
Okay, that sound like fun!
