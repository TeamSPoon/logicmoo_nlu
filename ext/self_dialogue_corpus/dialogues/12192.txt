In all the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?
I would probably have to say either Han Solo or Obi Wan Kenobi.
Oh, Han Solo is one of my favorites too.
He's such a good character and Harrison Ford plays him so well, especially in the first trilogy.
Yea, he's good at playing kind of like the rascally, space pirate type of character.
Yea, him and Chewbacca are such an unlikely pair, but someone how it works so well.
He definitely brought a lot of comic relief to the movies.
Yea and his own individual storyline was really interesting too.
Yea, I heard they're making a separate movie that is just all about Han Solo.
Really?! That would be awesome!
