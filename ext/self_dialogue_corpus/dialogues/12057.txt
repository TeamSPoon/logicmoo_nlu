When did the very first Star Wars movie come out?
Well, you know that the very first one was actually episode 4, don't you?
Oh yeah!  I had forgotten about that.  It was the middle trilogy.
Yes--and to answer your question, it came out in 1977.
Did you see it in the theater?
Yes, I did.  It was an amazing experience!
Who was your favorite character from the first set of movies?
Luke Skywalker, of course.
I guess he was kind of the underdog that came into his own by the end of the movie.
Yes, he really ended up saving the day at the end.
