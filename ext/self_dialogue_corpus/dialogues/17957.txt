Okay, we did Toby Keith. So let's do top five favorite Garth Brooks song now.
Finding five good songs is gonna be easy. Figuring out the five BEST songs is gonna be the issue.
So, what would be number one?
Number one is easy, "Friends in low places."
Okay. What's number two?
In no particular order... "Rodeo," not one of his most popular songs but I love it.
Okay, Number three?
"The Thunder Rolls" has got to be in there.
Okay. And four?
I gotta include "Callin' Baton rogue."
What's that about?
A guy is on the road but he keeps thinking about the girl he left in Baton Rogue.
Okay. And number five?
No, no, no. I'm naming songs that might be there. I'm not saying they're definitely top five.
Okay, so what other songs are you considering?
You can't talk about Garth Brooks and NOT include "The Dance"
I like that one. So is that your top five?
No. Still have "Ain't going down til the sun comes up." I LOVE that song.
YOur top five is now your top six.
I told you. This ain't easy.
