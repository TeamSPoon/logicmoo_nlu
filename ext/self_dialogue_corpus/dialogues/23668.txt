Hello. I want to see a good movie, which one do you recommend?
Well, I really like Jack Nicholson, do you know what type of genre do you want to see?
How about comedy. Does he has comedies?
Yes he does! You can watch the movies As good as it gets, Something´s Gotta Give, The Bucket List, Anger Management
Oh wow! I didn´t know he had so many. So which one would you see then?
I would definitely go for Something´s Gotta Give or Anger Management, you have a guaranteed laugh right there.
What is Something´s Gotta Give about?
It about this older guy (Jack) who has a younger girlfriend, but due to some circumstances he falls in love with his girlfriend´s mom, which is more adequate for his age.
Oh really?, Sounds very interesting and like a hoot, who else is in the movie?
It has great actors like Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet
Oh wow, then is a definitely a must see!. What about Anger Management? That sounds serious.
It´s actually not. It´s super funny, it deals whit someone that is tricked to join anger management so he can overcome some issues, but in the movie Jack makes his life impossible.
It definitely opened my curiosity. What other actors are in it?
Top notch, it has Adam Sandler, Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman.
Oh wow, I didn´t know. I really love Marisa Tomei´s work.
Really? Now is your time to recommend to me, which other movies is she in?
My Cousin Vinny, Only You, What Women Want, Someone Like You to name a few.
Well they all sound pretty good, but Im in the mood for a romantic one, which one would be the best?
Definitely Only You, is about this girl who is looking for the love of her life in Europe and this other guy falls in love with her. By the way the guy is Robert Downey.
No kidding! Then I definitely have to see it. I love both actors!
