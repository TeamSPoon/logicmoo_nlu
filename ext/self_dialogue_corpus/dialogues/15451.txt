Remember the Grunge Era?
Sure, I definitely do. I was in my teens at the time.
Yep, me too. There was a 3-4 year stretch where all I listened to was Grunge music.
Speaking as someone who had Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, and Pearl Jam tshirts on heavy rotation, I'm right there with you.
Nirvana is my favorite band of all time.
They're pretty great. I think I actually liked Pearl Jam more when I was younger.
Pearl Jam is really good too.
It's sad how some of the great musicians from those bands have passed away.
Yeah, Chris Cornell's death hit me hard. And of course, at the time Kurt Cobain.
That lifestyle wasn't a healthy one, I suppose.
No, but they made some incredible music.
No question. I remember in high school I saw a show with Alice in Chains and Soundgarden.
So lucky! I never saw any of the big grunge acts play live.
Yeah, my friend and I got a couple of tickets for our birthdays, which happened to be right around the same time.
I'll always regret not being able to see Nirvana play live.
The funny thing is that the show wasn't that great - it was outdoors and drizzling, and the sound quality was lousy.
Still, you got to see Alice in Chains and Soundgarden live.
True. I guess I can't complain.
I'm going to throw my Nevermind CD into the stereo.
Cool, I wouldn't mind hearing it again.
