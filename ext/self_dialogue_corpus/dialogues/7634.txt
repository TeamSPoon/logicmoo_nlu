Whats your favorite part of Harry Potter
I like platform nine and three quarters
Yea that was neat
It was so cool how they have to run through the wall to get to the Hogwarts express
Harry was so scared when he did it the first time
It was kind of funny
I like the owls
It seems cool to have a pet owl and they also deliver letters
That would be amazing
Totally
