Do you still need those Harry Potter DVD's?
Yeah, we want to binge watch them.
Ok, which ones?
Do you have at least the first three?
Yes. But what about the rest?
I think I might have the rest but when we moved I displaced them.
Okay, how about I bring the first three and then we can watch the rest next time?
Sounds like a good plan. Do you think we can watch three in one day?
I think so, if it's a weekend.
Okay, how about we watch them on Saturday?
