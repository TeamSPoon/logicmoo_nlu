Are you watching Goodfellas? That's one of my all time favorites!
Mine too! I can quote this movie almost by heart.
What's your favorite part of this film?
Oh wow, too many to mention. For one thing, I love the scene with Tommy and Billy Batts.
I like when Billy Bats says "Go home and get your shinebox!"
Yes! That's such a hilarious scene, even though it's quite brutal too.
I like when they're all sitting around the table in the restaurant, and Joe Pesci is telling stories.
Yes, and they're all laughing hysterically!
It makes you laugh hysterically too, even though sometimes you don't even know the context of the story.
Exactly, it's Joe Pesci's New York/Italian accent, the way he tells the stories, and the way everyone cracks up when he tells them.
I also love all the food in the movie. It makes me salivate!
Me too! I get so hungry, especially when Ray Liotta is cooking that big feast at the end.
The part when Ray Liotta says "I had some beautiful cutlets I was gonna cook up before dinner just as a appetizer" always makes me want chicken cutlets.
I also like when they go to Joe Pesci's mother's house and she shows them her painting.
Oh yeah, that part is so funny for unexplainable reasons. Joe Pesci says, "I like this. One dog goes one way, the other dog goes the other way."
Yeah it's funny but I don't really know why. Maybe it's his voice again.
Did you know the woman that plays the mother is actually really Martin Scorsese's mother?
No kidding? Wasn't she in Casino too?
Yes, I think she was.
What a nice bit of trivia. I never knew that.
