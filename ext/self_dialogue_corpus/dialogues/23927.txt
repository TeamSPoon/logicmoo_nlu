I want to watch something that feels true to life and human relationships.
Can you think of a movie that has done that for you in the past?
Uh, there's this one 80s movie Broadcast News that I've always really loved.
I'm not familiar with it.
You should definitely see it! It's hilarious and deep, it deals with failure and there's a really fun love triangle plotline.
That does sound pretty good.
Well, do you have any suggestions for me?
Yes, I do. There's a Lynn Shelton movie from 2012 starring Mark Duplass called Your Sisters Sister that I adore.
What's it about?
There's a character named Jack whose brother has just passed away and he's feeling quite depressed.
So like Garden State?
No, not really. His best friend previously dated his brother and he's hopelessly in love with her, but he's also going through a rough time.
Sounds like a pretty compelling conflict, but one I've heard of before.
Wait, that's not all there is. She decides that he needs a vacation so she offers to put him up in her father's cabin alone on an island to get some head space.
Then she comes and visits him and they figure otu over a period of time that they're in love?
Not exactly. When Jack gets there he runs into his friend's sister, whom he's never met, Hannah. Hannah is a lesbian who recently got out of a relationship.
So no chance of love for them?
They actually have a one night fling and then Iris, Jack's best friend, shows up as a surprise the next morning.
Wow, this sounds super messy and complicated.
Yes, the acting and dialog are very real. It's also super hilarious.
