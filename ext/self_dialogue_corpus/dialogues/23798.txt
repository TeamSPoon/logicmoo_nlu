My daughter thinks that Kurt Russell and Patrick Swayze look alike. Do you?
I guess I can see a resemblance because they have the same facial shape and hair color. Do you like either actor?
Actually I like both of them. They have both done a lot of great movies.
I guess that's true. Which is your favorite?
Do you mean favorate actor or favorite movie they have starred in?
I mean which movies do you like best.
I think that for Patrick Swayze it's a tie between Dirty Dancing and Ghost. Which of those do you like better?
I think I like Ghost best because I really like Whoopie Goldberg and Demi Moore as well as Patrick Swayze.
I think Ghost was a funny movie but also very touching. Dirty Dancing was more serious.
I agree. What about Kurt Russell?
I liked him in Overboard and also in Tombstone.
I have never seen Overboard. What is it about?
It's about a snobby rich woman who hires a carpenter to work on her yacht.
Who plays the rich woman?
Goldie Hawn of course! Anyway, after she is mean to this carpenter she falls overboard and can't remember who she is.
That sounds funny! Is Kurt Russell the carpenter?
Yes, and he decides to get even with her and claims her as his wife. He then takes her home to take care of his awful children.
Does she ever figure out that she isn't really his wife?
Yes, he eventually falls in love with her and tells her but she stays with him anyway.
That sounds like a movie I'd like to watch.
