You ready for another Giants Superbowl win?
Of course not!
Why?
I cannot stand Eli Manning to save my life.
Oh no, why? He's a good guy.
He's a jerk disguised as a good guy.
No way. How so?
Remember when he was drafted?
A bit, what happened?
Do you remember who drafted him?
The Giants.
WRONG. The Browns.
Huh. I didn't know that.
So here's why I hate him.
Okay.
He flat-out refused to play for them. He literally said he would not play a single snap.
Why not?
He said he'd only play for the Giants.
You hate him for that?
Yes. He had the audacity to come out of college and demand which team he plays for, and threw a fit.
