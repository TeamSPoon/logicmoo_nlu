Have you taken any courses on Music
Of course I have.
What's it called?
Music and the visual arts.
Whoa what's that about?
Basically, the course was a historical perspective on how music is portrayed in all arts?
so like movies and music videos?
Not really actually. More like how music has been perceived in paintings, scriptures, and basically anything.
Oh wow, what's the coolest thing you learned?
Music has always been considered the purest of arts.
Interesting, why's that?
It is the only art experienced by a single sense, hearing.
Interesting perspective. I guess everything requires you're eyes and something else.
Yeah music has really evolved in a unique way.
I guess all art has as well.
That's true.
I might have to take that course sometime, would you recommend it?
Yes! The professor is bomb. You should check it out.
Awesome. I'm thinking about it next semester.
Its an Easy A too. Go for it!
