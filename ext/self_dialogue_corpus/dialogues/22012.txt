Hey, have you seen the movie Ms. Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children?
No, what a strange sounding title!  What is it?
It's based after a juvenile fiction book, and it's really great!
It seems like there are so many movies based on juvenile fiction lately.
Yeah, I know!  Like Harry Potter, the Maze Runner, and so many more.
Yeah, so was it a good movie?
Yes.  It's a fantasy movie so it's definitely not for those into realism.
What was it about?
It's kinda hard to explain.  There's this boy and he's wanting to visit this home for children that have special power.
Sorta like the X-Men?
Well, they're not super heros, but it's a similar idea, yes.  They can do things that normal people can't.
So does he get to visit the home?
Yeah, he does.  He goes on a trip with his dad and finds the home by himself.
It sounds a little boring from what you've said.
No, you'd just have to see it to understand.  He starts getting involved with the children at the home and things going on in their lives.
I wanna say I've seen the trailer at some point.  That rings a bell.
Yeah, it's pretty neat.  And there are villains that they wind up trying to attack together.
So it turns into a hero type story?
Yes, I would definitely say that is true.  It is suspenseful and interesting at the same time.
Okay, well I might look into it.  I don't usually like fantasy though.
