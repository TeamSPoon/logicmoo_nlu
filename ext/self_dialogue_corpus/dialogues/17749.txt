What genre of music has the best lyrics, overall, do you think?
Hard to judge. I can think of some genre's that DON'T have the best lyrics.
Like what?
Classical music, for instance!
Haha, very funny.
I'd maybe pick Hip Hop music. So much of the art form is bound up in the lyrics.
I can see that argument, although I'd argue that there's a lot of popular hip hop music with terrible lyrics.
For sure. But the same can be said about Rock, or Country, or any other genre.
I actually would pick Rock music, myself.
When I think of the greatest Hip Hop songs, lyric-wise, and the greatest Rock songs, I think the Hip Hop songs are better lyrically.
I guess it depends on what you like.
Definitely. Though I think in this case, it's fairly clear which is better.
I am a big appreciater of poetry, symbolism, and ambiguity. All those exist in larger quantities in Rock music lyrics.
To some extent, I agree. At least about symbolism and ambiguity.
But not poetry?
Absolutely not! There are some incredibly poetic MCs out there making beautiful Hip Hop songs.
Like who?
Talib Kweli, Common, Aesop Rock, to name a few.
OK, I agree with those artist you've named. But they aren't necessarily mainstream.
That doesn't really matter for this discussion, though.
