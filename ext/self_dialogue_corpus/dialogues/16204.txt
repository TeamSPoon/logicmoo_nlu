We're you ever a Sinatra fan?
Yea,I like his songs. Good music.
I have several songs on my playlists.
I do too actually.
Boy did he have a ton of hits.
Wow,you're right there.
My father never thought he had that great of a voice. Said he sounded flat at times.
I can see where he could say that.
He could belt them out though.
Yea,I loved My Way.
Oh me too.
I think Elvis did it better though.
I have to agree with you. More powerful.
Definitely more powerful.
Don't say that to Sinatra fans though.
Oh know,they wouldn't appreciate that.
I'm a big Yankees fan and I love hearing New York,New York after every game.
Yea,they've been playing that for years.
Always sounds good at The Stadium.
Always good when you're actually there.
