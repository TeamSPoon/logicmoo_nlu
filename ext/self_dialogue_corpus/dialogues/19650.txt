I am getting ready to go on a jog, want to come?
Yea sure, first just let me transfer a few songs on to my mp3 player.
Sounds good, which songs are you adding?
I am going to listen to some classic rock and roll. It always motivates me!
Yea certain songs do that for me as well, they really get your blood pumping.
They sure do, I am getting several Bonjovi songs for today's jog.
Bonjovi is an awesome group, which songs of theirs will you be listening to?
Probably Living On a Prayer, Its My Life, and Have a Nice Day.
I love all three of those, especially Living On a Prayer.
It is a timeless classic for sure!
When I was in college my roommate and I would always listen to that one and Bed Of Roses.
I forgot about A Bed Of Roses, that is also a classic.
It is old but I enjoy it just the same.
Me to, there is nothing like older music in my opinion.
What about AC/DC? I used to love them as well.
Me to! I actually have Thunderstruck on my playlist right now.
It has been so long since I listened to that one!
They have so many classics on their resume; their music never gets old to me.
I know exactly what you mean! They truly had special talent.
I feel that they very well may be the best rock band of all time.
