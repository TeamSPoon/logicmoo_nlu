I know you love the original Star Wars trilogy.
Yes, I am a fan of those 3 films, definitely.
Lucas "enhanced" Star Wars when he got the chance. Is there anything you would change about them, if you had a chance?
Not like Lucas did - that's taking perfectionism a little too far, if you ask me.
But you would change something?
Well, everyone would change that scene with Han in Star Wars where he uses "parsecs" as a unit of time instead of distance. That was embarrassing - for Lucas, who wrote that line.
Would you have Greedo shoot first?
Hell no, it was fine the way it was. Greedo was a bad dude and threatening to boot.
Anything else?
In Return of the Jedi, when Luke tells Leia they're siblings, her reaction is so understated, it almost doesn't register. I would have "made the moment" a little more strongly, given it the importance it deserved.
