Did you see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?
I did! So exciting to see another Star Wars movie on the big screen!
Did you like the new characters?
Oh yeah! Krennic was a pretty menacing guy. Very manipulative.
How did you like the surprise cameos?
The digital ones?
Yeah. Tarkin and Leia
It was awesome. I could see some flaws with the CGI of course, but it was great to see those characters.
What about those Darth Vader scenes?
I know! Awesome hearing James Earl Jones do the voice. And that last Vader scene is crazy!
