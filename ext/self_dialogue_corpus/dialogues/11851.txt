DId you see that PBS special on the Beatles recordings that was on recently?
No, was it good?
It was awesome!
What kind of things did you learn?
They showed what went on in the studio. They showed lots of the recording techniques George Martin and the other engineers came up with which were very avante garde and never been done before
Did they focus on a particular album?
Yes, actually, it was mostly about the Seargeant Pepper's album
I love that one!
Me too. It's probably their best.
Yes, I agree. I just love Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite
