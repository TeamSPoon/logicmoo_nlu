What kind of Rock music do you like?
I like Classic Rock
Give me some examples of who you listen to?
I listen to LEd Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, bands like that.
So you like the harder rock?
It was hard then, but it is nothing compared to hard rock these days.
That's true. Have you heard Five Finger Death Punch?
Yes, but I think that is more Metal than hard rock?
What about their cover of Bad Company?
I like it, it was a lot more intense than the original, but it was still good.
