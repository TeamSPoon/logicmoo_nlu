Did you get to see La La Land yet?
No but I am wanting to, did you see it?
No, we should find out where it is playing and go see it this weekend.
Okay, I'm in. I think Ryan Gosling has this thing about him. I can't put my finger on it.
I know, if you saw him on the street you probably would not look twice at him but at the end of a movie he seems so handsome.
Yeah, I felt the same way about Barbra Streisand, She was not attractive at the beginning of a movie but beautiful by the end.
I like Emma Stone, she has sort of the same thing about her.
Her sense of humor seems to come through no matter what role she is playing.
She has that cute factor.
She got an Academy Award for her role in this movie.
It got a lot of awards didn't it.
Yes, best motion picture, best director, best screenplay and more. I can't remember all of the awards it got.
Well, I guess that makes it a must see movie for the weekend.
Sounds like it  to me.
Do you want to take the husbands?
It may be a chick flick. Does your husband like chick flicks?
Not really if someone isn't getting shot or ran over he gets pretty bored.
Mine likes cartoons. I swear all we watch at home together is cartoons.
Thank goodness, these days most people have a television in every room.
Your right about that, I just go to the bedroom and watch what I want to watch.
