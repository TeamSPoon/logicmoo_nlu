Hey have you heard of Alina Baraz?
No, who is that?
She's my new favorite artist!
Oh really? What do you like?
Imagine Norah Jones, but less proper.
Ok, interesting - what kind of music does she make.
Its the same kind of ambient vocal stuff - its really beautiful to listen to.
What is your favorite song?
For me, its called Make Me Feel
What its about?
She's singing about how she wants to make someone feel good, so to speak.
What is your favorite lyric?
At the open, she says "Listen long, long enough, you can love me"
Wow - thats pretty insightful, actually.
Her songs are seductive without being explicit, if you know what I mean.
Thats kind of tricky to do, most artists just go for explicit these days.
Does she ever tour?
Yeah she is on tour with Coldplay right now
Woah, Coldplay - she might not be unknown for long.
I hope not, I think she could be a huge success!
