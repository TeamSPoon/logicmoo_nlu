In Phantom Menace, what did you think about Darth Maul?
He was a good villain but but died too easily. That was a little disappointing.
Yes I thought he was going to be the main villain for the whole trilogy so it was a little surprising that he was killed in the first movie.
They build him up to be this ultimate fighter and extremely powerful but in the end he wasn't so much.
Well to be fair he was fighting against two Jedi knights. That's pretty impressive so I'd say he was extremely powerful.
He even killed Qui-Gon Jinn who was a Jedi master.
He made dumb mistake when he had Obi Wan Kenobi hanging over the pit. He stood there to gloat instead of finishing him off.
Yeah it's hard to believe this skilled warrior would do something so stupid, thus allowing Obi Wan to best him.
Maybe Darth Maul didn't die.
He was cut in half so I think it's safe to say that Darth Maul is dead.
