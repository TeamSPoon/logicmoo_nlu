Hey are you excited for the new NFL preseaon?
Yes, I can not wait to see new player and teams.
Me too, I want to know of the new trades.
I hope my favorite teams get some new talent.
Same here, the Patriots last year had the best season so far.
That's true they did. I hope my team the Chargers have a great year.
I know right. I really want Tom Brady to take the team to the superbowl again.
That would be nice but I would prefer to see the chargers there.
Do you think your team will get any new players?
I really hope so. The draft gave the team some fresh talent.
Same here for the Patriots.
Yeah, but as always we will have to see what the seasn brings.
Of course. I reall cant wait for the preseason to begin.
Yeah, it will be nice to visit San Diego to see what changes the team will be making this year.
Yeah I reall enjoy traveling to Foxborough to watch the preseason games.
Yeah, there is something about just my team work out the team kinks before the regular season.
Thats true. Previous years Tom Brady had used diffrent recievers and running backs.
Every year he always has a new go-to guy.
It will be great to see who he uses this years.
I fee the same about Rivers and the Chargers.
