The Avalanche Game last night was amazing.
It was exciting. Every time they scored a goal, the Blackhawks came right back.
Both goalees were on fire.
That penalty in the fourth quarter that sent the Avs player to the penalty box had me biting my nails.
I thought sure the Blackhawks would get ahead, but the Avs' penalty kill stopped them cold.
The Avs have a good chance to win back the Stanley Cup this year.
I  hope so, but the Penguins and the Blackhawks are going to be tough to beat.
When is the next home game?
Two weeks. We should try to get tickets.
We should, but I like to be right down on the ice.
Me too. I like to see all the action up-close.
I hope Lewis is off the DL by then. He's my favorite player.
Patterson is my favorite. He has the most shots on goal for any player right now.
They did great in the draft this year. The team is really starting to gel.
They are, but they need to stay out of the penalty box.
But that's hockey for you -- everybody's emotions are high, especially as the playoffs get nearer.
Yeah, but they need to keep their head in the game. Terchoff had a hat trick two weeks ago -- I want to see more action like that.
I think he's still healing from that groin injury he got earlier in the season. But he should be back in top form by next week.
I hope so. Let me know what you find out about those tickets, okay?
I will.
