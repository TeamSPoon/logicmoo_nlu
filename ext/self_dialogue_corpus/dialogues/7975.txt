Pop is such a weird category. It's like a catch-all bucket that you can toss everything else into.
It is -- it's basically every kind of music based off of the music American slaves sang to keep themselves sane. Up until pretty recently, in Europe it was all called "black music".
Yikes. Wasn't expecting a deep dive like this.
Well, you can't really avoid it. It's all about the class and race divide.
There is a sort of snootiness to the name. This is, ugh, popular music -- for the proles.
It's a euphemism. Everything about pop music is a euphemism, just like everything about white culture is about hiding our shame over our crimes.
Yee yimminy yikes. Let's dial it back, okay?
I'm just being honest here. You know how "dangerous" it was in the 1950s for nice young white girls to dance to that rock and roll music.
Well, that was a generational thing.
It's all about fear of black men having sex with white women. Rock and roll was at the time black slang for sex, just as jazz was a generation earlier.
