What is the one song that takes you back to the past?
Oh, that is easy "Stand Strong" by Burton Cummings.
Why does that song take you back.
It came out in 1976, I was in college and my boyfriend had broken up with me. He was my first love and broke my heart.
What is it about the song you like?
It says, "stand strong, don't you fall, don't you go do something foolish, all you are feeling right now is silly human pride".
Was you thinking about doing something foolish?
I was thinking about dropping out of school so I would not have to run into him.
Did you run into him? Did he start dating someone else?
Yes on both questions but I would go back to my dorm, play that song and cry.
Did you ever get over him?
It is a funny thing, I never think about him until I hear that song.
Well, look at the man you have now. I am sure you are better off.
So much better off. My grand-daughter recently had her heart broken, I looked it up on youtube and played it for her.
Oh, how sweet what did she think?
She thought it was stupid. I said, listen to the words and played it again.
After listening to it again, did she understand the song.
No, she said, why would anyone do something foolish when there are so many more boys to choice from.
This generation are so use to instant fixes they barely have time to feel anything.
I guess but when you are going through it a good song can always help.
