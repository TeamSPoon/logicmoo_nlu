what do you think about the new bands out today?
some are ok but i like a lot of the more classic stuff.
like the stones? and the who?
yes they are okay but i always liked the edgier stuff like the ramones and the stooges.
so youre into classic punk rock?
sure and some other genres too but nothing beats the raw energy of the older stuff.
thats true a lot of the newer bands do all sound the same.
yes i agree, most rip off the older bands. todays seem so fake  like they try to hard.
yes i see alot of that but rock and roll is here to stay.
haha yes it is thank goodness. what would we do without it?
