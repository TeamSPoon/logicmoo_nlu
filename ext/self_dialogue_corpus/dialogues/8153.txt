Hey do you like pop music at all?
Not one of my favorite genres, but it can be okay at times.
Fair assessment I've fallen in love with old 80's pop music in particular.
Oh really? What artists would you recommend?
Michael Jackson would be first, so many classics.
I will admit I've not given him enough of a chance, I do really like Man in The Mirror though.
That would be my absolute favorite track of his, but also check out Billy Jean, Thriller and Smooth Criminal.
Wasn't there a newer band that covered smooth criminal?
You're thinking of Alien Ant Farm. Alot of people like the cover, didn't do much for me.
Yeah me neither, Jackson is a hard act to follow, I can even say that given my limited exposure.
