What do you think about the new celebration rules?
Well, I'm not that familiar with the specifics.
Mostly it is allowing more celebrations after touchdowns as long as they aren't deemed inappropriate.
That's wonderful, I miss those days of TO and Chad Johnson competing with celebrations.
Me too, I like the group celebrations as well.
It's just like soccer!
I wonder how much they will actually allow.
That's a good point, they may say they are going to relax on the rules, but that doesn't mean they actually will.
I'm thinking they will possibly have some fines for celebrations that they said were going to be legal.
Well, hopefully that doesn't stop the celebrations in the first place!
Hopefully we will also see lots of touchdowns.
More touchdowns equal more celebrations!
I'm looking forward to some Patriots games and there high-score potential offense.
With Cooks and the revamped running backs, they should put up some good points.
A Falcons and Patriots rematch may put up a fair amount of points and have some nice celebrations.
But, Cooks' still can't do his bow and arrow!
That is unfortunate.
I agree, I think they should make some exceptions as that is definitely not a modern weapon or anything.
I agree, but you do have to make limits somewhere and it is easier there.
I suppose so, but that will still lead to some nice fines!
