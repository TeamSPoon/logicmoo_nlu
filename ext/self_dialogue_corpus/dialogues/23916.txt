Do you like animated stuff?
Like, movies? Disney?
Yeah, sure. There's other producers of animated films, though.
They're few and far between.
Yeah, whatever. Do you like animated movies?
I mean... I remember loving Anastasia. I know that wasn't Disney.
Anastasia was pretty good, too, I remember! Good recall.
Thanks - what were you thinking?
Titan A.E. I feel like society has collectively forgotten that movie even though it was so awesome.
Definitely underrated. Especially for how shockingly star-studded the cast was.
Drew Barrymore, Matt Damon, Bill Pullman... ah...
Janeane Garofalo!
Yeah! It was insane how many stars there were in it.
I wonder how that happened. Did they all just up and decide to try out voice acting together?
I don't know. Maybe the writer or director had connections.
We should look that up. Whatever connections they had, they probably had them for good reason.
What, because the movie was awesome?
Pretty much. Oh and remember the soundtrack?
Yes! It was so weird but pretty cool there'd be like music video scenes inside the movie itself.
To showcase the animation, I think. They nailed it.
