Do you have a favorite Rocky movie?
I liked the second one the most.
Really, why is that?
It's shot very similar to the first one and he actually wins in the end.
The opening scene of Rocky II is sorta gory.
Yeah, I know. They are both laid out in the hospital beaten practically to death.
Do you remember Apollo saying there ain't gonna be a rematch in the first one?
Yeah, it was in the 15th round. Rocky says I don't want one.
I don't blame him for not wanting one.
I don't either but both dudes changed their minds.
My favorite character in the Rocky movies was Paulie.
I liked him too. He was some working class stiff that liked to drink.
He really liked to drink and he ran his mouth off all the time.
Sure, but he was funny sometimes.
It's cool how before every fight Paulie and Rocky are cracking jokes.
You're right, it's very realistic. That's probably the best way to deal with nervous tension.
Which fight was the best?
I don't know. They were all good.
The second match versus Clubber was the shortest.
For sure, if Rocky didn't dispatch him quick then he would have been "dead meat sucka."
