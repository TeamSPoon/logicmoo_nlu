Did you see the Golden State Warriors game tonight?
Yes, they won and swept the Jazz.
They will probably win another championship.
The only team that has a chance to beat them is Cleveland.
Cleveland may win a game or two, but that's about it.
You're probably right.
Kind of isn't fair that they had a great team and added Kevin Durant.
Yeah, the NBA is kind of always that way; one or two teams are stacked and everyone else is mediocre.
Yeah, I wonder how they managed to stay under the cap.
The cap in the NBA is a soft cap, and essentially a joke.
The NHL and the NFL have it right with a hard cap.
Yeah, it creates more balance. Did you know that only about 8 teams have won the championship since 1985.
That's it? The same old teams always seem to win a championship.
Yeah, I believe it was only the Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, Spurs, Bulls, Rockets, Cavaliers, Mavericks, Heat, and the Warriors.
That's 10 teams.
Still, that's not too much of competitive balance.
Kind of sucks that it will be one of those teams again: Cavaliers or Warriors.
You mean the Warriors.
Yes, the Warriors. Nobody will beat them.
What a boring league.
