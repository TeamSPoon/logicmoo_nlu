So, in Harry Potter, Trewlaney was usually pretty spot on.
Sometimes, others she was just nuts.
But, that is the thing. She is a great-great granddaughter of the seer Cassandra.
So, what has that to do with her crazy side.
Cassandra, in old myth, was a seer, always right, who was cursed to be seen as insane, even when people saw she was right.
What? Oh, wow , just like her!
Yes. She predicated the whole movie, in a convoluted way.
And no one believed her predictions.
Yes, just like the myth! See, she was right the whole time!
Wow, that makes a lot of sense.
