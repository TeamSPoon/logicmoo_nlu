I heard a musician I love.  I can't wait to buy their cd.
Yeah?  (Kind of bored and disinterested.)
I can really imagine doing my schoolwork listening to this.  It was beautiful.
(Dutifully but still bored.)  Who is it?  What kind of music?
It's a band called Grace and the music is instrumental - it's gentle and soothing.
Sounds boring, honestly.  But if it makes you happy.....
When you study what do you like to listen to?
I like lots of music.  I can't say I've ever listened to just instrumental, though.
When I study I  can ONLY listen to instrumental-only.
It would put me to sleep!  I need something lively.
I enjoy gently and flowing music.  I like to light a candle and listen to flowing music.
What kind of instruments are on this cd?
Piano I think.  Maybe some guitar, some flute, and rain sounds.
Omg.  Just save yourself the money and sit outside.
I'm going to check if there are several cds by this band.
It's your money.
Well, I guess people do what fits themselves best.  My music works for me - it doesn't have to for you.
Yeah, that's true.
I love classical music - baroque strings mostly.
Whatever!
