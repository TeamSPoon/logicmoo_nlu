Are you watching the game tonight?
I don't know.
Why do you say that?
It's not going to be a good game?
That's true, but not like anything else is going to be on.
Haha, watching the weather channel going to be more exciting than that game!
There is always next near for the Celtics
Boston is going to be a beast!
Look at the season Isaiah Thomas had before he got hurt.
You are right, plus they have a deep bench.
I know this is wrong, but maybe if LeBron got hurt, it would be a series.
Don't wish that on anyone,... bad karma!!
I wasn't wishing it on anyone, I was just speculating!
Uh huh sure you were.
Who you got in the Spurs / Warriors?
Are you kidding?
Anything is possible! No guarantee that Golden State is going to sweep.
I mean, I guess you are right.
I know I am right, they were up 3-0 on Cleveland last year and look what happened.
You do have a point.
