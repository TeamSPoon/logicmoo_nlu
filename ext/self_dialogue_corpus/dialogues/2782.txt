Who is your all time favorite MVP winner?
Oh, definitely Jim brown.
Who is that?
Are you kidding? Jim Brown player for the Cleveland Browns back in the 1950.
Oh jeez, that's way too old.
You said all time.
I know, but I didn't think you'd go ancient on me.
Ok, fine, who is your all time favorite?
Joe Montana.
Yea he is one of the great ones.
Yep, he won two years in a row, 1989 and 1990.
For what team?
The San Francisco 49ers of course.
Oh yea that's right.
It was a close race between him and Brett Favre for my all time favorites.
For me, it was between Jim Brown and Peyton Manning.
Peyton Manning is definitely one of the greats as well.
Yea, I think he bought some Papa Johns restaurants after he retired.
Oh, no wonder their pizza tastes so good.
Yea, that guy dominates at everything he does.
