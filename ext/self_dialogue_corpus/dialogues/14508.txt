Do you think Derrick Rose will ever be the player he was suppose to be?
No, he will just end up fading away and hanging on to long.
How tall is Joakim Noah?
I want to say around 6'11....I could be off a little though.
If you had to pick one Duncan or Robinson?
They are both great players in their prime, can I say neither and pick Shaq?
Best 3 point shooter of all time?
Currently?? Curry without a doubt. All time....Miller.
Who is your all time favorite player?
Walt Frazier, his domaence is so under rated.
Do you think they should do away with the 1 and done rule?
Yes, I think its hurting the college game more than its helping the NBA.
Do you think Paul George will sign with the Lakers?
Last week, no - this week yes....he was snubbed off of the all-nba team.
Are you surprised Chris Paul wasn't picked either?
Honestly, no I'm not....he had a terrible season by his standards and so many players had career years.
Do you think George will chase the money or a championship?
He's gotta chase the money, any championship team won't be able to pay him what he wants.
Do you think George and the Lakers are a good fit?
NO! They are young, real young and George wants to win now.
