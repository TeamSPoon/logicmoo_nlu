Remember back a few years ago when everyone had to buy Air Force 1s.
Of course! I did too.
Didn't someone rap a song about it?
Yes it was called "Air Force 1s" I think by Nelly.
Right! I loved his music.
He was pretty popular when I was in high school.
Me too. I listened to him a lot on the radio.
I had posters of him on my wall.
He was pretty cute actually.
I also loved his song "Ride Wit Me."
That was a great one I remember that.
I also remember his song "Country Grammar".
I remember that one too! Also another great one.
Yes it was from his album "Country Grammar."
When did that song come out again?
It was in the year 2000.
Right I remember now. I got that album as a gift for my birthday one year.
One song I did not like of his was "Grillz".
Oh I kind of liked it, why didn't you?
Because it just looked nasty in my opinion, the music video that is.
