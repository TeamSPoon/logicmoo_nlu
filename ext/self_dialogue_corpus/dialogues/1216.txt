How do you think the next NFL season will go?
I mean, I hope it is less drama.
What do you mean?
Well, there was the whole deflate gate thing.
What is that?
A NFL controversy.
What happen?
At the 2015 playoffs, some one supposedly purposely deflated the football.
Who was the guilty party?
New England.
Was Tom Brady involved?
Yes, that is why I mentioned it.
Did he get in trouble?
He had a four game suspension last year.
Wow, I missed that whole thing.
Yes, I think they will have a good year now.
I hope so, he is a good player.
The Patriots always have a good chance at winning.
You think so? I have a feeling the Steelers will make it to the bog bowl.
I think they have a good as chance as any one.
