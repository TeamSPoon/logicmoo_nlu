I am ready for some NFL football to return!
Me too, thankfully pre-season is right around the corner.
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Detriot Lions.
How did the Lions do last year.
The lions had a decent year and won 9 games.
Did they make the playoffs?
The lions lost the wildcard game and got put out of the playoffs.
Oh, thats a shame.  We always watch them on thanksgiving day for tradition.
We are hoping for a year like we had back in the day.
When did the Lions have a great team.
Oh, in the 1950's, the Lions were the dominat team in the NFL.
Wow, I didn't know that.
Led by quarterback Layne, the Lions won sever NFL champoinships in the 1950's.
Who is their quarterback now?
The Lions are led by Stafford who averages over 4000 passing yards a season.
Stafford seems really good, where did he play in college?
He had a great college career at Georgia and was a stand out player.
He is one of only 4 players to throw for over 5000 yards in a season!
It sounds like the Detriot lions have a great quarterback!
