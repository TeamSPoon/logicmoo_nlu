What rap artists do you like?
I like any and everybody that's come out of Philly.
Oh so you like Skooly-D?
Parkside the 5-2, you better know it.
Do you remember MC Breeze from Philly?
Of course. He had that joint called Yo Lady Whoo.
Man the beat on that track was slamming.
What ever happened to Breeze?
I think he be touring overseas.
I think I heard something like that. Who else was live from Philly?
Beanie Mac. Bienel Siegel. Who Want What?
Yeah, Beans went hard. I remember when he was beefing with Jadakiss from The Lox.
I know. But you know it took Jay-Z to squash the beef.
Yeah, then they made that track Reservoir Dogs.
Reservoir Dogs goes hard. I be trying to download it from youtube but they don't have the full version.
I know. I think Jay-Z be whining over publishing rights or something.
I can't see why. A lot of his music I get from youtube.
I know. That don't make sense because actually I just downloaded You Can't Knock the Hustle from there last night.
Can't Knock the Hustle is a classic.
That thing is timeless my dude.
