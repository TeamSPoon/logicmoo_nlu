What are your plans for the evening?
I am just going to hang out and listen to some music.
Sounds like fun, who will you be listening to?
I like to listen to all kinds of different artists.'
Do you have a favorite singer?
I would have to say Taylor Swift if I had to pick.
A lot of people really like her!
She puts out some really great music.
Which one of her songs do you like the most?
I love her older music way better than her new stuff.
Me to! Even though her new songs are good as well.
I agree, she hardly ever delivers a bad song.
I love her song Picture To Burn. Are you familiar with that one?
Oh yes, I love that song! Not as much however as Teardrops On My Guitar.
That is a tough song to beat. What else do you like from her?
Mean, Tim McGraw, and Cold As You are some of my other favirotes.
Have you ever got to see her live in concert?
No, but that would be fantastic!
I have heard that she always does a great show.
I would expect nothing less!
