Cars 3 came out this past weekend.  Have you seen it yet?
No but I hear it is really good.
I haven't seen it yet either but I am really looking forward to it.
Yes, I am looking forward to it too.Hey maybe we can go together this weekend.
I would really like that.  Do you mind if I bring my grandson along?
That would be cool and I will bring my niece along.
My grandson will want to watch it over and over again just like he did with the Troll movie.
My niece loved the other two Cars movies so she will surely love this one as much.
It will definitely be fun and we get to see the up and coming youngster car.
My daughter loves McQueen and Mater.  We will see you guys Saturday afternoon for the movie.
