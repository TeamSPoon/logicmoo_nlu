What do you think of Rap Music?
I really do not care for it at all
I don't either. You cannot even understand half of what they are saying.
Yea, it does not even seem like music.
I like the music from the seventies. They had some great bands.
Sure did, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan to name a few.
Let's not forget the Beatles, Credence Clearwater Revival and The Band.
Wow.  I remember them all. They were all great!
Some great songs too, like Proud Mary by CCR and the Weight by the Band.
Yea definitely. And how about those Southern Rock bands like The Outlaws and Lynryd Skynrd?
They were some great bands too.
Todays music is nothing like it use to be.
It is either loud and screaming or you just cannot understand the words.
That is true.
No one will even remember most of these musicians years from now. They will remember a few like Taylor Swift or Beyonce.
Yes those who have really made a name for themselves.
The rest will be forgotten and maybe they should be.
You are not kidding.
I wish I could go back in time and see the bands from the seventies again.
Me too, that would be an experience.
