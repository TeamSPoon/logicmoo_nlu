Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Yeah I did! It was so good!
I thought it was pretty good too, though I feel like some things could have been done better.
Like what?
Well, I felt like a good portion of people's lines were predictable.
Yeah, maybe a little bit, but that's part of the charm.
If you say so, but I did like the new Darth Vader like guy.
Yeah he was a cool character, a little whiny though.
He was kind of a brat, but he was at least fun to watch.
I like his lightsaber, it's very different from what's been done in the other movies.
Yeah that was cool to seem them try something new.
I also like that there was a girl as the main character.
She was very likable, very spunky and funny.
Yes! She was so cool!
I can't wait for the next movie to come out, I hated that cliffhanger ending.
Yeah I didn't like it either, but I guess it had to be done.
I kind of see what you mean. It's a good way to keep the audience thirsty for more anyways.
Yeah, Disney has really been pushing the Star War's franchise lately.
Yeah they definitely are, there's a new generation of people to enjoy it.
True. There are quite a few people from the old generation to enjoy it too, though.
