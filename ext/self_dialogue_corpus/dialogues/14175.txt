Alright, So here is a serious question. What do you think of Laday Gaga's music?
Her early work was weird as hell.
Really? You think so?
Absolutely! Don't get me wrong some of her music was entertaining but a large portion was just odd.
Oh yeah? What song stood out to you as weird?
I think bad romance was pretty stange. The thing that bugged me about it was that everyone would constantly sing it.
So you didn't like the song at all?
No, it's one of those annoying songs that are designed to get stuck in your head until you like it.
That's silly,
Oh yeah? Then why do so many people say they didn't like the song but it just grew on them?
