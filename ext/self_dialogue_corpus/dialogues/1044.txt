I remember the good old days of NFL Monday Night Football!
The good old days?
With the incomparable Howard Cosell!
Oh, yeah!
And Frank Gifford!
Kathy Lee Gifford's husband?
That's right!
I love Kathy Lee!
And Dandy Don Merrideth!
Dandy?
Yeah. Dandy DOn Merrideth!
You cheer for a dandy Don?
No, Dandy Don is the nickname for the announcer.
Dandy?  Was he a special announcer?
Yeah. He was awful!
THen why did they call him dandy?
He was a great football player before he became an announcer. Dandy was a term of respect and admiration for his skills on the ball field...not his skills in the announcer's booth.
I just never would have thought that all those roughnecks on the playing field would nick name someone "Dandy"!
It's true. Dandy Don!
Dandy Don. Did they have a Pretty Paul too?
