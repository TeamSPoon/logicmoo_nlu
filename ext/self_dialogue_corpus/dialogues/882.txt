Did you see the new quarterback the Bears drafted?
No. What college did he go to?
North Carolina. He's really good.
Was he picked in the first round?
Yes. He was the number two overall pick.
Does Chicago need a quarterback? I thought they signed a free agent.
They did after the draft. They signed Mike Glennon.
So is Glennon the starter and the draft their back up?
Yes. His name is Trubisky.
I will have to check his footage out. Who was the number one pick?
Myles Garrett. He went to the Browns.
He's that defensive end from Texas right?
Yeah, Texas A&M.
I watched him play in a few games. He really is good.
I was hoping the 49ers would get him but the Browns had first pick.
Who did the 49ers pick up as defensive end? I know they needed one.
Soloman Thomas.
I don't remember him. What college is he from?
Stanford.
Oh. We don't get many of their games broadcast here.
