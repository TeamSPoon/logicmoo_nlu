Do you like the Beatles?
Yes I love them my favorite song is Love Me Do.
That is a good one. I also really like Help.
Who was your favorite Beatle?
I always loved Ringo. How about you?
I was always a big fan of Paul McCartney.
I think he is still going on tour.
I will have to go I hope he plays some old Beatles songs.
I wish we could see them all play together in the 60s.
Yes the whole Abbey Road album!
