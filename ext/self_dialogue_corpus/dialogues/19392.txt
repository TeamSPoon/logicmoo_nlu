Hey Leslie, whos a better R&B singer Trey songz or Usher?
Wow I love them both?
Me too but if you really had to choose who would it be?
I would say Trey Songz
Really why is that?
To me he has much mote sould than Usher.
Yeah I kind of agree.
I do think Trey kinda took Usher style a bit .
Yeah I can hear it in his vocals and songs.
Usher is a great dancer but not a singer to me.
Trey songs has a very wide fan base.
Everyone loves him I cant wait u til he comes to my city.
I really like how he has evolved over the years.
Yes he has became a great singer and has really proven himself as an artist.
Whats your favorite song?
Hmm probably ..But I gotta go.
Mine is Wonder woman.
Oh I forgot about that , that song was a hit.
Gotta love Trey Songs.
Yes his music I will never forget.
