I was thinking about having some of the guys over and have a trivia night.
Sounds good. What's the topic going to be?
NFL facts because they think they know a lot I am going  to do my best to find some odscura.
This should be fun. What do you want me to bring?
We'll talk about that in a minute. First I want to run some facts by you that I have found so far.
Okay go for it!
My husband will probably  know this one since he is a Pats fan. The New England Patriots The Bay State Patriots.
Kind of interesting but I know you have some better ones.
Yes I do. How about the Monday following the Super Bowl, antacid sales increase by 20 percent.
That isn't hard to believe!!!
Here are some more to do with food. It is estimated that over 8 million pounds of guacamole is consumed on Super Bowl Sunday.
Holy Guacamole!
Really?? You went there?
But of course!
On Super Bowl Sunday, it is estimated that 14,500 tons of potato chips are eaten. How did you like that one?
That one is definitely a good one for trivia.
For a yearâ€™s supply of footballs for the NFL, it takes 3,000 cows.
Holy cow.....holey  get it?
Aww come on now enough with the lameness. I need help.
Yeah I know you do! Ha ha
