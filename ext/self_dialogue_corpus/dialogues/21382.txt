Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just watched Doctor Strange on Netflix!
Oh, they have that?
Yep, I think they just got it recently.
Well, I think they have some kind of Marvel deal, so it makes sense.
I know. I love the Marvel movies, so I am glad Netflix gets a lot of them.
Me too! Which hero is your favorite?
Hmm, that is hard to say. Probably Thor.
Really? I am a huge Iron Man fan!
Yeah, Iron Man is pretty awesome. I just really like mythology.
I see. That makes sense then.
My favorite movie is probably Avengers, though.
I know! It was just so good.
So many heroes in one movie! Hard to dislike.
I really liked Captain America: Civil War because of that.
Me too! Spiderman was such a treat.
I am really excited to see his movie! I think it is coming out soon.
We should go watch it together! I think it comes out in July.
Okay! Sounds like fun.
Sweet. We will make plans later.
