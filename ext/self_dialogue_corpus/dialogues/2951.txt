They both should be pretty good, but the Patriots have shown no signs off slowing down.
You are right about that. They just don't quit.
Yea, well they some how seem to make the right trades and just moves in general.
Yea, they clearly know how to build a team.
They are consistently picking at the back of the draft, yet consistently find players that make plays.
It seems like every week, they have new players step up and make plays.
Yea, that could be due to how their pratice.
I agree, but whatever it is, it works.
I'm with you on that one. I just can never count out the Patriots.
Yea, I know what you mean. I just feel like eventually age will catch up.
Well, it always does at some point, but I'm not sure its ready yet.
Yea, we will find out.
Hopefully they Steelers will challenge the Patriots this year.
Yea, there aren't too many teams out there that can challenge them.
Yea, but they are one.
They sure are, but they have to stay healthy as well.
Yea and avoid suspensions. Both have been tough for them.
Yea, especially for Leveon Bell. The kid can't stay on the field.
Yea, he needs to learn to stay out of trouble.
I agree! He's too good to be doing silly stuff.
