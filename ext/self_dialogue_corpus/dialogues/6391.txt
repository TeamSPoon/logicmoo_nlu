Lady and the Tramp is one of my all time favorite movies.
Me too! What's your favorite part?
I love the part where Lady and Tramp are eating spaghetti and they kiss.
Aw, me too. It's so adorable.
It's so cute, and it's a classic scene.
I agree.
It's one of those moments in history that just always lives forever.
Yeah. Like Cinderella and the glass slipper.
They're just so adorable I want to hug them both.
I know the feeling.
