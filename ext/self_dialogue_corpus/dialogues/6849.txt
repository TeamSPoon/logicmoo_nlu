My daughter just loves the High School Musical movies.
They were pretty good.
I saw the three of them.
I only saw the first two.
Those kids in the movie are talented.
Yes, but how many high schools have that many good singers?
That's funny.
Funny but true.
Zack Effron pretty much got his start in that movie.
Yes, that was when he became popular.
