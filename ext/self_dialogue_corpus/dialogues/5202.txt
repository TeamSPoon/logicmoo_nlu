I think The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of Disney's scariest movies.
What? I loved the Nightmare before Christmas.
I think it's way too scary for kids.
I watched it as a kid and I might've been a little scared but it's not like I was scarred by it.
Didn't you find some of the characters to be a little unnerving, like the mayor or the doctor?
Well that's one of the main themes, is that things can be different but they don't necessarily have to cause fear.
How do you mean?
Well on halloween Jack is celebrated but when he tries to deliver Christmas presents he's met with fear.
I'd be afraid if he delivered my presents too! But the stop motion christmas scenes were pretty.
They were my favorite part!
