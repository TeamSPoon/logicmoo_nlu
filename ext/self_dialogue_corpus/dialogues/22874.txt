Have you seen any new movies lately?
I saw Logan recently.
How was it?
It was a great movie. It really showed a darker side to comic book characters.
Awesome, I really enjoy wolverine in the other movies, but I always thought he deserved to be potrayed diffrently.
Yeah, he is able to really show his violent and ignorance much more in this.
I think that sounds good! I just saw Wonder Woman the other day.
I want to see that, I've heard it's really good.
Yes, it was great. The actress did a wonderful job.
I think it's great to see a woman take the lead in a comic book movie.
Me too! She does amazing and portrays a really strong woman.
I think she will have a chance at a sequel.
We both seem to be comic book movie fans, that's for sure.
We should go see one sometime in the future... or we could watch Guardians of the Galaxey as I haven't seen it.
What! That movie is hillarious, it's just as funny as Deadpool.
Well I thought Deadpool was really funny, so I have high hopes for it now!
Okay we will have to get together soon and we can watch the first and second one.
That sounds like a plan! I'll bring snacks and we will have a movie day.
I'm looking forward to it.
Me too!
