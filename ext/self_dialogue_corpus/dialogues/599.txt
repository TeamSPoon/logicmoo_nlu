I saw highlights from Superbowl II last night.
That's a long time ago.
1968.
Who played?
Green Bay Packers against the Oakland Raiders.
The Packers were favored, I bet.
14 points.
Who was the announcer?
Ray Scott, with Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp.
How was the first quarter?
Low scoring.  3-0, Green Bay.
How about the second quarter?
Green Bay scored 13 and Oakland scored 7.
Who played at halftime?
The Grambling State University Band, again.
By the way, who were the quarterbacks?
Bsrt Starr for Green Bay,  Daryle Lamonica for Oakland.
What happened in the rest of the game?
Green Bay scored 10 in the third quarter and 7 in the fourth, while Oakland scored a touchdown.
Sounded a bit boring, if you ask me.
