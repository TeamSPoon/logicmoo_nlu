Are you excited to see the new star wars movie?
I am. I am not a huge fan of star wars, but I think it will be fun
really? I am super excited
Did you like the last movie?
Which one? Rogue one or the force awakens?
I was thinking about force awakens, but did you like both?
I liked both a lot. Darth Vader in rogue one was a badass.
really? I haven't seen rogue one.
Oh you should even if it is just for darth vader. It is a prequel to a new hope the first ever star wars movie
Like the old one?
Yeah it shows what happened just before that movie began.
Interesting I'll have to check it out
I am excited to see luke skywalker again.
Yeah we really didn't see him in the last movie
I know. We only saw him at the end of the movie for like a second
I wonder what they will do with Leia
Yeah that was tragic. I don't know if she will be in this movie
Maybe, but they will have to address it in the movie
They may CGI her
That or just mention her and try and bring her up in the next one.
