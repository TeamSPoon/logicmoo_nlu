Mam, let me stop you there.
Yes?
Is that a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey you're wearing?
Why yes it is. My spouse got it for me.
I just love the Steelers.
Me too. Welcome, nation.
Yes, indeed. Who is your favorite Steelers player?
I love Antonio.
Antonio Bryant? The wide receiver?
Yes, the wide receiver.
Wow, me too!
That's simply amazing.
How do you think they'll do this year?
I think they'll go to the playoffs but lose in the second round again.
Will they play Seattle again?
I hope so. I love those games.
I love them too.
We beat them in the Super Bowl a few years back.
Yes, my spouse and I celebrated for weeks thereafter.
Good times for the Steelers. Good times.
