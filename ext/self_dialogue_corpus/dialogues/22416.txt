Have you seen that movie from last year starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling?
La La Land?
Yes. Did you watch it?
Yes, I did! I watched it in the theater last year.
How do you like it?
As a jazz music lover, I really enjoy some of the musical pieces played. Did you watch the movie yourself?
Yes I did. I am really loving the musical numbers!
How do you feel about Ryan's and Emma's dance moves?
I feel like they can do better. But at least they did not suck at it!
Well, I think Emma's ability to dance is better than Ryan's at some of the scenes!
I cannot agree less.
How about their singing voices?
Well, nowadays there is auto-tune. So I am not sure we cannot judge it based on what we saw in the movie.
Hmmmm...good point. And how about Ryan's ability to play piano?
Did he really play the piano or was it a "double" playing?
Well there are some scenes in which, I felt that there are "glitch" around his wrists when he plays the piano. I think...
Really? I have to see that?
Well, I could be wrong. But again I am a skeptical one.
No, I understand where you are coming from.  As a piano player, there is a certain skill levels and years of practicing in order to do what his character does in the movie.
Do you know what? I will try to google it tonight and see whether it was CGI-ed.
