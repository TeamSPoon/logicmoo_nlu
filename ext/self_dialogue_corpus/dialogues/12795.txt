What's your opinion on the Star Wars movies?
Oh, well, overall I really enjoyed all the ones I've seen and would definitely rewatch them.
Which ones are those?
The first trilogy that came out plus The Force Awakens. There was something that bothered me in them though.
Oh?
Yeah, it seemed like every time a light saber was used it would affect the victim differently. One time it would cut right through somebody, then it would be propelling them back, then it would be making them simply disappear.
It's not the most realistic of movie series', I admit.
Oh I know, I just like consistency. Like, I don't care if something is wild and fantastical and doesn't make sense, as long as it doesn't make sense in a consistent way, know what I mean?
Yeah I feel you. I had my own issues with the inconsistencies myself.
You'll have to tell me about them sometime.
