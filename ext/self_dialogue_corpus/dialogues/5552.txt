So, who are some of your favorite animated male heroes?
Well, my favorite is probably Hercules.
Oh, that's a good choice. I loved Tate Donovan as his voice actor.
Another one is probably Aladdin.
I agree. The cast and music in that movie was incredible.
Who are some of your favorites?
Well, I'd have to say Hiro from Big Hero 6 is my favorite.
Yes, that's a good choice too. That movie is really good.
Do you know if they are going to make a sequel?
I'm not sure but I really wish they would. I would go see it definitely.
