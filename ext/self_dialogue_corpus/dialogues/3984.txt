Are any new thriller or horror movies coming out this week?
No not this week.
Well that's a bummer.
Yeah but that new movie Death Pool came out last week I think.
And what is that movie about?
I want to say that a young kid almost drowns to death during his childhood and when he gets older he has flashbacks of the event and he turns into a serial killer.
Well that sounds dramatic.
Ya I know. But hey, it does sound pretty exciting.
Do you want to go see it with me sometime this weekend?
Sounds good.
