Did you like disney's cinderella?
I did. I really love gus, the chubby mouse.
He was a cute character. Adorable voice.
The cat from that film was iconic to me too.
I think his name was lucifer, good bad cat name.
Ya  it was.. I loved when he walks across the floor with his muddy paws.
You feel so bad for cinderella there, but got to love how well it displays his character.
Agreed. I mean in the end she gets the prince and all is good.
True. Do you recall the song they dance to this is love? I think it is such a beautiful tune.
Yes, that was my friend's wedding song.
