What are your thoughts regarding the BET Music Awards?
I think it's a good showcase of talent. I like the variety of artist that they have.
People always look forward to the opening act, what did you think of that performance?
Bruno Mars was awesome. I'm one of those who looks forward to the opening act. He always gives the audience a show. He and his crew did a great job.
So now, I want to talk about two groups from the past. One have made a comeback and the other one is one the verge of a comeback. New Edition and Xscape
Yes, I saw them. I was excited to learn of the Xscape reunion. New Edition will always be my favorite and they still have the same moves.
How do you think Xscape did?
I think their performance was okay. To say they have been away for awhile and everyone was expecting the new Xscape to be just as great as the old Xscape was not fair to them.
So overall on a scale of 1-10, how did they do?
I'll give them a 6 and that's being generous. I think they should practice more and have more defined roles. They were kind of all over the place.
What are your thoughts on New Edition?
I still love New Edition. I have always loved New Edition.
Are you happy to see them back together?
I'm elated to see them together again. They still move and sing like they did way back in the days.
On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, what would you score their BET performance?
They would definitely get a 10. That performance had me in my living room trying to do the moves.
What was the best part of the performance?
I think the best part was the people from the movie coming and joining them. I loved how in tuned they were.
Compared to all of the other BET Music Awards shows, what do you rate this year's show?
I would probably give them an 8. Simply because music has changed tremendously and it evolving and they are still trying to figure it out.
