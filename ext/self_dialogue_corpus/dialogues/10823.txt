I watched Furious 7 again last night.
I can't believe that is the last we will see of Paul.
Yea, it was really unfortunate.
The movie paid tribute to him pretty well.
Yea, that end scene had me tearing up a little bit.
It was done really well and tastefully.
Yea, he will always be missed.
The movie itself was pretty good too.
Yea, I liked how it took place after the third movie.
It is nice how they were able to tie everything back together.
