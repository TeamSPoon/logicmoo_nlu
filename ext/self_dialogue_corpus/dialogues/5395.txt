Do you like the new Disney movies better, like Brave, or the older ones, like The Little Mermaid?
I like the older ones--the hand drawn ones. Sleeping Beauty is my favorite, but I really love all the old cartoon styles.
I loved that one! The drawings were so romantic and unique.
Another one like that is Alice in Wonderland. The way it looks is really different from anything else they ever did.
A lot of the older ones are like that. Fantasia has like six different drawing styles in it along, and you can tell the difference between each one.
So do you think the CGI looks more uniform? Like it's all the same from movie to movie?
Well, the CGI sure gets better in quality, right? You look at something like Chicken Little, it doesn't compare to how gorgeous Brave is.
Merida's hair looks like you could reach out and touch it. And yet they still make it look like a cartoon, you know--not just like it's trying to mimic live action?
I hear you. I guess while I like the hand drawn ones best, the CGI is its own art form.
I can't argue with that. Every movie they do expresses something special and takes a ton of time and effort to make it a special thing of its own.
