Did you see that there's a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
I know. I'm so happy they made another one.
I heard this was going to be the last one.
That's sad, but how long could Johnny Depp keep playing Jack Sparrow?
Forever! He's the kind of character that would still be great at 70.
Maybe. I do love Depp and Sparrow.
And it isn't like it is romance heavy.
True. Though at some point it has to end.
No, no it doesn't.
Yeah, you are right. Long live Jack Sparrow, even if he has to come back as a ghost.
