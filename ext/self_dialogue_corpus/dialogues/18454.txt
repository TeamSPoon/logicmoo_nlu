Do you like any songs by Tamar Braxton?
Yeah, I like Hot Sugar.
Me too. Did you see her performance to King on Dancing With The Stars?
Yes, I thought it was beautiful.
I agree. I just love that song.
Me too.
I just saw her new video for her song My Man.
Is it any good?
Honestly, it was ridiculous. Tamar is crazy sometimes.
Oh really? I've never seen any of her music videos before.
That's the only one I've ever seen, so I don't know if the other ones are crazy like that.
Did you know her husband has worked with Lady Gaga?
Seriously? What's her husband's name?
His name is Vince Herbert. You can see him sometimes on Tamar's show Braxton Family Values.
That's so interesting. I never knew Lady Gaga and Tamar were connected in some way.
I know. They are actually good friends.
It's always nice to see artists supporting each other.
I agree. It's so much better than when artists try to tear each other down.
I know. I'm getting sick of the Taylor Swift and Kanye West feud.
Me too. Why can't people just move on?
