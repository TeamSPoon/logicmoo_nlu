You're telling me that a healthy San Antonio or Houston couldn't at least make the series competitive?
Houston vs. the Cavs would have been a great series, they battled every time they played.
Cavs fans will be in for a rude awakening when they get to the finals and realize that the Warriors aren't the Celtics.
All I'm saying is that the Warriors aren't going to leave Kyle Korver open for 3 every possession.
The Cavs are way too explosive in offense!! Before the series I thought it'll be Cavs at 5 but now it is clear it will be over after 4 games.
The celtics are not ready yet and i think no one can doubt it. There are obvious lags in rebounding.
The Celtics need to draft Fultz and move Thomas while his stock is high.
But can you imagine Fultz AND Thomas together?
The NBA is way to predictable. They need to implement a hard cap with no luxury tax.
Your right, Spread the talent around create parity and make the NBA competitive.
The thing that kills me is that Cleveland fans forgets that Lebron abandon them to win a ring with another team.
Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, Pierce NEVER abandon their teams to win a title..THEY played against the BEST because they wanted to be known as the BEST.
As much as I love the NBA I'm starting to find the games unwatchable. There's just no competition.
I agree, but I will still continue to watch....I just hope they make some changes.
I know its based on the record but HOW was Boston a #1 seed.
A #1 seed should NEVER lose by 50 points....that just isn't fathomable.
Celtics are nowhere near as talented as the elite teams, yet accomplished a lot.
Of course though, no respect is given. Wait till we see who they draft.
The Celtics already got what they wanted this season: Got a first seed, Made it to conference finals and got the first pick in the draft.
I would say this was a success, the only thing better would be a ring.
