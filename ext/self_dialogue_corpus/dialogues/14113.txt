I know you're a Lady Gaga fan, but what's your favorite song?
Hmmm,  that's a tough question.  She has so many good ones.
Yes, I know.  But which one or two really stick out to you?
Okay, even though it may sound a bit lame, I'm going with Poker Face.
That's a not lame at all.  That would probably be my choice also.
It's just so catchy.  It's hard not to sing along when it comes on the radio.
Did you ever see the South Park episode that had Cartman singing it?
That was awesome!!! It might be one reason why hearing this song always makes me smile.
All right, now that we've established your first choice.  What's your second favorite song?
I'm going with Just Dance.  It's one of my favorite songs to run to with that great beat.
