What was your favorite movie from 2014?
My favorite movie was Whiplash.
Is that the one with J.K. Simmons playing a musical conductor?
Yes, it also has Miles Teller.
Why did you like the movie so much?
It tells the story of a journey to reach one's maximum potential.
Yes, I can relate to that as well, I just thought J.K. Simmons' character was too abusive towards his students.
I disagree, I think that his abusive attitude was necessary in order to weed out those who couldn't make the cut.
So are you saying he was the good guy in the story?
No, I'm saying that his character personified the extreme challenges that people face in every day life.
I see, so he was a necessary evil then?
Yes. Think about it this way, would Andrew have reached his maximum potential had it not been for his instructor Fletcher?
Well now that you put it that way, I can see what you mean.
Towards the end of the story when Andrew is finishing his improvisational drum solo, you can see Fletcher smile.
Yes, but I've heard that the ending might not have been so positive.
Indeed, the ending was totally up to personal interpretation. That's what was so beautiful about the movie.
I'll have to watch the movie again now.
You really should. It is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I remember hearing that it won 3 Oscars in 2014.
Yes, and all on a shoe string budget of only $3.3 million.
