What do you think about the Red Wings this year?
Datsyuk's departure doesn't bode well, but we'll see what happens.
Well they're supposed to build the new stadium!
Yeah, that will be cool.  It's going to be called the Olympia right?
Yep.  All shiny and new.  Big time development down there planned by the Mayor.
That's cool.  How good is this new guy Nielsen they're bringing in?
He's fast and he's a good shooter, we've already got some big guys in there as you know.
I think Franzen is the biggest enforcer we have right now.
Sheesh, I used to love Darren McCarty, he used to majorly enforce back in the day!
Yeah, he was cool to.  I saw him at Kid Rock's New Years Eve party smoking bud with the Kidster himself!
Amazing.  Good thing the police don't patrol the inside of clubs!
Yeah, really.  I'm glad they're still a good team and made the playoffs last season.
Me too.  Hopefully they can be number one again.
Yeah, that would be cool.  Respect Detroit!
Yeah, lol.  As long as the Illitch family owns the Wings, there's enough money to get some good players!
Yeah really.  It's so weird how these young guys have growth spurts after they're signed!
Yeah, one of the young guys grew like two inches since they signed him up!
I guess that's what happens when they draft kids who are just 18 years old!
Yeah, haha!  Then they've got guys who are almost 40 in the same team.
Well I guess they can be the ones with the steady hand, to guide the younger guys.
