This has been a boring day, not much to do!
I agree. Maybe we could watch some movies.
What kind of movies do you have in mind?
Anything would be fine with me.
Do you like 80s movies? I have a lot of those.
It depends, what kind do you have?
Have you ever seen Liscense to Drive?
I am not sure, who is in that one?
It has Corey Feldman and Corey Haim in it.
Those are two of my favorite actors from that era.
Yeah, they have great chemistry with one another.
I actually do not think that I have ever seen that one.
I think you would really enjoy it.
I sure hope so!
I'll bring that movie and one more that is newer.
Sounds good. What else do you have in mind?
How about the movie Shut In?
What is that one about?
It is a scary movie staring Naomi Watts.
Sounds good. I can't wait to watch them.
