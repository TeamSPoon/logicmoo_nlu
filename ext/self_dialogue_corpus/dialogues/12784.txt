Let's talk about The Force Awakens. Where does it fit?
You mean with respect to the other 6 films?
Yes, that's right. Where does it rank?
Let's take this piecemeal. First, it has to be better than the prequels.
Has to be better? All of the prequels?
The first two prequels were a total disaster. The third was solid, but still far more full of cheese and CGI than The Force Awakens.
Fair enough. So where does it rank with respect to everything else?
That's harder. First, it simply can't be as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.
Those are sacrosanct? Is it better than Return of the Jedi?
Ultimately, it isn't. It's solid, but Return of the Jedi has such important scenes that it can't rise above.
