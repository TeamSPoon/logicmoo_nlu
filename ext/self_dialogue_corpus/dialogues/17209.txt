What do you think of Fifty Cent?
His music career or movies?
Music mostly but just overall.
Well I liked his music I just wish he produced more.
What about his movie career.
He was an average actor at best nothing special.
I think he mostly got roles because of his reputation.
I agree but it was neat seeing him in them.
Yes it was.
What's your favorite or one of your favorite songs of his?
Most memorable had to be Candy Shop.
That was a catchy song.
What about you?
In Da Club
Loved that song and it was great for parties.
We used to dance to that all the time growing up.
I wish he would bring out a very good album one from the heart.
Like the old days?
Exactly, something from the heart.
I hope so too.
