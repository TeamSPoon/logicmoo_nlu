Did you see the Brewers are now in first place?
No, I didn't.  That's crazy!
Yes, they were supposed to be terrible this year.
All their players are young and unknown.
They are now 24-18.
Wow!
They have been hitting a lot of home runs, but their pitching still isn't great.
They still have Ryan Braun, right?
Yes, but he is actually hurt right now.
Really? And they are still doing that well?
Yes. It will be interesting to see if they can keep it up.
Baseball is a very long season.
Hopefully they will at least be in contention at the end.
Yes, that would be fun.
It makes the games much better to watch at the end.
I should start paying more attention to the Brewers now, I guess.
Yes you should.
Going into the season there was so much negativity I just figured they were going to be really bad.
Yes, not many people had confidence in this team.
Go Brewers go!
