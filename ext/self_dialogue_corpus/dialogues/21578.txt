Did you see Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them?
Yes, we saw that Saturday.
How do you like it as a Harry Potter movie?
It's not a Harry Potter movie.
What do you mean?
It's a Harry Potter universe movie.
Don't be like that. Answer me.
I liked it, and it's a fine magic movie, but it's infuriating for the same reasons as the previous ones.
Which are?
Why don't they use magic all the time?
They do?
No, they don't. Sometimes they jump and dive, other times they use "accio!".
So?
Well there's nothing that says when they can and can't, or why they wouldn't. It's never presented as draining or anything.
Maybe they just get tired or want to change things up.
That doesn't make sense though. Why fight and risk yourself when you can apparate and get a better position?
Eventually there would have to be a showdown.
Actually in this movie, Porpetina knew where Newt would apparate to. We've never seen that before.
Yeah that was a little unbelievable, even for me.
At least they name-dropped Dumbledore.
