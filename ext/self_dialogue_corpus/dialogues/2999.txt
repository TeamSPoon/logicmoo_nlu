How will the Raiders do this year?
They should win their division this year. Got better on defense and they got Lynch
You mean Gareon Conley? Is he out of trouble?
Don't haven't heard nothing about that yet.
Hope he is OK...
Yeah, but he needs to be in jail if that is true
I don't think he did that. Will give him the benefit of the doubt.
Yeah. He's pretty good though. At least he was at Ohio State
Messed up that they are moving to Vegas
It is what it is...business as usual
They would have to play at night, or in a dome
I personally think the town is not gonna support them
Why do you think that?
Too many distractions...know what I mean?
They have to offer more than casinos though
Don't know if that's enough though
We'll see. If the teams is any good, that will be a pretty hopping town.
Maybe...we'll see
So are they good enough to beat KC?
They'll catch them this year.
