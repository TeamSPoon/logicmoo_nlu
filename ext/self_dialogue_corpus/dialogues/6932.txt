So, what did you think of Frozen?
Oh, I liked it, especially from an artistic point of  view
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a bit of  CG buff myself, so I thought all the effects and animations was terrific!
Hey, neat fact, did you know in the original script Elsa was supposed to be the villain?
Yeah, I heard that.  I think it was because it was originally based on The Snow Queen story for Hans Christian Andersen, and the Queen's the villain in that one as well.
Now, as much as I liked the film there were a few things I would have changed.
Like what?
Well, I thought the Trolls were pretty pointless... they could replaced them with the characters getting info from a magic book and nothing would be different.
Ahhh.. but they were so funny!  "I grew a mushroom!"
