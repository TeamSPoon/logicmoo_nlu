Over the weekend, we watched The Little Mermaid.
I love that movie, its my favorite.
The girls loved to watch Sebastian and Ariel.
I loved that song "Under the Sea."
I loved Ariel's voice its so pretty.
I think Ariel was played by Jodi Benson.
I loved when Ariel left the sea to go find Eric.
My favorite character was Ursula the sea witch.
I loved that it had a happy ending.
Yes, Triton lets Ariel have legs and she goes to marry Eric!
