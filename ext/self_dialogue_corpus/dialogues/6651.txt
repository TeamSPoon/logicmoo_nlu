Are you going to see the Newest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie?
I am not sure, when does it come out?
It is out now, and it is supposed to be really good.
How many movies are there in that series?
I believe this is number 5, can you believe that?
A lot of people really like it, I wonder how many characters will be back?
I know that Johnny Depp will be in it, of course. I am not sure who else.
I wonder if it will be funny still, or if they have run out of jokes.
I think it will be really funny, especially with the monkey.
I don't know about the monkey, I guess I'll have to watch a trailer about it.
