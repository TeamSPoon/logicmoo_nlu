Do you do a Fantasy Football draft like this every year?
Yeah, or at least the last few. It's fun.
Hmm. I'm no good at these sorts of things.
Why not?
I'm just not knowledgable about football.
You could study!
Maybe. Last year I had one of my students help me pick.
Did that go well?
Awful.
Well, that's too bad.
It was still fun though.
I could give you some advice?
Okay. What've you got
Well, first, if you want to study, you should look at the statistics.
Any specific ones?
Just go team by team. Maybe start with the ones that made the playoffs.
Okay. That makes sense.
Yeah, just look at who was good last year and guess.
I guess I can do that. An NFL fantasy draft doesn't have to be intimidating!
It really doesn't!
