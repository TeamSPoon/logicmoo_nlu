Did you watch the movie Split?
I did and found it bizarre.
So its definitely a horror movie.
Yeah they did a good job with plot development
I was not a fan of the ending though
Alot of M Night's movies have bad endings
Yeah once they get to the twist it falls down
I am sure he has worked on that
But split specifically had a good ending, I think he developed that well.
I would agree but its still not his finest work.
