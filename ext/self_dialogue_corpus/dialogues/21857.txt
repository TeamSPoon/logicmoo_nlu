Have you seen any good movies lately?
I just saw the new Mummy movie.
With Tom Cruise?
Yep, for whatever reason, he is in it.
Did you like it?
It made no sense.
Why not?
Well, the old ones were great.
I agree, I seen all of them.
The new ones chose an aging actor.
So, he is still a good actor.
Not in this film.
Why not?
He just runs around. There is a mummy, no real plot.
I thought it would have been a good movie.
There is a lot of action, if you are into that.
I like action films and Tom Cruise, I am sure I might still like it.
There is no plot, at all. I could barely follow what was going on.
Was there at least a good villain?
The only thing scary about the mummy, was the fact their eyes looked like snakes.
