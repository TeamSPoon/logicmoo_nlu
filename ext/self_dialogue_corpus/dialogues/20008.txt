Have you heard Meshuggah's new album?
No.  What's it called?
It's "The Violent Sleep of Reason".  It came out last October.
Okay.  Have you heard it?
Oh, yeah.  I like most of the tracks on the album.
Really?  What does it sound like?
Well, it sounds like Koloss and Obzen, but more.. thrashy?
I get that.  What's you favorite track?
Oh, definitely Clockworks, for sure.  It's the first track.
Why is that you favorite?
It's an instant adrenaline rush for me; the song sets the tone for the entire album, and really gets you going.
I'll have to give it a listen sometime.
Definitely.  You'll also probably like Born in Dissonance; it's the second track of the album.
Why is that?
Well, Clockworks delivers really well on the instrumentals, but Jens Kidman kind of falls flat a bit on the vocals on the track.
I see.  And Born in Dissonance is better?
Definitely!  It's a tight, five-minute song that I have difficulty not listening to on repeat.
I'll have to give it a listen as well.  Really, the entire album is something I'll have to look into.
Definitely.  I really think you'll enjoy it if you've enjoyed any Meshuggah album over the last few years.
Cool.  Thanks for the recommendation!
