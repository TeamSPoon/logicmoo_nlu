Have you been keeping up with cavs they did amazing against the celtics.
Nah i have not had a chance to watch that game.
Do you got it prerecorded or something?
Most definitely i did.
Good it is a game you do not want to miss it is honestly the best one i have seen for them this season.
Is it? How good was it?
They wrecked the celtics like they were nothing i have never seen anything like that.
You have not before?
Yes it was like a storm and they were the storm itself.
Now you are making me want to watch the game more now.
It is all thanks to Lebron he is the mighty hand of the Cavs.
I mean lebron is good without a doubt but..
But what? he is the reason the team is succeeding.
The whole team is responsible for it because they are a collective whole..
I mean they help but they need their star player and he is the star player.
That is true he is the star of the show and is the most well known.
Exactly he is the face of  the team and the best on it hands down.
I mean he is the best but by a very small margin.
Name me one player who is almost as good.
I would say Chris is pretty amazing on the team to be honest.
