Do you know Adele?
I think everyone knows her through her song hello
I think she got the most grammies for her new album
She bit the lemonade album by Beyonce.
Well in my opinion Adele's album is better
i agree though there some songs in lemonade i really liked
True that, i personally liked formation.
i prefer dady issues
well speaking of the best albums Ed Sheran is now on top of the game
Oh yes, his songs are so famous.
Oh i love his songs too.
ok guys speaking of trendy songs despacito has to make the cut.
I think that song is the most trending song this month.
I love that song.
Have you guys heard privacy by Chris Brown
I heard the song, i think its cool.

Is he the one who sang loyalty?
No thats Kendrick Lamar.
But Chris does have an album named loyalty.
