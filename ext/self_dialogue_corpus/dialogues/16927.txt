Have you heard of Metalica?
Yes, who hasn't?
Well to be honest you would be surprised how many people don't know about Metalica.
I think most people have heard them they just don't know it.
Yeah James Hetfield has a very distinguishable voice.
I still remember when I was kid getting my first electric guitar, the first thing I did was learn how to play fade to black.
Lars was always my favorite if I had to pick.
His drumming is amazing, I don't think there is a more well rounded rock drummer in history.
How many bands careers span decades?
Not many.
Right? Most die within 5 or 10 years if they are lucky.
Somehow Metalica has made it for years and still sells records.
I still think there is never going to be another rock group like Metalica.
Its as if that genre has died.
If a new artist could come out with the same raw and unique sound as Metalica I think they would explode.
I agree, the world is dying for some new and fresh sounds.
All of the stuff they do today is so cookie cutter and stale.
I don't even listen to the radio anymore because theres nothing on it I like.
Theres a few modern rock artists I don't mind but nothing I'm married to.
I think there will be a new band with as big of an impact as Metalica, it just can't be predicted when they will come.
