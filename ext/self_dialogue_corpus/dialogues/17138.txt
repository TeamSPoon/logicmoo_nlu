Well I love live music.
Oh okay.
Yeah it's great for me.
What is it about live music that you like?
I love the atmosphere and how alive it feels.
That's true the atmosphere at a concert is second to none.
I agree completely.
Who are some bands that you've seen live?
I saw Radiohead recently.
How was that?
They put on an incredible show.
I bet they did, I would love to see them.
If you ever have the chance I say go for it.
