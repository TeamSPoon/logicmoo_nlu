You will never guess who I am listening to these days?
No idea who?
Nirvana...I started with Teen Spirit and then had to watch all the documentaries on Curt Cobain.
Yeah, those are pretty good. He was a genius in his way.
Yeah, the music just speaks to me. I know everyone says that about the music of the their time.
Look at the Beatles. I hate them. With their sing song music....they were not that great.
Agreed! Give me Queen any day any hour!
Now, that's some music. So much depth and creativity. We are the Champions, We will Rock You, not to mention the soundtrack to the Higlander!
I know! And Fat Bottomed Girls...who else could get away with that! It probably made people who had no interest in opera think twice.
Freddie Mercury's voice was incredible. I could only imagine what he could do today.
I know. Another great lost. Still not a fan when Niravana was big. I am now.
That's funny you're so late to the game.
I know that's me! I went through a summer listening to the Byrds and bunch of 70's bands in the late 80's.
There's some good stuff in there. I like it too. It's all ballad-y and chill.
Yeah, I just go through these phases of music. I also like this group called Hammock.
What do they do?
Hammock is a two member ambient-rock band from Nashville. I kid you not there is description for that.
There are so many sub-groups to describe bands and their music. That's a new one on me.
These guys are really good. Kind of mellow when you want something in the background.
Sounds good to me I'll have to see if I can find them.
