Tell me about some star wars movies you like.
I really like the third one.
Oh really? That is a movie that not a lot of people actually like.
Well I like it.
Why do you like it?
Because it shows the development of Anakin to the dark side.
Wasn't it sad when Padme died?
Oh yeah that was so sad.
Well it was nice talking to you!
Same to you!
