Why do you think Nickelback is so hated?
I think people think their music sounds all the same.
I kind of like them. I think all bands face that to some degree.
I think it became cool to hate Nickelback.
So people hate Nickelback because people hate Nickelback?
Pretty much, it hasn't stopped them from being popular, though.
I agree, I think everyone secretly knows all the words to Rock Star.
That song is probably the epitome of why they are hated, it's about selling out.
I always liked their first album.
Some of the songs are dumb, though, like Photograph. "how did our eyes get so red and what the hell is on Joey's head? "
