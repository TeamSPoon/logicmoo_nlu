Everything going good for you?
Just keeping busy.
Me too. Had any down time?
I have a little. Been trying to fill it.
My down time I watched some movies.
Oh yeah, like what?
I just saw some old movie about a Princess, Princess Bride.
The best movie ever. What you think of it?
It was not what I thought it would be.
So, you liked it
It was an amazing film. I liked the score.
The music is really perfect in that movie.
Made me feel like I was part of the fairy tale.
It is one of the best sort of funny but touching movies I have ever seen.
I liked the way the music was serious.
The full orchestra and so on?
Yes! The classical scoring, so fitting.
The show I think reflected that. The serious and the silly all in one.
I love movies that take me on an adventure like that.
I like when that adventure has good music too.
