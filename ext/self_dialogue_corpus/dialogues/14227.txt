Which of Lady Gaga's songs impacts you the most?
In what sense?
Emotionally.  Which song impacts you emotionally?
I'd have to say it's "Million Reasons."  There's just so much pain and anguish in that song, but also so beautiful.
I really like that song too.  Though I personally feel that there isn't much to that song outside of the chorus.
That's a good point.  But once she starts belting out those notes, all else is forgiven.
She has such a powerful voice.  It gives me chills.
Did you know it debuted at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100?
That doesn't surprise me.  I believe in total, she has had 24 songs total make it onto Billboard Hot 100.
That is truly impressive, and speaks volumes about her talent.
