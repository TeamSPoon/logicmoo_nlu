Do you know much about the history of baseball?
Not really. Baseball really isn't my thing.
How can you not like baseball?
Well, every time I'm forced to go to a game, everything feels the same every play, unless someone hits a homerun or something.
There's a lot more to baseball than hitting the most homeruns, and if you understood that, you'd be a lot more engaged while you watched.
Well, enlighten me.
First of all, baseball is a game that takes an investment of knowledge to enjoy watching.
What does that mean? That doesn't sound very fun.
It's like food. You can eat food and not really think about it, or you can learn about food and gain a pallette and suddenly your world is blown wide open.
So it would be worth it for me to learn more about baseball?
Definitely, because once you understand different batters' strengths and weaknesses, and you know the pitchers as well, their game becomes much more exciting.
Isn't it just throwing the ball and trying to hit it over and over again?
No! The pitchers know the batters, and know how they hit. And the batters know the pitchers, and know how they throw. And then it becomes an exciting duel!
I'd rather just watch professional wrestling and see people get thrown around.
You're unbelievable! Here, we're going to a baseball game right now!
I can't, I have to watch my kid while my wife is out. We could turn on the TV and watch a game though.
Do it! I'll walk you through every detail, and you'll love it by the end of it. I haven't even talked about the pitcher getting tired yet.
Sound great. You grab some beers out of the fridge and I'll get the TV warmed up.
Hey, I'm back with the beer! Wait, where'd you go?!
I'm running out of the house to get away from you and baseball!
