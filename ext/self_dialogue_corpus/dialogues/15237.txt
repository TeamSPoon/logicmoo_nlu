Question for you, who do you think was more talented Michael Jackson or Prince?
I'm not really sure, I've got mixed feelings on it.  They were both amazing.
I agree, but overall, I think Prince was more talented.
I can see your line of thinking, but I'm going to have to say Michael.
See, that's what I thought at first too, he definitely has more hits.
Yeah, everyone knows his songs.
But, I think overall, Prince was more talented.
Why do you say that?
Well, he tears it up on guitar, had one of the best voices in Music, and he wrote a lot of his stuff.
That's true, so I guess on talent he does have one up on Michael.
Even though he's more talented, I think I'd still rather see Michael Jackson in concert.
That would be awesome, I'm sad it'll never happen.  I think there's only one other band I would rather see then him.
More than Michael? Who?
Queen.
I don't know how I didn't think about them!  Good call.
Freddie Mercury had the best voice in Rock, and seeing videos they put on an amazing show.
Yeah they did, what's your favorite queen song?
Probably Bohemian Rhapsody.
Mine too.  We will rock you is a classic too.
Can't argue with you on that.
