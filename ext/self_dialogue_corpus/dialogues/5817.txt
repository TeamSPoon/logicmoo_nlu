My favorite character in Finding Nemo is Mr. Ray.
He is awesome. I like how they made him the teacher.
That is why I like him so much. His wings make him a natural protector for the little ones.
My favorite part is in Finding Dory, when Dory insists that Mr. Ray wants her to be the assistant.
I liked it when Mr. Ray was teaching them about migration, and Dory kept echoing him.
It was so cute when the one asked Dory where did she grow up.
Especially when she went off tangent to tell them what happened when mommies and daddies got together.
That was one lesson Mr. Ray was quick to interrupt.
Everything comes back to the undertow.
It plays such an important part in both Finding Nemo and Finding Dory.
