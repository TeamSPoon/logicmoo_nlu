What's your favorite type of horror film?
I like the home invasion thriller.
I thought you liked all those big slasher and ghost films.
Not anymore.
What changed?
I don't like things I can't believe in. Ghosts, spirits, exorcisms, and so forth aren't real. So I can't believe in them.
So why home invasion?
Because I'm now a home owner and it's a legit fear and can happen. It's something I can relate to.
You enjoy thinking about your home being invaded?
No, I just like horror movies and this type strikes close to home.
