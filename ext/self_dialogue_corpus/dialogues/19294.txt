Hey! Did you hear Megadeth was in town last night?
I didn't! Did they play a good show?
It was awesome. The guitar solos were insane.
That's crazy! Did they play songs off the new album?
Sure did. And some from Rust in peace as well.
that sounds awesome. We're any other bands there?
Yup! Meshuggah opened up for them.
I've never heard of that band.
They're from Sweden but they really know how to play.
Will Megadeth make a new album?
They just came out with one so I'm not sure.
I liked their song Peace Sells.
Yeah that one is one of their biggest hits.
I hope I can see them in concert some day.
They should be coming back in the next year.
Do you think they will play The Mechanics?
They mght! You never know what they will play.
I really like the song the Mechanics.
That one is good. They did not play it last night though.
Bummer, maybe they will next year.
