What was your favorite era of horror films?
Wow that's tough, The 80's probably with the 70's and 50's close behind.
The 80's had so many gems.
It absolutely did, Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th, even some of the early Halloween sequels.
Yeah and Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, that alone wins it for me.
They are the not so holy Trinity of horror characters in my mind.
Would have to agree there my friend, even though some sequels we're pretty maligned.
Make as many films as all three of those characters have and there's bound to be a few stinkers
Oddly enough even the less harealded films were still enjoyable.
Yeah can't go wrong with classic horror movies.
