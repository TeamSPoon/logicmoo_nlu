Son"ja is the best artist in the world.
you are so right. I love Son"ja .
What is your favorite song by Son"ja ?
The best one to me is She gee do wha
Oh yeah that song is something else.
She broke a record for the most cuss words in one song.
Son"ja was telling a story on how her man broke her heart.
That song is a powerful song and you can feel her pain.
I also love every track on her cd.
You meant the "2wenty Years" Cd ?
Son"ja's one and only.
I loved the 2wenty years into call the same as the cd.
I do to it is so much melody in that song.
is it done in accapella ?
I think it is
Do you like the song called "4u"

My son like the teddy bear song
Me, my teddy bears and my pillows
Yes the kids love it
