Do you know what the first movie was I saw in the Drive In Theatre?
What?
Herbie Rides Again.
Is that the Disney movie about the car?
Yes it is.
Wow, how old were you?
I was eight and the whole family went to see it.
A VW Beetle that can talk.
I know right, but it was a cute idea.
They were good movies back then.
