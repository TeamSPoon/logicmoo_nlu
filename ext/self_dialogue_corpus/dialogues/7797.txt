You think butterbeer is actually beer?
Of course not.  They would never sell that to children.
Then why do they call it that?
It is a catchy name.
That doesn't answer my question though.
I'm pretty sure it talks about why it's called that in first or second movie.
It's a shame they didn't let the kids go into town more than they did.
Maybe they could have butterbeer in a can.
I doubt they'd let them take that into Hogwarts.  It would be illegal.
Everything Harry did at Hogwarts was illegal!
