What did you think about the Rebel Alliance?
They were more than just a group of guerilla fighters
Rogue One showed how organized they had become even though there was still a senate
The number of ships they had and the size of them shows how much support they had
It would be interesting to know how they got their funding
You assume the Empire was funded by taxes. But the rebel's government support was questionable
Alderaan must have supported the rebels.
The base on Hoth and on Yavin seemed to be far from civilization
It is likely the Death Stars cost more than all of the other ships the Empire had put together
The rebels made better decisions with their money
