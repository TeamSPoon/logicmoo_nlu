Were you a fan of Sean Combs?
You mean who used to be Puff Daddy?
Yes that's him. Do you know why he changed his name?
I'm not sure, maybe legal reasons?
Possibly, I'm not sure though.
He's always had great music though.
Yes, remember that one song "I'll Be Missing You."
Yes that song was so sad but beautiful.
It was a tribute to Biggie Smalls when he was killed.
You're right. They were pretty tight I think.
