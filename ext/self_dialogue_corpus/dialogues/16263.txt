What's your favorite music genre?
For me it's metal hands down and then I guess classical music.
Now that's a weird line of preference.
I wouldn't think that, because if you listen to some metal songs they have a lot of similarities to classical music.
What makes you say that?
It's just how many different instruments that can get used within the metal genre that are classical instruments.
Do you have any examples of this?
I would say that Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword is a pretty good example.
What an interesting band name. Where is the band from?
It's an Italian symphonic power metal band.
Symphonic power metal? Such a thing exists?
You would be surprised at how many different sub genres exist within metal.
So metal isn't all with screaming vocals?
No far from it, some of the best singers I am familiar with are metal singers. I believe some of them would put pop singers to shame.
I would like to see that.
I'm sure there are metal bands that have done covers of pop songs.
When you mention it I think I stumbled over Children of Bodom when they covered Oops I did it Again.
That's one hilarious cover, shows us that they don't take themselves too serious.
It's refreshing to see that not all bands take themselves super serious.
Just a shame they don't earn the same kind of money as those pop stars.
