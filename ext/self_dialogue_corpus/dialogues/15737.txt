what is the first album you ever bought with your own money
I saved for a long time and bought Kiss Alive
really, how old were you
about 8 I think
that is kind of young for Kiss isn't it
I suppose it was but I still wanted it
wow did you like it
I did I loved it
what was your favorite song on it
I did not have a perticular favorite, I just remember I had never heard a live album before
oh wow I guess not
I remember all of the solos on there drums, guitar, etc. I was like nothing I had ever heard before
I always liked Cold Gin from the album
you know the album was a 2 album set
yes I know
of course the classic Rock and Roll All Night
that song is used so much in movies and stuff
Who was your favorite Kiss member
ALways Peter Criss
I always loved Ace
