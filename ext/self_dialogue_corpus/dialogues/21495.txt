Heya, did you see Hidden Figures?
Of course I did! I wanted to work for NASA basically my entire life.
I haven't seen it yet! How did you like it?
Amazing! Revolutionary! It's so rare we have women at all leading movies, much less women of color.
I know! It's about three black female rocket scientists, right?
It is! We know about the men who went into space, but the women behind the launch?
Not the story in our history textbooks.
Not the ones we grew up with! I think this movie might add some new characters to our books.
Did the movie win any awards?
It was nominated for three Oscars, but didn't win any. But it did win a SAG award!
Which award was that?
I think it won Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture?
Sounds like it deserves an Oscar, though! How was the acting?
The leads were all terrific! Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon√°e will go down as legends.
Where does the movie take place?
I think it was filmed in Atlanta, but it's set at the Langley Research Station in Hampton, Virginia.
It takes place in Virginia? You know I'm from Norfolk?
Really? You have to see this now! They even use Virginia license plates.
A movie about women in science--especially one that takes place in Virginia? So cool.
So cool.
