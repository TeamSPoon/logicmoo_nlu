Do you follow basketball?
Not as much as I used to. What about you.
I watch as many games as I can, including college and professional.
Yeah? Well, I usually check out the scores, but don't really watch many games. Whose you favorite pro team?
I grew up in California, so I always root for the Lakers.
Me to. They've had some great teams and great players over the years.
I know they usually come up with some great player combinations. Remember when they had Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
That was a great combo. You can talk about your Jordans all you want, but I love to watch Baylor play.
He was really something. He used to actually get hangs time when he went to the basket.
Hang time? What do you mean by that?
For some reason if he and another player jumped at the same time, he seemed to stay up in the air longer and it gave him an advantage.
Oh. I didn't realize that, but he was fun to watch. My favorite was Magic Johnson.
I know, he just had a way of controlling the whole game.
He did. He was a winner. There's just something about some players. They just have a way of winning no matter what.
Right. Did you ever play much basketball.
Nope. I'm too short, and I don't jump very well. Maybe that's why I don't follow the game all that closely.
Yeah. Basketball is made for tall people. Wouldn't it be great if they had a league with a height limit? Nobody over six feet.
Then they could lower the basket so that six footers could dunk.
It's interesting to think about. Do you think you would play more then?
Nope. I'm still too short.
