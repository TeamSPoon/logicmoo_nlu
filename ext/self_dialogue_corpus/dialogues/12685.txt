Hi are you excited for the upcoming Star Wars movie? The last Jedi?
Yes, I am a Star Wars fanatic! It comes out this December 2017. Right?
Yes it will be! Who would you be very interested to see in this movie?
Our Princess Leia. She will be a GENERAL Leia now.
Wait, the Carrie Fisher's character? I thought she passed away?
She passed away. But she managed to complete her work for the movie prior to her death.
I still feel bad. She was such a good actress.
I agree. Who would you be interested to see in this movie?
Maz Kanata played by Lupita Nyong'o. She is an awesome actress.
I agree! Lupita is pretty and talented!
