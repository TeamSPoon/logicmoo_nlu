What is your favorite genre of music?
I would go with Hip hop.
Ok thats not mine but I still like it.
I think Kendrick Lamar is the best in the genre right now.
I listened to his last record, not too bad.
His vocal delivery is on point.
He does rap about stuff that is relevant.
Yeah like he uses a ton of different beats as well.
Do you think hes the best in the last 10 years?
He could be.
Not Kanye West?
I think Kanye is very talented but not the best.
Thats amazing, I thought he was beloved by all.
I think his raps got weird. An entire album of auto tune?
I think he was being experimental.
I mean theres being experimental, and then theres that.
I dont think theres anything wrong with exploring.
Me neither but this was terrible.
He improved on the last record
It was OK but nothing like College Dropout
