Do you think the Cubs can repeat this year?
I doubt it. It's hard to repeat.
Yeah, I don't think so either. They lost Chapman and some of their starting pitching isn't as good.
And baseball teams don't really repeat championships very often.
I think the Nationals might make it to the World Series, but I don't know that they win it.
It's so early in the season that it doesn't matter what the Nationals are doing right now. They always fall short.
It could be the Dodgers, but it's kind of the same thing with them too.
Yeah, but someone new has to break through.
I just hope it isn't the Cardinals again.
Or the Giants, but I don't think we'll have to worry about them.
What about the American League?
I don't know. I don't follow the AL as much as the NL.
The Yankees are surprisingly good so far.
I know. They finally have some young talent.
And they have Chapman back to save games like he did for the Cubs.
There's a lot of good teams in the American League right now.
You're right. The Orioles and Astros should be right there.
And don't forget the Indians.
Yeah, they came so close last year.
It's going to be a good season in both leagues.
