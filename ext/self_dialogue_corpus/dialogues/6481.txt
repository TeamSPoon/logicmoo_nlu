Who's your favorite Disney prince?
I'm not even sure I can think of any of the princes' names.
Yeah, they don't get as popular as the princesses do.
That's true.  I did like Prince Charming.
Yeah, always a classic to go with the guy from Cinderella.
He always wore such formal clothes.
Any other princes that you liked?
What about the one from Princess and the Frog?
Oh, I can't even think of his name.
Didn't he spend half the movie as a frog?  That's probably why we can't remember him.
