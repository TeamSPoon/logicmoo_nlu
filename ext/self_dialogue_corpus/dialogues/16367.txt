What do you think of Poets of the Fall?
I'm not familiar.
Sure you are, they did the in-game music for Alan Wake.
Oh, they're the Old Gods of Asgard?
Yeah, that's the name they went by in the game.
What else have they done?
They did a big cover of "You Know My Name" a while back.
Oh, the James Bond song, yeah.
Yeah, too bad about Chris Cornell.
May he rest in peace.
Yes, but anyways, they did that, and before that they also did a song for Max Payne 2.
So it sounds like they do a lot of game music.
Well, just the two, but they've been around since 2003 or so, and have released several albums since then.
I see. Where are they from?
Finland, actually, like Nightwish.
I have heard of Nightwish. Are they similar?
Not really. Nightwish has more of a orchestral, harmonic metal sound similar to Within Temptation though a bit harder edged. While Poets are more alt or prog rock.
Okay, I did not understand any of that, but it sounds good!
Just listen to Twilight Theater or Revolution Roulette. I think those are their best albums. You might like them.
Well, alright, if you insist. I'll try to look for those on Spotify at some point.
