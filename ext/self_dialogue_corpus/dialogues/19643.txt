Good Morning.
Hello.
How are you.
Not bad.
Good.
How are you?
Good.
Cool.  We're supposed to talk about music.
Yeah that's right.
Okay, who was the best band you ever saw?
Like saw play live?
Yeah.
I saw Kings of Leon play a while back.
Oh nice I like those guys.
I didn't really know much about them before.
Did they put on a good show?
Yeah it was a blast.
I bet.  I've always wanted to see them live.
You would love it.
I'm sure I would.
