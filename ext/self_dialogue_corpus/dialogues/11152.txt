What do you think are some new fashion trends this spring?
I think rompers and bright paisley patterns are in style this season!
I have just the perfect paisley dress sitting in my closet. What about skirts?
Maxi skirts, especially in dark colors, are all the rage!
What should I pair a maxi skirt with?
For the best look, a maxi skirt should be paired with a shorter, well-fitting top.
Which style of shoes are in this season? I love my Louboutins to death!
Stilettos will always be popular. But chunky heels are making a come back.
Thank goodness! What about accessories? I've got this lovely gold chain.
Gold chains aren't as popular, but chokers are. Usually they're made out of plastic or leather.
I've never worn a choker before. I'll have to go buy one!
I own a few chokers. They're all beautiful. Now onto bags!
Yes! I love purses of any and every kind. What's couture this season?
This year, big, oversized bags are all the rage!
Thank god, I have so much stuff to carry with me I usually end up using a tote anyway!
Yep. Now let's talk about the backbone of a wardrobe: jeans.
Are skinny jeans still in style?
They always are. This season we recommend a high-waisted, dark wash jean.
What about tops?
Some popular tops are crop tops and the classic white tee.
