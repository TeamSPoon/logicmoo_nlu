Who's the second best coach in the NFL?
That's an odd question.
Well it's because we all know who the best is.
Yeah, I guess you're right about that.  The Hoodie all the way.
Well I'm going to go with Mike McCarthy.
Yeah, he's been to a lot of playoffs.
Tied with New England for longest streak.
Yeah, that's good company.
Plus I think New England has more talent.
I can see that.  Green Bay finds a way to go deep every year even when they have a tough start.
They do.  Who else do you think is good?
Andy Ried has been good.
Yeah he has.  Talk about coaching with nothing.
Yeah, KC is just pretty solid and well coached.
Mike Tomlin too.
Yeah, Steelers always seem to be in the thick of things.
What about Pete Carroll.
Obviously he's been good.  Been to a couple Super Bowls recently.
Yeah, a lot of that was coaching.
And a good defense.
