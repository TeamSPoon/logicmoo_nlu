I heard Cars 3 is releasing soon.
Yes, I read about it online.
I wonder how does the story take you in the latest flick.
Well, it sure will be full of humor and life lessons.
Any idea whether they are adding any new characters to the story?
I remember reading they are adding a new race car named Cruz Ramirez
What does Cruz do in the movie?
Well, obviously must be around to help McQueen.
Do you think it will be better than the previous two instalments?
I sure hope so and wish the movie does well.
