Hey I just watched that new Guardians movie.
Really? Me too, what you think of it?
It was good, but the music was the best.
Yes! That movie had the best soundtrack.
The last one did too, the first one.
I think it may have been better. Which one had better music to you?
The second one. They seemed to have more songs you know, really had some good dance numbers.
I would watch it again just to hear the music.
I love when the song fits the scene, you know?
I liked Groot dancing, perfect imagery, in the first scene of the movie.
There is a scene in Xmen First class, with Quicksilver.
Where he saves people while wearing headphones?
That is the one. It was one of those movie moments where the music fit so well.
That whole scene was just amazing.
I liked the movie. I felt they really did it well, putting the feel of the time in it.
I think the new Xmen have a lot of potential.
I can not wait to see the new ones.
How cool would it be if they had some of the songs of the 80's in it?
Like Love is a Battlefield?
Yes! Some real eighties feel songs, you know?
