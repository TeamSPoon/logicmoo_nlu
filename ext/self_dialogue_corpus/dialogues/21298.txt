So, what do you think of the Transformers movies?
You know, I thought the first wasn't too bad, and the second had some decent action scenes, but then after that, the last too REALLY went downhill.
How so?
I mean, they were just WAAAY too long for starters, especially part 3.  It was like, what nearly three hours I think?
I think like two and half, but yeah...
And they just pretty much recycled the same plot over and over "So BIG thing is threatening everyone, oh no!" And I've just never really liked the way the Transformers have looked.
What do you mean?  I thought some of them looked pretty cool.
Well, a lot of them it's just like they got too many gears and extra crap on them, and the action is paced so bad it's hard to tell who's doing what to who.
Yeah, it does get kind of confusing sometimes.
Not to mention with how little characterization any of the characters are given it really makes it hard for me to care about anyone.
What you mean you didn't care Shia's character?
Actually, I think I wanted him to die a few times during the first three films.
Do you think Mark Walhberg was an improvement?
Uh... I don't know.. wasn't really much there.  And it's Wahlberg.  I mean, he can be good if given the right role, but here's it's like "Guys.. I'm an inventor! I invent stuff!"  Yeah, sure, pal...
Hahaha.
And then there's that whole scene where his daughter's boyfriend goes on and on about how he can legally bang her because of the "Romeo and Juliet" law.. it's like what??
Yeah, that kinda... weird..
I mean, just make the character 18 and we can still have her father and her boyfriend fighting w/o all the creepy subtext.
Weird how Michael Bay seems know so much about that law, huh?
Well, I've heard some rumors...
