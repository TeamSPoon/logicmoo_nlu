Who do you think is the worst NFL team?
Haha, that's a loaded question.
That's understandable, it's based on the season, right?
Yeah. Like the Raiders was horrible one season, and then they got Carr and just look at them now.
Yep. But I think the Browns have been very bad.
Haha, yeah, they can't pick out a proper QB.
What ever happened to RG3 and everyone else.
Yeah, both of their defense and offense are just horrible.
Yeah didn't they have an all lost season the year before that?
Nope they won one game to not have the worst season ever.
Have anyone ever gone 0-16?
Yeah the Lions in 2008.
Oh yeah! But they turn around now.
Yeah, they've been playing much better. Though, I still can't forget that game where Aaron Rodgers throw that Hail Mary and beat them.
Yep, that was heart-broken.
Anyway, who do you think is the worst team?
I would have to go the Browns or the Jacs.
Oh yeah, leave it to Florida to have 3 teams and still suck.
Haha quality over quantity, am I right?
Yes sir.
