Hey! I'm in the mood to see a good thriller movie tonight, any recommendations?
Oh! Definitely check out Alien: Covenant - it's excellent, really well done, and seriously scary.
Really? I'm not a huge fan of the Alien franchise, though I'm open to reconsider. What did you like so much about this one?
Well, for one thing, it's got Billy Crudup in it, playing Christopher Oram, the first mate of the Covenant. He's really good - the movie's worth seeing for him alone if you like Billy Crudup.
I do like Billy Crudup. Okay, I'm interested. Any other good cast members?
Well, I'm not a huge fan, but Michael Fassbender is really good in the movie, playing David 8 and Walter, these android characters. He's really good, and it's interesting fare!
Oh, I do love Michael Fassbender. He's such an interesting actor.
He is in this, certainly. Also, the movie's got Katherine Waterston as "Danny," an expert in terraforming. The character is really smart, I think she ups the quality of the movie in general.
Hm, I've never heard of her, but this sounds like a movie that could probably keep my interest. I do like science fiction thrillers in general, so I'm going to give this a try.
Hooray! I hope you enjoy it. Who knows, maybe you will turn out to be an Alien fan after all!
