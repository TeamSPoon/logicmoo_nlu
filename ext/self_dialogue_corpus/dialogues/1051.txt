What do think of the controversy over the Washington NFL's team's nickname?
That gets political and I don't like to talk politics, but I do get a kick out of team names.
How so?
Well, like how they don't always make sense--like the Utah Jazz.  Utah and jazz?
Well, that's because the team moved from New Orleans--I don't know why they didn't change the name, but that's basketball.  Any NFL names that amuse you.
Well, most of them make sense, but what about the Buffalo Bills--are the named after Buffalo Bill Cody?
And the Houston Texans--what creative genius came up with that?
We could have the San Francisco Californians.
And the Seattle Washingtonians.
And then there are the New Orleans Saints
Whats wrong with that--maybe related to music and New Orleans and "When the Saints Come Marching In".
I don't know--are you intimidated by a team of Saints?
I guess you wouldn't be too fearful of the Dolphins either.
Well, they are big and they relate to Florida, so I'll give that one a pass.
What about the New England Patriots?
Well, a patriot seems more like a concept than a mascot, but that's not what bothers me about that team name.
What does?
New England--that's not a city; it's an area.
You're right--every other team belongs to a city.
Yeah, I'm going to the game; where do I go; oh I don't know--New England.
