Hey, I got a cool fact.
What's that?
Can you guess how many movies Disney has made in total?
In total? It has got to be alot.
Yeah, it is, but can you give a ballpark estimate?
I don't know, maybe three a year for the past seventy years. So like 210?
That's not a bad guess. From the information I just read online, they have made at least 161.
Wow! I wonder how many of those I've seen.
Yeah, I've probably seen two or three new Disney movies for each year of my life. So probably around fifty.
That sounds right. I hadn't realized how many I had seen until you pointed that out.
