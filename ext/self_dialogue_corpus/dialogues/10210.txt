Do you think the new Transformers movie will be good?
I dont think so because the cast is terrible
It wasnt that good when Shia was still doing them
Yeah the acting fell of on Dark Side of the Moon
It wasnt that bad of a movie
But the special effects are great.
Sometimes I get lost in fight scenes with that franchise.
I know what you mean you cant tell what transformer is what
Yes and sometimes the voices I forget
All in all though the franchise isnt THAT bad just has taken a turn for the worse
