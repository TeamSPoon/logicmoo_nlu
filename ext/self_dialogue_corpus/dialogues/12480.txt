It's hard to believe that Star Wars is a 40-year-old franchise.
Is it really?
The original Star Wars came out in 1977. They had a 40th anniversary celebration this year.
It seems like it's such a timeless franchise.
Well, they update it when new installments come out.
That can age movies, though. The CGI in the prequel trilogy really stands out.
I hope the use of practical effects in The Force Awakens avoids that.
J J Abrams is a good filmmaker. He respects more the aesthetic of the original.
That's true. The setting's "used universe" feel is very important.
And it was definitely there in The Force Awakens, and in Rogue One.
