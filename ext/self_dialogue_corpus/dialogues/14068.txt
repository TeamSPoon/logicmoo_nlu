Have you heard the latest Lady Gaga single?
I'm not sure, what is it?
'The Cure', it's called. A little different from her other stuff.
I have heard it actually, I love it! I really like that she's ditched the gimmicky stuff.
Me too. She's a really talented musician.
She's always been a great singer but I didn't know how much she writes.
Yeah! All of her own stuff and some for other people.
She writes songs for other people?
Yes, she always has. She's a great songwriter.
I'll have to find some other stuff she's written.
