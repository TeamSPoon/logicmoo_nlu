Who won the Superbowl last year?
New England...again!
Oh, yeah, now I remember..I was thinking Broncos
That was the year before. Against Panthers.
That's right. Kind of weird now I think about it...Panthers!
Yeah. With the cry baby QB...what's his name?
Cam Newton?
Yeah, that's him. Didn't do so hot last season did he?
Not as good. What about Wilson, though?
Russell Wilson? He's still good.
You think Seahawks still has a chance?
I think they are still good, but they need better defense though.
i kind of like the Seahawks too.
I thought you were a San Francisco fan.
Not so much any more. I think the Raiders are better than them now.
Yeah, they did play good last season.
Them and Minnesota.
Yeah, that was a bit of a surprise, though.
I'm glad because I don't care for the Packers.
I don't think anyone does besides those cheeseheads who actually live there.
