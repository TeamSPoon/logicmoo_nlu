Hey did you see that LSU won the SEC West championship?
No I didn't! I watched the games last weekend though.
Yeah it was great game man. This is LSU's 19th division crown.
Isn't LSU 20-9 in SEC play?
Yes they are, and if they beat Mississippi State later today I think LSU is tied to win the SEC overall championship.
What's a stake for LSU?
Florida has to lose to Kentucky for LSU to be SEC champions.
Oh man I really hope Coach Paul Mainieri can pull out this win for LSU, they really need it.
I agree, Jared Poche pitched really good yesterday.
Poche is going to need to be on his A game today though.
Especially since today's game is the last game of the regular season.
Dude if LSU doesn't win the College World Series this year something's going to have to done about Paul Mainieri.
As much as I hate to say it, I agree. LSU has been struggling the past few years.
Yeah I think Coach Mainieri is having a tough time coaching in Skip Bertman's shadow.
It's tough to say but season after season LSU clinches the top seed in regular season play but they end up flaking when it's time for the College World Series.
I don't get it, I really don't. They without a doubt have some of the best talent in college baseball.
This is very true but I think this year may be their year.
Couldn't agree more. Kramer Robertson is going to be a top MLB draft pick next year.
I think Kramer Robertson is on par with being as good or better then the former LSU player Alex Bregman.
Woahh, I'll believe it when I see it man but I do love Kramer. He's a great shortstop.
