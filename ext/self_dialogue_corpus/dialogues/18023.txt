I love the way the Eagles could harmonize.
Oh yea, now that was a superb band.
Glenn Frye, Timothy Schimdt, Don Henley, now they had some great voices.
Timothy Schmidt has the best voice ever I think.
And they had the best songs.
Yea Take it Easy, Lying Eyes, Already Gone and the list goes on and on.
Wasn't Randy Meisner in the band too?
Yes he was and Bernie Leadon.
Remember Take it to the Limit  , I love that one.
Me too.
My favorite album was their debut album, The Eagles.
Yea that had some hits on it, remember Witchy Woman?
Yup and Peaceful Easy Feeling.
It's too bad that they disbanded.
Yea but remember ,they did get back together for a tour years later.
Yea the Hell Freezes over tour.
Did you ever see them in concert.
No never did, that is one band I wished I had seen.
I saw them one time, they were amazing.
I bet they were.
