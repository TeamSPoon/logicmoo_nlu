I can't believe football is almost back!
Yeah, training camp starts soon, right?
In a couple weeks, I think.
That means fantasy football is coming back soon, too.
Yeah!  We'll have to schedule our draft.
I'd take TB12 first, personally.
Do you think the Patriots will repeat this year?
Definitely!  Brady is the greatest of all time.
Well, he is almost 40.
Must be all of that avocado ice cream.
Their secondary is going to be insane, too.
Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore together sounds pretty intimidating.
I wonder what the Patriots are going to do about Jimmy Garoppolo.
It's gotta be tough to be backup to Brady.
Yeah, you just have to hope for an injury to the greatest quarterback ever.
Yeah, that seems weird.
The organization seems to like Garappolo a lot, though.
They should trade him and cash in now.
Then who will replace Brady when he retires?
Can anyone replace Brady?
