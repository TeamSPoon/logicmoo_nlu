Who do you think is the most popular player in the NFL right now?
Geez thats a tough one to think of
Would you think Tom Brady
I mean yeah who else could you even say?
I think Drew Brees is one of them
Hes a popular QB but even that is waning I am sure.
Yeah thats true I guess I dont know who I would surmise
You could also probably name any Dallas player
Elliot has top jersey sales
Yeah and I am sure Prescott is on his way there
That would be amazing with Bryan too
Yeah they arent called Americas team for nothing
Speaking of that I hate that nickname
Well it wasnt organic thats why people have a problem with it
Is anything that team does organic?
No I know what you are saying
But back to popularity would you say Antonio Brown
Yeah his antics have him up there
I love his celebrations
They may be making a comeback this year
