I don't get all the hype for Frozen when it came out.
What do you mean?
It was a good movie no doubt, but a bit overrated.
I didn't think so.  Why is that?
The actual story itself wasn't much different from most Disney stories.
But the ending showing family love was.
I guess so, but it wasn't that hard to see from my vantage point.
I guess you just have a bit of a cold heart like Anna, eh?
Hey, that's pretty creative.  Maybe you should make films.
Maybe I should!
