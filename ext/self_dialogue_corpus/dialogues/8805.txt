I have a confession: I like Creed.
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
Hear me out.  They were huge in the 90's, right?
Sure.
Well, I grew up in the 90's and everyone liked them so why would I change?
Probably because it's just not cool to like Creed anymore.
Their lead singer went crazy and they stopped making music, but they had some good tunes.
I hope you're not talking about 'With Arms Wide Open'.
That song was awesome!
Yep, we're no longer friends.
