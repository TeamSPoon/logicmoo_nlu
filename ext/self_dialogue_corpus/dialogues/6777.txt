What's your favorite Disney movie?
Definitely Jungle Book.
The new one or the old cartoon?  I liked the new movie.
I liked the new movie too, but the old cartoon is my favorite.  I just loved all of the characters and the songs.
The songs are the best!  I love the monkey's song - that's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time.
I even love just the background music too - it reminds me of Disneyland.
I thought that the new movie did a pretty good job too.  Some things were a little different but it was good.
I thought so too. I thought that the actor who played Mogli was really cute.
I heard that it was his first acting job and that's why he just seemed like a normal little boy.
Oh that's so cute. Of course I loved Baloo and Baghera too.
