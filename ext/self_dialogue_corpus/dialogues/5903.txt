So what do you thunk about the movie tangled
I love that movie
I cant believe she was locked in that huge tower
She was a very clever girl
I loved the art where she used the frying pan
Yeah she used it in Flynn ryder
He had a soft spot for her
The witch was very manipulative in that movie
I totally agree
The song in the bar was awesome also
