We just saw the new Cars 3 movie!
Really? How was it?
We loved it. It was better than the second Cars movie.
Why do you say that? I liked the second movie.
This one focused more on Lightning McQueen like the first movie. The second one was more focused on Mater. I really like Owen Wilson who is the voice of Lightning.
That's good. Since Mater is my favorite character, that is why I liked the second movie so much. I think Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious.
I like that they continue to introduce new characters like Cruz Ramirez to the existing cast of characters to make the movie so interesting.
I agree, the writers for the Cars series are so talented. I need to go see this one today!
You should! Let me know what you think of it. I hope it is successful enough for them to make a 4th movie!
I'll let you know. Thanks for letting me know how good it is.
