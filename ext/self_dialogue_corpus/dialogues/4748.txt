What do you think about Pete Rose?
I think he is one of the greatest, most hard-working players in MLB history.
And...?
And he bet on the game. He should be banned--it's the rules.
But he never bet on his team to lose.
So?
So that means he wasn't intentionally throwing games as a manager. He was trying to win.
So?
So he didn't really do anything WRONG, just went against a rule that had been around for a while.
He still broke it.
Yeah, but in a good, competitive way. He wanted to win and make some extra on the side.
I still think he should be banned.
I think he should be recognized as the second-greatest hitter ever.
Why second? You're clearly a fanboy.
Well, he's not baseball's all-time hit leader.
In 17 years, he got 3,000 hits ... but had far more in Japan.
How much more?
Well, last year he passed Pete Rose as the all-time hit king.
Dang, I didn't realize that.
You'd hate him. He didn't bet on the game.
