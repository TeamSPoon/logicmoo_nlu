Let's talk about pop music. Who is your favorite pop group?
I used to really like One Direction, but they haven't been the same since Zayn Malik left the group?
I know. I like the music that Zayn has done as a solo artist, but I can't remember anything from One Direction lately that has been good.
Same thing with Fifth Harmony. I think Camila Cabello leaving has destroyed the group.
It's weird for them to still be called Fifth Harmony with only four people in the group. Did you hear their latest song?
No, I haven't heard it. What is it called?
It's called Down and it has a feature by Gucci Mane. You should look it up. It is a great dance record.
I have been hearing Camila Cabello's song almost non-stop. I'm glad she proved she can be successful on her own.
I think it is hard for pop artists to get along in a group. All the good groups break up.
I think for girl groups it is especially hard because they all have diva attitudes, and everyone wants to be the star. It's sad because I really liked their music.
