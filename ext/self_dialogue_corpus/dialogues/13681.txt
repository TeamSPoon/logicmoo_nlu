What was Lady Gaga's first album called?
The Fame Monster, I thought it was her best work in her career.
I didn't really start listening to her until her album Born This Way, which is my favorite.
I thought that album was a little to dark for me I preferred her more pop sound.
Do you have some songs you could recommend from The Fame Monster, I could check out?
Sure. My favorites are PokerFace and Papparazi.
I actually think I may have heard that song PokerFace before it just slipped my mind.
I am sure you have that was one of her biggest singles.
Well when I listen to The Fame Monster maybe it will jog my memory. Thanks For the Suggestions!
You are welcome! Be sure to tell me what you think about the album
