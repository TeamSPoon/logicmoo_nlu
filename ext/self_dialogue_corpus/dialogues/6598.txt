Don't you just love the music in all of the Disney movies?
I do. It is very well done.
I usually purchase the soundtrack when it becomes available for the majority of the films.
Wow, really?
Yes.  I just also love that they have well known actors and musicians singing in the films.
I do too.  That's what makes them so addicting I think.
Yes, because you know the voices.  It's not just some unknown.
Although, sometimes they have cast unknowns that have been wonderful.
Yep, and they have been skyrocketed to fame.
Yes, you are very right.
