So do you like Star Wars?
Well, I liked the movies okay, but I'm not like a die hard fan.  I mean, I don't buy the toys or memorize the lines or anything.
Well, hey, no one's perfect.
Haha.  Although I have to admit, some things were a bit confusing to me with the new one.
You mean Rogue One or The Force Awakens?
Uh.. the one with the girl and that one black guy and the rolling ball droid.
That was Force Awakens.  So, what confused you?
Well, I mean, why did that one bad guy had a cross guard on his lightsaber?  Seems like that be rather worthless.
Well, it's not explained in the film but actually, it's because the crystal he used to make his lightsaber was cracked and that caused a flaw in it's design.  Guessing he just kind of "made it work" rather than trying it again.
Ahhh... if you're too lazy to fix it, just cover it up.
