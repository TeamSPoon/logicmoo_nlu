Have you listened to Dr. Dre?
A little, but probably not as much as you.  You're the hip hop expert.
Well, he's definitely one of the best hip hop artists of all time I would say.
I've heard a few of his songs.  What makes him so great?
He was the producer of Death Row Records, which had so many great artists such as Snoop Dogg, 2pac, Xzibit, and many others.
Oh wow, yeah that is impressive.  Tell me more about him!
He had a solo album in 1992 called the Chronic, it was pretty amazing too.
I might've heard of that one, what were some songs from it?
Let Me Ride was the hit single, I think it won a grammy.
Oh yeah, I think I've heard that.
And you may not have known that Warren G was his step-brother.  He helped him rise to fame.
Oh wow, that's wild!  No, I didn't know that.
Yes.  He created the careers of so many great artists.
That's really impressive.
Yeah, and he's been in a bunch of movies too, like Set It Off and Training Day.
So what's unique about his music style?
I'd have to say his beats, and he made the West Coast G-funk style popular.
What is that?
It's hip hop music with low bass beats.  It sounds great.
I'll definitely listen to him a little more now that I know all this about him.
