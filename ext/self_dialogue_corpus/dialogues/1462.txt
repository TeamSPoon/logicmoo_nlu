Who is your favorite NFL team?
The Giants.
Why do you like the Giants"
I grew up in the New York area and hate the Jets.
Did you attend many games as a kid?
I usually went once a year with my dad and brothers.
I went to the old Giants Stadium a few times.
Really?  Did you do any tailgating outside?
Sure, I remember the frigid cold days with a nice fat sausage and peppers with some hot sauce with a nice beer to wash it down.
The good old days.  Now, it's insanely expensive.
Did you get a chance to see any of the playoff teams back then?
Yeah, I got to see some of the Parcells wins back in the 90's when the Tuna was in charge.
So I take it you hate New England, huh?
Not really, we bested them in two Super Bowls in the last 10 years, we ain't afraid of them.  Brady is pretty awesome though.
You're telling me man.  What he pulled off last year against Atlanta was pretty sick.
Hope the Falcons can bounce back this year, I like Matt Ryan.
You plan on getting out to any games this season?
Maybe if I can get seats at a reasonable price.  Otherwise, I'll invest in a new TV.
Who's going to win it this year?
G-men all the way baby.
