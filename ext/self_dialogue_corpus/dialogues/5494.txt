Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?
Yes, wasn't it great?
I thought it was fantastic. Emma Watson did a wonderful job.
There were so many guest stars! I tried to guess them all.
So did I! I missed Ewan McGregor, though.
Oh, he was the candelabra, Lumiere.
My favorite was Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts.
She was great. How many times did you see it?
I watched it three times in theater.
I'm buying it the day it comes out on DVD!
