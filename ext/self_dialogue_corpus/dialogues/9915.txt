Are there any new girl rappers you'e been listening to?
Yeah, I like Cardi B. She's been getting popular lately.
I think Cardi B is cool. I like BIA, her song "Whip It" is good.
Oh yeah, they kind of have a similar style. I want to hear them on a song together.
Yeah that'd be dope.
I liked Kamaiyah too.
Yeah? Didn't she just make the XXL freshman cover?
She did! Her song with YG is so good.
You think she can become popular?
I think she already has a strong following.
