Have you ever purchased a "Now that's what I call Music cd"?
No, what kind of music is on the cd?
The biggest hits being played on the radio station on one album.
Really, like what artist.
Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, Alessia Cara, Ariana Grande, DJ Snake
I only know a couple of the singers you just mention. Sounds like it would be a waste of money.
I have been buying them for years, that come out ever 3-4 months. My kids and I love them.
Ok, you mentioned Alessia Cara-never heard of her, or the Snake singer.
Have you heard of "Scars To Your Beautiful"?
I love that song, I didn't know who sang it.
I know I am always surprized when I play the CD, because I know songs but not the artist.
Ok, so what does that snake guy sing?
"Let Me Love You" DJ Snake feat. Justin Bieber.
No Way!  I know what you mean, when you say you know the song but not the artist.
Like I said earlier, I have been buying them for years, when I first started purchasing them, They included of a couple of crossover country hits as well.
How many songs are usually on the cd?
Around 16 top hist and then they include maybe 5-6 new and upcoming artist. I usually have never heard of these songs. But I have enjoyed a few.
Sounds like something I might be interested in purchasing.
When I get home I will loan you a couple of my lastest ones, try them out and you can decide on your own if you like them.
Thanks, I would like that-don't worry I will return them to you.
