When does football season start?
I think preseason starts pretty soon?
Dallas might do well this year.
Particularly since Romo is out of the picture.
What about New England?
Depends if Brady decides to retire
He should retire
Yes. Brady has won enough
What about Peyton? What is he doing these day?
Not sure, other than Nationwide and Papa John's commercials.
Do all NFL players get commercials
Depends how good they are or were.
It seems like broadcasting is part of the ritual as well.
The younger crowd may not even know that the announcers were once players.
I am hoping the Jets will do well this year.
They had some issues with Sanchez, but they should be getting better.
What about the Giants and Eli
I am not sure how much longer Eli will be there. We'll see.
As long as someone else wins this year. New England needs to be dethroned
Agreed. Someone new this year should win.
