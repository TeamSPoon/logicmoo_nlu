Well I just hope the Falcons get it, really.
The cowboys are where its really at.
The cowboys huh? When did you start liking the, August?
Well, I am now a Cowboys fan perse; I am a Dak fan.
I also love Dak but I am not a banwagoner.
I will always bandwagon for Dak, #Hailstate
Ive been liking the Falcons since 2002 and you dont know my struggle.
Back to the seahawks, how do you think Wilson is going to do this year?
I dont really know, things are tough since lynch has going to the Raiders.
How dumb is it that they are going to Vegas?
That is so dumb!
The fans are really getting screwed there!
Is just like how the rams fans were screwed.
I really do not like the moving of teams.
Next thing we know, they will move one to the UK
Yeah, Robert is getting power hungry.
I really hope they dont move the falcons anywhere!
I also hope they dont move the seahawks.
Well friend, nice to see you!
It was nice to see you too!
