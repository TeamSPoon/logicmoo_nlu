You know, I really liked the Moana movie.
Oh I know right?  Hawaiian culture is so nice, I looked it up.  There was a lot going on in the back scenes.
How do you mean?  In terms of making of the movie?
Exactly.  They went to Hawaii, researched legends, spoke to the people, and got their input and contribution.
Ah that is nice!  It's really great to experience different cultures every now and then!
Tell me about it.  The fact that each country and nation is distinct from one another, it's so great.
I totally agree.  You know, if there were no countries/nations, we wouldn't have any Disney princesses right?
Yup!  And I'm totally looking forward to the next Disney princess!
What culture should they focus on next?
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be amazing.
