You know what the best romantic subplot in all the Avenger movies is?
No, what?
It's Steve and Peggy.
Steve and Peggy? Really?
Yes. He can never bring himself to tell her how he feels until it's too late, and his plane is going down and everybody thinks he's going to die, and they talk about having never had that dance together.
Yeah, that will get you in the feels every time.
Then after he wakes up, he tracks her down at the hospital, and she's an elderly woman and he hasn't aged.
Yeah, and it's almost like it doesn't even matter to him.
Exactly! He just wants to see her, no matter how old she is.
And then he gets her the glass of water, and when he turned around it's as if she sees him for the first time...
That will really kick you in the feels. She's so over-whelmed to see him alive.
And it's almost like she doesn't understand how impossibly long it's been. She's just overwhelmed at seeing him again...
After she thought she had lost him forever.
And Cap tears up a little. He knows she's stuck in this hellish condition where she can't remember things clearly...
...and every time she seems him, it will be like she's just realizing he's still alive...
...and every time, she experiences the heartache and sadness all over again.
And as much as he wants to see her, he knows it's best if he doesn't. He doesn't want to keep putting her through that.
And so he walks away.
But he never gets over her. Never.
Man, I was sure you were going to say that Natasha and the Hulk was the best romance in the Avengers.
