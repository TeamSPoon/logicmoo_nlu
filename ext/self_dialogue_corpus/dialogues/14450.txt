Did you see the basketball game last night?
Yeah, Golden State won 120-108.
The game was close in the first quarter.
After that quarter, the Warriors controlled the game.
Kevin Durant was dominant!
I heard he scored 33 points and had 10 rebounds.
Curry had a great game too.
He had 21 points.
The series is at 3-0 now
I'm thinking Golden State will sweep and move on to the next round.
When's the next game?
They play Monday.
If they sweep on Monday, it'll be the third straight sweep by the Warriors.
Yeah, they've had a great playoff run.
San Antonio has a lot of injuries.
If they were healthy, I think this would've been a closer series.
Even if they were healthy, it would be tough for San Antonio to win.
Yeah, Golden State has a great team
I'm thinking Golden State might win it all this year.
I agree with you on that one.
