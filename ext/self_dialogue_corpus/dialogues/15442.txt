What's your favorite song from a Stephen Sondheim musical?
Does it have to be a musical in which he wrote the music and lyrics?
No, I guess not.
Then I'd say "Tonight" from West Side Story. I think it's beautiful.
It is beautiful. I prefer the songs with really clever lyrics, though.
Such as?
Have you ever heard "Getting Married Today" from Company?
I don't think so.
It's sung by a woman on her wedding day. It's all the reasons she's NOT getting married today.
I'll look for it. Isn't Company the one with "Ladies Who Lunch"?
Yes. It's probaby the most famous song from that show.
I saw somebody sing that a long, long time ago on Johnny Carson's show.
Another great song from Company is "Another Hundred People." It's about all the people who move to and live in New York City.
Oh, then I definitely want to hear that one. I like the music from "A Little Night Music".
Yes, that's a beautiful set of songs. It has what is probably Sondheim's most famous song--"Send in the Clowns".
Most of the songs are waltzes, right?
Yes. It has some songs with clever lyrics, too. Remember "Now/Later/Soon"?
Yes! That's the one where the father, his new wife, and his son take turns singing about their frustrations.
Yes, but getting back to West Side Story. My favorite song when I first heard the album (as a kid) was "Gee, Office Krupke."
Ha! Did you understand the lyrics?
