Did you see John Lennon and Chuck Berry make a song together?
No, can you tell me more?
Yoko Ono interrupted them, it was quite funny.
What happened?
Chuck Berry and John Lennon played beautiful music together.
What did Yoko do?
She was making bad sounding noises and interrupting them.
Wow why did she do that?
Nobody knows for sure, but she probably wanted to be in the spotlight.
Wow I will have to watch that, it sounds funny.
