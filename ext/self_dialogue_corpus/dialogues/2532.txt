What do you think about the 49ers this year?
They might be better or not.  You really can't tell.
Well, they made one move that they should have done years ago.
Yeah, the offensive line has been horrible.
They finally made a move to plug all the holes.
Kap was running for his life the last couple of years.  Them not fixing the line was a clear message.
The niners have been on cruise control for a few years now.
They made a change at head coach again.  Wonder if this one will stick?
They really screwed up when they got rid of Harbaugh.
Well, they got a new coach again and it will be interesting.
It is not like he has to do anything special.  He just has to be better than last year, which is not saying much.
They have totally changed over the roster.
The free agent moves and the draft seems like an upgrade from the past teams.
Yeah, some of the problems were clear.
It is a brand new year, but niner fans are not going to get their hopes up.
Yep.  It has been a downward decline ever since Coach Harbaugh left.
The new quarterbacks are just a bunch of place holders.
With the Shanahan offense, they might not need to be that good.
Well, they don't have to be great. The expectations are going to be low.
Some niner fans are going to believe the hype out of the gate.
