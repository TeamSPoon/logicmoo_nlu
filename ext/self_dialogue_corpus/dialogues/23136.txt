What are you watching?
A comedy. It's called Multiplicity.
I've never heard of it.
It's good, especially if you like Michael Keaton.
Oh, he's in it?
Yeah, he plays, um... several of the lead roles.
That's odd.
Well the whole basis of the movie is that he multiplies himself, so you have all these versions of him going around.
Exactly like him?
That's the problem, each one is slightly different with their own quirks.
Sounds like that could be trouble.
It is, it gets him into some trouble. That's where the comedy comes in.
Sounds interesting.
There's one version of himself that's a bit mentally handicapped, one I believe is gay.. but the mentally handicapped one is my favourite.
Is it an older movie?
Relatively. It's also relatively new when you think about it.
Well I've liked Michael Keaton in other stuff.
I loved him as Batman.
I thought he was the best Batman ever!
I agree.
