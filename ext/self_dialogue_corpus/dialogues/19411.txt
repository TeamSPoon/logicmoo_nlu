what do you consider the biggest rip off song?
The doors hello I love you  is clearly the kinks all day and all night.
I think that is a perfect example.
YA and the courts agreed.
Yes, i believe the kinks got a bunch of money from the doors success from that song.
Yep.Another is Led Zepplin whole lotta love vs you need love muddy waters.
I think this was settled out of courts.
Zepplin also got called out on stairway to heaven.
Really? I hope not I love that song!
I love all these songs, ripped off or not.
True.I just want to be able to respect them still as great.
Well you can they are great, just not truly original.
I think at times it is hard because there are only so many notes.
True but when a song is being clearly ripped off it is clear.
Ya huey lewis was totally ripped off in ghostbusters.
Interesting He was asked to write the music for ghostbusters  but was busy with other work.
Well that is just it, then they come out with this song that sounds just like his song I want a new drug.
I hope that he got some money for that .Clearly ripped off.
Me too, I always feel fine you want to sample but be upfront and honest.
And give the original artist there fair cut!
