What do you think of Tech nine?
I like him man, one of my favorite rappers.
I'm thinking about seeing him next time he comes around.
You should, I saw him in 2009 and it was great.
What's your favorite song by him?
Well, my wife introduced me to him with the Waitress, so I'm gonna have to go with that.
That one's my jam!  I think my favorite is Show me a God.
I'm not really a fan of that one, but it's not the worst thing I've ever heard.
I feel you.  Who else are you listening to now?
Have you ever heard of Immortal Technique?
No, does he sound like Tech?
Not really, I mean he's a rapper, but not the machine gun style rapping like Tech nine.
Oh alright.  What's a good song to listen to?
I'd start with Internally Bleeding.
Is he still making music?
No, I don't think so, but he has a few albums out.
Do you know if they're on Spotify?
Yeah he is, all of his albums are on there.
Nice I'll have to check him out, thanks man.
No problem!
