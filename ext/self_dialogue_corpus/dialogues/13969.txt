Do you like Lady Gaga's newer music or her older music?
I actually like her new music, it sounds so much different from her older albums.
I like her older music, I really like the Fame Monster album.
Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga song?
I have two, my favorites are Bad Romance and Monster, what about you?
I really like the Cure.
What did you think about the release of the Cure?
I like that she released it at Coachella.  I thought that was pretty cool.
My favorite music video she did was Bad Romance,  I still think its one of the best music videos out there.
I liked that one and I also liked Alejandro, I thought it was really edgy and unique.
