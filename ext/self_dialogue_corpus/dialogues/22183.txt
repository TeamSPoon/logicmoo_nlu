I was able to watch the new Aliens. Have you seen it?
No, not yet. From 1 to 10 what did you think?
I would give it a 7 out of 10.
Oh, okay. Why so low?
It was a little slow in the beginning.
Oh darn, Was it as scary as the original one?
I didn't think it was as scary because they are not on the ship as much as the first one.
Oh yeah the ship was the main part of the original and what made it so so scary.
Exactly! I thought the actors were all good though.
Oh okay cool. I heard it was a long movie?
Oh man, it was over two hours and I kept waiting for the characters to develop more.
What do you mean?
Well, like when you start feeling a connection to a character or feel like your getting to know them.
Oh, so it lacked depth of characters?
Yeah, that is a good way to describe it.
I was going to take my son who is 14 years old, do you feel like that is too young?
It kind of depends. I seen a father and son there and hid kid was about 15 or 16 yrs old.
i know what you mean because every kid is different and parenting style too.
Overall I would recommend seeing it but not necessarily in the theater.
I might just wait til it come out on DVD! Thanks!
