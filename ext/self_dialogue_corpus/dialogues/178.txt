What do you think is a great superhero movie?
I love the original Spiderman.
Do you like the new one?
No, I prefer the one from 2002.
I thought it was good too. I liked James Franco.
I like the fact that it built a story and was very organized. The new one was really messy.
I agree and I did not think the guy who played Spiderman was very serious about it.
Do you like new superhero movies?
They are okay, but there are too many of them. I prefer the older ones like the original Superman.
Yeah, that one is excellent. Christopher Reeve was amazing.
