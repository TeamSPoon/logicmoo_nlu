Manoa.
Whet?
Manoia, it's this cool movie about a girl living on an island.
I dont watch girl movies.
Do you like the Rock?
Yeah, he's so cool in Fast and Furious movies.
He's in this movie.
So, he's like the girl's dad?
No, he's a demi-god.
Whats a demi-god?
He's like part man and part god. It's great because he steals this jewel and like nature gets mad and...
Your confusing me. You said it was about a girl?
Well, it's hard to explain. It's animated so you dont really see the Rock but you hear his voice.
No Rock and it's a cartoon or something?
It's computer animated, like Toy Story only better. Just watch it and you'll like it.
Why would I like a girl's movie thats a cartoon with no  Rock in it or any cool violence?
Everything dosen't have to have guns or fights. This movie has cool monsters and the Rock is funny.
Maybe I'll watch it.
You want to see the Rock right?
You said he wasn't in it, sheesh!
