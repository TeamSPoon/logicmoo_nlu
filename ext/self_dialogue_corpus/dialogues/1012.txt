My favorite sport is football. What is yours?
Mine too.  What do you think about drug use in football?
I wish it were nonexistant.
It can ruin a sport.
That's for sure.
I hope that teams tackle drug abuse as much as they work on tackling players.
That's true.
It would be great if teams educated players from a young age.
It would be incredible if the players and coaches would be on the same page about defeating drug abuse.
It's a shame that players would get involved in that.
They are so harmful to the body and take away from the game.
I hope the professionals keep promoting to stay clean.
Me too.
Football is such a great sport and you need a great mind to play.
Many don't realize just how much acumen is required to play along with strength.
I think some of the best players are geniuses.
That's true.
Many top players not only are strong, but highly academic.
What a great sport.  I hope it continues for a long time.
No doubt it will.
