What position in an NFL team do you think is the best?
Uu that's a hard question. Hmm the QuarterBack?
Well Quarter Back couldn't work without a Receiver.
That's true, and we can't forget about the Running Games.
What about the Defensive players?
Yeah, they are very important.
The big guys on the line are the one that make a lot of the big play.
Yeah, interceptions and sacks.
The special team are also important.
Haha you can't forget about the kicker and the punter.
And the long snapper.
Haha, he is always the one people make fun of, but no one can do their jobs.
Did you know that the tight end is the worst paying position in the game.
Really, that's surprising. What about Gonk?
Well, he's an outlier.
Yeah well, they are still a team.
Yeah and no one can work alone.
Yeah but they still do need a leader.
So then I vote for the Coach!
Haha, that's correct!
