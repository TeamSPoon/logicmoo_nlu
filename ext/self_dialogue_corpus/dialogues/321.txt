Battle of the silly superhero movies: Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy?
I liked the action a lot more in Guardians of the Galaxy.
Me too, but I liked Ant-Man a lot more.
Why?
It had me cracking up a lot harder, and still had the villain to defeat and the origin story.
Yeah, there was a lot in a little bit of time.
Do you think they're TOO goofy?
No, but Guardians 2 for sure was bordering on insanely goofy to the point where I couldn't take it seriously.
Favorite part of Ant-Man?
I was cracking up like a child when he was throwing all those toys out of the house and they were dodging huge cars. Hysterical!
