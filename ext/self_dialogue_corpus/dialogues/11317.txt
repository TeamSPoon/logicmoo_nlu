Do you like the beatles?
I really them and their music as well.
Who is your favorite beatle?
Paul McCartney is my favorite. What about you?
I say Ringo Starr, I always felt he was never as appreciated as any of the others.
Ido think John and Paul certainly seemed the most popular. Poor Ringo.
Well Poor I doubt with their popularity and albums sold.
How many albums did they sell? do you have a clue?
I think it is somewhere around  800 million copies.
Wow, That is a ton! I wonder if that is the most of all time even.
