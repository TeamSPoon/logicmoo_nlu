Who is your favorite Beatle?
Ringo, obviously!
Wait, seriously? Or are you joking?
I'm joking - although I do love Ringo.
So who's your favorite then?
I'm going to be a contrarian and go with George Harrison, what about you?
Ah George - so underrated, I think I'd have to say Paul McCartney.
I can understand that - Hey Jude and Let it Be are two of  my favorites!
And Here Comes the Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are Two of mine!
Well then I guess we agree for the most part.
