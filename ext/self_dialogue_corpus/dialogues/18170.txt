What was your favorite band of the last five years?
I think I'd have to say Imagine Dragons.
I've heard of them, but I can't remember any of their songs.
Oh, they had a few.
What were they again?
Well, one of the first songs they released was Radioactive.
Oh, yeah!  I remember that song.
Yeah, it got a lot of radio play.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
I haven't, but my sister got the chance.
Were you jealous?
A little, but I wasn't in town anyway.
Did she like the show?
Yeah, she said it was awesome.
Did she have good seats?
Yeah, I think she was in the fourth row.
Wow, that's great.
Yeah, I think she even caught a guitar pick from the opening act.
Who opened for them?
I really don't remember.
