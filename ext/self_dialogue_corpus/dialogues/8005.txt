How do you feel about Taylor Swift?
Well she's a beautiful girl, but I'm not impressed by her music.
So you think that she is just another manufactured pop star?
Yes, I think that the only requirement is good looks.
Well that's important to sell music to people now.
Yes, but I yearn for the older days of popular music.
I think that you are being naive in thinking that pop music has ever been about more than money.
Well what about the Beatles?
Yes, I guess that their music was popular and critically good as well.
That time of skilled musicians with popularity seems to have vanished from the music scene.
