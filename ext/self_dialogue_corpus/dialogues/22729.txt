Have you seen The Parent Trap?
Yes, like a million times.
Same here! Who's your favorite character?
I know they're two characters but I love Hallie and Annie.
Aw me too! I always wished I had a twin sister.
No way! Me too!
What's your favorite part of the movie?
I liked it when they went on the camping trip.
All of those tricks they played on Meredith were hilarious.
Definitely. Which prank did you like most?
When they put the lizard on the water bottle.
That was hilarious but also disgusting.
True. I also liked when they moved her mattress into the middle of the lake.
That was so funny.
I was rolling on the floor peeing my pants I was laughing so hard.
The ending of the movie was so cute.
Definitely. I was so happy the parents got married at the end.
Yes and I was so happy the two maids got together too!
Yes, that was the best part!
Agreed now I want to go watch it!
