Did you see the Spurs Rockets game tonight?
I sure did and the Spurs spanked them.
It was awful, I bet on Houston.
Why would you do that? The Spurs have so much history of success.
I wasn't, but right before game time their best player Kahwai Leonard was not going to play.
Still risky bet don't you think for a game 6.
Frankly, no. The home team has won ever game of the series.
Well, then what happened? Why did Houston lose?
Because I think Houston felt the game would be a breeze to win.
Because they had won all their home playoff games?
No, because with the Spurs two best players out, they just mailed it in.
Well, who is to blame?
The whole team and coaching staff. They got sucker punched into thinking San Antonio would not try and wait til game 7 when they would be at full strength
That makes some sense, but still the wrong way for a professional to behave.
I'll say it was despicable frankly. You should have seen the crowd.
What did the fans do?
They Boo'd the Rockets like crazy for a lack of effort.
Were the boos directed at anyone in particular?
Yep. James Harden, A potential MVP and he gave no effort. Played awful.
I always felt Harden was not a championship caliber player.
