You ready for the NFL this year?
Yeah! i can't wait.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Saints.
Oh. I'm a Giants fan. The Peterson signing was interesting
Yeah, he is a bit old, but I think he has something left in the tank
Brees still looked good last year too.
Yup. Just got to get the defense working a bit. How do you feel about your Giants?
Not too good. Still have Eli Manning...
True haha. He is a turnover machine
At least Coughlin is gone
I really like watching Odell Beckham
Yeah, he is the best WR. Who do you like to win it all?
I like the Patriots.
Yeah me too
I worry about Brady's age, but I havent seen any signs of falling off
Belicheck is a legit genuis
Yeah it is insane
Im just glad the Saints arent in the same division as them!!
Yeah, being a Giants fan can be difficult because of that
