Man who is Leona Lewis?
What makes you ask that?
I'm listening to this song of hers.
Which one?
Which one, I never heard of her. Bleeding Love. Does she have more?
I don't know. I know Bleeding Love though.
I think I might have to add this to my library.
You should just google her and see if she has more songs out.
I know right.
That's how I get most of my music. I hear something hot, then I check to see if the artist has more.
But then when you find more you have to listen to them to see if they are any good.
Something like that.
I just googled her and she has songs out from like 2007.
That's when she did Bleeding Love. What, you thought that was new?
Well yeah. I guess it's new to me.
I think she may have a couple of albums or cd's out.
Yeah, I think I will go on youtube and hear some more. She has a nice voice.
Yeah she does.
Have you ever heard Fire Under My Feet?
Well that's a track she did last year.
