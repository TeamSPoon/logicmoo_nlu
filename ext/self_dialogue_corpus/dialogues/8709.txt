Do you like the band Journey?
Yes, I do, and I like the song Sherry.
My best one is Wheel in the Sky.
Is the singer Steve Perry?
Yes I think, I get it mixed with Steven Tyler alot.
Yes but Perry is not singing with them anymore.
Yeah some guy that sounds just like him though.
I can't remember his name, but he is from another country.
I like them better with the original band.
Me too, but the guy is good.
