Do you recall Robert Plant winning a Grammy Award recently?
Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin?
Yes, that's the one.
I do not remember him doing anything post Zeppelin
Wait a minute, I think I remember. He won with Alison Krauss for Please Read the Letter
Oh yeah, now I remember. That was around 2009.
Yes, that's it. Who else was big in the music scene back then?
Well there was Adele. She was just starting out.
Oh yeah. Chasing Pavements.
Yep. And then Coldplay had Viva La Vida
Ah yes. That was a good album.
And then Duffy and Sheryl Crow came out with some new pop music.
Ugh, I was not a fan of Duffy.
Yeah, I didn't really catch on to her music either.
I definitely like Adele though.
Yeah, she's still making some great music.
Yes, incredible voice.
I agree. Not many can hit the notes like she can.
Yeah. I hear she's a nice person as well.
Good to know.
