Did you ever like any of The Beatles' music?
I love the Beatles. Favorite song of theirs is I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
I'd have to say mine is Yesterday. Such a beautiful and always relevant song.
Imagine is another beautiful one sung by John Lennon.
It really was. I hate that his life was cut so short.
Me too, and by a fan of his. That's crazy.
Yeah it is. Did you ever see Across the Universe?
Yes I did I love the interpretations of Beatles' songs they did in that movie.
My favorite is when the sang While My Guitar Gently Weeps.
Oh that was a beautiful rendition. That Jimi Hendrix character was so good.
He really was. Black Bird is another pretty one.
Yeah I like that one and Hey Jude. They were so talented.
Did you ever see any of their movies from back in the day?
I never saw any of them but I've been making it a point to.
They were crazy famous, up there with Elvis and Michael Jackson.
Elvis really had a great following. People believe he's alive to this day.
I can't say I have any favorite Elvis Presley songs. Maybe Love me Tender.
That is a sweet song. His daughter Lisa Marie married Michael Jackson at one point.
Right she was in his video You Are Not Alone.
I remember people making fun of that video but I thought it was sweet.
