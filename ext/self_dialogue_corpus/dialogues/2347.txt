So how many games does Clevelan win this year?
One...and that's being conservative...
I think they will win five..
I'd like to have some what you are smoking, dude
The schedul look to be in their fave though.
First of all, no quarterback, just a bunch of bums.
True, very true. Forgot about that
And their best receiver is playing for the Redskins
I remember that...and Gordon stays in trouble
Exactly. Cannot leave the drugs alone
Didn't he get traded?
Unfortunately, no
Well maybe he gets it together this year
Keep dreaming, he'll find a way to mess up
He has wasted three three years of his career on drugs
He will never get it back either
It's a shame. You imagine what we'd do if we had his talents?
Yup. Everyday...
So three wins then?
Hahahahaha...one. like I said
