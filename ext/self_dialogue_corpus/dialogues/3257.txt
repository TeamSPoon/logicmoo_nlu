Did you ever see Halloween?
The original one, yes.
That was a spooky one.
Yes, Michael Meyers always creeped me out
Wasn't Jamie Lee Curtis in that one as well?
Yes, I believe it was one of her first movies.
I just remember her going into the house at the end
yeah, that was pretty freaky.
I always thought she was a good actress.
Yes, I agree
