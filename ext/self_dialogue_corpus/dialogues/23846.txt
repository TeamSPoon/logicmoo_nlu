Are you a fan of Marvel movies?
Definitely! I love them.
Are you going to see 'Spider-Man: Homecoming?' "
Of course. I've already bought my tickets. What about you?
That's my plan. I want to see how it goes this time around with Tom Holland in the role.
I heard it's actually the best one they've made.
Really? I like the ones with Tobey Maguire that Sam Raimi did.
Those were good. My favorite was 'Spider-Man 2' because of Doc Oc.
Yeah! Alfred Molina was amazing in that role.
One of the best Marvel movie villains.
True. Another good Marvel villain was Loki.
I love Loki! I can't wait to see him back in 'Thor: Ragnarok.' "
Me, too! When does that come out again?
In early November. In fact, it comes out on my birthday.
Lucky you! One of your favorite characters right on your birthday. That's a great present.
It really is. It's a great year for movies all around, though. Right after that is 'Justice League.' "
I wasn't into seeing that but after 'Wonder Woman' I'm more excited about it.
I can understand that. The last few films were pretty bad, but I'm excited to see Aquaman, as  well as Wonder Woman in it.
I never thought I'd be excited about Aquaman as a character, but I'm looking forward to seeing him, too.
I think it's going to be better than people are fearing.
