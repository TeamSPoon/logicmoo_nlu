I just watched the old movie The Notebook for the first time. Did you ever see it?
No. I heard it's a love story.
Yes, it is but the way it was done was excellent.
How do you mean?
You are being taken through their lives by a story being told.
By who a narrator?
Well you actually don't know it, but one of the characters about their own lives.
Who is in it?
Ryan Gosling, James Garner and not sure of the girls names.
So what is th ebig deal with the movie.
The end just made me so sad.
Why did they die?
James Garner is telling the story as an old man.
The story is about his life I guess?
Yes and he is reading it to his wife in a hospital who has dementia.
Okay, I get it.
I didn't realize until close to the end that's what it was.
So the movie is him telling their story.
Yes, so sweet and he lays in the hospital bed with her and they both pass together in the end.
That's does sound sad. Maybe I will watch it.
