Seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I just watched Look Who's Back. Have you seen it?
No, I haven't even heard of it! Is it good?
Well, it's definitely really bizarre.
How so?
It's this German...comedy...about Adolf Hitler waking up in a park in 2014 and being totally confused about where he is.
Wait, what? That sounds so weird!
Yeah, and no one believes he's himself, obviously, but it actually takes a surprising turn at the end and has a really positive message.
Well that's good, I was a little worried with the subject matter.
Right? But I liked it overall. Have you seen anything lately?
I just watched Swiss Army Man on Amazon the other night.
Wait, is that the weird one with Daniel Radcliffe?
The one where he plays a corpse? Yeah, that's the one.
Wow, yeah, I saw that movie recently too and thought it was super weird.
Right? But again, also a really positive message at the end.
To be honest, I thought it was a little corny at points with the friendship message, but I think it worked overall.
Really? I didn't think it was corny at all.
Well, we all see perceive films a little differently. Anyway, going to anything this weekend?
Yes, I was thinking of going to see Guardians of the Galaxy. You want to come?
Yeah! How does Friday night sound?
