What is your opinion on Beyonce? Are you a fan?
I used to be back in the day. When she was part of Destiny's Child.
You're not now though?
Kind of. I like some of her songs.
I'm a pretty big fan.
She's not bad now, it's just that I had more respect for her as an artist in the earlier days.
I know what you mean.
I just feel like she kind of sold herself out in a sense. Remember that song "No Scrubs" and how popular it was?
Oh yes! I sang that a lot when it came out.
Me too! My friends and I would make up dance moves to Destiny's Child music videos.
Did you know that Beyonce and Jay Z had twins recently?
Yes I read that online.
I think they are twin boys but I'm not sure exactly.
I bet they'll be pretty cute!
If they looks like Beyonce they will be!
Did you know that Beyonce is actually from Texas I think?
I have heard that somewhere I know.
Pretty interesting. I'm also from Texas.
What did you think of Beyonce's song "Crazy In Love"?
I loved it back when it first came out actually.
