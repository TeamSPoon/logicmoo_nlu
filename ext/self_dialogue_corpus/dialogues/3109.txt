ave you ever gone to a football game in Philadelphia?
Yes. It was an experience.
I know. The Eagles fans are crazy.
Yeah, but I guess fans for all teams get nuts.
Yes, but some of them get mean.
They think their team is unbeatable.
Too bad they haven't had such great seasons.
They did have some real good players.
Donovan McNabb was a good one.
They retired his number.
I didn't know that.
Reggie White too.
That one I knew.
What's the name of their field?
I beileve it's the Lincoln Financial Field.
Did they just remodel that?
I'm not sure.
Their logo sure has improved over the years.
Yeah it has.
The Eagle from the early seventies was odd.
