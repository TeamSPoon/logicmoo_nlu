What do you think about hip hop now a days?
I think it is complete garbage?
Really why do you feel that way?
Have you heard the stuff it is complete poison.
No, its just about having fun.
I disagree, it is actually about selling drugs and gangbanging for the most part.
Well, what about the positive rappers?
The positive rappers are not given record deals.
Maybe their music is not as good.
Do you really feel that  that is the reason?
Sure, what else would it be?
Maybe the record label owners want to push a certain mindstate in the Black community.
Oh so your a conspiracy theorist.
This is beyond theory, starting with NWA hip hop was driven in a negative direction by record label execs.
Maybe that is what the people wanted to hear.
Maybe for some, but positve rapper was still quite popular, the negative rap was pushed and pushed and it eventually became popular.
Oh wow, I don't think it is that deep.
It certainly is.
You should lighten up.
You should wisen up, check up the website vigilantcitizen.com there is more going on in hip hop than you will ever know.
