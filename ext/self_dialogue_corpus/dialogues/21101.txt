What do you want to do this weekend?
Maybe we could go to the movies.
That sounds like fun. What would you want to see.
How about Beauty and the Beast.
Hmmm...I don't know about that one.
Why not?
I'm not really a fan of all these Disney, live-action, remakes.
I think they're cute.
I like most of the originals. It seems like a money making scheme to me.
I guess.
I say leave well enough alone.
Did you see Jungle Book.
Unfortunately.
Huh?!
I wasn't anywhere near as good as the animated version.
I admit it wasn't quite as good, but the CGI was amazing.
Yeah, it was pretty good, but that is difintely not something I rate movies on.
How do you mean?
I think it's a little over used these day, and most the time, not to a good affect.
Ok, well, what do you want to watch this weekend?
