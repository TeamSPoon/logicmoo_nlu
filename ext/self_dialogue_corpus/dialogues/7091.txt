What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lion King, easy.
Who is your favorite character?
I love Nala the best. She took care of her home and talked sense into Simba when he wanted to run from his problems.
Who is your least favorite character?
Probably Zazu, he's so uptight.
And your favorite scene from the Lion King?
I love the entire Hakuna Matata montage.
Oh that's a really good part.
Yes! The animation, the music, it was just cute and my favorite part of the movie.
