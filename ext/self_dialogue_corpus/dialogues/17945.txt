Are you a David Bowie fan?
I'm a major David Bowie fan! You too?
Mmm hmm.  He was pretty universal, in my eyes.
I know he was popular around the world.
Right. His music sold extremely well.
Something about his personality as well I think.
He was a cool cat, ha ha.
And he was out there in the sixties performing in a way ahead of the times.
What's an example of his early work you like?
Ziggy Stardust, Young Americans, and Rebel Rebel are some.
Love those. His early music has a much different sound from his later work to me.
I tend to like his earlier songs better.
Often the earliest work of a musician is the best.
Can be. Luke the artist has more angst then, or needs to prove himself.
Or because maybe he's a starving artist.
They say when he heard a Little Richard song, he said he heard God.
That's a serious statement!
Well he dud have a serious side.
What's a favorite later song?
Heroes...not that late but amazing.
