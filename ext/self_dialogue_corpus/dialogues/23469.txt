Hey did you see the new Jurassic Park movie?
Jurassic World?
Yeah the one with Chris Pratt.
No not yet, I've been kind of avoiding it so I don't ruin my childhood.
It's not the best film but it certainly won't ruin your memories of the first movie.
I'm glad you say first movie as I did not like Lost World.
Oh I know you didn't and that's why I'm confident you'll at least enjoy Jurassic World.
Does it try to play on our nostalgia by referencing past movies?
There are a few callbacks but nothing obnoxious or anything.
What about the whole idea of them genetically engineering dinosaurs?
I mean, how else are we going to get dinosaurs in this day and age?
Yeah but genetically creating some kind of super dinosaur seems a little lame.
You just have to watch it and see for yourself, I genuinely had a great time with the film.
Alright I'll check it out, but if I don't enjoy it you know who I'm messaging first.
I'll be waiting patiently to shield your attacks.
Are they making a sequel to Jurassic World?
I believe so, it did really well in theaters and Chris Pratt is hot right now.
Well then if this stinks then I'll know to blame your financial contribution to the sequel.
I'll be waiting patiently to shield that attack too.
Alright then off to watch some dinosaurs.
