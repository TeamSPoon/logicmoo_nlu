You know that new Transformers movie looks like it will be good.
Transformers 5? The Last Knight?
Yeah, man. What do you think?
You know I like my transforming robots. I grew up watching their cartoons.
Those were the days.
Good cartoons and good TV.
I was watching the trailer and the humans are at war with the Transformers.
That's no surprise. The humans are always at war.
What are you saying? Humans don't like peace?
Look around you and then you tell me.
True, true. But back to the movie, you know Optimus Prime is gone.
Yeah, saw that last movie. This is reminding me of the story they did in the cartoon.
Exactly. With Optimus gone Cade, Bumblebee, some English lord and an Oxford professor have to save the world.
So you think. Optimus will prevail in the end and save the day.
They say The Last Knight "shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero,"
Redefines what it means to be a hero?
The story picks up with Humans and Transformers warring, with Optimus Prime out of the picture.
Okay and?
In it they try to explain why the Transformers keep coming to Earth.
Because they are gluttons for punishment. Enough said.
