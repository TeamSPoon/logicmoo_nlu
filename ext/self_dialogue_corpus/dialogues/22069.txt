I see they're making a Justice League type movie.
Yeah, I hope it better than what DC seems to be putting out these days.
How are they going to bring back Superman?
What do you mean?
Remeber, they killed him in the last movie.
Oh, right! Batman vs. Superman.
That was awful.
Yeah, didn't really care for that flick myself.
Did you get a look at Aquaman?
I did. Right at the end in the pictures.
Yup.
Looks like that guy from Game of Thrones.
I think it is.
Kal Drogo, or whatever.
Yeah. Interesting choice for Aquaman.
Yeah, but that character needed a little updating.
Maybe a little, but this seems like a complete overhaul.
So it would seem.
Anyway, I still want to check out Justice Leage.
Yeah, me too.
