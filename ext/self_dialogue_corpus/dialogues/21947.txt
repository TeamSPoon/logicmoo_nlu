Even though I don't like fantasy movies in general, I like Harry Potter. What about you?
I love the Harry Potter movies. The whole franchise really.
Do you have a favorite movie?
That's really tough. I know my favorite book was the fourth, but for movies, it may be the first just because of the nostalgia.
Did you see all of them when they came out?
Oh yes. Midnight showings every year!
Have you seen the new related one.
Do you mean Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?
Yes, that one.
No, I haven't seen it but I really want to.
I didn't see it either. I'd like them to make The Cursed Child into a movie.
That would be pretty cool. I think there is a second Fanstastic Beasts coming out.
Oh, I hadn't heard that. Do you know who that actor is?
Isn't it Eddie Redmayne?
I think you are right. It's too bad they couldn't incorporate any of the Harry Potter actors.
Well, it was kind of a different story and a different world almost.
That's true. But I wouldn't mind seeing Daniel, Emma, or Rupert again.
Did you see Emma in Beauty and the Beast.
Yes. It was so good.
I love that Disney is remaking all of their animated movies into live action films.
