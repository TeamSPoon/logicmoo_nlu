Did you here about the new Frozen movie?
No I haven't heard anything about it.
I heard they are coming out with a sequel.
Oh, really.  My kids will be excited.
Yes mine will too, all except Bobby.  He hates those kinds of movies.
Well who wouldn't love to see Ana and Elsa?
Bobby says if he has to hear Do you want to build a snowman one more time he'll throw up.
HaHa that's Emily's favorite song of all time.
HaHA Jessica and Mariah love that song too.
We'll have to plan to take the girls and leave Bobby home with his dad.
