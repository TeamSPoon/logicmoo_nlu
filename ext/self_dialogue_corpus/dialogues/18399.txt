Can you please play the new Ed Sheeran CD?
What's it called?
"Divide." It's really good. I promise.
Would I know any of the songs on it?
I'm sure you would know "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill."
I didn't even know he sang those songs but I definitely hear them all the time on the radio.
Do you like them?
It's just not really the style of music I like.
What genre do you listen to?
Mostly just country music.
What artists?
Sam Hunt, The Rascal Flatts, and Zac Brown Band.
I'm not really a fan of Sam Hunt but I do like Zac Brown Band.
Really? What's your favorite song of theirs?
I don't think I can choose between "Colder Weather" and "As She's Walking Away."
Oh my gosh! I love "As She's Walking Away" and I feel like no one has ever heard it.
It's definitely one of their least played songs but I just love it so much.
Me too! I think it's the most played song on my iTunes.
Actually? I don't even know what my most played song is on iTunes.
You should look it up. It's a good thing to know.
