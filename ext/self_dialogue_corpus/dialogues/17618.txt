Have you heard of Dmitri Hvorostovsky?
No, who's that?
He's a opera singer from Siberia.
Do you like opera?
I'm liking it now because I've become such a fan of his.
How old is he?
He's in his 50s now. He's been around a long time, but I've just found out about him.
Have you been to one of his operas?
No, not yet. Unfortunately, he's stopped appearing in operas because he has a brain tumor. He only performs in concerts now.
Ooh, that's not good.
Yeah, he's been undergoing treatment for a few years, but it doesn't seem to be getting better. But his voice is spectacular.
What kind of voice does he have?
He's a baritone, almost a bass. But the beauty of his voice is what sets him apart from your typical opera singer, especially a man.
What do you mean by "beautiful?"
His voice is melodic and powerful and dramatic all at the same time. Plus, he's absolutely gorgeous.
What does he look like?
He has silver hair, and he's tall with a muscular physique.
Does he have any CDs I could listen to?
Several, and he sings a lot of Russian music. He's a very patriotic Siberian.
Maybe you'll be able to attend one of his concerts.
