Do you think they will make another 101 Dalmations move?
I don't know but I enjoyed the cartoon original.
I thought the one with the actress Glenn Close was very nicely done.
Yes it was, she played a great role in that one.
Do you think a new cartoon version would be similar to the original?
I imagine it would be much better with all the special effects they have.
Do you think they would change the music to be a little more modern?
I would think so but I would hope they would keep some of the original score as well.
I loved the puppies in the movie version.
They were absolutely adorable!
