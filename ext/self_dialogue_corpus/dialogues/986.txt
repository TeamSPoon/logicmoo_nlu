So it looks like the Texans are getting a new Quarterback coach.
Really? Do you know who?
Yes, Sean Ryan is his name.
Right on. Is he any good?
Yeah. He was the recievers coach but thet bumped him up for 2017.
Very cool. I hope he works out.
Me too, i'd really like to see the Texans go to the palyofs this season.
I would as well. I'm thinking the Cowboys wont.
I agree. Tom Savage says he's looking forward to the new coarh.
Hopefully he will help Savage get that ball downfield.
Yeah, Osweiler was pretty useless last season as a coach.
True. I think he did nothing for Savage last year.
Yes, when a coach gets a 40 million dollar contract, he better help the QB get the ball to the end zone.
FORTY million?
Yes, he was getting paid more than top players.
That's sad.
I have a feeling this season will be much better.
I'm hoping it does.
Well, we'll know in less than 90 days.
I know, i cant wait!
