Did you watch the Billboard Music Awards?
Of course! I wouldn't miss it!
It was a blast! What was one of your memorable moments?
You know I'm a sucker for K-Pop, so it had to be BTS' debut at the BBMAs!
I was so surprised by their win! Were you?
I was as well! I cried and sobbed for a couple of minutes.
You really are a fan! I can't believe they beat out Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber!
It was a beautiful moment.
Speaking of Justin Bieber, what do you think of his new song?
Which one are you talking about? The Spanish one?
Yes! "Despacito" with collaboration with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee!
That song is the bomb! Also, Justin's Spanish isn't bad at all.
I want to dance every time I hear that song!
Me too, I just play it whenever I want an upbeat song.
Justin is doing really well huh? He's staying low but has been collaborating with so many great artists lately.
I would have to agree.  Do you have a favorite of his other works?
I really like "Let Me Love You" with DJ Snake! What's your favorite?
That song rocks! My favorite would have to be "Cold Water."
Is that his collaboration with Major Lazer?
Yes, that one is pure perfection.
