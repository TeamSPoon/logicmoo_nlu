Have you ever listened to the Beatles?
Yes, they are one of my favorite bands.
Which one is your favorite Beatles?
I would say John Lennon is my favorite.
I would say Paul McCartney is mine.
What songs do you like from them??
I really like Strawberry Fields Forever and Yellow Submarine.
Nice, I love those two songs as well. I also like most songs from the album Help! as well.
I wish there were new music sounded like this.
I agree with you, older music is so much better than what is popular nowadays.
