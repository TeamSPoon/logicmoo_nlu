What do you know about the NFL?
I know a little bit. The Steelers are my favorite team.
Oh nice, I don't really have a favorite team. Who does Aaron Rogers play for?
He plays for the Green Bay Packers.
Oh wasn't he in the news for something recently?
I think he broke up with his girlfriend.
Oh that's right! Who was he dating?
I think it was Olivia Munn.
I think that's right. How are the Steelers doing?
They did pretty well last season. They went 11-5.
Oh that is pretty good! Who are their best players?
Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown are both pretty good.
Yeah, I have heard of them. Who is their biggest rival?
People in Ohio are pretty serious about the Browns-Steelers rivalry.
Oh interesting. The Steelers are much, much better that the Browns though, right?
Correct. The Browns have not had a winning season in a very long time.
Who is that one player for the Browns who is always getting in trouble?
Oh, do you mean Johny Manziel?
Yes! That is who I am thinking of.
Yeah, he actually doesn't play for the Browns anymore, but there are rumors that he might play for Dallas this year.
