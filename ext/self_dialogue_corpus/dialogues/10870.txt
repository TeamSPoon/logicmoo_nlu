How do you feel about the Fast & Furious series?
I love those movies. Honestly, it's my favorite film franchise ever.
So you actually like the entire series, movie by movie?
Yes. Well, there's one thing that kind of bothers me.
What's that?
Probably the naming. Over the years, they've had some pretty odd names.
The fourth one was literally just Fast & Furious, wasn't it?
Yeah, that one has my least favorite title.
It's my least favorite everything.
I can understand that.
