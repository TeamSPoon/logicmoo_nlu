What movie do you reel like watching?
I'm kind of in the mood for a thriller.
Action or suspense thriller?
I was thinking like Olympus has Fallen.
That one was awesome. Gerard Butler is always great.
He's one of my favorites.
Have you seen the second one?
They made two?
Yeah, the second one is London has Fallen.
Problem solved, we are watching that right now.
