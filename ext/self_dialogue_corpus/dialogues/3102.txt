Remember Mark Sanches?
Oh wwo, i havent thought of him in YEARS.
Yeah, everyone thought he was the next Joe Namath.
Yes, there was a rumor the coach had a tattoo of him on his arm, that's how sure he was gonna make the Jets a dynasty.
Yes but you know what he's always gonna be known for, right?
The "Butt Fumble"
Oh man, that was so funny.
I remember. This guy was suppose to be the next hero and then got lost in obscurity.
Butt Fumble. Man, it's been so long since i heard that.
I know, right?
Any idea what he is doing now?
No clue.
I think The Fridge took over for infamy around that time.
Yes, i think if the "Butt Fumble" and Perry had not got famous, Sanchez would have been one of the greats.
You think?
No doubt. He was taking off back then.
That's too bad.
My thoughts exactally.
Who replaced him on the Jets?
I don't know, i'll have to look it up.
