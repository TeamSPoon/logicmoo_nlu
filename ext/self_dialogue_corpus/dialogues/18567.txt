I wish No Doubt was still together.
Talk about a great band.
But then Gwen Stefani went solo.
I don't like her solo work.
Pretty Hip-Hoppy.
Yeah, No Doubt was the best though.
She does have a unique voice.
Kinda reminds me of Cindy Loper.
Another great vocalist.
Did you hear that Gwen Stefani got a divorce?
Who was she married to?
The lead singer from Bush.
Oh, yeah. They were together for a while, huh?
Decades.
Those things never work out.
Now she's on to Blake Shelton.
The country singer?
Yeah.
They were on The Voice together.
I think that's how things got started.
