What are some movies that you would recommend for guys?
New films?
No they can be from any point in time.
I'd have to say all of the "Die Hard", "Rocky" series and the front half of the Terminator series.
Why only the front half?
The tail end of the series starting going all girl power on the audience. It was a real turn off.
Oh yeah, now I remember.  Sarah turned into some kind of tough woman that don't need a man. I thought it was pretty funny.
Yeah thats the problem. It was funny.
Seems like you hated it.
Yeah I did. I don't like whn a serious toned movie is turned into a comedy. It really ruins the series.
Where would you say you would stop watching the series?
I'd stop watching at Terminator 2 personally, but part 3 is watchable.
Wait in part 2 Sarah was a pretty tough individual.
Yes, but it wasn't forced and she grew into that from the first film.
Yes, now that you mention it I see the character development.
Now in the later films she's just magically this rough and tough person that has everything figured out.
They never explained it?
No, not at all. What's worse is the actress wasn't even convincing. She literally looked like she was putting on an act.
How was Linda Hamilton when she played the role?
She was very believeable and natural.
