What was the first concert you ever went to?
I saw Buckcherry when I was in High School?
Who are they?
They are newer rock band.
I have never heard of them.
They are not a huge name but played quite a bit around my home town.
Neat.  Any songs I might have heard?
I doubt it.
What is the name of a popular one?
The song "Sorry" is pretty popular.
Nope I have never heard of that.
How about "Everything"?
That sounds familiar.
It is a good one.
Did they put on a good show?
I sure thought so, but it was my first concert so I may have been a bit bias.
Understood.
Do you remember your first concert?
I do, same thing I probably thought it was better than it really was.
They are great memories though.
