What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.
It's mine too! What's your favorite part?
When Han gets frozen and Leia tells him she loves him.
That part's great. My favorite is when Han is looking for Luke on Hoth.
Why is that your favorite part?
I really like how loyal Han is to Luke. It makes me happy.
Han is very loyal.
Lando isn't loyal though. He betrayed Han and his friends.
That's true, but if he didn't Leia would never had said she loved him.
