I was really interested in how well Ariana Grande's Manchester show did to help raise money for the bombing victims, so I went to look it up online.
I heard it was a sold-out show. With Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, and Katy Perry joining Ariana, I can imagine those tickets sold really fast.
Yeah, and you know those people are going to need a lot of financial help, funerals, medical bills, follow up care.
So how much did the show raise?
That was what was confusing. The first ten results on the Google page all showed different results.
Was it because of the difference in dollars and euros?
No. It said in millions- $13, E2, $9, E2.35, $3, $12, $2.6, $3, and E10. The numbers were all over the place.
That seems strange. You would figure tickets sales would be a pretty static number.
Unless they are somehow adding other donations in there. But it makes it seem suspicious that no one is reporting the same number.
Maybe they just have really bad press communications.
