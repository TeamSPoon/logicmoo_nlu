Who's going to be the worst team in the NFL this year?
Is it wrong that my mind instantly flashes to the Browns?
Haha, can't blame you. They've been bad for a while.
That said, I actually liked their draft last year.
But is that going to be enough to change their fortunes next year?
It might take a couple of years, and a few more good drafts.
Yeah, they've certainly had some bad drafts in recent years.
What about the 49ers?
They're a contender for worst team, if only because I don't like their quarterbacks.
The surest way to have a terrible record in the NFL is to have no stability at the QB position.
I think the 49s could bounce back a little, though. They have some some talent.
How about good old Jacksonville?
Now there's a team with talent! If Jacksonville could figure out the QB position, I think they could be really good.
I guess that's what picking at the top of the draft year after year does for you.
Yeah, they've stock piled some really good players, especially on defense.
I still think the Jaguars will underperform this year.
I wouldn't bet against you.
I think the Bears will be better, so my final answer is the 49ers.
Fair enough. They really do need to figure out their QB situation.
Yep, and I don't think they get it done.
