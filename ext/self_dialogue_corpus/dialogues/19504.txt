What did you think of the newest Kendrick Lamar album?
Damn? I thought it was fantastic.
To be honest, I didn't like it all that much.
Why not? It has arguably some of Kendrick's best work on it.
I don't know. I guess the lead single kind of turned me away from it.
So you didn't actually listen to the whole album?
Alright, you got me. I didn't.
So then why are you judging it?
I'm just afraid that the one song sets the tone for the whole album, and I really don't like that style of rap.
I can understand that judgement for the song, but not the whole album. You really should listen to it.
Is it as good as To Pimp a Butterfly?
Maybe not as good, but it really isn't that far behind. I have some songs that you might like.
Alright then. Which ones.
I highly recommend DNA, Element, XXX, Lust, Fear, and Duckworth. Those are the more lyrically profound ones on the album.
Do they have good beats?
Of course. Some of them are more catchy, while other ones are more atmospheric.
Is there a best song on the album, at least in your opinion?
Definitely Fear. It's incredibly atmospheric and tells a great story about Kendrick himself.
That sounds good. How long is it?
It's actually 7 minutes long, so you're definitely in for a treat.
