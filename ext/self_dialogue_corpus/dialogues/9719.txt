so what do you think about hip hop music?
I listen to them a lot, they tend to be very loose and ruthless, haha
true, I feel sometimes people just need that kind of vibe as a mean of release from society's pressure
I agree, this category of music is a lot of times, violent and contains a lot of dirty lines. But you know what?
what?
I like them, I listen to them everyday.
me too.
Is there a favorite artist in this category?
If I have to choose, it could be Lil Uzi  Vert
Ahh, I heard of his music.
