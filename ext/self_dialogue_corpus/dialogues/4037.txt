Have you seen Saw?
Yeah that was awesome.  Every second you were completely fooled.
Tell me about it.  That guy on the floor the whole time was Saw.
Yeah, and the guy he was chasing seemed like a genius in his own right.
Yep, but he was just another pawn.
That's what was so crazy.  The whole time you thought wrong.
Yeah, and it shows how smart Saw himself really is.
I know, and how about those puzzles he left?
Yeah they were crazy.  Basically kill someone you love or die yourself.
Yeah, it was like all a distraction, look here so we can fool you.
