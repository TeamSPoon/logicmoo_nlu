Did you ever see Ferris Bueller's Day off?
I'd seen it a lot growing up.
I always wanted to skip school like that when I was young.
Yeah, Ferris Bueller seemed so cool.
He seemed like the nice type of cool guy though.
Yeah, the one that could always get out of trouble.
I loved when he was racing home.
Yeah, that was great.
Who was it that played his sister?
Wasn't it Jennifer Grey?
