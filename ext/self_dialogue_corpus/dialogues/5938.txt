Do you know what surpises me about Frozen?
Frozen the cartoon?
Yeah, the Disney movie.
What about it?
Well, it's been so popular for years.  And off of one cartoon.
Okay.  What's your point?
Well, they could have easily turned it into an animated series.
I guess they could have, but why?
What do you mean, why?
It's already super popular.  It's not like they need to extend its popularity.
