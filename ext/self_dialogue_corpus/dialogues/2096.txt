So what do you think about the NFL this year?
It's hard to get excited, with the Bears basically in a rebuild.
Yeah, nothing is more underwhelming than Mike Glennon. Not bad, but not thrilling.
Right. Hopefully Trubisky shows up earlier than expected.
I don't feel great about that pick. The history of Bears QBs and all that.
Gotta hope. At least we get a new GM if he flops.
Yeah, but Pace will have at least another couple years.
I'm not looking forward to another transition, though.
Agreed. Flip flopping from a 4-3 to a 3-4 takes enough time.
I feel bad for the other side of the ball, too.
Jordan Howard emerges, but it's on a team going nowhere.
Right, and who knows which receivers will be healthy by week three.
But then Kevin White is almost like a rookie again, so there's hope.
A rookie with no good ankles. I'm not optimistic.
What do you think about the real rookies, other than Trubisky?
It's awfully small-school heavy.
You mean the TE, Shaheen?
I was thinking about that tiny 3rd-down back they took later.
You don't like Tarik Cohen?
If he turns into the next Devin Hester, fine, but there aren't too many of those.
