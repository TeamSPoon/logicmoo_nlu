Did you watch the movie The Jungle Book which was released last year.
Absolutely ! I rarely miss any such movies based on animals and people living in jungles.
I really liked the kid who portrayed the role of Mowgli. I think, he acted really well !
Oh yes, he sure did. But, I liked the animations and animals in the movies as well, especially his wolf mother.
It's amazing how they keep re-inventing an old movie. I think it is inspired by their first release in 1967.
Sure it was. I liked that one as well. I think it was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman.
By the way, it was a super-hit then and it is a super hit now.
Oh yes ! I think the new one has a business of more than 990 million dollars. Wow, almost a billion.
I am surely looking forward to their next movie on such a topic.
Well, don't have to high hopes. They have a tendency of not working on a similar movie for very long time.
