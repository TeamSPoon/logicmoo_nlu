How familiar are you with 80s music?
I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I am familiar with some of the popular ones.  I love "Don't You," by Simple Minds.
That's a classic!  It's forever intertwined with 'The Breakfast Club.'
One of my all time favorite movies with one of my favorite songs.  How about yourself?
My favorite 80s song is hands down, "Take on Me."
Who's that by?
It's by A-ha.
I don't think I've ever heard it.
It's so good.  You'll definitely recognize it if you hear it.
I'll have to look it up later.
I'll send you a link.  Another one of my favorites is 'Billie Jean.'
That's a good one.  Would you consider loving all of Michael Jackson's work, as liking 80s music as a whole?
To a degree, yes.  He was such an influential figure in music at that time.
You must really love 80s music.
I really do.  From rock, to glam metal, and especially New Wave.
What's New Wave?
Think, Duran Duran or The Police.
Does synth pop fall under that?
I'd say synth pop was an important element of the genre.
I see.  In that case, I guess I like 80s music too!
