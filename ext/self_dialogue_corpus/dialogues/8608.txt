Whose you favorite rock band?
Hard to say, who'd have to be more specific like what's my favorite heavy metal band.
Okay, so what's your favorite heavy metal band?
That would have to be Metallica.
Okay, I can see that. What are some of your favorite Metallica song?
Well, Ride the Lighting is one.
That is a good one, but what about Master of Puppets?
I love that one! My Metallica t-shirt has the cover from that album on it!
Okay, so you are a very big fan.
Not a "camp out for a week to get tickets" type of fan, but a pretty good fan.
