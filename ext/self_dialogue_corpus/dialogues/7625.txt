What is your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
I liked the sixth one.
What did you like about that?
I liked the story of Tom Riddle.
He seemed like an innocent kid.
Yeah, he seemed independent and ambitious.
He stole the stuff at the orphanage. But kids tend to grow out of that.
He didn't play by the rules.
He really hated muggles.
He had a tragic story.
