What is your favorite genre of movies?
I love superhero movies. All of the movies based on, books I absolutely love.
Me too I grew up collecting comic books with my dad so love every single one of them.
When they first started a while ago with the Iron Man movie I was in heaven.
Marvel is amazing. Every single one of their movies is fantastic.
When the first avengers movie came out it was like a boyhood dream of mine to see them on the big screen
Seeing the Thor, the hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man together was the best
What about the DC movies like Superman, suicide squad, and Batman versus Superman
I like them, but DC movies have been nowhere near as good as marvels.
Superman V Batman was OK, but nothing great.
I thought Suicide Squad was surprisingly good.
Me too, I didn't think it would be that good but I really enjoyed it.
I thought all of the different characters were a good mixture together.
I thought deadshot and Harley Quinn were fantastic. Will Smith and Margaret Robbie did a great job
The best DC movie they've made so far was Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds nailed that one.
Good call, the movie was funny as hell.
I think Deadpool being rated R took it to a new level.   I could just do what they wanted to and didn't have to worry about being too child sensitive
I think Deadpool 2 will be funny also. I can't wait to see it.
The next two movies I'm really excited about our Thor Ragnarok and Spiderman homecoming.
The trailers for both look really good. When Thor sees the Hulk, in the battle dome and gets excited is very funny.
