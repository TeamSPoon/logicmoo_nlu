Do you like cello music?
Yes I love yo yo ma.
Have you heard YoYo Ma's version of the  Bach Cello Suite No.1 in G Major?
It is so good. He is such a talent it amazes me.
The things he can do with those strings. I am always amazed.
I am in awe always of his skill.i think he may be the best cellist ever.
He is certainly world renowned.
Well he is pretty multicultural himself.
Oh ya? Where was he born?
He was actually born in france. But is chinese american as well.
He went to school in new york though right?
Yes child prodigy. .. of course.
I believe he was like 4 or something ridiculously young.
I don't think I could tie my shoes yet at 4. Puts me to shame.
So rare to be skilled at anything at 4.
He certainly deserves his 18 grammy awards.
Woah, I did not realize he had so many.
Pretty much a lifetime of work.
I wonder if he feels he missed out on his childhood.
I wonder, michael jackson seemed to feel that way.
