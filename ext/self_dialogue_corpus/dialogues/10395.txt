What kind of movies do you like?
I enjoy comedies.
Me too! I love them.
Yes they bring something not too serious into the world that is too negative.
I agree what is your favorite comedy?
I really like anything by Adam Sandler.
He is great and so funny.
Yes I love the movie Happy Gilmore.
That is Hilarious I love the Waterboy.
They are just silly movies that are good for a laugh.
When you think about it all of Sandlers movies are actually really good.
I just recently watched one with him in it where he is a manager for failing stars.
I think I saw that on Netflix.
You should watch it. He does a great job in character.
I will check it out. He reminds me of Caddyshack type movies.
Yes now that is old school.
I think Adam's movies are old school to this generation.
This is true. The comedies now are pretty crude.
The last good comedy I saw was Step Dad.
That was such a funny movie.
