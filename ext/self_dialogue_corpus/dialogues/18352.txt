I'm trying to think of some songs that have to do with dogs.
Why?
My aunt is having a birthday party for her dog and wants to play dog music.
Oh. OK.
I know it's weird, but she really loves her dog.
Well, the first couple that pop into my mind are How Much is That Doggie in the Window and Who Let the Dogs Out.
I know the second one, but not the first one.
It's an older song by a singer names Patti Page.
Any more ideas?
There's Hound Dog, Puppy Love and I'm Gonna Buy Me a Dog.
I'll add those to my list. I was also thinking of using the song Old Yeller.
From the movie?
Yes and I also like The Puppy Song.
Who sings that song?
Harry Nilsson.
I don't know who he is.
He was around in the 1970s.
Well, I think I'm off to a good start with my songs.
I hope you enjoy the party.
Thanks and thanks for helping me.
