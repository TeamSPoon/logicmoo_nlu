Did you ever see The Departed?
Yeah. Why?
I hadn't seen it and was wondering if I should.
You must!
Who's in it?
Everybody!
That's not true.
Exaggerating...
Really, who's in it.
Jack Nicholson...
Oh, he's good!
Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon...
Both great!
Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin...
Ok, ok...Everybody!!
Martin Scorsese directed.
Wow. I will definitely watch it.
You must!
Headed home to watch it now!
Good!
