Which one of the Disney classic films you like the most?
I don't really have a favorite.  But if I had to pick, it would be Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is a nice classic.  Isn't that's with the lost boys?
Yes, and Wendy and her little brothers too.
I like the dog in the movie. He was funny.
I think the dog was a she and was the babysitter.
Yes, the dog was the nurse-maid and followed them around everywhere.
But the dog didn't go to the land of the lost boys with them.
How many lost boys were on the island?
Not sure, I think there was about 12 or 13 of them around that island.
