What kind of guitars do you like?
I like fenders.
Why?
There are plenty of reason.
Give me your top 3 reason.
They have a rich sound, the guitar necks are thin, and a classic body.
That's true.
What kind of guitars do you like?
I love the classic Gibson.
Led zipplin used Gibson's.
That's why.I saw how that liked on stage and sounded live, and I feel in love.
They are just as good as fenders.
I'm selling one.
Really?
Would you like to buy it?
Not really.
Listen to zipplin tonight and you'll change your mind.
I'll check it out.
Also,check out Jimmy Hendrix.
Ok I will
