Who was the better Van Halen singer?
There was what, three of them?
I think so.
I would go with David Lee Roth.  Can't beat the original.
Sammy Hagar was no slouch though.  They arguably had better commercial success with him.
They sold some records no doubt, but Roth will always be the king.
It's funny that no one can even remember Gary Cherone was the singer once.
That album was junk though.
I don't even think I kept it after I bought it.
I don't really consider it a Van Halen album to be honest.
