Did you watch the Yankee's at all this weekend?
Yeah, they were supposed to play on Saturday but it got rained out.
When are they having the make-up game?
They actually had it the next day, on Sunday.
But didn't they already have a game scheduled on Sunday?
Yep, they ended up having a double header.
Wow, a double header on Mother's Day?
Not only that, it was Derek Jeter day.
Isn't he already retired?
Yeah, exactly.  They had a ceremony to retire his number.
How long ago did he retire?
About three years ago.  It was a long day of baseball, but it was really good.
What did they do for the ceremony?
Well, they actually gave him a stone in Monument Park.  His whole family was there and they gave him a plaque that was a mini-version of his Monument Park stone.
Wow, I did't realize he was that influential of a player.
Sure, he's up there now with all the greats.  Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle...
I know he was really well known, but was he actually that good?
Oh for sure!  He's their all-time leader in hits, at-bats and stolen bases.
I had no idea.  So did they win the games?
They won the first but lost the second.  It was pretty close at the end though, it looked like they were gonna come back.
