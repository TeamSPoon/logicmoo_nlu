What was the name of the princess in that one Disney movie?
Uh, need a bit more help than that.
Sorry, the princess in Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, her name is Aurora.
Ah, gotcha.  Wasn't her dress blue?
It was actually blue and pink.
I only remember blue.
It actually switched.  If you recall, the fairies kept changing it.
Right.  That's how they eventually were found.
Correct.  It was kind of their fault actually!
