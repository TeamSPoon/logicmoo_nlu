I'm ready for football season. What about you?
Yes, I'm ready to see what the Falcons are going to do this year. Who do you think will win it all?
Definitely the Cowboys.
The Cowboys haven't won since the 90's and they lost their whole secondary last year.
The Falcons got demoralized last year. They blew a 25 point lead.
All Cowboys fans are the same. They think they will win it every year.
That what all fans suppose to think.
Well if that is the case, Go Falcons.
You can't come back from what happened last year.
We are closer to the big dance than the Cowboys.
We will see. When we make it, we won't blow a lead like that.
They won't make it.
Ok, I hear you.
Dez Bryant sucks and always having emotional breakdowns.
After last year Superbowl, I'm sure the whole Falcons team had an emotional breakdown.
The Falcons is solid on both sides of the ball. Dallas still needs pass rushers and corners.
Every year our defense is so weak but Rod Marinelli scheme is so good that he covers up those holes.
I see all the holes every year.
Also we control the pace of the game and Dak proved in the playoffs that he is capable of leading a comeback.
He also shows that he is incapable of getting to the big game.
