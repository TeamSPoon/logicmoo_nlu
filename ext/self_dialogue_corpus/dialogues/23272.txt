You might laugh but I just saw the Lego Movie.
Awww... I heard good things about it.  How did you like it?
I was in stitches the entire time.
That good huh?
Totally.  And the song, I can't get it out of my head.
What's the song?
Everything is Awesome.  Really upbeat.
Ha ha. Can you stand it?
Chris Pratt was the main character.  Kind of your average Joe.
He can do that.  Did it in The Office.
Elizabeth Banks was his love interest.  An action-girl all dressed in black.
She liked him?
No not at first. Will Ferrell was the bad guy.
Kinda hard to see that.
I guess you had to be there.  Chased the Legos all over for Crazy Glue.
Sounds kinda cute.  So you liked it.
They had Batman, Superman, Green Lantern...just about every super hero.
Really?
I mean it! In the end a kid saved the day.
Sounds pretty good.
