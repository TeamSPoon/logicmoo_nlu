What is your favorite Disney movie?
Hmm, I don't know, they're all so good!
If you had to pick one or two, though
Well, maybe the one with the three witches
And the glass slippers?
I think that's the one- with the handsome prince?
Yes, I love the pumpkin chariot part
And the little mouse?
I don't remember a mouse
Or was it a raccoon?
