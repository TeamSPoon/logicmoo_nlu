A lot of people disagree with me here, but I'm a big fan of The Matrix sequels.
Really? I like the first one but I think the sequels are pretty bad.
Yes, that is a common sentiment. However I think they are underrated.
Why do you say so?
The lore of the Matrix is very deep and interesting and it's expanded vastly in the sequels.
I've never really looked into it, to be honest.
The lore also extends beyond just the films.
How so?
To fully understand the story of The Matrix, you have to watch the Animatrix, which is a anthology film that provides the backstory.
I've heard about that, but never watched it.
You also must play the video game, "Enter the Matrix" which takes place during the events of The Matrix Reloaded.
I have actually played that game. It's not very good.
Yeah, it got poor reviews from fans and critics. It does however contain over an hour of original footage. So it's worth it just for that, if you're a Matrix fan.
So the story is deeper than, "Machines enslave humans and plug them into a virtual world?"
Oh yes, the film series is deeply philosophical and tackles subjects such technophobia, hero-worship, and the essence of humanity.
Are you sure you're not just exaggerating because you're a fan?
I guess that's possible, but you should check it out yourself. There are a load of interesting characters.
Maybe I will.
Not to mention all the amazing action scenes.
I'll give you that. The highway chase scene in Reloaded was pretty amazing.
