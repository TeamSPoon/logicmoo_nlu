Who won game 6 between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
The Wizards did, but just barely, and only because John Wall made a game-winning three.
John Wall is a terrific player, one of my favorites to watch.
He could have been MVP if it weren't for James Harden and Russell Westbrook getting all those triple-doubles.
Which team do you think will win this series.
I don't know, because neither team seems to want it bad enough. Regardless, the Cavaliers will beat either team to get to the Finals.
So are you saying there will be a Warriors-Cavaliers rematch?
It could happen, but the Warriors have to go through the Spurs first, and the Spurs aren't easy to beat.
Do you think LeBron James is as good as Michael Jordan?
It's hard to say. I think time will tell.
I ask because Jordan has six championships, but LeBron only has half that amount.
True, but LeBron has some years of basketball still yet to play. He has time to win three more.
Right, but he'll probably have to hurry. The Cavaliers won't stay this good forever, unless they're the Spurs.
Yeah, because the Spurs are good every year, regardless of who plays for them. I don't know how they do it.
So, where will game 7 be played at?
It will be played in Boston, and, come to think of it, the Celtics will win just because of that.
I agree. The Wizards barely won at home, and they surely aren't going to survive a hostile environment like Boston.
Right. Plus there is too much green painted on that parquet basketball court.
Not only that, but Isaiah Thomas will step up at the right time, and so will his teammates.
I agree. This is Boston's best team since the big 3 of Garnett, Pierce, and Allen.
