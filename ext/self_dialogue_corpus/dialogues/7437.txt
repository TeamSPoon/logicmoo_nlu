Omg, have you seen the poster for the upcoming movie, Cars 3?
No i haven't
You should totally do it, i think they're making a twist in the story.
Oh really? I hope that doesn't involve taking off to any of the original characters...
Well, i guess we will have to find out.
That's sounds like a plan, what are you up to this afternoon?
Um, not much, why?
We should go to the premier this night.
Oh i would love to, i really loved the last one.
Me too, then it's a date. I will pick you up at 10:00pm
