Did you hear that Prodigy died?
Oh, that's so said!  I'll have to drink a Guiness to him.
I loved Mobb Depp! One of my favorite groups.
Yeah, that and Black Star.
Did you know that Nas inspired his lyrics.
No, but that doesn't suprise me.  They are both super deep.
I think Infamous was their best album.
Yeah, it's great.  But I like Hell on Earth better.
Did you like Infamy?
Hey man, it's better than no Mobb Depp at all.
