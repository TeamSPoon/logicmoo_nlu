Who were some of your favorite bands in the 1990s?
I really liked Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana
Ah yes two great ones.
Yeah, Nirvana didn't last too long
Well what do you expect when the lead singer dies
True. Pumpkins went on to have some good success.
Yeah, but then they kind of fell off as well.
True. What about you, who were some of your favorite bands?
I really liked Pearl Jam and Green Day
Yeah, they were pretty good. Had plenty of relevance into the 2000s.
Yes they did.
Secretly I also liked Spice Girls
Oh man talk about a guilty pleasure
Well their songs were catchy and they were very attractive
Have you tried listening to their songs today?
Not really.
Well do yourself a favor and don't. They do not hold up well at all.
Okay good to know.
Spice Girls. Man don't ever tell anyone else that you liked them.
Hey, I take offense to that.
