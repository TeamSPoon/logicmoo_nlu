have you seen the national tv schedule for this coming nfl season?
no not yet. why, what's up?
they got some good games hitting the airwaves right off the bat.
well i know the chiefs and patriots are the first game of the season.
yeah, and then opening monday night you got saints vikings and chargers broncos.
man. chargers broncos is gonna be lame.
why you say that?
who is denver's quarterback?
i don't know.
exactly. and phillip rivers might be on the down-slide.
well week two you got patriots saints on cbs early game.
now that should be a good one. drew brees is still a gunslinger.
end of september you got raiders washington for the sunday night nbc game.
if kirk cousins plays like he did two seasons ago, that might be a good one.
i think cousins still has some gas in the tank.
well he should. i think this is the season that he will be playing for a contract.
i know right. ain't this the second year in a row the skins slapped that franchise tag on him.
i think so.
they just messing up a dude's bread.
you know. watch him mess around and get hurt this season.
