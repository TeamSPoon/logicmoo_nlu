Have you ever listened to Rush?
Rush, are you kidding, that is my favorite band of all time!
Whoa, really?  They are mine too, they are incredible and have been around forever.
I have seen them in concert over 20 times!
I've seen then nine times, and that is not enough for sure.  They are so talented.
You know, my favorite album is "All The World's A Stage", Bytor is so cool played live
I agree, but I have to say I am a huge fan of Moving Pictures and no, not because of "Tom Sawyer"!
Hey, I'm glad to hear that because I was thinking maybe you were a "fake" fan that knew the three radio friendly songs and that's it.
Are  you kidding, Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, now that's what I'm talking about on Moving Pictures
Ok, I see you do know your Rush, hey, let's go listen to Hemispheres!
