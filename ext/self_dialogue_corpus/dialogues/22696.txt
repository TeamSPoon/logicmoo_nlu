Did you hear they are finally making a movie of "The Dark Tower"?
Like the Stephen King books?
Yep!
That's awesome! I can't believe they haven't done it before.
Me neither, I've been waiting for years and years.
Which of the books will it cover?
I think it's supposed to be a continuation or a retelling or something, I didn't really understand.
I'll have to look it up.
Guess who they have playing the gunslinger?
The gunslinger, Roland?
Yes.
Who?
Idris Elba.
Wow! That's a really cool choice. Who do they have playing R.F.
I think they're not going to call him Randall Flag, and go by the other name, but it's Matthew McConnaughey.
Matthew McConnaughey? Really? I can't imagine him as an evil-incarnate villain.
In the trailer, it looks like it works.
Can you send me the link to the trailer?
Sure will!
Thanks! I can't wait to watch it.
