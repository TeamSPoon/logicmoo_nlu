What do you think of the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
It's terrible!
I know. I wish they were less nomadic.
Me too.
It will be good, however, to have a team in Las Vegas.
Yes, I can't wait to catch a game while I'm there for business.
When's the stadium opening?
Las Vegas Stadium, the home of the Raiders, should be ready by 2020.
Wow, that's a long wait.
Yes, but it will be worth it.
True, but what should we do until then?
I think we should support the team.
Is the team more important than the location?
I think so. The Raiderss are famous for being tough irrespective of their location.
You think that toughness comes from the owners?
Yes, all owners choose values for their business.
And, the Raiders most value toughness?
I think so. But, they are also famous for being wild.
They try to live up to their name?
Yes, and they strive to live up to their logo -- football helmet-wearing pirate.
