Did you ever watch 'Avatar the Last Airbender?'
You mean the TV Show?
No, the movie adaptation by M. Night Shyamalan.
I did, and I completely regret it.
Me too.  What an awful movie adaptation.
Totally.  The acting was so poor.
And the writing and pacing were awful.
They also deviated so far from the original series in some aspects.
Which is crazy because the original source material is so good.  Why fix what isn't broken?
The original series was a fun, light-hearted adventure that grew in intensity and evolved as time went on.
Meanwhile, this version took out all the fun and made it gloomy and boring.
Who were the actors in this?
Noah Ringer was cast as Aang, apparently because of his martial arts abilities.
Which I think were amazing, but he did not have enough acting experience for that lead role.
I did think Dev Patel was good though as Zuko.
Oh, I like that actor too.  He was in 'Slumdog Millionaire' right?
Yes.  He was also in the movie 'Lion.'
What is that about?
It's about a boy who got lost in India as a child, and adopted by Australian parents.  Years later, he tracks down his biological family through Google.
Wow.  That's a movie I'd actually like to see.
