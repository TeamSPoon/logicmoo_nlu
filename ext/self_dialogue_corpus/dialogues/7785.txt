Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies?
Oh, yeah. I saw all of them in the theater when they came out.
Okay, so you remember what happened to Cedric Diggory, right?
Of course. That scene was absolutely heart rending.
Right? When they come out and Harry is crying over Cedric but the music just keeps playing, and everyone is clapping?
I still cry when I watch it and I've seen it like five times.
I know. The first time you see it you're just so shocked, but every time after that there is just a sense of dread before it happens.
Do you ever secretly root for him to live even though you obviously know he's going to die?
I thought I was the only one who did that!
Nope! I do it, too. Not just with Harry Potter, but with a bunch of other movies, too.
