Are you a big fan of comic book movies?
I like some of them, but I hate a lot of them too.
Which ones do you like?
My favorite are Marvel movies. Wolverine is my favorite character.
It's too bad that was the last one for Hugh Jackman.
I know, he's so great.
So what about after that, you like X-Men?
I definitely love X-Men, but I think my next favorite is the Avengers.
Do you like the movies based on one character or the group movies?
The best one is definitely the first Avengers movie, but I also like when they make movies based on one character.
Like Iron Man?
Iron Man is good. Robert Downey Jr. is really funny.
Any other ones?
Captain America is good too.
I just saw that new Guardian of the Galaxy movie.
Oh really? I can't wait to see that. How was it?
You will love it. Fantastic.
Better than the first one?
I wouldn't go that far, but pretty close.
Guess I better check it out!
