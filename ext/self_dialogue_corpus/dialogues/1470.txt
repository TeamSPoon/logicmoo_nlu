I can't believe there is only about a month and half before the NFL season begins.
It is getting closer.  Training camps are soon.
Is it the Cowboys that got Oxnard, California.
Yes they do and they have a brand new practice facility.
Well Jerry Jones is a showmen so I'm sure there are reasons.
You know it's all about the money!
Did the Redskins ever sing Kirk Cousins?
You know I'm not sure.
Last that I heard they were going to give him another franchise tag.
That's interesting.  I wander how many times they can do that?
It sucks that it's not a long term deal, but he gets paids a lot!
I can't figure him out he is kind of up and down.
He reminds me of Tony Romo.
Good comparison.  They are both kind of hit or miss.
Are they playing games in London again?
I believe so.  Jacksonsville somehow always gets stuck playing over there.
It seem like it would be cool for the fans, but not so much for the players.
Yes if your team was going to play there you could plan a nice trip around that game.
Let's get together on Sundays and watch some NFL football.
For sure I would.  I would enjoy that!
