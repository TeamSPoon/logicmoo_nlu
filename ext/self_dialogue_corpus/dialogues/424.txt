Hey man, do you follow football?
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan.
Lucky you, still enjoying the trophy?
Yeah right, that game was really crazy.
I hate the Patriots but even I have to admit that was insane.
Yeah man, I will never forget that win.
What do you think this year?
About the Patriots? They will probably go deep into the playoffs but I don't know about the Superbowl this year.
Why not?
I just think Brady is getting a little old, and he can still play well but I don't know about another Superbowl.
They are the best team in the league right now aren't they?
All-around, coaching included, probably yes, but the Falcons are going to be hot with revenge, man.
True that Atlanta coach is probably still fuming.
Plotting ways of revenge.
Hahaha, anyway, I think if the Patriots aren't the best team in the league the Seahawks are because of defense.
The Patriots have a nasty defense though too.
Yeah but they are all getting older and the rest of the league is figuring them out now.
You can study Tom Brady for years and still not have him "figured out". Look at the last Superbowl as an example.
Good luck this year man, try not to deflate any balls this time.
Very funny.
