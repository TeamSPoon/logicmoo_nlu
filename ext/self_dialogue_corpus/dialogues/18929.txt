Are you as into this 90s resurgence as I am?
Yes! The 90s were such a great time for music. Grunge was my life.
I know, right? I've been rocking out to Pearl Jam, Hole, Nirvana, Alice In Chains, if I don't stop, I may break out into flannel!!!
And combat boots! With flowers on them.
I wanted Shirley Manson's look from the Queer video so much.
Garbage's album was/is so good. Give me a good angry 90s grrl!
Riot grrls, those raw vocals, shocking lyrics and millions of baby barrettes.
Courtney Love was our goddess.
I lived for the alternative section but must confess, I liked a couple pop songs too.
Traitor! Preppy! Just kidding. Good music is good music.
Anyone who says they didn't sing along with Salt n Pepa's Shoop is a liar.
Exactly! A good song is a good song.
I drew the line at boy bands though. With the exception of some nkotb when I was like eight, I didn't see the appeal.
So manufactured. They could honestly have been animatronics and done the same songs.
Speaking of animatronics, I miss Major Magics.
Beatles covers and excellent pizza, plus Skeeball!
Ah, the Beatles. Some solid tunes but can you say overrated?
Yes and I can also say wife beaters shouldn't be martyred.
Oooh, there's that riot grrl! Meow!
Shut up. Love you!
