Hey, so what´s your favorite NFL team?
It was San Diego Chargers.
What do you mean it was?
Oh, because they are moving to LA.
No way! I did not know. So who is staying in San Diego.
Apparently, no one, we are very sad.
So will you still root for them?
No, I changed teams, now I am a fan of Raiders.
Oh yeah! I heard that they are moving to Vegas. What happened to the Chargers?
They his a couple of bad seasons, they will always do good at first on each game but after halftime they would always lose.
What a bummer. But does´t LA already have a team?
Yes they do! They have the LA Rams, so that will be a mess.
Oh well!. We´ll Im rooting for Denver Broncos.
Oh really? Who is their coach right now?
It´s Vance Joseph.
Oh yes you are right, for the Chargers is now Anthony Linn, the previous one was unfortunately fired.
Do you remember who was the MVP of 2016?
Yes I believe it was Matt Ryan.
You are so right. What team did he played for?
Oh that´s easy, he played for the Falcons.
