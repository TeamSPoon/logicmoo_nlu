Did you watch the Pens Caps series?
Yea Dude, the pens always seem to have the caps number in the playoffs.
That is true, I am not sure why the pens can't ever close them out before game 6 or 7 though, it makes me angry.
I wonder if Crosby's injury will affect him in the conference finals?
I would imagine that it would man, that looked brutal.
Yes, hockey is a violent game, but I love it.
What was your favorite series of all time as a pens fan?
I liked the 2009 stanley cup finals when we came back to win game 7 on the road.
My favorite game though was in 2008 in the 3OT match with the red wings. That seeme to go on forever.
WHat a great series that was as well, at least Pittsburgh got them back the next year at their place.
I believe the pens were only one of 2 teams to that point to win a game 7 on the road in a major league final, the other being the pirates in 1979. Both Pittsburgh teams.
But didn't the boston bruins win at vancouver in game 7 in 2011?
Yes, but as I said, up until 2011. That was also a great series, a lot of fighting and a beat down at the end.
Ha! Nothing like angry Canadians swearing at a short handed goal down big in a hockey championship.
I can't wait to see  how the penguins do this year in the conference finals. I hope the conference finals aren't as hard as last year when we played the lightning.
I am not looking foward to playing Montreal though, I hope we do better than last year.
I think we will be fine if we can get healthy and score.
The power play will be key.
We need Crosby and Malkin to really step up to win.
Maybe he can score a hat trick like back in January. Should be a good series!
