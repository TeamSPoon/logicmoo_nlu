What are your favorite Snape moments?
I loved his attitude when being questioned by that lady from the ministry.
Yeah, he was clearly unimpressed and let her know it.
And later when we find out he was saving Harry during that quiddich match.
Or how about when he was a kid talking to Lilly.
I know, that was emotional.  It showed he really was a person under that anger.
I loved when he showed his memory of being part of that master plan to kill Voldemort.
Who would of thought he was part of a master plan?
Yeah, the whole time we thought he was bad.
Well he was, until Voldy killed someone he loved.
