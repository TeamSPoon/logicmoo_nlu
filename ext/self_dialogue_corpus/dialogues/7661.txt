What house would you be?
Gryffindor for sure.
I don't think you're couragoues enough for them.  You seem more Hufflepuff to me.
Whatever, dude.  Hufflepuff is weak.
They're not all wussies.  That guy that died getting the goblet was amazing.
He's the rare exception.  Most Hufflepuff are wussies.
Well, in that case, most Gryffindor are untrusting.
Now you're just making things up.
Maybe you should have been Slytherin.
The sorting hat never lies!
