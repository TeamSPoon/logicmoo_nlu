What's your favorite movie?
I don't know, The Shawshank Redemption, maybe.
Yeah, that's a good one.  Based on a Stephen King story, right?
Yeah, like Stand by Me.
Oh, yeah.  It's been forever since I watched that.
Remember the leeches?
Yes!  Remember the story in it with all the vomiting?
Ugh, didn't like that part very much.
John Cusack was in that.
I don't think so.
Yeah, he was the older brother, in the flashbacks.
Oh yeah, I guess he was. Think that was one of his first roles?
He was in Sixteen Candles before that.
Sixteen Candles?
He played one of the geeks, you know, Farmer Ted's friends.
I don't remember that.
Remember when he needs the picture of the drunk girl and nice car?
Not really.  I didn't really like the movie, so I've only seen it once and that was a long time ago.
Oh, well, okay.  He was in Better Off Dead, too.
Oh my god, yes, that's a funny movie.
