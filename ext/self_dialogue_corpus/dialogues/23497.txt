What do you think of the new Spider-Man trailer?
For Homecoming? I think it looks great. Are you planning to watch it?
Oh, absolutely! With the trailer and with his appearance in Civil War, I feel like they finally nailed the Spider-Man character perfectly, and I'm so excited for him to get his own movie.
Me too. Not to say that any of the past ones were bad, though.
Not at all. Tobey Maguire's Spidey is still one of my favorites.
He really knocked it out of the park in Spider-Man 2. His whole storyline with Dr. Octopus was so good.
Agreed. I don't think he ever had a bad moment throughout his 3 movies.
I mean, Spider-Man 3 wasn't the best.
I'm going to be completely honest here, but I really liked Spider-Man 3.
What? That's a first!
I don't care. I liked seeing Venom and Sandman, and I thought it was nice to round off the storyline with Harry.
Harry's death scene was pretty sad.
Yeah, it was. The only one I could think of that might be sadder is when Gwen died in one of the newer ones.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2. That scene was heartbreaking.
I really liked the imagery in it with the web that he shot to try and catch her, with it looking like a hand and all. I thought that added a lot to the scene.
Same here. Also, I know there wasn't any blood or anything, but I thought the way she died was pretty brutal.
Understandable. My stomach dropped when I heard her hit the ground.
Yeah, that was pretty bad. Now that we're talking about it, The Amazing Spider-Man movies weren't that bad.
They weren't. I thought Andrew Garfield was a solid Spidey. Not enough to hold up to Tobey, though.
Well, we'll see if Tom Holland can outshine both of them.
