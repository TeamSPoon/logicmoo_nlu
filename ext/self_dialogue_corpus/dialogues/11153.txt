Are you wearing those earrings to your brother's wedding?
The skull ones? Yes.
It's a wedding, not a funeral. Wear something appropriate.
Okay. I'll wear my black rose earrings.
That's not much better. What else are you wearing?
My gothic cyber retro dress.
You're not serious are you?
What? My brother knows what I like to wear.
That's not important. It's a wedding, wear something nice.
What do you suggest then?
I'm glad you asked. I bought you this lovely teal dress with matching heels.
Teal? Really?
It came with a lovely handbag and lace gloves.
Teal isn't my color, you know that.
Too bad. You're wearing it.
Maybe I can mix it up with something in my wardrobe.
With what? All you have is black.
That's not true.
Isn't it?
No. I wear blood red colors too.
