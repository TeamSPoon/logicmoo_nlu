You know all this talk about pro basketball makes me wonder.
Wonder what?
What's the NBA revenue every year?
There 30 teams, and combined, they've generated 5.87 billion in the last season.
And the one before that?
About %.18 and this has been increasing every year.
And the feeder teams to these NBA teams are our college teams?
Yes, more or less, they also have minor league for NBA just like NFL and MLB.
Those are so sad.
Why is that?
I mean these are athletes who really just love the game, but are deemed not talented enough to play in the big leagues.
Yes, so? How is that bad?
I would be sad and disappointed if I wasn't chosen to play in the big league, and I'll probably give up and get a real job.
So, the fact that they're hanging on to their dream of making it in the big leagues is what makes it sad?
i guess so.
Well, for whatever it's worth NBA development league, that's their "minor league" does have a number of players who went on to play in the NBA
Like who?
There are 32 players who once played in the D league who went on to win an NBA title.
Most recently?
Cavaliers, Dahntay jones, Sasha Kaun, And Jordan Mcrae all played in the D league before getting picked by the Cav's
