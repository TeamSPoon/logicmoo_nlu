I love Disney movies because I grew up watching them!
I know, I love Toy Story!
Yeah, I like how you can find characters from other Disney movies in some of their movies.
Like how Tarzan and Frozen are supposedly connected?
Yeah, I also am so glad that they redid Beauty in the Beast with live characters!
I don't know, I have always enjoyed the original as it was.
That is true, some movies should stay animated, but not 101 Dalmatians!
Oh no, that is definitely a classic!
What is the Disney movie with the fish named Flounder?
The Little Mermaid!
