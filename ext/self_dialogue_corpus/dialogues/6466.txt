My mom loaned me the DVD of the original Snow White and The Seven Dwarves.
Oh ya, we should watch it later.
Yes, and see how it looks compared to the ones they make today.
I wonder how long it would take to make a movie like that back then?
Oh, it must have taken a long to time to draw each frame of the movie.
Yes I heard that they kept bare frames of sequences to be used in other movies.
What do you mean?
Then they could paint over them for a different movie.
Oh really?
Yes, that is why a lot of the early Disney movies had the same dancing parts in them.
