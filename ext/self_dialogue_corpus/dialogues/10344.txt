Which actor do you think wreck most of the famous sports car he drives?
ha, it's gonna be Daniel Craig, the famous 007
yes indeed, he always get  laid with gorgeous women as well
except the relationship never worked in the end, just like the way he is with his cars
haha, that's spot on
so which bonds movie do you like the best?
I think I love royal casino the most, we have Eva Green and Austin Martin in it, and of course casino
If I remember right, it has a sad ending
yeah, the girl got a deal with some bad dudes, and she has to give away all the money bonds earned at the casino
I guess she died in the end
