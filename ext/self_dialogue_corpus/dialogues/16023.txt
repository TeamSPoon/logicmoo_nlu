Have you heard Shawn Mendes' most recent release?
Are you talking about, "There's Nothing Holding Me Back"? Yeah, I have!
I've been playing it on repeat the last few days. It's so catchy.
And the message is empowering, too.
It is, right? What other songs of his do you like?
I really like his track, "Stitches." I feel it captures what heartbreak feels like.
Yeah, I've heard that track, too. I think it was a really big hit on Spotify.
Yeah, it made one of the "top" lists! How did you first hear about it?
Oh, I heard another of his songs on the radio a few weeks back.
Which song was it?
It was "Treat You Better" from his album titled the same.
Oh, I actually don't like that song much.
Really? How come?
The melody is nice and all, but the lyrics just sound so whiny.
Right, the lyrics are mostly complaining about being friend-zoned by a girl.
Exactly. It's a message that's common in songs, but it still irritates me.
Well, if you like "There's Nothing Holding Me Back," he just recently released the music video for it.
Oh, really? I'll go check that out on YouTube then.
I wonder if he'll release any new songs in the near future.
Hmm, probably not, given he just released a new single two months ago.
