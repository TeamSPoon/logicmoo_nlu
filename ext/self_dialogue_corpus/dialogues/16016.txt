Did you hear Glen Campbell has a new album out?
No,I thought he couldn't sing anymore.
Not sure about that. It's called Adios.
Is it new music?
I really don't know if it is.
Probably remixed or songs of the past.
I'm going to get it and check it out.
Maybe his family is trying to make one more dime in his name.
It could be. I hope not.
I know,that would be terrible.
His last couple of albums have been good though.
Yes they have. I like Meet Glen Campbell.
Yes,all cover tunes but good.
Yes it was really good music.
Ghost On The Canvas was after that right?
Yes it was. That was new music.
I liked it a lot.
It was pretty much classic Glen.
The title cut was good.
It was and so was the video for it.
