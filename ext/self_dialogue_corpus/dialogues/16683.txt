Wanna play a game?
Um, sure. What?
You know that thing that's going around Facebook: I'll tell 10 concerts I've been to, and you pick the fake!
Ok, sounds fun!
Ok, I've seen live Backstreet Boys, Sisqo, Hanson, Nsync, Miley Cyrus, LFO, Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber, Pink, Katy Perry.
Um, that's tough- they're all pop!
I know. I have very particular music taste I guess.
Ok, I'm gonna guess Backstreet Boys.
Why do you guess that?
Just because most people weren't fans of them AND Nsync back in the day, so I figured it had to be one of them.
Close, but wrong!
Really, who was it?
Nsync! I love Backstreet Boys but hated them!
Ugh, I really almost hit the nail on the head.
No your turn!
Ok I've seen Nicki Minaj, Miley Cyrus, No Doubt, Alycia Keys, Maroon 5, Nickelback, Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Hudson and... Elvis.
Haha! I think that one's kind of obvious!
No! What do you mean!?!?
Elvis died before we were born.
Yeah, my bad... I couldn't think of another musician!
