I watched Kung Pow again last night.
Wow what is that like thirty times for you?
I'd say it's gotta be more than that, it's an all time classic.
I could never see the appeal honestly.
It's just a totally ridiculous concept, dubbing an old kung fu movie with english voices.
Definitely a novel idea and I can see why it's a cult classic, I just can't get into it.
What cult classic type movies are you into then?
One of my favorites is The Wicker Man, with Nicolas Cage.
Wait you're telling me you enjoy that remake more than Kung Pow?
It's an unintentional comedy, or maybe even an intentional comedy we will never know.
That I can see but it's such an odd choice.
The acting in that film is so off the wall that I can't help but love it.
What's your favorite line?
Oh that's a tough one, probably when he's talking about the doll that burned.
I'm partial to the sharks in the bag line myself.
What about your favorite line in Kung Pow, while we're on the subject of favorite dialogue.
My favorite line in Kung Pow is probably the "my finger points" line, so simple, so stupid.
See that's why I kind of can't get into that film as much, just seems random.
That's the point of the movie honestly.
Guess so, maybe I'll rewatch it some time.
