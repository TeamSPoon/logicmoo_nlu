Have you ever seen Jaws?
Yeah, that was really good.  I didn't want to swim for weeks.
I know what you mean.  I swim in a lake and always think a shark is waiting for me haha.
Even pools are creepy after that.
The best part is John Williams score to that movie.
Yes, almost like a return of the leitmotif.
Yeah, for sure.  I liked the guy who was the shark hunter too.
Yeah, he was cool. Hardened by his time on the USS Indianapolis.
Of course we know what the best line of the movie was.
Yep, "We're gonna need a bigger boat."
