Did you see Iron Man?
I watched it in a theater
What was your favorite part?
I liked it when he escaped from the terrorists
He was a cool superhero
The movie was different from what I expected
I did not think the terrorists were going to pressure him so much with time
Which Iron Man movie did you like best?
I liked the first one best
That was my favorite too
