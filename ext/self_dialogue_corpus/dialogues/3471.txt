If you like period vampire movies, I think you'd like Interview With a Vampire.
Oh, really?  Who's in that one?
Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are the stars.
That must be pretty mainstream to have them in it.
It is mainstream, but it's still well-made.  A European directed it.
Oh, who directed it?
Neil Jordan directed it.  He does a good job making you feel like you're in that time period.
Isn't Antonio Banderas in it?
Yeah, he is in it.  He makes an impression in it.
I like period movies and vampires a lot so it'd probably be right up my alley.
