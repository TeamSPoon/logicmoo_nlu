Who do you think is better wide receiver Marvin Harrison or Reggie Wayne?
Marvin had better stats.  So I'd say Marvin.
Reggie Wayne was a beast.
Reggie Wayne was great, but Marvin is an all time great.
So you would rather have Marvin Harrison on your team than Reggie Wayne.
No, I rather have Reggie but I think Marvin had a better career.
Why would you rather have Reggie on your team?
Reggie was a taller guy.  I like tall receivers.
Marvin wasn't that big of a guy, was he?
They both were 6 foot tall but Reggie played like a big receiver.
What do you mean?
Reggie would out jump people and make himself a bigger target.
What about Marvin?
Marvin Harrison was more of route runner.
Route runner what do you mean?
Marvin would make great cuts to get open but if the ball wasn't a good throw Marvin wasn't going to get it.
I guess that's why Peyton Manning to Marvin Harrison was so deadly.
Peyton was so accurate in his younger years Marvin just had to run the route and Peyton would hit him.
So why didn't Reggie have bigger stats?
Reggie's first few years he was the number 2 guy behind Marvin Harrison.
