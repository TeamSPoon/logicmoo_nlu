Are you watching the Stanley Cup playoffs?
Yes, so far they've been very exciting!
Who do you think will have scored the most goals at the end of the playoffs?
I don't know.
He spent a lot of time in the penalty box last game.
Yes, he did.  I think it hurt his team.
Did you see that he got a hat trick last night?
Yeah, I saw that.
What is your favorite NHL team?
My favorite team is the Vancouver Canucks.
Who do you think will win the Eastern Conference?
I think Pittsburgh will probably win, but I want Ottawa to win.
What do you think about the NHL's most recent expansion?
I think Las Vegas and ice hockey are a strange match.
Would you have traded for that goalie?
With that Goals Against Average?  Of course I would.
Do you follow any leagues outside of the NHL?
Not really, just the NHL and the minor league affiliates of my favorite team.
That should have been called for icing.
I agree.
