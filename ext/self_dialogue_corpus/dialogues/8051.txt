So have you been listening to any new pop music lately?
I have been listening to 'Stay' by Zedd and Alessia Cara! What about you?
That song is awesome! I have been listening to 'It Ain't Me' all day!
Is that the song by Selena Gomez?
Yes! It is the perfect summer pop song.
I would have to disagree! The new song by Chainsmokers is amazing.
They have a new one? Which one is that?
It's called 'Something Just Like This' and it's with Coldplay.
I don't think I've heard it yet.  I'll have to check it out.
You need to! It's the best collaboration I've heard in awhile.
