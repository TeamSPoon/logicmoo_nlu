Have you seen the movie ' A Dog's Purpose'?
I don't think, isn't that the one with the contraversy?
Yeah, they had a lot of flack over the mistreatment of one of the dogs.
That's what I thought, was it good?
Yeah, it was a pretty good movie.
Did it seem like the dogs were mistreated?
Well, it was the german shepherd that was getting the attention for mistreatment.
Oh, not all the dogs?
No, just the german shepherd and yeah the scene with the water the dog did look pretty scared.
That stinks, how was it otherwise?
It was good, the german shepherd's part was pretty small, the majority of the movie is about a retriever.
Oh really?
Yeah, it follows one dog's soul through several rebirths.
Interesting, if you believe it is possible.
Well, whether you believe or not, it was a cute movie.  Puppies are always cute.
Yeah, can't go wrong with puppies.
I did have some adult themes like alcoholism but was worked in a way that kids could see it.
I see, many kids have to deal with that.
Yeah, it wasn't really beligerant with language or anything, just the father was an alcoholic and did have to leave the family.
Sounds like it might be worth checking out.
