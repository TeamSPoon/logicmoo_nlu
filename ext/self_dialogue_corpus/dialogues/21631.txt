What do you like more comedy or horror films?
I think Horror genre is my preference.
I am surprised. I feel horror is usually less quality than comedy.
I think you have to take a film by itself to judge quality.
True every genre can vary so much.
Exactly I think you were just thinking of b film horror. Lots of great ones.
Like what is a horror masterpiece to you?
The conjuring recently, In the past say The exorcist.
Both of those were terrifying. Also well acted and written.
See.. also poltergeist.
I like that little lady in that film.
Her name was Zelda. She was perfectly cast in that role.
Her size really added to the oddity of the character.
Also the oddity of the situation.
True. I think she was a very key choice in the ultra success.
I do think it was a wise casting and she did add a lot.
Have you seen Teen Witch?
I don't think so. Who is in it?
Zelda is in it too. A fortune teller /witch I believe.
Oh cool. I will have to find a copy to watch. She kind of was always a spiritual role.
