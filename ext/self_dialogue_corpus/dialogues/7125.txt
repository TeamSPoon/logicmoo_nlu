Have you seen the new Finding Dory movie yet?
No, I haven't. Was it good?
Yes! It had very cute characters.
Can you describe them?
Dory's parents were in it! There were also multiple friends made along the way!
That sounds really interesting.
Baby Dory was just the utest thing imaginable.
I really want to watch the movie now!
That movie really brought back great childhood memories.
I know, even though it came out so many years after the first movie.
