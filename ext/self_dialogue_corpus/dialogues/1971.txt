Do you like the NFL team the Colts?
Not really, i'm a Patriots fan.
They have a bit of a rivalry.
Used to when manning was still the quarterback.
Luck still brings the heat.
Yes, but the rivalry was between Manning and Brady.
That's a fair point.
Do you think Manning would have won if he was in Brady's position?
Hard to say really.
I think Brady would have still won he's the better all around Quarterback.
That's a fair opinion.
You don't agree?
I think it's hard to say, I think Brady had the better team.
I think Brady was the better player.
Peyton did amazing things with a subpar team.
That's fair.
Just imagine if both of their teams were good.
Those would have been some epic games.
Yes they would have been.
Now you have me wanting that.
