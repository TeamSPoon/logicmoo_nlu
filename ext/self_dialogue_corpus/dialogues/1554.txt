You like pro football too, right?
Yeah I'm a big fan. Can't wait for this fall.
Do you follow how the season schedule is structured? I never knew.
Sure. I know, it can be somewhat complicated.
I know there are thirty-two teams. Then they start competing..
So back in 2002 there was an expansion and realignment.
Yeah and that's when I lost track of things. How does it work?
So now there are four divisions in each conference, see?
I'm still with you. Then what else?
The champions of each conference proceed to the NFL playoffs.
That part I have down. Just some of the regulations aren't clear.
Maybe you're thinking about the wild card teams.
I bet that's it. Those extra teams can muddle things up.
They've limited the number of wild card teams, so it should be clearer now.
I know I enjoy the fall season, plus the playoffs.
Speaking of rules and regulations, you know those of pro-football differ from college football, right?
I wasn't sure. Also I wasn't thinking about that.
So you could be watching a pro game as a college football fan and become thrown by the game rules.
Mostly I like the social aspects of the game.
No argument here. You and a lot of people.
