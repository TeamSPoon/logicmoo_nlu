What kind of music do you listen to when you work out?
Oh, a lot of older stuff mainly.
Like how old?
I mean like 80s and 90s stuff. I listen to a lot of sound tracks.
Oh cool, which sound tracks?
Blood sport for one. I love that training song during the movie.
Oh yea, the one that sings about the Kumite.
Yea, I also listen to the rocky sound tracks.
Oh yea, Eye of the tiger always gets me pumped too.
Yea same here. But every rocky movie has a song that really gets my heart pumping.
Do you listen to any modern music?
I do, but mostly modified versions of slower songs.
Oh, that's interesting, like what?
Well like anything really. Last time I worked out I listened to a fast version of Just a Dream by Nelly.
Wow, I didn't see that coming. But I've actually done that before too.
What kind of songs do you like to listen to?
Well mine are modified in a different way. They sound like Jpop.
Oh you mean nightcore.
Yea! I didn't think you knew about that.
Yea. I actually listen to a lot of anime music.
