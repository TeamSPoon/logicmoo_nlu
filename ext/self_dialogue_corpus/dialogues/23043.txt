Did you ever see Platoon?
Yes, that's the Oliver Stone movie, right?
Right. He directed it.
I think he won best picture for that movie if I'm not mistaken.
Yes, you are correct. In 1987.
Who else was nominated back then?
I don't remember all the nominees, but I remember Paul Newman won for Color of Money.
Best actor?
Yes, that's correct.
I always thought he was overrated
Really? I think he's a good actor.
Nah, so many others are better. What other big movies were there back then?
I remember Hoosiers came out around that time.
Oh great one. Still holds up today.
Except for the music.
Well yeah. Most 80s movies had that horrible electronic music.
Yeah, but I agree that Hoosiers was good.
Gene Hackman as the coach was great.
Yeah, and Dennis Hopper as the dad was good.
Oh yeah, I forgot about him.
