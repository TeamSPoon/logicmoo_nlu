Are you going to see Spiderman-homecoming?
Yeah, I want to you?
I plan on seeing it the night it comes out. I am really excited
Is spiderman your favorite super hero?
One of them. I of course like Batman and Ironman too.
Itonman is going to be in the movie
I know. I want it to be a more spiderman than ironman movie though
I am sure it will be.
Finally Spiderman is in the marvel Cinematic universe
yes. The x-men need to join too.
I don't think so. That would be too many characters
I guess you are right
Yeah at that point almost every person has super powers. no one is special
true. I just hope these movies are good.
I will see them even if they aren't probably
yeah i will too.
Isn't there another marvel movie coming out this summer?
yeah Thor Ragnarok is coming out. too
I do want to see that as well.
Me too. The hulk is in it.
