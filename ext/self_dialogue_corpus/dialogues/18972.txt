No one I know listens to country music.
Same here but I listen to it sometimes.
I like to listen to it sometimes as well.
Who is your favorite country artist?
I love to listen to Taylor Swift and don't care who knows.
No reason to be embarrassed. She is absolutely beautiful too!
I know, she is a beautiful person with a beautiful mind and a beautiful voice.
Well said that is a really deep description of Taylor.
What is your favorite song by her?
There are so many great ones. I like Shake It Off out of her most recent songs.
That is a great song that I can definitely dance too!
It has such a deep meaning too even though it is so upbeat.
That is what I love about Taylor. She rights a lot of upbeat and sadder music but it also has an important message.
She is really talented for sure. I still don't forgive Kanye for interrupting her that year.
I know he was a jerk! But Beyonce made up for it by letting her get her moment.
That was nice of Beyonce. I'm not sure what Kanye was thinking if even Beyonce was upset he did that.
I know it was a poor move on his part.
Do you still like Love Story by Taylor Swift?
Yes that is also a good one.
Let's listen to some Taylor Swift now!
