Did you see the Matrix?
It was a great series
What do you think about the machines?
They should have won
Why do you think that?
They could defy gravity, they already controlled most of the people
Some people didn't like the way it ended. But I did.
It was unexpected
It made Neo seem special
I wonder what Neo did differently that the other saviors were unable to do
The Smith program must have finally gotten too bad
The Smith program was a unique character
He was dressed like a pro but he was actually a bad person
It was scary that the machines were control over both worlds
It seemed like the humans would lose so many times
Do you think that is a realistic scenario
I think people would not be needed to power machines
Yeah, it is a very dark picture of the future
There were some parallels between Neo and Jesus
Yeah
