Do you know who is still in the NHL playoffs?
Yeah, the Penguins, Senators, Ducks, and Predators.
Oh ok. Where are they at in the playoffs?
It is the conference finals - Penguins and Senators for the East, Ducks and Predators for the West.
Who is winning the series right now?
Predators lead 2-1 and the Penguins and Senators are tied 1-1.
When do the Penguins and Senators play again?
They play tonight at 8.
Do you know where they are playing?
Tonight and Friday they play at the Senators, and then they go back to Pittsburgh on Sunday.
Is Sidney Crosby still with the Penguins.
He is, but he hasn't been producing much lately. He only had two shots on Sunday.
You can tell I don't know much about hockey! Who plays for the Senators?
Probably nobody you'd know, but Ryan adn Pageau were the ones that scored on Saturday.
You're right, I've never heard of them!
So I guess you probably have no idea who plays for the Ducks or Predators?
Actually, I know one of the Predators players! Mike Fisher plays for them!
Wow! I'm impressed. How did you know that?
He's Carrie Underwood's husband.
I should have known....
