Hey there, are you excited about this upcoming football season?
I totally am! I am hoping to get to a few games this year.
Very cool, I hope that the Cowboys go all the way this year!
I heard a rumor that Tony Romo is going to retire this year, is that true?
Gosh I hope not! Hes my favorite player.
I am really hoping that my team will do well this year. I say that every year and they dont but I wont give up hope.
Really, who is your team?
I really want to see the Lions go all the way to and win the superbowl once in my life time.
HAHA, the Detroit Lions really!!
Heck yeah, Matthew Stafford is the man,  he broke Peyton Manning's record of most fourth quarter comebacks in a season.
That may be true but really, the lions last championship was back in 1957. Thats before you were even born.
I know it but the lions are my home team, what can I say Im loyal!
The cowboys have a much better chance of winning the superbowl in 2017.
Statistically you are right. I'll probably hit some Cowboys games this year.
Makes sense since you live in Texas now. So when Detroit and Dallas play who do you want to win?
Detroit of course! Man it would be cool to go to one of those games, Lions jersey and all!
So do you honestly believe that you will see them win the Superbowl?
I like to think so. I even have money saved to get tickets to the game in case that ever happens.
You really are a die hard fan huh?
Yeah what can I say, they are my home team.
