what did you think of the harry potter movies?
I thought they were pretty good.
I can hardly remember most of them past the first one.
I thought the books were better than the movies.
all I can remember is the one where he chases the snitch.
you don't remember him fighting the dragon?
that too. well that, and the second part of the final movie where snape dies.
yeah , that was pretty sad.
snape was on harry's team the whole time!
totally. he sacrificed everything to take down voldemort!
