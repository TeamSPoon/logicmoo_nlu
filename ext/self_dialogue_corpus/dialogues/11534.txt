Have you heard of the beatles?
of course, I grew up listening to them with my parents
do you like the oldies?
I do, I like many genres
which beatle is your favorite?
Paul McCartney is my favorite, every interview I saw with him made him look like a down to earth guy
do you have a favorite song?
I would have to say "Yesterday", I tend to like a soft vocal
That is a great one, I love that too, mine is Penny lane
Oh yes, I can sing every word to that one
