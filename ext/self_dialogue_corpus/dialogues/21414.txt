What was the last movie you went to see in the movie theater?
I believe it was Hitman 1.
Really? You have not seen anything after that?
Sure I have see movies after that but that was the last one in a movie theater.
Why? Going to the theater is like a national past time.
I have a couple of reasons.
What is the first reason?
You have to take out a small loan for to buy tickets and then if you want snacks your kids can no longer go to college. Seriously, it is just too expensive when movies at home are cheap and more convenient.
And your second reason?
I can't stand to miss anything and inevitably I always have to go to the bathroom right at the good parts.
Now that I can agree with since I do the same thing.
Also, there is always someone with a baby or a small child who screams at the loud noises.
Oh I know. I never understood why parents would bring kids to a movie they have no business being at.
Also, the theaters are never clean. The floors and chairs are sticky, the air is stuffy and stale.
There is nothing worse than walking across the floor and having your shoes sticking.
Which you then carry with you no matter where you go after that.
Any other reasons?
My hearing has been damaged and the sound from the movie is too loud. It makes me feel motion sick because of the damage.
So you really do not have a good time at the theater?
No, it is my least favorite date night venue.
