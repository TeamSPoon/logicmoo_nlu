Are there any songs you only like to listen to with specfic other people?
You mean like with my girlfriend, like we have a song that's 'ours'?
Sure, that could be an example. Though there could be others.
I don't really look at music that way. I think if a song is good, it's good no matter what.
For me, all the songs from the soundtrack of the musical Rent. I can only listen to them with my sister.
Really? Why?
When we were younger, we used to be big fans of the musical, and the music.
But you don't like them now?
It's hard to say. I'm not actively a fan of them, but there's a nostalgia factor.
Ah, I can relate to that.
I'd probably say I don't like them very much now but it's fun to get together with my sister every once in a while and listen to the album.
Makes sense. I never listened to Rent, or saw it.
Honestly, it's kind of cheesy, when I see it now. It was a product of its era.
I remember that it was very 'topical' and 'edgy'.
Yeah, but a lot of the music is fairly timeless.
Isn't there a song called 'Light my Candle'?
Yes, that's one of the songs from the musical.
I saw someone reference that song online somewhere. I can't remember where.
It's not one of the more famous songs, but it's one of the more romantic ones.
Maybe I'll give Rent's soundtrack a listen.
