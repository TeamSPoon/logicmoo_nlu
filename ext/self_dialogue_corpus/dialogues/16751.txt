Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Well and you?
Not too bad.
Good.
You a big music fan?
Yeah I like music sure.
Cool, what kind of genre do you like the most?
I listen to a lot of stuff, all kinds of genres.
Oh really? Like what.
I like rock, blues, hip hop, rap, edm, you name it.
Oh wow, that is a lot.
I'm all over the map.
Yeah it looks like it.
Basically, if it sounds good I will listen to it.
That seems like a pretty good way to go about it.
What about you?
I'm like pop music a lot.
Oh okay.
