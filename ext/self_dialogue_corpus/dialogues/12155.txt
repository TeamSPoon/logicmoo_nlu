When you first saw Star Wars, what did you think when  it showed Darth Vader was Luke's dad?
I kind of knew, his name means Father in German.
Well, that is a bit of a let down. Did you think they ever showed any other clues.
Well, when Obi was speaking on Ankain, to Luke, he sais Vader killed your father.
But, that would show they were two people, not the same.
He even greeted Vader, calling each other "Old Friend".
That should have warned people.
I think we were so caught up in all the action of the movie, no one put it together.
The way that Vader killed him always confused me.
Well, Obi Wan did say Jedi never die, not really.
