Which Beauty and the Beast movie do you prefer?  The cartoon from 1991, or the new live action film that came out this year?
Well, I haven't seen the new movie, so I guess, the cartoon?
Oh, man.  You have to see the new movie.  Belle is played by one of my favorite actresses, Emma Watson.
You're right.  I do have to see it then, but I don't know if I like how they used the CGI to make the Beast appear.
What don't you like about it?
Well, He looks much smaller than in the animated movie. The old Beast had broad shoulders and looked ferocious.  This one is much slimmer.
You get used to it I suppose.
Who plays Gaston in the 2017 movie?
Some actor named, Luke Evans.  He is pretty good in the film.
I may watch it just for the scene where Gaston storms Beasts' castle with the townspeople; to see if the newer technology adds something to that scene I remember as a child.
