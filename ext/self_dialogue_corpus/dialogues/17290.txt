Was there ever a song that you loved when you were younger and then when you got older you were horrified because you realized what it was about?
I don't know. What do you mean?
Like, I used to love I Touch Myself by the Divinyls. I didn't realize what it was about until I was in my 20's.
Oh wow! Yeah, that would be embarassing.
It was, especially because it took me so long to figure it out!
I had one kind of like that. I used to love Love in an Elevator by Aerosmith.
Oh yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
I thought they meant like romance, long glances, maybe a little kissing.
Yeah that is not what they meant. I thought the Divinyls were singing about dancing.
Dancing? Yeah that's not what they were singing about.
I know that now! I also went through a big Prince phase.
Oh no. I can see where this is going.
I was singing Cream at Thanksgiving dinner when my mom grabbed me and forbid me to sing anything at all the rest of the day.
She was probably mortified that her kid was singing that in front of the whole family.
Probably, of course now she finds it hilarious and tells that story almost every Thanksgiving.
Yeah, moms are like that.
I need to do some new embarassing thing so she can stop repeating herself.
That's still not as bad as my most embarassing moment.
What was it.
I was singing She Bop by Cyndi Lauper in the locker room before Gym when a really mean girl started telling everyone what I was singing about. They called me She Bop until graduation.
