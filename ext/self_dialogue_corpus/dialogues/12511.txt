Did you know one of the actors is banned from Star Wars events?
Really?  That seems strange and bizarre.
Yeah.  Apparently, George Lucas doesn't like him and think he's annoying?
Harrison Ford?  Mark Hamill?
No, it's actually the guy who played Darth Vader in the original movies.
Oh, I know who you're talking about.  I think his name is David Prowse.
Since he didn't voice Vader, I guess they don't seem inclined to stick up for him.
Well, anyway can play Vader so they don't need to kiss up to him.
He's the one actor you would never be able to spot since his most famous role called for him wearing a mask.
That's gotta be a strange feeling.
