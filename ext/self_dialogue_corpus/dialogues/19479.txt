So, what kind of music do you listen to?
I really like electronica/pop music
What kind of artists play that kind of music?
The sounds, pearl fiction, the birthday massacre, my gold mask and electric six are some
Oh I've heard of some of those bands
Yeah, it's like really the best music
Have you ever seen any of them live?
Yes, I've seen the sounds, birthday massacre and electric six live. They were all really good.
Wow, I've been listening to marina and the diamonds and daft punk
Oh, they're really good. Marina and the diamonds are one of my favorite's as well
Who else would you recommend, along the same sound?
Plushgun and the black kids are really awesome
Cool, I'll check them out
Yeah, I don't really like mainstream, hip hop/rap, or regular pop
Yeah, mainstream music is just horrible these days
True musical talent is not what sells
I have to agree. It's all about manufactured pop artists and sex in the videos
Tell me about. I don't even watch music videos anymore.
Some of the best music was in the 80's. From hair bands to the pop bands
I totally agree. The 80's has some of the best music that anyone will ever hear.
