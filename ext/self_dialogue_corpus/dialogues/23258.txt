Seen any good mystery films lately?
I just seen Gone Girl, I was a little late but it was good.
Which one is that?
It has Ben Aflek in it.
Not Batman?
Nothing like Batman.
Oh, so a mystery then.
Yes and a good one. I like Mysteries. Ever seen Murder on the Orient Express?
No.
It is amazing. Strangers on a train. Do you like stuff about trains?
I mean, sure I had never thought of it.
Throw momma from the train is a mystery, but very funny.
I like both of those.
Have you ever seen Trainspotters
No, is that a train movie?
Not entirely. It is more than just trains.
I will check it out.
There is an older version of strangers on a train, with Carey Grant, very worth while.
I will look into that and the other train ones.
Maybe you will get into train movies.
