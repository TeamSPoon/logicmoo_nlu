Let's talk about some music.
Okay what genre?
Let's talk about rock music.
What bands do you like?
I like coldplay.
Oh that is more of alternative than rock though.
Yeah but I still like them a lot.
What song?
Viva La Vida.
Oh cool.
I like the song Yellow also.
That song makes me cry everytime I listen to it.
Yeah I can see that. It is such a beautiful song though.
I agree.
I wonder if they will make any new music soon.
Yeah I wonder too.
We should see them in concert together.
I agree!
Let's make a date.
Sounds like a plan.
