What is the best superhero movie of all time?
Tough one...toss up...I guess.
Easy for me, I think it's the Dark Knight.
Yeah, it's a good one. Not my favorite though.
So, don't leave me hanging?
I like Avengers Civil War or may the first X-Men movie.
Ok, I can see that.
The Avengers movie battle scene was wicked. And the let's just say Wolverine....
Yeah, we need Batman against Wolverine.
That would be the best movie! Someone should tell them!
