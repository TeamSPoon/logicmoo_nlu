Hey whats up?
Not much, how about with you.
Just counting the weeks until some NFL football.
I hear you, can't wait to see what the Patriots do this season.
I know right, I'm wondering if they are going to make it to the superbowl.
They did pretty good last year.
Yes, I believe they ended the year 14 and 2.
They even beat the Broncos. The same Broncos who took the superbowl last year.
Yeah I think the score to that games was 16-3
That right.
Ha, Ha, you just never know who is going to win.
Tell me about it.
This year the Patriots drafted Derek young from the Titans.
What position does he play?
I think he is a linebacker, but there is a lot of versatility to him.
That's always a good plus for any player.
Yes. Versatility players have a longer career in football; they add value to the team and can step up when needed.
I know that's right. Once you are not good in your one position anymore; see you.
From what I understand this Rivers has a lot of strengths and only a couple of weaknesses.
And we know that thoses weaknesses can be correct.
