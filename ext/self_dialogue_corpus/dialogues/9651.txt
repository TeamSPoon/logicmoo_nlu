I am not really fond of rap music.
Really? Why's that?
I think the rhymes are incredibly stupid, and the artists really mumble.
I guess you are right.  Is there anybody you like that raps.
I don't know any of their names.  Usually, I am just telling my son to choose something different on the radio.
Have you heard of Nicki Minaj?
I have, and I actually like her.  She has some talent.
I like her too.  She can rap and sing.
Have you heard her sing with Drake and Lil Wayne?
I don't know if I have, but I will look them up together and listen.  Nicki makes rap bearable.
