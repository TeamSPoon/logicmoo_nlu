I'm trying to make the perfect party playlist.
What's on it so far!
Lots of things. It's a pretty busy playlist. I want to make sure it can appeal to everyone.
Give me some examples.
Well, of course, Party in the USA. People will scoff, but everyone will always dance to it.
I'm a little skeptical, but okay.
And then Will Smith's Wild Wild West.
I don't even remember that.
Trust me, it's great. How could you forget Will Smith's musical career?
I just don't think that's what people remember Will Smith for.
Well they should. He's incredible.
Okay, okay. What else is on it.
Both the real and Weird Al versions of Gangster's Paradise.
Okay, those are good. You know I saw Weird Al at a County Faire once?
Really?
Yeah. He kept running off stage to change costumes and played clips of his guest appearances on TV shows.
That sounds like a good time.
It really was.
I might need to add another Weird Al song then.
I think you should.
