What do you think of Bruce Springsteen?
I like him.
And of course the e- street band.
Yes,his band is phenomenal.
He's had a lot of hits.
I love born to run.
One of my favorites.
The whole album?
The song of course,and the album.
That is definitely a classic.
Lots of good songs off that album.
Thunder road is another one.
Great tune.
Another one he played at the SUPERBOWL was tenth avenue freeze out.
Wow,he opened with that.
Right. The SUPERBOWL performance was fantastic.
Man was it ever.
To much bad music at the SUPERBOWL now.
I agree.
Start repeating the good performers.
