Hey, I just downloaded Harry Styles new album!
Really? I've never heard of him.
Are you kidding?! He's from the band One Direction.
Didn't they do "Story of My Life"?
Yeah, that was one of their biggest hits.
I liked that one, actually. How is his solo stuff?
It's great! "Sign of the Times" is my favorite song off the album, but some of the other songs are pretty good.
Are any of the songs on YouTube?
Yeah, I believe so.
Cool, I'll have to check them out.
Make sure to look up "Ever Since New York". That's another really good one.
Okay.
Actually, what you planning on coming over this weekend?
Yeah, I thought I'd stop by after work on Saturday.
Saturday Night Live is doing a repeat of their Harry Styles episode. Why don't we just watch it when you come over?
Will he be performing some of his new stuff?
Yeah, he does both of the songs I mentioned.
Sounds cool. I'll be by around 10 PM.
Okay, I'll see you then!
Looking forward to it!
