James Franco is one of my favorite actors. Did you see 127 hours?
No I haven't seen that one.
If you get a chance watch it, it is pretty good.
I will have to do that.
What about the Spider Man movies with him in?
Yes I liked them.
He was great in them. I also liked Tobey McGuire.
The Spider Man movies weren't the same after Tobey left.
I know I liked them better with him.
When they change the movies up with different actors they aren't the same.
