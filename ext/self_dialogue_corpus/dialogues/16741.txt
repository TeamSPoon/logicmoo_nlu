Do you like listening to Justin Timberlake?
He's actually pretty talented.
I think so too.
Yeah, I mean, he's done it all.
What do you mean?
He's an awesome singer, he's acted, he takes on other roles in the studio.  That's what I mean.
I think you forgot his talent for dancing.
Yes!  He is an incredible dancer.
Do you think he is the best dancer in music today?
It's between him and Usher.
Yeah.  Did you like him in NSync.
Sure, but when he went solo it was amazing.
So you like his solo stuff better?
Absolutely, I just wish he released more albums.
When did he last release something?
I don't remember the year, but it was a while back.
What album was it?
The 20/20 experience.
Oh, yeah, well at least he works on other stuff between albums.
Yeah, I really like the song he did for Trolls.
