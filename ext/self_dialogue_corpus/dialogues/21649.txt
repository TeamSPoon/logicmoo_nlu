Do you like Mel Gibson movies?
Yes, some of them.
What is your favorite?
I like his old stuff like Year of Living Dangerously.
Oh, that's a great one!
Have you ever seen Gallipoli?
No I haven't, what is it about?
It's an old war movie about these two runners who are sent to the front lines.
I love a good war movie.
Then you will have to see this one.
Anyone else in that movie that I would know?
Not really, a lot of actors that I have not seen again since.
I will see if I can get that on Netflix.
It is a real tear jerker. I think you will like it.
His movie Braveheart is one of my favorite.
Yes, me too.
I haven't seen him do to much lately.
No, I think he is directing more now than acting.
Yes, I think he's leaving acting more for the younger generation now.
Yes, I just recently saw that his son is an actor too.
