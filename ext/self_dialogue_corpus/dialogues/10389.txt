What do you think of movies?
I'm not a movie person.
What! How can you not like movies!
I dont know, i just never got into them.
Thats bizzare. What do you do for fun?
Do you really want to know?
Yes, please.
I prune bonsai trees.
Trees. Really?
Really.
You can stare at a tree for hours but not a movie?
Movies are too loud these days.
You liked movies in the past?
As a kid, I liked cartoons.
Now we're getting somewhere! Any favorites?
I was a big fan of ferngully.
You would be. A movie about trees, of course.
Hey man, dont know it.
It is a pretty great film.
I think I have a problem.
