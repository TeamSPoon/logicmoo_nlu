Do you like Pitbull?
Oh yes, I've seen him in concert.
You have?
Yes, when he came to American Airlines center last Fall.
How exciting!
Yes it was a great show, he sang all his major hits.
Mister Worldwide, I am so jealous.
I just love how upbeat his music is.
Oh yeah, it's great dance music.
His music is all about coming up in the world and improving yourself.
You are right, now that I think about it.
They use a lot of his music for Zumba.
I bet they do because his songs have such a good beat.
Exactly.  They all have a great rhythm to them.
He collaborates with tons of cool artists too.
He really does.  From country to hip hop.
Yes, I remember hearing that song with Keith Urban.
Yes, that one shocked me.  But it was a great song.
I can't wait to hear what he puts out next.
I know, there is really no telling what it will be.
