Do you think Nirvana would be a big deal if they came out today?
Maybe, it's hard to tell.
I don't think they would be a big deal today.
Why not?
All new music has to have some attractive singer.
Kurt Cobain was considered attractive.
I still don't think he would be hot enough to sell records.
It's about the music not about their looks.
Then explain Taylor Swift to me if it's about the music.
You got me there.
