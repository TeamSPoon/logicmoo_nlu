How about all these book turning into film lately?
I do not think it is a recent only thing.
Really? Paper Towns. The Hunger Games. Ransom Riggs books.
Books have been movies for years. Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter etc.
What about like in the old days?
Before movies? Or you mean in like the 1950's?
The fifties. Where books made into movies then?
I think so. Gidget was a book. Shop around the corner was a book. So, yes I think so.
Well, then what is your favorite one?
Movie based on a book?
Yes, any time any genre.
I would say the Harry Potter series.
Which movie?
The first one. I think it was the best.
I liked the last one.
Deathly Hollows part two?
I liked part one better but yes.
I think the whole idea of books into movies is really neat. Lets you see the book on film.
I think it is sometimes, but it is a bit over done.
Okay, but The Fault in our Stars was really a great film.
