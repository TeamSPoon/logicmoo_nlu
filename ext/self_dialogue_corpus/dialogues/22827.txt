Have you seen dirty dancing?
Yes i love that movie
Its a classic
Yes it is
I just rewatched it again
Ive seen it so many times
I have too
I love it
Its one of my favorite movies
Mine too
I cant believed they tried to remake it
I know
The remake was horrible
Oh i know
And they made it seem like an actual play
Yea it was really dumb
I agree
Good talking to you
You too
Thanks
