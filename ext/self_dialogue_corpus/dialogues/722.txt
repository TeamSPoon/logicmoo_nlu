Worst team in the NFL this year. What are your thoughts?
How could I not say the Cleveland Browns?
How could you not. I agree.
They went one and fifteen last year and were lucky to win that one game.
Who did they beat last year. I can't remember.
The Chargers. I believe it was the last game of the season as well.
Was it. Crazy they won the last game of the season.
They're on a winning streak. Watch out.
Ha ha. Yeah, they are bound to reel off seventeen in a row now and go 16 and 0 this year.
After all of the crazy things that have happened in 2016 and 2017, that would be the biggest shock of all time.
For sure. What other teams do you see as being horribly atrocious?
The teams that come to mind are the Jets, Chargers, and the Bears.
Bears might be a little bit better. Didn't they just get a new quarterback.
Not particularly any good ones. Glennon, I believe. They lost Cutler.
Oh year, Cutler is gone. That's an upgrade just there.
Ha ha. Pick six Cutler. He retired, right?
I believe so.
The bears did draft that Trubisky guy from North Carolina.
That guy is either the next Ben Roethlisberger or the next bust.
He's a bear. So, I'm going with a bust.
