Have you watched any of the Harry Potter movies?
I haven't, but I read the books.  Did they live up to the hype?
Definately, of course the books were better.
I really like waiting until after I read all of the books to watch a movie.
Why's that?
I like to envision my own characters and who would play each part before I watch the movie so I don't have the movie character in my head the whole time.
I see what you mean; who were your favorite characters?
My favorite characters were the Weasley's.  How did they portray them in the movie.
I think they did a great job and picking out characters for them. Although the movie didn't give them as much of a story line as the books.
That's a little disappointing.  Who played Harry Potter?
I can't believe you didn't know that Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter.
I guess I've really had my head in the sand when it comes to the movie.
My favorite character was Hagrid.
Did he have his dog in the movie?
Yes, but he was only in a few scenes.
I bet Hagrid was impressive on screen.
Yes he was, big and burly, but so sweet.
What about the bad guys?
Well Malfoy was my least favorite actor in the series, and Professor Snape was my favorite.  Even though he wasn't evil, I wondered until the very end if he really was.  And of course Lord Voltemort had everyone on edge.
Sounds like I need to catch up with the times.  Maybe I'll see if I can have a netflix marathon this weekend and see what all of the fuss is about.
