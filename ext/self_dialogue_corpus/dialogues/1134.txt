Who won the game?
The Hogs!!
Good, I had a $100 bet on it.
Good for you.
The Hogs are the best.
They have 2 top players on thier team.
I know.
Tim Ryan is back from his hiatus.
You know he's my favorite!
He had a injured knee.
I hope he is healed well.
He's young, so I'm sure he will.
The Hogs are leading the season.
Yep, so far.
I think they'll keep that streak going.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
I hope they don't trade Alfonso.
I haven't heard anything.
Other teams are begging for him.
They can't have him!
