How do you feel about soundtracks in movies?
I think they can add a nice touch.
I dont think they do anything for me
They used to be bigger than they were
I always see at the Emmys people getting nominated for Scores.
It used to be a big deal
I hate when actors are featured on it as well.
Like who?
Well Justin Timberlake for example.
He can do both.
Right but choose your lane.
Why not do both if you can?
SO then you are making a Disney movie.
Essentialy yes but whats wrong with that.
I just dont see the direction its going is really that important
Well its a big deal for kids.
I dont think mass appeal is important
Sure it is
Not really, Hamilton did well
Yes, for a specific audience
