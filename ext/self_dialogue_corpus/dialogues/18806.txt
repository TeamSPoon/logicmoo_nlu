I'm glad you like rock n roll.
Me too.
Now we just have one more thing in common!
Yeah I can't believe I didn't enjoy it until just recently, even though I heard it all the time growing up.
Were your parents into rock n roll?
My mom was, big time. She would share it with me but I never connected with it.
I think it's natural to grow up despising the music your parents like.
Well if I did because of that I wasn't conscious of it at the time. I think I just needed to listen to different artists till I found a particular sound I liked.
You mean Little Richard and Elvis didn't do anything for you?
Ha ha, no. I mean I can understand why they're popular, though.
The beat, the beat, the beat.
The beats are good and their songs are catchy, I just couldn't get into the lyrics and their voices.
Oh, yeah, if you can't get used to their voice that pretty much ruins the experience.
Exactly! I like Jerry Lee Lewis' and Buddy Knox's voices for some reason.
Oh okay. I like that one song "Party Doll".
It's pretty catchy.
Jerry Lee Lewis' songs although they get stuck in my head a lot I'm actually not a big fan.
I gotcha, I have songs like that.
I have a bunch of old rock n roll records you should help me go through sometime.
Will do!
