You know what was an awesome song?  Take me to Church.
Yes!  That whole album was amazing.
I know right?  The Work Song, Cherry Wine.
You could go on and on.  Every song was flat out great.
I didn't like that song he did for Tarzan.
Me either.  I really want to hear new stuff from him.
I know, release one of the best albums ever then nothing for years.
Tell me about it.  I don't want to call him a one hit wonder.
But it's starting to look that way.  Although there were many good songs on one album.
Yeah there were.  Funny story, I downloaded that album right after I heard it for the first time.
Yeah, then that's the only song they played on the radio for months.
Tell me about it.  At least I got the other songs.
Yeah, it's not often you can buy an album and just listen to the whole thing.
I still hear Jackie and Wilson all the time on the radio.
I hear like Real People Do too.
Yeah, I love that song.
He has such a rich voice.
I know, raspy and great.
Makes good coffee house style music.
Yep, gotta love it.
