Do you know anything about the music of the 1400's?
No I do not, did they actually have music then?
They sure did, it was called Renaissance music and was popular from 1400-1600.
What did it sound like.
Well it was sort of classical.
Oh sounds boring.
One song was O Rosa Bella, they liked songs about heartbreak and love.
That theme is still prevalent today.
Yes, there were also hymns.
Oh I forgot about hymns.
They have been around forever, right?
Yes.
I do not know if they had many instruments but I know they had a lute.
Oh that is something like a flute?
I think so.
I do not think I would have liked the music back then.
Me either.
I am glad I can listen to the music of today.
That's for sure.
I guess they did not know any different though.
