So what are your opinions on legal steroid use for NFL players?
Heck, no. Why should that be allowed?
Because it would make the game more exciting.
I think that would be so wrong. I don't think athletes should be allowed to cheat like that.
But if it's legal, how would it be cheating? Everybody would be allowed to use it.
What about the players that don't want to use it?
Well, then that's their choice. They don't have to use it?
But that would make the playing field really dangerous for those who have no desire to use steroids.
Then they should consider using it. I think the game would be more exciting for fans to watch since there'd be better athletic peformances.
I think there already is great ahtleticism in football. We don't need to add steroids to the mix.
To me, there shouldn't be limitations to how the sport should progress. If athletes want to use steroids they should use it.
Like I said, it would be unfair to those who don't want to risk the dangers of steroids.
Personally, I think sports are more exciting when athletes are using steroids. Look at the home run derby between McGuire and Sosa years ago.
To me, if they have to use steroids to put on a show, then there's really nothing great about it.
I think you're being a little too judgemental about steroids. It isn't as dangerous as you think.
Even if what you say is true, just the fact that it's even a little dangerous is something some players don't want to deal with. And they shouldn't have to.
I just think the NFL is too soft these days. I want to see some hard hits again.
I think that has more to do with the rules than the lack of steroids.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe I just want to watch some old style football again.
That could be it. Plus, you never know which players just haven't gotten cauging using illegal substances, too.
