Do you like to listen to music?
Sure, who doesn't?
Well, I mean are you an avid listener?
No, definitely not. I do like a lot of genres though.
Me too. Although I'd have to say 80s classic rock is my favorite.
Who doesn't like that? Any favorites from that era?
There are so many good ones. Poison, Whitesnake, even The Who, and Bruce Springsteen.
They are all a little different in style, but I'm with you. I like them all too.
Do you have a favorite?
Well my favorite in general is Springsteen. I can't get enough of his music.
I really only stick to his 70s and 80s music. I don't care as much for the more recent albums.
It does get a little more pop rock, but I'm in love with the album Magic.
Didn't he do a really folk album in the 90s or 2000s?
Yes, he played with the Seeger Sessions and did all classic, and I mean really classic, folk songs.
That is so odd. Give me Born to Run or Badlands over that.
Badlands is probably my all time favorite Bruce song.
There is just so much that came out of that era, from him and others, that is so good.
Well, good enough to make a whole musical about it.
What do you mean?
The musical Rock of Ages only uses 80s rock for the songs.
