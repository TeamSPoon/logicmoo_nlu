The Seahawks confuse me in general. Last year you guys beat the Patriots in an amazing game, but then you also had that 6-6 game against the Cardinals and then a 9-3 game against the Rams
Any team with a good DLine or some sort of elite pass rusher can give Seattle a ton of difficulties.
Seems like against those teams Wilson is under pressure for a good majority of all drop backs and it just throws off the offense completely.
That's because they haven't had any quality OL.
The Rams had decided to go with the super athletic, high ceiling players.
well, tom cable also does not care about pass protection.
Rams are 4-2 in the last 6 meetings. I don't know how to explain it.
Jeff Fisher's superbowl was the good team(s) in the NFC West.
I wonder how Browns fans immediately reacted after that fake fumble in the Skins game.
Dude we were all so mad. Cost us the game, that and the pseudo unsportsmanlike conduct call on Pryor. Infuriating.
We're the only team besides the Packers that Rodgers hasn't beat yet
Just need to play them in the Superbowl and its a guaranteed win.
The Colts man. We're like 3-18 in our last 21 matchups.
how did you manage to win 3 games? asking for a friend
There it is Titans. If you want to break the streak just get you a Von Miller. Easy peasy.
If we're like 14-0 going in, sure.
Philip Rivers always beats us. Doesn't matter how. Doesn't matter when. He could literally beat us with half his starters on IR.
Yeah I was going to mention this. He seems to carve up those Seattle cover 3 defenses
Pats are the Bills kryptonite.
Bills fans know how to talk a big game, but secretly in week 4 last year we were all terrified that the Bills would find a way to lose to Julian Edelman at QB.
