Just saw Tokyo Drift, it sucked without Vin Diesel.
Doesn't he do a cameo at the end.
Drifting seems so lame compared to racing
I do love American muscle cars.
I love how he kicks in the nitro at just the right moment.
He's unbeatable.
That Dodge Charger makes me drool.
I wonder if they have more than one to make the movie.
I really like the sister character.
She's cool.
