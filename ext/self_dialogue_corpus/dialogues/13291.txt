Rey's imagination bothers me.
Why?
She's flying to a planet with Han and Chewie and says "I didn't know there was this much green in the galaxy"
So?
Well, clearly she'd have known there are endless planets.
You think it's a character weakness that she thinks this one planet has more green than any other?
Yes, do you have a better idea?
Of course.
Let's hear it.
It's a metaphor. She's from a desert. Get over it.
