Did you watch the cardinal game yesterday?
Yeah.
It was so good wasn't it?
It was.
I'm so happy that the cards are back on track.
THat was a rough beginning
Yeah, but It's the St Louis Cardinals - they were bound to bounce back
It's a long season.
THat is for sure.  I love watching Mike Matheny manage this team
I wasn't sure that was the right move a few years back.
HOw do you feel now?
I think it's partly him and partly because of St Louis history.
Yeah, St Louis has always been a great organization
You are a little bias
Well sure - I'm bias, I live here.
I will say I've noticed there haven't been as many fans lately.
Well that is partly because of the floods in our town.
True, they had to close down highways right?
Yep.  SO that has affected the turnout.  ALso, the blues were in the playoffs.
Yeah.  I'm just so happy the Cardinals are back at it.
