What would you say is the ultimate date movie?
I guess it depends what you mean by 'date'.
OK, how about a first date?
For a first date, I'd say you want to pick something exciting and interesting.
Why are those the attributes you'd pick?
It gives you something to talk about afterwards, and the excitement of the movie mirrors the excitement of getting to know someone romantically.
That makes sense. So, what would be some examples.
I think a perfect one would be something like Jurassic Park movies.
How about for a third of fourth date?
Now I think you want something like a Romantic Comedy. Sleepless in Seattle type stuff.
Man, you're old if your go-to Romantic Comedy is Sleepless in Seattle!
Haha, you got me! I grew up during the era of Meg Ryan and Juilia Roberts and Sandra Bullock doing Rom Coms.
I can see why you'd want to pick a movie like that for a date, but those are always a tough watch for me.
You don't find them charming and romantic?
Mostly just boring and silly.
I think a well told love story is kind of heart warming.
I like them when they've got more of an emphasis on the comedy. Something like Wedding Crashers.
Yeah, that''s a great movie. That'd be a good pick for just about any date.
Plus, Will Ferrell as the dude living at home and crashing funerals was the best.
'Ma! The Meatloaf!' Haha.
