Have you seen the Omen
One of my favorite movies.
That kid was just plane creepy.  He was fantastic the whole time.
And all the foreshadowing such as that dog that would make people kill themselves.
And when he went nuts before going in the church.
One of the scariest endings I've ever seen.
What when he's about to kill the kid or when the kid turns around.
What the kid turns around.
I know what you mean, it's like we're done for.
Horror at its best.
