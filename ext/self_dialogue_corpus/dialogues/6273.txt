I agree, the song "Let it go" is still being played everywhere.
Yes it is, I love that song.
My favorite is "Do you want to build a snowman".
Oh yes, I forgot about that one.
I like it so much because Olaf is my favorite character.
Olaf is the snowman right?
Yup! He's so cute.
My favorite character has to be Elsa.
Have you seen the Broadway performance of Frozen?
No Io haven't.
