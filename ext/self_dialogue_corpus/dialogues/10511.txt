Good morning.
Good morning, how are you doing?
Pretty good, been a busy week.
Me too, I'm ready for the weekend.
I hear that, what are your plans this weekend?
Nothing really, I want to stay home and watch tv.
Sounds like great plans, there's a Indiana Jones marathon on this weekend.
Nice, which channel?
The Starz channel. I might watch it myself.
We can text each other while watching it.
Yeah, like a long distance movie date!
It would be great if there was a Star Wars Marathon too.
Harrison Ford overload would be fun!
Yes, he was such a good actor in his prime.
For sure, I wonder how rich he is?!
Probably loaded, just between those two movie series he had to make a killing.
We should google it.
Ok, I just did and it says net worth of $230 million.
I was expecting more, but that's still quite a bit.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
