Did I ever ask you if you like classical music?
No, but I do.
Me too.
What are some of your favorite pieces?
Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" is really good.
That's some of my favorite, too.
But some of it is overplayed and a little to familiar to the ear.
Yes, but I think that's true of a lot of classical music.
What are your favorites.
One that pops into mind is Dvorak's "New World Symphony".
See, there have been some great "modern" classical composers.
Exactly. It's not just, Brahms, Beethtoven, Mozart.
There is a great moment, I think it is the fourth movement, of New World Symphony.
Yeah, that's very stirring and dramatic. It's the signature part of the work.
It sounds triumphant or jubilant to me.
That's exactly right.
It's surprising to me I haven't heard it at the climax of a Hollywood blockbuster movie.
Don't jinx it.
You know another good modern classical composer? Elgar.
Elgar, I really like Elgar.
