Really? Then it must be a great movie.
It is! You should definitely see it.
Do you know what the rating is?
Let me look it up on rotten tomatoes.
Oh you don´t have to do that. I believe you, it´s ok.
No don`t worry, I´m curious to anyways. So it´s certified fresh and it has 75% rate approval.
Wow! No I´m definirle watching it this weekend?
I didn´t tell you, but I actually have the movie. Do you want to barrow it?
No, it´s ok, I heard it´s on Netflix, so I´ll watch it there.
So, have you seen other movies of Samuel L. Jackson that you could recommend to me?
Of course, oh my gosh, where should I start?, there are so many good ones.
Well what's your favorite one?
Well I don´t know if it´s my favorite one but it definitely is a classical one. You have to see Pulp Fiction.
Really? But isn´t it like an old movie, from the 90´s?
It is, but it does´t matter, it´s an amazing movie, time does´t make it worse.
What is it about?
It´s about these guys that are mob hit men and then they get into trouble, but other stories intertwine, believe me, it´s amazing.
Ok, I believe you. Who else is in the movie?
Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis... But the scene with John Travolta and Uma Thurman dancing is the best.
Dancing? There is dancing? Now I definitely have to see it. Thank you very much for your recommendations.
