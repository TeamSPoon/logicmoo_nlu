My father went to a charity dinner earlier and was kind of bored. He was ready to leave until he saw a man's Giants hat. Then my mother had to drag him away.
I'm guessing he's a Giants fan?
Yup, a huge one!
Does he watch all their games?
Yes, he does. He even has a regular routine where he always orders pizza for Sunday football.
What does he do when there are no new Sunday football games?
Sometimes he watches videos from a DVD he has of the most recent season where the Giants won the SuperBowl.
Are you a fan of football too?
Not particularly. By osmosis, I like the Giants and dislike the Patriots.
That's funny. Any other team preferences?
I have a soft spot for Seattle, as I once read an article about one of the players and he seemed very intelligent.
Do you know the rules of football?
Not as much as I maybe should, but mostly!
Where did you learn them?
It would make sense if I learned it from the football games I watched while I was in marching band. But I actually learned most of the rules from Eyeshield 21.
That's the goofy football manga/anime, right?
That's right! Anyway, my dad's been trying to teach me more about NFL football recently.
Really? What kinds of things?
A little more about trading and how they determine who makes the Superbowl. I still find the wildcard thing kind of weird.
Me too!
