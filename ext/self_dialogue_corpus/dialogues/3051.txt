How do you think Aaron Rodgers is going to do this year?
Oh, about the same as usual
So, you don't think his breakup with Olivia Munn is going to affect his play?
No, I think he is pretty much over her
How do you think the Packers are going to do as a team?
Well, I hope they do well.
Yes, I do also, with free agency you never know how the rookies will do
Isn't that the truth.
The Pack was one game away from the Superbowl last year, what a shame
Yes, Let's hope that they can pull it off this year.
I don't know, the way the Patriots seem to cheat all the time, seems to always be about them.
Isn't that the truth, maybe Brady will retire some day.
I don't know, he seems like he still has some years ahead of him.
Yeah, I guess
Let's just hope the Pack can go all the way.
I hope so, I am so excited for football season to start.
So, I am, I am really excited for this year.
I just hate that the Pack always have those late games.
Me too, hard to watch and then have to get up early the next day
I hear ya.
