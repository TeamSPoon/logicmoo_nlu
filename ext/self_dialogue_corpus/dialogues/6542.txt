I recently saw the movie Moana.
I saw that movie too.
Yeah, I was surprised but I really liked it?
What did you like about it?
I liked that it had a new theme to it.
I liked that it was about the ocean too.
What was your favorite part in the movie?
It was when Moana first went to the ocean by herself and the ocean was nice to her and gave her the shell.
Yeah, I liked that part too.
We should get it when it comes out on DVD.
