So what kind of rock do you like?
Classic rock all the way. I just saw Gunsn Roses in concert
Oh yeah, I heard they were back together. Have they released anything new
No but they are doing a killer version of November Rain live
I have their Appetite for Destruction album, I like it
It's my favorite, you should check out The Spaghetti Incident too. I think you would like the acoustic numbers
Okay, I'll download it. I just downloaded Bruce Springsteens's greatest hits too
I love Bruce. Streets of Philadelphia is amazing
Yep. His early stuff is less commercial but great too
I haven't heard much of it. Thanks for the recommendation.
