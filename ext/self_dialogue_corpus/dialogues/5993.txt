What is your favorite Muppets movie?
The Muppet Christmas Carol.
That was a good one.
Michael Caine as Scrooge, come on!
That guy is good in everything.
Kermit as Bob Cratchet was priceless.
They always put "Kermmy" in such fitting roles.
I hope they do another Muppets soon.
I heard they were going to do the show again.
That would be Awesome!
