Who is the Spurs biggest star in this next series?
I would say it all rests on Kahwi Leonard.
Yeah he seems to carry them alot.
They need him to be great.
Ginobli has become a part time player.
Well hes old, it happens.
They just seem to keep the rock going.
Pop makes sure his players believe in his system.
Do you think they ever dip again?
Sure, when he retires.
Dont his assistants carry on his teachings?
Well Brett Brown hasnt seen much success so far.
He hasnt even been given a legit roster yet.
Yeah but you dont see much progress.
I doubt Pop would ever lose 60 games in a season.
Well they intentionally lost for a lot of Brown's years.
They did have a legit roster in the beginning of the year and they stumbled out the gate.
Alot of those players were playing in the NBA for the first time.
But you want to see some level of competency.
Lets wait til this year and judge that book.
