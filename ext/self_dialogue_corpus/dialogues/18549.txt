1963 until sometime in 1967.
What groups were the major players in the invasion?
Of course the Beatles,Rolling Stones,the Who,the Kinks and Animals.
Wow, that is a hall of fame list.
Yep,not only did they change music,but changed culture as well with men wearing long hair, and women dressing more sexier.
What group started it?
It had its roots in 1963 starting in England,but exploded in 1964 when the Beatles played the Sullivan Show,so the Beatles started it.

Around 1967 the Summer of Love was starting in America. So the people moved onto that.

Probably not,as the genie is out of the bottle now. Different technology today makes everything not so exciting and different as it must have seen to Americans in 64.
