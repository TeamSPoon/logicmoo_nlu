Hey, do you like indie rock?
I love indie rock!
Yeah? I find it's a hard genre to define.
It is, but when you listen to it you know it.
I agree.
Do you have any favorite Indie Rock bands?
Yeah, I like The Kooks, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The shins, the strokes, the Arctic Monekys, stuff like that.
Ohhh, me too. I also really like Bon Iver.
I don't know if I'd call Bon Iver Indie Rock.
What would you call it?
I'm not sure.
Exactly, like we said genre can be so hard to define.
Do you like Cage the Elephant?
I love Cage the Elephant!
We have similar taste.
We do.
I know it's indie pop but I also really like Foster the People.
Me too.
My favorite song by Foster the People is 'Waste'.
Yeah Waste is Great.
