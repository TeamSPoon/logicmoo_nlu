oh man, i just saw The Dark Knight again.
wow, you are obsessed with that movie, huh?
you know it, the greatest superhero movie of all time
i agree with that big time
it was nominated for an academy award for best picture that year!
wow, i didn't know that, i guess Christopher Nolan did a great job.
better than okay, to bad that heath ledger died in January, the same year the movie came out
i know, that's really sad, he was an accomplished actor
yeah, he sure was, at least he won the Oscar for best supporting actor
that's a great honor i know that.
did you know that he secluded himself for one moth in a hotel room to perfect the role of the joker?
incredible, now that's dedication and it paid off at the end.
i really did and it really helped that Nolan is a master story teller, he wrote the screenplay for The Dark Knight with his brother Jonathan Nolan
he's brother helped him write the movie? that's so cool
Christopher Nolan isn't just a great storyteller, he's also a great director. he really know how to direct his actors.
i agree, all his actors have given great performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal was in it too, right?
yeah, and she did an incredible job as Rachel Dawes, to bad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role of Rachel Dawes
right, i forgot that she was the original Rachel Dawes
i wonder if the movie would've turned out differently if Katie was in it instead of Maggie
we'll never know but the movie would've been great anyways.
