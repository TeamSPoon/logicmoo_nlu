When does The Dark Tower come out?
I don't know.
Have you seen the previews?
Yep. That movie looks hot.
How on earth did Idris Elba get to do a movie with Matt?
I don't know but I can't wait to see it.
I think it might be out later this summer.
I hope so. I haven't seen a good thriller in a while.
Well when it comes out do you want to go see it with me?
You but the tickets and I'll buy the refreshments.
