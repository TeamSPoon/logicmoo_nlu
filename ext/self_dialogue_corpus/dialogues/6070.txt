I loved the Mighty Ducks
Emilio Estevez was a great head coach.
I just think it was a good sports movie too.
It was so big that it spawned an actual NHL franchise.
hard to believe that could happen.
Yeah but the movie overall was so good.
Joshua Jackson playing the role of Charlie was perfect.
When they initially hated the coach.
Gordon Bombay hated the team too
Yeah I forgot he was coaching for community service.
