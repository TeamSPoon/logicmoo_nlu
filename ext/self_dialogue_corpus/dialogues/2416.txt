Hey what you think about the Saints this year?
It'll be interesting, they still don't have the defense they need though.
Yeah Rob Ryan really screwed us over!
Yeah they're defense has been terrible.
Are you excited about having Adrian Peterson though?
No not really.  The guy is old, and history shows age is not friendly to running backs.
Yeah but he came back from the ACL so strong a few years ago, I'll bet he has a lot left in the tank.
I don't know man, watching him play the last two years, he looks so much slower.
Maybe if he just loses some weight?
Maybe, but he's never been a really elusive runner, he's more of a power guy.
Yeah I guess you're right.
We still have Mark Ingram though, and he's proven to be pretty good.
Yeah, it's a real shame we lost Brandon Cook though.
Yeah he was a real weapon, it's gonna be tough to watch him play for the Patriots this year.
Yeah, you just know Belichek is going to use him the best way possible.
Oh for sure, he's gonna put up number like Welker did.
Right, I think he's better than Welker was.
He might be, definitely has the measurables to be better.
Yeah, Welker was just good at beating zones and matchups.
He was quick, but Cook is quick too, just with better top end speed.
