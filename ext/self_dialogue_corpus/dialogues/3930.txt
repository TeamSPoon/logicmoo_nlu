I don't especially like thriller movies.
Oh really?  Why not?
I tend to get really tense. I can't relax.
I am like that too. But there are times I think it's fun.
I really didn't like The Ring. I would never watch it again.
Did it scare you?
Yes!  The image of the girl coming out of the well was scary!
I agree. It stuck with me for a while.
I guess that means it was a good thriller movie!
Yes that's true. It was genuinely scary!
