Are you a fan of musical movies?
I mean, if the music makes sense I am.
Did you know Clint Eastwood directed one.
The actor?
He is a director too.
What musical did he do?
He directed Jersey Boys.
No way. What else?
He directed many of the films he stared in.
I liked him in Dirty Harry. I would like to see one of his musicals.
It has a bit of comedy too, not unlike Grease.
I liked Grease, not a fan of the sequel.
There was too much silly stuff in the sequel, the guy who was the "Cool Rider", made no sense.
Yes. I did like one musical, called the Sound of Music.
That is probably one of the most well known ones there is.
The songs were so catchy.
You might like Mama Mia then.
What is it about.
It is about a girl, falling in and out of love and lots and lots of singing.
So, the basis of just about every musical, ever.
