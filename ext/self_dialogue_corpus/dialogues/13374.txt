Who do you think Snoke is?  Someone new or someone from the past?
I think he's someone new.  There are a lot of people he could be but I think they all have plot holes.
One person I hope he is not is Palpatine.  He was a great bad guy, and powerful, but he's gone.
I agree, if they did bring someone from the past maybe someone supremely powerful like Darth Plagous.
That seems to be the prevailing wisdom.  Or maybe the guy who trained Yoda whomever that may be.
Have not even given thought to that theory yet.  I have heard some theories about a return of Samuel L Jackson's character.
That was one I hear too.  But I wouldn't be big on that as a plot device.  Even though you never saw him actually die.
Yeah, and as we know in the Star Wars universe with Jedi, unless you see a body.
He isn't dead.
I just hope they don't do something lame.
