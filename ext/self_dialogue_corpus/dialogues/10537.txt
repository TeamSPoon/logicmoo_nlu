You studied music in college, right?
Yes, I have a few degrees in it.
What were your favorite- and least-favorite courses?
SO many favorites, but I'd have to choose Advanced Analysis.
Why is that?
It introduced me to higher-level theory as an undergrad and really opened my eyes to alternative interpretations and how to use mathematical systems to understand music.
WOW. That sounds like a lot.
It was, and the graduate-level courses for it, like transformational and set theories, are insane.
What about your least favorite?
Well, I have two.
And they are?
Aesthetics and The Science of Music.
You seem like you'd like The Science of Music. Why was it bad?
Well, it was mostly just studying properties of sound waves, rather than interesting things like acoustics. It was a let-down.
I see, that would bug me too. What about aesthetics?
I hated that class to death because it's all philosophy. You know I can't read that crap.
It's not crap, but I understand.
Plus, the professor was awful to me.
How so?
Well, not awful TO me, just that I couldn't follow him. I could never understand his ways of thinking and his mannerisms.
