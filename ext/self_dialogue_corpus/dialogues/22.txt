Have you ever seen the Sam Rami Spider-Man movies?
I have seen all three.
What did you think of them?
The third one really bothered me.
Same here. The whole Peter Parker dance scene was really stupid.
I argee.  Topher Grace as Eddy Brock?
I know.  Eddy Brock is suppose to be pretty built.
Sandman doesn't fly.
He also didn't have anything to do with Uncle Ben's death.
I hate how Hollywood changes the story of comics.
