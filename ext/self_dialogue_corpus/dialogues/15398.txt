I'm thinking of getting my mom an album of some kind for her birthday.
That's nice of you! Any ideas on what you're going to get?
I'm still debating. She's big into older music.
Like classical music?
No, more like rock and roll from the 50s and 60s.
Ah, I understand. Like Chuck Berry, Elvis, the Beatles?
She's a big Elvis fan, I know that.
Then you should get her an Elvis album!
The problem with that is that she has all his stuff already.
Then maybe you should consider some artists from around that time.
Like who?
Well, like I mentioned, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Big Bopper. Guys like that.
I'm not all that familiar with their  music. But I can read up a little bit.
I bet if your mom likes Elvis, she'd like Chuck Berry.
Were their styles simiar?
In a lot of ways, Chuck Berry was the trailblazer, and Elvis followed in his footsteps.
Oh, then I bet my mom would like his music too!
Definitely. Maybe get her the album "Rockin' at the Hops".
I will. Thanks for the recommendation!
You're welcome. I hope it's a good present.
