The Little Mermaid has to be my favorite of all time
Really? I'm not really into the talking animals like Sebastian and Flounder.
I love speaking Animals.  The imagination behind Ursula, and the curse of her stealing Ariel's voice is so fun to engage in.
It definitely has to much imagination for me, but I'm sucker for Prince Eric and some romance plot.
That's understandable.  You know I've always wanted a dog like Max, Eric's dog.
Well, you sure you didn't want a fish with how much you love this little sea story?
I guess I wanted a bond like Eric had with Max.  Just like when he saved him from that burning ship.
That's when he encountered Ariel right? Those love stories get me I guess.
See, I knew you liked some part of the Little Mermaid.
I guess I do, but I think I relate more to Sebastian or Triton though.
