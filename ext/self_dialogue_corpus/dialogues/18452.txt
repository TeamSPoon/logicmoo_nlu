I've been looking for something new to listen to.
What sort of music do you like?
Well, I'm open to anything, but I'm especially fond of good singers.
Have you ever heard of Jacob Collier?
No, who is that?
He's a really amazing singer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist.
Where is he from?
I believe he's British.
Have you seen him live?
Yes, actually, I have. It was an amazing one-man performance where he played several instruments.
What did he play?
He played drums, piano, guitar, electric bass, and acoustic bass.
But not all at the same time, I imagine.
He actually used this electronic looping technique so that the parts would play at the same time.
So was he jumping around the stage a lot?
He was, during most of the performance, except for when he did some piano/vocal pieces.
What does his voice sound like?
He has a huge range, from bass to falsetto.
Where could I hear him?
He actually has a lot of YouTube videos that have become really famous; one is a cover of a Stevie Wonder tune, "Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing."
