I see "Cars 3" is now in theaters.
Yeah, I know.  I don't know if I want to go and see it though?
Why not? Did you see the first two?
Yeah, I did. I liked the first one, but the second one was not as good.
I know what you mean. And Michael Keaton doesn't do the voice of "Thunder" like he did in the first one.
It does look a lot like the first movie though, with all the racing.
I liked the way that the main character, Lightning McQueen, takes on the role as a mentor.
It sort of brings the movie full circle in that regard.
Maybe I'll just wait to see it when it comes out on DVD.
That's what I was thinking, too.
