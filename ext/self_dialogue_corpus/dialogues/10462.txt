Really? no I hadn't heard.
Yeah check this out it was directed by a woman. Her name is Patty jJenkins
Wow that is interesting
I'll say! A female super hero and it's been directed by a female.
Oh what a novel idea. A woman director...sarcasm implied!
It seems to be doing well.
Well maybe that might be something I can do tomorrow afternoon
Rotten Tomatoes  gave it 94% thumbs up
Hmm sounding better all the time.
