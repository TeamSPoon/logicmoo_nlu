Hey what was the name of red hair girl in The Little Mermaid?
I think her name is Arial.
Arial was the fish wasn't it?
Nope i'm almost a hundred percent sure that Arial was the name of the main character.
Hey when you think about it Arial was a fish so I am technically right.
No she was a mermaid not a fish there's a difference.
Oh come on she had a fish tail and breathed under water.
But she did have a human top half so I think it's still different
How about we agree to disagree on that.
Nope you are wrong she is and never was a fish.
