What's your favorite Marvel movie?
I love all of the X-men movies but I really like their shows as well.
Yes, they are doing a great job bringing their characters to the small screen. What's your favorite Marvel show?
Definitely Agents of Shield.
It was such a surprise when they brought Agent Coulson back from the dead.
Agreed! So glad we got to know his character better.
Are you looking forward to any of the upcoming films?
I'm excited for the next movie featuring all of the Avengers.
Me too. I was looking forward to an Inhuman movie too.
Yes, but that got scraped.
