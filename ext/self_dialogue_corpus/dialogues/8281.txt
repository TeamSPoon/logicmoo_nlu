pop music was better in the 90's
you can say that again
new kids on the block!
had a bunch of hits?
yeah, and jennifer lopez was still singing!
at her finest, too.
prince was still alive
yeah, but he was still alive two years ago too...
but best of all? all the boy bands!
what, one direction isnt cutting it for you anymore?
