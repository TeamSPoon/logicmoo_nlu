What is your favorite NHL team?
The Montreal Canadiens. They have won more Stanley Cup trophies than anyone.
Who are your favorite Canadiens players in history?
Maurice Richard, Guy Lafleur, and Patrick Roy.
Patrick Roy was an amazing goalie.
So was Jacques Plante, who also played for Montreal.
Jacques Plante was also the first goalie to wear a mask, right?
Yes, he also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins.
I think the Boston Bruins are my favorite NHL team from the U.S.
They have had a lot of good players, like Cam Neely and Bobby Orr.
I wish they had made it farther in the NHL playoffs this year.
They lost to the Ottawa Senators, who just won another playoff game today.
I think the Senators will win that series and defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins.
The NHL Western Conference Finals are just as interesting.
I agree.  I want the Anaheim Ducks to win the Western Conference.
Personally, I prefer the Nashville Predators. I want them to win their first Stanley Cup.
I think the Predators got lucky in beating the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues.
Either way, the Ottawa Senators will beat the Western Conference winner in the Stanley Cup Finals.
Good, I would like a Canadian team to win the NHL Stanley Cup this year.
I know, but I wish it were the Montreal Canadiens again.
