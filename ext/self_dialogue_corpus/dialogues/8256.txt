How much do you like Katy Perry?
I like that she was born Mormon.
Well thats just details.
I know but its important in my view.
I think California Girls is such a great track.
I enjoy it very much as well.
Would you consider her the top pop start of this decade?
It does seem all she makes is hits
She can do anything and make it seem amazing!
She is talented more than we probably give her credit for.
