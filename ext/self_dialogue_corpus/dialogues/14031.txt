Lady Gaga is famous for making records. But, she's also a songwriter.
Yes, she's written music for several other artists in addition to herself.
Can you give me an example?
She wrote The Greatest Thing for Cher.
Wow, that's impressive.
It's just one of many examples.
Give me another, then.
Okay, she wrote Quicksand for Britney Spears.
That's a good one! You know any others?
She definitely likes to write for artists who are similar to herself -- pop stars. Another example is Hypnotico for Jennifer Lopez.
