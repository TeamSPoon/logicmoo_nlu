What's your favorite 80s movie?
The first movie that came to mind was Dirty Dancing!
I love Dirty Dancing!
Yeah I must have watched that like 100 times in the 80s and then 100 times since!
Haha, I watch it every time it comes on TV. I can't help it.
Me too! I love all the dancing and the corniness of it. I think Patrick Swayze was so hot!
Yeah, I also like him in Ghost.
Oh yeah that was good. Whoopi Goldberg was so good in that.
She's still funny! What movies is Demi Moore in these days?
I have no idea. The last film I saw her in was G.I. Jane back in the 90s.
I never saw that one, was it any good?
Yes, actually, it was pretty good. And I am not a huge fan of army type movies.
Oh, so you haven't seen American Sniper or Hurt Locker?
Nope. I would rather watch something weird like Birdman.
Oh I never saw that. I heard it was good though.
Yeah the cast was really good. Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Naomi Watts were really good.
I like Edward Norton, he's always great.
Yeah, he hasn't been in anything quite as good as American History X or Fight Club though.
Wasn't he in something else?
I vaguely remember that he was in The Illusionist. I didn't watch it, though.
