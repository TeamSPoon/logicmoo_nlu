So, what movies are you looking forward to coming out?
I don't know, there's so many I still haven't had a chance to see yet that have already been released.
Yeah, I hear you on that.
But, I'm definitely looking forward to The Last Jedi.
Well, that's a given!
Been wanting to see Alien:Covenant as well, but I haven't had a chance to go to theaters.
Oh, yeah, heard that wasn't too bad.  I still haven't seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet.
Really, no way?
No, it's true.
Yeah, it was a pretty awesome movie!
Did they do another Thanatos tease at the end?
Ah, you know I can't in good conscious spoilt it for ya.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
Hehe.
So, what else are you excited about?
Well, definitely Spiderman Homecoming and War for the Planet of the Apes.
Oh, oh, yeah!  Forgot about that one?
Which one?
Spiderman!  I think the new writers will be able to do the character justice.
We can only hope!
