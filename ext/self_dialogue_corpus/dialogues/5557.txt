Are you going to go see Cars 3?
Yes! I've been waiting for it to come out.
Me too! Lightning McQueen and Mater are two of my favorite characters.
Who would have ever thought that automobile characters could be so entertaining?!
I was hesitant about seeing the second Cars movie because I didn't think it could be as good as the first one.
I know I was too. Disney has a way to make sequels great too.
That's what I love about Disney!
Disney definitely has a way of making great movies!
Do you want to go see Cars 3 together tomorrow?
That sounds great!
