Do you think Michael Jackson is the king of pop?
I think he is the king of pop, no doubt.
He did sell a lot of records.
His album thriller is an all time great.
That album is just full of hit songs.
My favorite is Billie Jean.
I really like Thriller.
I like the song too, but I like the music video more.
That music video was huge.
I remember Mtv playing it all the time.
Yeah, back when Mtv use to play music videos.
That was Michael Jackson perfected was the music video.
His music videos were events.
I don't remember the song but one they had a giant statue brought in on a boat.  Just to premiere the music video.
That was Michael Jackson.  When he did something he did it big.
Did you know Michael Jackson wanted to play Spider Man?
No, I didn't know that.
He wanted to do it so bad he almost bought Marvel.
That would have been a strange Spider Man movie.
Michael Jackson as Spider Man would have been something.  I don't think it would have been good.
