I remember when The Conjuring first came out and everyone said it was amazing.
It was. It was super scary!
Well, I wanted to see for myself, so I rented it. It was okay, but nothing special.
I can't believe you didn't like it. Didn't you think it was frightening?
You know, I liked the story, and I liked the characters, but I didn't think it was scary.
That's too bad. I guess it isn't for everything.
Well, later that year, it was Halloween, and I didn't have anything to watch, so I thought I'd rent a couple films. One was Lights Out, the other was The Conjuring 2.
How did that go?
Lights Out was okay. Kind of interesting, but not too scary. But I gotta say, The Conjuring 2 really blew me away!
Wow! Really, you liked it that much?
It wasn't that scary, but everything just clicked for me otherwise. The characters, the setting, and I just loved it.
That's great! It's funny you mention Lights Out, too, since James Wan the director of those movies also produced that!
Yeah, he also produced that Annabelle spin-off which I also later rented. I liked it too, but not as much as the Conjuring films.
Annabelle is okay. A second one is going to come out soon.
Yeah, and I'll be sure to rent it some time. It looks better than the first one.
Maybe it'll be an Ouija scenario where the second film really outshines the first.
Could be. If not, there's always hope that The Nun spin-off will be good.
I don't expect it to be as good as its parent films, but fingers crossed that it isn't all bad.
I'll probably watch that at some point too, but I just hope we got a Conjuring 3!
You and me both, man! You and me both!
