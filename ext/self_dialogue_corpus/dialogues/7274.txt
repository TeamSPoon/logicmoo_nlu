My girlfriend said the weirdest thing yesterday.
What was it?
She reckons "The Fox and The Hound" is the best Disney movie ever made.
Well she's right about that.
What?
That film taught me about friendship and also about the inevitability of outgrowing childhood friends.
That's so bleak.
No, it's also got important messages about accepting people's differences.
Doesn't the hound kill the fox in the end.
Nope, Copper saves Tod from being shot, because despite their differences, they will always be best friends.
