What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Inside Out.
Me too. I thought it was very well done.
What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love the Little Mermaid, always have, always will.
That was a cute story too.
Did you see they're making a live action mermaid movie?
I did, I don't think its going to be The Little Mermaid that you remember though.
Oh, I know that, but it still looks good.
I think it looks really dark, but I still want to see it.
