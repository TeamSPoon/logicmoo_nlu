Norwegian Wood is my favorite Haruki Murakami novel.
Does it have anything to do with the Beatles song?
Sort of! Only when it was translated into Japanese, there was a translation error.
What kind of error?
Well, you know how in the song, Norwegian wood is a building material?
Right, it's talking about how a particular kind of girl has a room made with it.
Well, when it was translated into Japanese, they thought it meant forest.
Oh no. That's a big error.
It's kind of understandable though. Anyway, the novel has all these long passages about being alone in a forest...
But that's not what the song's about at all!
