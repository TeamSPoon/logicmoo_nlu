Wow, you were in high school during the punk years!
Yep, I was 16 or so during the height of it. Good times!
You loved James Taylor back then - HOW did you get into it?
I got into it via a friend who had been on a short school exchange to the UK.
Who were your favorites?
Started with Sex Pistols then fell in love with and XTC, X-RAY Spex
X-RAY Spex? Who were they?
A UK band fronted by a teenage girl named Poly Styrene. Lots of great songs, including my fave, My Mind is Like a Plastic Bag.
Haha funny. Does she still perform?
She passed away of cancer recently, here daughter is making a documentary of her life.
Aw, that's too bad. Did you have /American punk bands you loved?
YES. I loved early Blondie, the Ramones, Lena Lovich, DEVO, Thompson Twins and many others.
You were on that German exchange, did you have any GErman bands you liked?
Nina Hagen for sure! She got together with some guys who had had a band called Spliff.
I remember that New York, New York song she did.
Yeah, but she was way better before she became known in the States.
I've read that she is pretty offbeat, um eccentric.
Yes and still is today. Very artsy and dramatic, probably a narcissist, probably a bit cracked.
She said she once met Jesus.
Yeah ok, very cracked hahaha.
