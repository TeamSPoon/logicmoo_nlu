Are you a big fan of Ed Sheeran?
I suppose, I like a few of his songs. I am not as big of fan as my husband.
Your husband likes him? Awesome. I really like his new song, "Shape of you."
Yes, it is pretty good. I liked it alot more before the radio stations overplayed it.
I just think it's amazing that Ed Sheeran went from playing at subways and street corners to being a mega superstar.
That type of thing happens alot now because of Youtube and the internet.
Didn't Justin Bieber start on Youtube?
I think so, I read that Usher was the one who really helped him get into the music industry.
I have seen them together and heard Usher say Bieber is like a little brother to him.
I am not a huge Bieber fan, but I did watch him sing "As long as you love me" acoustically once online and it was so amazing. He is really talented when you hear his voice raw and toned down like that.
So you are a big fan of acoustic music?
I am. I think it shows an artist true vocal capability without all of the hype. I also am really loving instrumental music now.
Instrumental music? Which musician?
I have been listening to alot of George Winston. Have you heard of him?
Is he the pianist?
Yes, he's an incredible pianist! He plays so beautifully. If you get a chance look up his songs "February Sea" and "Hummingbird."
Okay, I will when I get home. The only instrumental groups that I have on my playlist are The Piano Guys.
They have done some wonderful covers.
Yes, my favorite one that I have heard from them is "Rolling in the Deep."
Wow! I love Adele. Now I will have something to look up at home too.
