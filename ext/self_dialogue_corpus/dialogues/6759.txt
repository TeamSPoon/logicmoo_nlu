I never saw Disney's Hercules movie, did you?
Yes, I actually did. My one son got it for a birthday.
Was it any good?
Yes, it was a cute movie.
Do you have the DVD or VHS?
DVD, why you want to borrow it?
Yes, I'd like to see it.
Okay, it's a good watch for any age.
Do you know who does the voices?
No, sorry.
