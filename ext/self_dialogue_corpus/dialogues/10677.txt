Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?
Are you kidding? They are awesome!!
They really are! I loved the first two so much.
Me too. I like the newer ones even more, though.
Really? I like them, but not nearly as much.
Fast Five was just so awesome.
It kind of turned the franchise into a heist series, though.
Yeah, but I love heist films!
Me too, but it just wasn't what I expected from them.
Well I am glad they did it! They got even better with time!
