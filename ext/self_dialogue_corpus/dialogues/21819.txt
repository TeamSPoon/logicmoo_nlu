What movie scares you silly?
Ah, stephen king's IT!
Oh man , that is horrifying for sure.
I think it is the clown that gets to me mostly.
Pennywise is such a creepy character.
I can only watch it if it is day time.
Good call. certain films call for daylight viewings.
What is an example for you?
Again stephen king, but the shinning.
He is like the master of horror writers.
Ya he owns that genre. His dark tower series is coming out soon.
Those books are less horror.
They are still dark. Have you seen the trailer?
Ya, I don't know what to think yet.
I think it looks incredible. what are you unsure of?
I don't love the casting choices.
I do think they have taken some liberty in casting but all seem good to me.
I would rather seen matthew mcconaughey as Roland.
Mcconaughey does seem slightly weird for the role of walter/ man in black.
I thought so. Plus roland has blue eyes, talked so much of them in the book.Would have made more sense as Roland .
