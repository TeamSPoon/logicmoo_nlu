Reservoir Dogs, how did I just find out about this gem?
It's been out for such a long time!
I know, I saw it with a friend recently and the story telling was done so well.
Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink was my favorite character
The whole aspect of the heist and crime elements were so powerful.
I liked how they started to turn on each other
It's easy to see how they would, with that much stress going on
I don't think I would be able to do a heist
It's a lot of planning and teamwork to pull off, and the danger is not worth it for me.
I liked how the ending was a little ambiguous
