One of my favorite movies when I was little was Mary Poppins.
That was a great disney movie.
I remember my parents took me to see it in the movie theater.
It starred Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.
Yes, they were too great actors!
Julie Andrews has a great voice The songs were good too.
Yea, a Spoon full of Sugar and Chim chimerie
I liked the part when the rain washed the chalk off the sidewalk in the park.
Yea that was good.
I like how she flew with her umbrella.
