So have you heard any good dance music lately?
Well, there's that new Cupid Shuffle song!  I love that dance.
Oh yeah, that one is fun!  It reminds me of the Macarena and the Electric Slide when we were little.
I know, it's fun to watch the kids do it at parties.
What about the Whip Nae Nae?
Yeah, that one is fun too!  I've heard it at a lot of parties.
They should make more party dance songs like that.
Haven't you played the Just Dance games on the game systems? They're full of good dance songs.
Yeah, that's true.  But it's different when you're doing it at a party.
True.  I can't get into a lot of the pop music nowadays.
What do you mean, like Miley Cyrus and stuff like that?
Yeah Miley and the Backstreet Boys and One Direction, things like that.
I just don't think they have much talent.
I'm not hearing it, either.  It's real popular with the young crowds, though.
I think the stuff we listened to when we were younger had more style and talent.
What, like Madonna and Michael Jackson and those things?
Yes, definitely.  They were better than the new stuff.
I'm not so sure about that.  It probably just sounded better to us.
Taylor Swift is a great artist though.
I don't know if I'd call her pop.  She's kinda country.
