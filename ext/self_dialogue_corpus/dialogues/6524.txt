I hear you're expecting! Is it a boy or girl?
A boy! We're naming him Sebastian.
I'm sensing a pattern. First Ariel, now Sebastian?
Well Flounder isn't exactly a good name for a little boy.
Or Ursula for a girl!
If I had twins I could have named them Flotsam and Jetsam.
Classic! And let me guess you're doing an " Under the Sea" theme for the nursery.
The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.
You dream about going up there but that is a big mistake.
Both my children will be avid Little Mermaid fans and they will learn to love their namesakes.
