Are you a fan of Taylor Swift?
I'll listen to her, but I'm not really a fan.
Oh, my daughter loves her.
I think everyone's daughter loves her.
She's actually not that bad of a role model.
No, not compared to a lot of the other female singers.
Her songs are extremely catchy, too.
Oh, I feel you on that.  I feel like I'm too old to be singing them.
But they are so catchy and fun!
Hey, that's why the kids love her!
