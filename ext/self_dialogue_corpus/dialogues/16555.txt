Whatever happened to U2?
They're still around.
Oh, yeah?
Yup. They released a new album a few years back, at least.
I never heard of it.
I wish I hadn't!
Why?
To start, it wasn't good.
What else.
They cooked up some deal with iTunes.
What was that?
They basically gave it away.
That doesn't sound very savy.
And the automatically added it to peoples' accounts.
Totally weird!
Yeah, and annoying!
How so?
I had to delete that crap off my computer.
Sounds like the promotion didn't go that well.
No, Sir! Not for me at least.
