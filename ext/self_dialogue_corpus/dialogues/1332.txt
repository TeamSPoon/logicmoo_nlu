Did you get your BUCS tickets yet?
Yes, I renewed the tickets.
Me too. I loved our seats last year.
Plus, the team is actually better.
I agree. I think they did well in the draft.
I hope Jameis can keep getting better
Well they focused on D this year so that should help
Well it cant be any worse
Good point.
Ugh, that was painful to watch
No kidding
I thought this was going to be better, not worse
Maybe it will take a few years?
I am not sure but they better get it resolved
At least we have good weapons
True, there isn't much excuse now
Also, we are in a weak division
Hopefully we just don't play down to the competition
I know
That said, I am excited
