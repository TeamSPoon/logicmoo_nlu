Is it December yet?
No, why?
I am counting down the days until The Last Jedi comes out.
Is that the name of the new Star Wars movie?
Yes!
I didn't really like the new one that came out.
Really? I loved it.
I just really like the originals.
I get that I guess.
It just doesn't get better than the New Hope!
