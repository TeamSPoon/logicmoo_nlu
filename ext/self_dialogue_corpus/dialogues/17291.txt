Have you ever listened to music by OMAM?
No I haven't. Who are they?
They're an Icelandic folk-rock group called Of Monsters and Men. OMAM for short.
Folk-rock? That sounds very interesting!
You should give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it.
Tell me more. What are some of your favorite songs by them?
My absolute favorite would be King and Lionheart, from their debut album My Head Is An Animal.
Do you have any others?
I have too many that I like to be honest. They're one of my favorite bands.
They sound very original.
Their music is dark and beautiful. And their music videos are mesmerizing. They tell a story.
And they're from Iceland? I didn't even know Iceland had such an amazing band!
I think they are more famous now than they used to be.
What is their latest album like? Have you listened to it?
Beneath The Skin was their last album which came out in 2015.
How did it compare to the first one in your opinion?
Well, in my opinion, I thought it was lovely too. But their first album is still their most outstanding.
They don't release new music very often?
Sadly, not. Much to the disappointment of their fans.
Thanks for recommending them to me. I can't wait to listen to their music now!
