Did you ever see the 40 year Old Virgin?
That movie is hilarious!
Yeah, Steve Carrel is super funny.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I think it had to be when he was getting his chest waxed.
Wow, yeah, that was great.
I think he ad-libbed what he was saying for that part.
That would make sense.
Yeah, especially since none of it made sense.
Yeah, the words he was making up were super funny.
