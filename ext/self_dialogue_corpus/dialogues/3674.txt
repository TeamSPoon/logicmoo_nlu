Wild Things is a good thriller
Neve Campbell and Denise Richards are good in it.
Don't forget Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon.
That was a good thriller for 1997.
Yeah it was a good follow up after Scream  for Neve Campbell
She did a good job
That twist ending was great
Yeah, Bill Murray added a lot of comedy too.
There is a lot to like about that movie.
I agree.
