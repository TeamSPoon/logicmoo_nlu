It's time to talk about those Atlanta Falcons.
I believe this is the year for them to bring home a trophy.
Another division and conference trophy yes?
No they are going to bring home a lombardi trophy to Atlanta,Georgia!
The Falcons do have NFL MVP Matt Ryan but they are playing in the most competitive division.
That they do, as well as picking up a pair of great linemen from free agency.
Yes, Dontari Poe will do wonders as tackle and not to mention Jack Crawford to fill the end position. Don't forget their draft pick ups.
Can not forget about the pair of linbackers, Takk McKinley and Duck Riley.
So you believe this will be the outcome to a NFL title?
I do see them becoming the new champions and bringing home the trophy to Georgia.
That will be one way to add some decoration to a brand new stadium.
Indeed, the Falcons will be in their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium this season. Can't wait for their season opener!
That will be a game to watch, the rematch of last season NFC championship.
The Green Bay Packers are going to have their hands full.
I might have to disagree with you on this one I see the Packers winning by a touchdown.
No way, the Falcons take this easily by 14.
Well I guess we will just have to wait till game day and I can't wait for kick-off!
I agree, can not wait for the football season to get here!
NFC Championship rematch here we come!
I can not wait! Time to open the new stadium in a winning fashion.
