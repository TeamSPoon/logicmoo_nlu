I saw that Emma Watson was in the new Beauty and the Beast.
She hasn't really been in many movies lately.
I wonder if she can sing well for Belle. Belle's character does a lot of singing, doesn't she?
Yes. She has a pretty big musical number near the beginning if I remember correctly. I wonder who is playing Gaston.
Luke Evans is playing Gaston.
Who?
He was the guy that played Bard in The Hobbit series.
Oh, I know him. He's a good actor.
I bet he does well as Gaston.
I'll let you know what I think after I see the movie.
