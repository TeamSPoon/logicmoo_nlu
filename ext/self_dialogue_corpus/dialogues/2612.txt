Andy Dalton will lead the Cincinnati Bengals to the Superbowl this season!
No way! He's failed the past years how can you say that now?
This is going to be his year! I can feel it, with AJ Green healthy, the running game strong and the defense as strong as ever they're going to do it this year!
I highly doubt it. I think they'll have a good season like they always do but fall short again in the playoffs.
I look at their team this year and I look at the other teams in the AFC and I don't see a threat in their division.
You only feel that way because Le'Veon Bell hasn't signed back with the Steelers.
I think the Steelers are getting old. Big Ben can't last a season without getting hurt and so this season I feel the Bengals have their best shot.
I think they'll be the same. I still think the Steelers are the team to beat in their division and I see them on the same levels as the Baltimore Ravens.
I think they're way better than the Ravens. The Ravens haven't really improved.
I think the Ravens are well coached John Harbaugh is a very good coach and he gets the most out of his players.
I won't disagree with you there but the talent level isn't there for the Ravens.
Let's assume the Bengals win the division, they'll have to face the Patriots, Raiders, or Chiefs in the playoffs. That isn't any easy task.
I think they're on the levels as those teams and I think you'll see Marvin Lewis really coach them to that next level this season.
They're going to win 9 games at the most.
You're underrating them! I think they're going to be an 11 win team at the least.
I'll let you have that but I don't think they're going to win that many games.
Who do you think is going to come out of the AFC or at least challenge the Patriots?
I think the Raiders have a good shot but I also really like the Steelers once Le'Veon signs his contract.
I'm sticking with my Bengals as the top team to come out!
You're a true fan if your belief is that strong, I'll commend you on that.
