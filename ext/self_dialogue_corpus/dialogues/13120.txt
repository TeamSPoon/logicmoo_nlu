What was the best 'Star Wars' movie?
Well, 'Empire Strikes Back' is definitely the best.
What did you like about it?
So much happened in the movie.  And it actually had real stakes.
What stakes in particular?
Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father, Luke loses his hands, Han is frozen, and we're all left with a major cliffhanger.
Now that you mention it, that was so unique of Star Wars.  And viewers at the time must have left the theater with so many questions.
I don't think I could have waited years to see the next one.
It's especially impressive when you think about it because the second movie is always the toughest to make.
I agree.  Yet, somehow 'Empire' was an excellent standalone movie that also tied the 1st and 3rd movies together seamlessly.
