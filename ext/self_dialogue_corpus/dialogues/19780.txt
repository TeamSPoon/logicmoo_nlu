Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Oh sure, who doesn't like those boys from Liverpool?
The Sgt. Pepper album is celebrating it's 50th Anniversary this year.
It's a classic album for sure!
What is your favorite song off the album?
Well, I think of the album as a whole entity - you don't break it up!
Yeah, you're right, since it IS a concept album.
I think they were inspired by the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album.
Yes, they highly regarded Brian Wilson's music.
Brian Wilson is an amazing American artist that should have been able to do a lot more.
Well, that's what happens when fathers try to be managers of their sons' music groups.
That tends to be a problem with a lot of bands, right?
Sure, you can name the Beach Boys, Jackson Five, and the Cowsills as bands with controlling manager-fathers.
Those stories never turn out good for anyone - the dads, musicians, or the fans!
There's so much great music out there that gets lost in the shuffle of business.
Indeed, like when Michael Jackson bought the Beatles' catalog of music... that broke up his friendship with Paul.
Absolutely, since that was a good business move for Jackson, even at the cost of his partnership with McCartney.
Paul McCartney went ahead and bought Buddy Holly's catalog of music.
Do you know why he did that?
He was a big fan of Holly's music, and it was a tremendous influence on the Beatles.
