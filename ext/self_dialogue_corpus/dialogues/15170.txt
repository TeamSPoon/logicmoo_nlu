What are your thoughts on metal music?
I enjoy it. It has a lot of different sub-genres.
It does. Some of them are too extreme for me.
Yeah, I don't listen to the really extreme stuff.
So then what's your favorite metal band?
I really enjoy Metallica.
Metallica is awesome.
They are. The Black Album is my favorite.
That's the one with "Enter Sandman" on it, right?
Yes, that whole album is amazing.
My parents used to play that song all the time.
Mine did too. I think that's why I like it so much.
They actually have a lot of hits.
They do. I think they're the best at sounding heavy but still being catchy.
Yeah their music gets really heavy at times.
Their guitar solos are awesome too.
Kirk Hammett can shred for sure.
A lot of the guitarists from back then were very talented.
They were. Dimebag Darrell was another one of my favorites.
He was very good also. I wish I could play an instrument like that.
