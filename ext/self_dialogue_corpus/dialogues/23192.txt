Have you seen The Silence of the Lambs?
Of course, it's my favorite movie.
Mine too!
Who's your favorite character?
Who do you think?
Doctor Lector?
Of course.
Yeah, I guess he's my favorite too.
You guess?
Well, I really like Clarice.
Of course, I do too. But Lector as a character is innately far more interesting.
Yeah, you're right.
I have to say, no matter how many times I watch it, I get so tense at the end when Clarice is in Bill's house.
I end up yelling at the screen. It's so suspenseful.
Especially when he has the night vision goggles and she doesn't.
It's amazing she survives. Realistically, that wouldn't have happened.
Yeah, he would have just shot her. She got too lucky.
I guess we have to suspend our disbelief.
Of course we do. It's a movie about a cannibal psychiatrist and a man who makes clothes out of women.
Good point.
