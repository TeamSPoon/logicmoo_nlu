Did you watch Adam Sandler movies back when they were popular?
I loved Big Daddy especially, such a cute movie.
I remember that one! It was pretty cute.
I also like Billy Madison, that story line was hilarious.
I remember watching that too a few years ago.
You don't see comedy like that today unfortunately in movies.
No you really don't.
What was the name of that movie where he plays golf?
I know what you're talking about! That was Happy Gilmore.
Yes! I had forgotten the name.I loved it.
I think one of my favorite scenes was when he was playing and the ball wouldn't go in and he says, "Kiss my white ass ball!"
Yes that had me laughing so hard!
He has a knack for making the best comedies.
I completely agree.
Have you seen the Wedding Singer?
You mean that one movie with Drew Barrymore?
Yes I watched that movie over and over!
It was pretty good that's for sure, I need to watch it soon.
You know which movie of Adam Sandler's I did not like? Little Nicky.
Yes I don't think that one was made as well if you ask me.
