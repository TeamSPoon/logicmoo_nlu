If you had to pick, who would be your favorite Disney prince?
Oh, easily Eric from The Little Mermaid.
He's pretty dreamy - but I like Flynn Rider from Tangled.
But he wasn't a prince until he married Rapunzel!
In that case I guess my favorite is Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast.
He seems like a good choice.
I wonder if Kuzco from the Emperor's New Groove counts as a Disney prince.
Not sure, but if he does I'd switch my vote.
"Pull the lever, Kronk!"
"Wrong lever!"
