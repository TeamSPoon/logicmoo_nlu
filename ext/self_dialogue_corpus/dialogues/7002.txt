Mulan is one of my favorite movies.
I have never seen it.
Really? It's been out since 1998.
What's the premise of the movie?
It's retelling of a traditional Chinese folktale.
That's so interesting.
Yes, Disney is great with historical films.
I agree. I will see Mulan as soon as possible.
That's great. There is also a sequal called Mulan II.
I will see that as well!
