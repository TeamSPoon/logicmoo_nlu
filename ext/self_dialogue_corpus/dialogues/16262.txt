Remember the band Credence Clearwater Revival?
I sure do. John Fogarty was their lead singer
He has a good voice.
I love their songs. Down On the Corner and Who'll stop the Rain.
Yea those were great hits.
His brother was in the band too, Tom Fogarty.
They played at Woodstock, remember?
I do.
I also remember them playing on the Ed Sullivan Show.
I remember that too.
Do you know that they had a lot of number one hits, only Elvis and The Beatles had more.
Wow I did not know that.
Yes, Willy and the Poor Boys and  Fortunate Son were also some great ones.
Fortunate Son was in the Forest Gump Movie.
Your correct.
I wish they had bands like that today.
The music today is awful compared to the seventies.
That was the best decade ever.
I know , so many great musicians.
I am going to go listen to some Creedence now!
