What was the last Thriller movie you seen?
I just watched Don't Breath the other night.
I don't think I have seen that one.
You should. It had me on the seat of my pants the entire time.
What was it about?
Basically about some young adults who break into a blind man's house, but don't expect what happens next.
How was the acting?
It was amazing. A ton of young actors that were able to carry the movie
How were the jump scares?
The sound and just the entire premise added to the suspense.
