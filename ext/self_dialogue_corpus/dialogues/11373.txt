So, what's your favorite Beetles song?
That's hard to say. I am very fond of several of them.
Well, tell me one of them.
Okay, I have always really liked "Hey Jude".
I love that song, such a sad and beautiful meaning.
Can you remember who wrote "Hey Jude"
I think Paul McCartney wrote most of it but it is also credited to John Lennon on the album.
Did you know it was originally called "Hey Jules" and was changed before it was released?
No, I had never heard that before, very interesting.
It was called "Hey Jules" because it was originally written for Julian Lennon.
