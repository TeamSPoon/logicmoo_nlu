Weird to think that the Foo Fighters wouldn't exist if Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself.
I used to love Nirvana, but really like the foo fighters too.
I miss grunge music.
Pearl Jam has always been my favorite.
I wish I lived in Seattle back in the day.
I was really shocked to hear that Chris Cornell died.
I'm going to miss Soundgarden.
Just everything about music coming out of there in that decade was amazing.
Rock music is dying.
I agree. Very few new acts that focus on rock and roll.
