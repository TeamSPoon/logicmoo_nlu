I really enjoy Tarantino  movies, and I love Samuel L. Jackson movies, but I couldn't get into this one because of him.
Really? You're like the biggest Jackson fan going? If you did not like it, there must have been some problems.
Yeah, it felt like nothing was really challenging Jackson.
Were there no antagonists in the movie?
Sort of. The only identifiable antagonist was one who was in chains. I expected her to get out eventually, but what happened in the meanwhile?
I would imagine someone in chains can only talk to you.
That was the problem. All of the other antagonists were not revealed, and Jackson was not the paranoid one in the group, so he was not bothered by them.
So you basically paid to heat him speak for a few hours?
I would say that aptly describes what happened. Oh, and he did not care about the prisoner and her constant babbling- he did care about the sheriff though.
Was Jackson a criminal in the movie?
No, he wasn't a criminal. I think he was considered an anti-hero by the north who he was formerly employed by.
Why, what did he do?
He burnt down a prison which happened to have 37 union soldiers inside. They deemed him to be a white killer.
Okay, so he was on the run from the law because of that?
No, they could not prove it.
So why would he be worried about a sheriff?
The sheriff was like a former rough rider or something- he used to hunt black people.
Okay, so why didn't that create tension throughout the film?
Because he didn't want any trouble. He had gone legit and was going to become a town's sheriff.
So he was on Jackson's side? Yeah, it sounds like Jackson didn't really have any enemies.
