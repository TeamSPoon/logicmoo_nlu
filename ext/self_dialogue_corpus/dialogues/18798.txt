I just saw Citizen Cope live.
I'm not familiar with them--is it one musician or a band?
It's one guy, but I think he's been playing with the same backup musicians for years.
What kind of music does he play?
It's hard to describe. It's very urban sounding and has all kinds of different influences--blues, soul. He was busker before he got a record deal, I think.
Huh. I've never heard of him. Has he had any big hits?
I don't think so. He's really great, though. No one else sounds like him. His music is very atmospheric. I think some of his songs have been in movie soundtracks.
How was he live? Was that the first time you'd seen him?
Yeah, and he was exactly the way I hoped he'd be--very authentic. You could tell that the crowd was full of true fans. He's got a lot of heart, and it shows.
What do you mean?
Well, his lyrics are full of humanity, and he expresses a lot of gratitude for his fans. I think he actually turned away from a major label so he could have more independence.
I guess I should check him out.
You definitely should. Highly recommended.
Any album in particular?
They're all good. Start with the first one--Citizen Cope. I think he may have had an earlier one, but I'm not sure it's available.
How did you first hear about him?
I have a friend who's a music critic. He turned me onto him years ago. He said there wasn't a single false note on that first album, and he was right.
Wow, that's high praise.
It's well deserved. And I've liked all his other albums, too.
I'll definitely check him out.
