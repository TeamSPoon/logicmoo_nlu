Do you ever watch the Dallas Cowboys games?
Yeah but I'm not sure if I will now that Romo retired.
He was a good Quarterback.
It is a shame he never won a Superbowl.
Yeah that is too bad.
He had a long career though and some players don't always get that.
Exactly he was with Dallas for 14 seasons.
Yeah he must be proud of what he accomplished.
Do you think Rayne Prescott can replace Romo?
He did a great job last season.
How were his stats?
He got 23 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions.
That is an incredible season!
If he can keep that up next season; they will have a good chance of going far in the playoffs.
I am sure they will at least make the playoffs.
They have a good chance of making it.
If they don't make it that will be a shame.
Well no reason to think about it now.
Yeah we have a few months until football starts back up.
Let's enjoy the rest of this summer!
