What was that band you went to see at the Fillmore in the summer of 2013?
That was Empire of the Sun!  They are a very good band from Australia.
I remember that they had an outlandish appearance, is that the right band?
Yes, they look different.  The singer wears a crown-like headdress.
Someone told me they're kind of spacey or something.
Well they're very creative, and they mix electronic and other kinds of music together.
So they have an actual band?  I don't get it.
They have some kind of tape playing and they also have a drummer and a bassist.  The singer plays guitar also.
So that's it, just three people onstage?
No, they also have four girls who are dancers.  They do all sorts of choreographed stuff and it's interesting.
Hmm.  I imagine they have other elaborate things too onstage, right?
Yes they do, absolutely.  There is a screen behind them also which plays videos that have something to do with the song as well.
Wow, so it's a pretty good show and pretty elaborate then.
Yes, and they have all kinds of props to do with the songs also.  The girls sometimes are in these mountain things and they come out over the course of the song.
Well that's pretty amazing.  I seem to remember there are only two guys in the actual music videos though.
Yeah, and interestingly enough, only one of them tours, it's the guy with the crown headdress and his name is Luke Steele.
That's interesting.  What happens to the other guy?
He just doesn't tour with them because he's a singer by skill but he doesn't sing on the albums really.
So what kind of duo is that then?
From what I can tell they are a creative duo but the actual stage show only needs one singer, so it's kind of forced for him to be there on the rare occasions he does show up.
