What was the best movie of 1994?
I would say Pulp Fiction.
Bzzzzz, you're wrong.
Okay.  Forrest Gump?
Bzzzzz, wrong again.
Entertain me.  Is it Shawshank Redemption?
Ding-ding-ding, we have a winner!
That was a truly great year for movies.
Agreed..  Any of those movies would have won best picture in a normal year.
I believe Forrest Gump took home the Oscar that year
It did, but I would have gone with Shawshank.
That's perfectly logical.  That's an all-time great movie.
I especially loved how they did the escape at the end.
You mean hiding the hole through the Rita Hayworth poster?
Yep.  And he spent so many years digging the hole!
And bringing the rock and dirt out into the courtyard.
Truly a memorable movie.  The ending was just fantastic.
Walking on the beach, meeting Red...
Just perfect really.
Alright, you convinced me.  Shawshank was the best film of that year.
