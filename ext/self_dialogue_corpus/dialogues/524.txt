Who do you consider America's football team?
Everyone says it's the patriots..
They used to say the Cowboys.
Yes, they did. Maybe in the nineties.
There were some good players back then.
There was.
Trpy Aikman was everyones favorite.
Yeah, he was okay.
I liked Deion Sanders better.
Me too.
Not a fan of the team though. They're rivals.
I remember the one New Years Day game when it snowed.
That was a terrible game.
Yes, your brother loved the Cowboys and you didn't.
That was a rough day to watch football.
I could imagine.
Emmitt Smith was a great player.
Yes, he was an MVP in the one SuperBowl.
I didn't know that.
If I'm not mistaken it was Superbowl XXVIII
