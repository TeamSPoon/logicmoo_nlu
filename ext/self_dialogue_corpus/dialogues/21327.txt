What did you think of Grand Tarino?
It was alright.
Alright? what did you not like about it?
The old man was mean.
The old man? You mean Clint Eastwood?
Yes, he was so mean to the neighbor kid.
You do realize he tried to steal his car?
Yes, but the boy was forced to steal it.
He didn't know that at the time.
well that explains a lot.
So what did you like about it?
I like how he drove up and helped the girl get away from those gang members.
Me too. When he pulls his hand out of his pocket and acts like its a gun, only he could do that and make it look cool.
I thought it was funny when he kept giving the boy dating tips
It was cool when he gave him the grand tarino
I would so drive that car, classic muscle cars rock, perfect car for the movie.
I agree, a mustang would have ruined it. A 1966 camaro would have been cool too.
Nah, wouldn't have made near as an intriguing title.
I hated it when he died.
He was going too anyway, he was sick. At least he went out in style.
