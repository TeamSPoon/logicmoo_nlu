What is your favorite genre of music?
My favorite music genre is alternative?
Why do you think that is your favorite musical genre?
I like all types of music, and think music over defined and categorized.  Alternative is my favorite, because it tends to be where I find the most inspiration.
Do you have a favorite alternative band?
I like a lot of different bands.  The one that come immediately to mind is 'Dinosaur Jr.'.
Have you ever gotten to see 'Dinosaur Jr.' live?
Yes, I got to see them live for the first time just this year.
Do you own much of their music?
Yes, I own quite a lot of their stuff in my collection.
How do you prefer to collect your music?  Do you have a preferred format?
I have CDs, downloads and vinyl in my collection.   I'm trending more towards downloads, because of space and storage issues.
Are there any good music shops where you live?
Yes, our town has managed to keep a number of long-serving record stores in business.
Do you have any questions for me, regarding music?
Sure what is YOUR favorite style of music?
I like theatrical soundtracks.
I would not have expected that to be at the top of your musical list?
I tend toward classical-music style soundtracks, more than music-compilation soundtracks.
That makes sense.
