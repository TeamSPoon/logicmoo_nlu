Seriously? on the radio?
Yes, SiriusXMU plays them
Well, what did you think of their new songs?
It's okay. Sounds like their old stuff.
Well that isn't a bad thing, right?
No! I loved their old records.
Maybe you just need to listen to this new album more?
Yes I think so. I listened to the old album for years.
Me, too. I saw them live as well.
Oh really? Where
At ACL. Like, 7 years ago.
How did they sounds live?
Actually really good!
Oh cool. I wonder if they'll tour again?
I hope so, and if they do, we can see them together
Sounds like a plan!
I just hope they come to Texas and the tickets aren't too expensive.
Agree.
