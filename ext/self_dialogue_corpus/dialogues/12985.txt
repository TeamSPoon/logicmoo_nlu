What do you like most about the Star Wars movies?
I like the technology like the droids and stuff.
Yes the AI in star wars takes it to the next level.
I wonder if it will ever be like that in real life.
When robots have real personalities like CP3O and R2D2.
It might some day you never know.
When they get like that they are almost human.
In Star Wars they still treat them as disposable despite the intelligence.
It will be an ethical dilemma to think about.
Sure will be.
