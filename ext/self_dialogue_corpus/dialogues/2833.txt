I hate waiting on the NFL to return!
I know! I wish we could have football year around.
Who is your favorite team?
I love the Tennessee Titans!
Are you a big fan?
Yes! I have loved them ever since I was a child.
Who is your all time favorite player in franchise history?
I would have to say Steve McNair would be my favorite.
I liked him a lot, he was a really good quarterback.
Yea, he came so close to winning us a Superbowl. I still think about that game!
I do not blame you, that was one of the best Superbowl games of all time.
We were simply one yard short of winning it all. That is the only game that has ever made me cry.
I think I would have cried to if that happened to the Raiders.
I did not know you are a Raiders fan.
Yea, they have been my team for a very long time.
Who would you say is your favorite player in Raider history?
I will go with Bo Jackson! He is the best in my book.
Bo was a great player! I think he should be considered among the top five running backs of all time.
I feel the same way! He was also a great baseball player as well.
He was a rare specimen to say the least!
