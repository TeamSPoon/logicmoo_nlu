Hi, do you like movies?
I love movies.
Me too, I go to the redox quite frequently
I like redbox, a lot cheaper then going to the theater.
Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw Lego Batman.
That one was good, great family movie
I want to see Beauty and the Beast. I haven't seen it yet
It was so good you won't be sorry.
I've been waiting to see the second guardians of the galaxy
Me too. I've been excited for tiny Groot
He is so adorable.
The first movie wasn't too good, tiny groot is really the only reason to watch the second one
I completely agree
I watched Central Intelligence last week
Thats the one with Kevin hart?
Yes Kevin Hart and the rock
Was it good?
It was really funny
I'll have to watch it
