Wow, cool Jets shirt, you don't see many of those around here Eagles country.
My grandpa is a huge fan. He always gives me Jets merch for presents.
What do you think about Eric Decker going to the Titans?
I think the Jets will look like idiots for letting him go.
He was on fire before he got so banged up last year.
Yeah, Jets management will never cease to amaze me.
My cousins in NY curse Leon hess and blame him for everything.
They get a little momentum and then boom another stupid trade.
How do you feel about the Giants?
Personally, I like them more then some NFC teams but we don't mention them at grandpa's house.
I have an uncle in the city who says that the Bills are the only legitimate NY team.
A lot of people feel that way and refuse to root for Jersey teams.
Don't get me started on Eli Manning, I'm not a fan.
He's no Peyton, that's for sure.
The team has some serious talent but once again sketchy management.
The Big Apple and the NFL are two powerful forces. Who wants to be in the middle of that.
Remember when the Jets picked up Tim Tebow?
Tebow? That was ridiculous, they lost fans over that.
I would like to see decker put up some huge numbers this year.
He's got a one year contract, expect an myp performance.
