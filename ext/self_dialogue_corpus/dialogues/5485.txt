Holes was a really good movie
I know the scene where tehy went on the mountain was cool
it was and they ate all of the sweet onions and had water
and then the lizards would not bite them because they ate the ontions
and when they found the treasure that was neat
it was and they found out they were related
that part was neat, digging all of those holes was pointless
it was, they really wanted that treasure though
I always wondered how that lake dried up
maybe there was a curse on it, like most Disney movies
