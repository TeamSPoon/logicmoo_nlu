I can't tell you how much I LOVE the Princess Bride.
Really? Me too!
What's your favourite part?
I love the fire swamp with the ROUS's. What about you?
Oh man, so many good scenes.
I love the part where the old lady is like, "bow to the queen of slime!" and the whole mad max thing, "get back witch!"
Oh my gosh, those are great. What about the wine scene?
How could I forget?! "so CLEARLY, the poison must be in front of you!"
I can't picture anyone else in that role.
I can't picture anyone other than Andre the giant as the giant.
You know what? I never knew that the grandpa was Peter Faulk who played Columbo.
Who?
Columbo, liutenant Columbo on that old murder mystery show.
Oh, who knew! I just knew him as that guy who plays the grandpa for a few minutes.
I mean I thought he did a great job of playing grandpa, but it's cool to now have that background and be able to recognize him as the guy who sneakily figures out who done it.
I heard he has a glass eye.
He does, it's super hard to notice, not that you have much opportunity to in that movie.
I'm so glad I lived my life familiar with that movie.
I seriously can't imagine living without it. I mean, the Pit of Despair??
Oh man, I love Mel Smith as the albino.
