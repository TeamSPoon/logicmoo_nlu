Who is your favorite pop singer?
I love Whitney Houston.
She has a fabulous voice.
Yes! And how iconic is I WIll Always Love You?
It made that movie The Bodyguard.
And she won a Grammy for it.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Such a great song.
Who is your favorite pop singer?
I'm a huge Britney Spears fan.
She has some really fun dance songs.
And I loved her comeback. Songs like Womanizer I felt were amazing.
That is a fun song. It's catchy, but has a message to relay.
Yeah I like that in a pop song.
It almost makes me think of Salt-N-Pepa.
Yeah, they're not pop artists, but they always had a message for women.
George Michael was a pop singer with some messages in his songs.
That's true, like Faith.
Exactly what I was thinking.
But then sometimes a song with no really good message is fun too.
Like DNCE's Cake by the Ocean. I totally know what you mean.
