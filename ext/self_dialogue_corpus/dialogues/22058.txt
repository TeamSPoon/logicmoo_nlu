Have you seen "Titanic"?
Yes, it's one of my favorite movies!
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are amazing aren't they?
They were perfect for their characters.
The special effects were incredible!
Yes, I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the movie.
Rose's husband was so chauvinistic in his role.
Yes, I'm surprised she married such a man.
The scene where the boat overturns had me in suspense!
That was an incredible scene!
The nude scene was very well played.
Yes, not obscene at all.
Hard to believe it's over 3 hours, I didn't want to leave my seat.
I also didn't want to miss a minute of the movie.
I can't believe it was 20 years ago it debuted.
I remember the scenes very vividly.
Seeing the bodies floating around was a little disturbing for me.
To this day, I'm hesitant to go on a cruise.
The ending was very sad.
Yes, too bad Rose's husband survives.
