What's your favorite Fast and Furious movie?
Probably The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.
What do you like about that one?
It's pretty exotic.  All the neon in downtown Tokyo at night.
Right. Anything else?
The drifting technique.  Kind of fascinating.
They made it look effortless.
But I think it really takes a lot of practice.
And the ensemble was really great in this one.
Plus so much racing on the surface streets. Spectacular!
