Allright, what's the absolute best superhero movie, ever?
That would be M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable!
Granted, Samuel L. Jackson does a fine job as Mr. Glass, but it's awfully low-key for a superhero movie.
It's a slow burn, right to the end and ultimately the origin story of a superhero.
Also, the origin story of a super villain, though that's not revealed until the end.
Still, the story of David Dunn and his slow discovery and acceptance of his abilities is so good because deep down, he's just the average Joe he always thought he was.
Except he's not and he's spent his whole life trying to pretend that he is, leading to a mediocre life and boring existence.
His finally becoming who and what he is, makes for a compelling movie and his journey is skillfully portrayed by Bruce Willis.
I still think it's going a bit too far to call it the best superhero film, ever.
Maybe, but the sequel comes out in 2019, so we'll see if that changes either of our minds.
