Whats the last movie you went to the theater to see?
I haven't been to the movies in a while.  I think the last one I saw there was The Shallows.
What is that one again?
It's the one with Blake Lively and she's surfing and gets trapped by a shark.
Oh yeah, I remember seeing previews for that one.  I thought it looked stupid.
Actually it was pretty good.  I didn't think Blake Lively was that good of an actress but she did good in this movie.
The only movie I've seen her in was The Age of Adaline and the previews made that movie look so good but it just wasn't.
Wasn't Harrison Ford in that too?
Yes, he played a guy she used to know.  He was only in it for a few minutes though.
I haven't really seen him in many things lately other than a few minutes in the new Star Wars movie.
His best movies were the Indiana Jones movies.
Those are some of my favorite.  The newest one they did of those wasn't good though.
I do remember that.  It had Shia LaBouf in it right?
Yeah, he was in it.  It was kind of just sad because they had Harrison Ford doing all these crazy things in the movie and making jokes about his age.
They need to stop trying to make money off of old series and come up with some new ideas.
I know I feel like everything is a remake anymore.
Did you hear they're rebooting the Spiderman franchise again?
Again? They made those ones with Toby McGuire then the ones with Andrew Garfield and now they're doing more.
They are.  Apparently its going to have Tom Holland playing Spiderman.
I've never even heard of him.
