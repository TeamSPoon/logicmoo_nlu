What's your favorite kind of music?
Probably pop.
Yeah me too.
Who's your favorite artist?
Miley Cyrus I think. You?
Probably Ariana Grande, if i had to chose one.
Oh man, did you hear about what happened at her concert?
Yeah I can't believe it, so tragic.
It kinda makes me scared to go to a concert again.
Yeah me too, I hope Ariana Grande recovers from that trauma.
Did you watch the finale of the Voice?
Yeah, why?
Usher and Chris Blue dedicated a song to everyone hurt in the bombing.
Oh yeah, I saw that. Miley Cyrus did too.
I didn't stay up late enough to see her performance.
Oh, you should watch it. She sang so emotionally and her set was beautiful.
Are you going to any concerts coming up?
No plans. You?
Not that I know of, but I always enter radio contests to win tickets!
Maybe I'll hear you on the radio then! haha
