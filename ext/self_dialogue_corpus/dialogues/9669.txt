Can you tell me why their is not more types of rap
Their is a lot of rap
I just feel like only one kind exists
Nah not at all
Explain this to me
Well their is Hip Hop and west coast
Okay how do they differ
Well hip hop is more smooth and suave
Makes sense
And west coast is more focused on rhythm and flow
