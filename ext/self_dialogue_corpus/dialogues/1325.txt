Ready for a Miami Super Bowl?
That's funny, Don't see that happening.
We do have Suh!
Detroit didn't even want him.
There's always a chance.
Yea, if the city of Miami bids on a Super Bowl.
You know Marino ain't coming back.
Marino? I'd settle for Scott Mitchell at this point.
Oh it's not that bad.
I bet they don't win 5 games this year.
Even with two against the Jets?
I don't see much success from this team.
I bet they have a winning season.
I hope you are right and I am wrong.
I wonder what Don Shula would think?
He'd make this a better team in a hurry.
Still has the only undefeated team in history!
He was a great coach.
Yea, they don't make them like that anymore.
Well, I'm still ready for some football.
