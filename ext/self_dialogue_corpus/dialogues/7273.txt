Do you remember the very first Disney movie you ever saw?
I do! I saw Bambi at the drive in movie theater.
At the drive in? Wow, that's cool.
Yeah, I remember how cool it was. I loved the short movie clips they played before the movie too.
They are starting to bring back some of those too.
I noticed! I saw an old time Mikey Mouse clip last time I went to the theater.
How fun! I just love how things have evolved.
It gets better every year. The 3D Disney movies are my favorites now!
I saw Toy Story 2 in 3D! I absolutely loved it!
I wish it was easier to watch 3D movies from home. I love them, but don't like the price tag at the theaters.
