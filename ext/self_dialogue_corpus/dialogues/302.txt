Did you like Venom as a villain?
He was different
It was neat to see how Peter handled it differently from the other guy
It was bad for both of them
Brock let it master him. Peter was able to beat it in the end
Brock died trying to keep the Venom suit
He must not have realized that it was turning him into a bad person
It made Brock kidnap Mary Jane. Peter realized the suit made him push Mary Jane, and got rid of it right away.
Spiderman had a hard time ditching that suit
It was easier when he found it was affected by sound
