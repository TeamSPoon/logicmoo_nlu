What's your favorite Disney movie?
It's either Beauty and the Beast or Mulan.
Well, you have to pick one!
Hmm, it's so hard to decide!
Wait, are you talking about the original Beauty and the Beast or the new live-action version?
The original, of course!
Hey, the new movie was good!
It was okay. Emma Watson is pretty great.
Yeah, what a good actress! Maybe you should wait to decide until you see the new live-action Mulan!
That makes sense. Better ask me again in a couple of years!
