You know what bugs me?
What's that?
Whenever you see Rapunzel, why does she have long hair again?
What do you mean?
So Flynn Rider cut her hair off in the movie, but it's always long in the cartoons again.
Ah, I see.  Guess it's better marketing.
But it totally breaks the canon of the series.
Do you really think kids care about that stuff?
My five year old noticed it!
Mine was too busy dancing around to the music.
