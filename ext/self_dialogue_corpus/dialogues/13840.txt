Are you a Lady Gaga fan
I am, she is a hell of a singer
Her songs are fun and your right, she can really sing.
I heard her sing live on Howard Stern and she was amazing!
I saw her in concert with my wife a few months ago.  It was a great show.
I like her newer song "million reasons"
I do also!  I also like the old ones like poker face and  ban romance.
She can really play the piano good also
I didn't know that.  That's cool to know
She really is one of the most talented artist that have come along in quite a while
