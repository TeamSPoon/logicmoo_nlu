Do you think the Yankees will make it to the post-season this year?
I hope so. Last year was a huge disappointment.
Well, this year they seem to be doing better.
Yes, absolutely. The Yankees have some younger players on the roster.
Some of the new players are excellent. The Yankees appear to be doing pretty well this year, in general.
I'd be willing to bet that they'll probably make it to the post-season.
They've been leading the AL East.
I'm really happy to see that. They should be leading it all the time with the size of their payroll.
True. But there are a lot of factors involved with their performance on the field.
I don't think Joe Girardi is a very good manager, though. That's just my opinion.
I agree. He's certainly no Joe Torre.
Those were the glory days when Joe Torre was manager and they had Derek Jeter on the roster.
They just haven't reached that level since then. Not consistently, anyway.
But it does seem like they're getting their act together this year.
I sure hope it continues.
I think it will. They've taken a risk with some younger players this year, and it's paying off.
It is. Aaron Judge is amazing.
Totally! Where'd he come from?
The Yankees actually drafted him four years ago out of college in California.
He's the one to watch. I think he could be a Jeter-level superstar.
