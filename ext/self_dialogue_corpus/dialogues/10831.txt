Are you going to catch the new Fast & Furious movie?
Nah. They stopped being good when they stopped being about street racing and turned into cheesy spy flicks
Same. And when Paul Walker died, it kinda made the whole street racing thing seem like a bad idea.
Yeah, it sucks when you get killed trying to do the same dumb stunts in reality as in your movies.
I mean, at least they still got Vin Diesel, but he's gettin' kinda old, ya know?
Same for Jason Statham. they need new movies, not more of the same old stuff.
Did you know Diesel play the voice of a robot?
Wait, seriously?
Yeah, he was the robot in "The Iron Giant."
I can see it now: "*BEEP BEEP* I AM GOING TO DO SOME DRIFTING AND MAKE JASON STATHAM LOOK GOOD."
