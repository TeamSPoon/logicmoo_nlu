Have you discovered any new music lately?
Not really.  I'm looking for something I could really relate to.
Well I've discovered someone new.  She definitey relates to me.
How so?
She's singing about staying in a relationship for too long and just questioning why.
I'd be interested in that. What's her name?
Her name is Kehlani.
Thanks, I'll look her up.  What kind of music does she make?
It's R&B with a little pop.
That's my kind of style. Where did you find her?
I was using the Apple music app and put on new pop music and she was there.
Has she been out long?
Yeah, for a few years. She used to be a model.
Wow. She went from modeling to signing?
Yep. She has a very unique look.
Doesn't surprise me with her modeling background.
Download her album SWEETSEXYSAVAGE  Most of the songs are great relationship songs.
I'll download her album tonight.
Great. Let me know what you think of it.
I will. Later.
