Do you like Disney movies?
I do, always have.
What are some of your favorites?
I like "Sleeping Beauty", "Cinderella", "Princess and the Frog", "Bambi"
I thought "Bambi" was so sad.
It was when Bambi's Mother got shot. But the other parts are cute.
True. Do you like any of the Disney-Pixar movies?
Yes! "The Incredibles" is probably my favorite.
I love that movie, too.
I wish they would come out with a sequel.
I heard one was in the works, but I'm not sure if that's just a rumor.
I like the "Toy Story" movies, too.
Which one is your favorite?
The third one, definitely.
That is a great one. I'm not a huge fan of Jesse.
Who does her voice?
Joan Cusack.
Oh yes, now I remember. Why don't you like her character?
I think she's a little annoying. Too high pitched, too.
That's funny. She doesn't bother me. Slinky dog is one of my favorite characters.
