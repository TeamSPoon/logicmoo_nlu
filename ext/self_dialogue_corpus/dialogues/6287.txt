I want my daughter to see the classic Disney movie, "Cinderella".
Oh, I think she'll like that. Especially the dancing at the end.
Yes, I'm sure she'll like Prince Charming. What do you think she'll say about the mice?
I'm sure she will especially like Gus. He's funny.
Yes, he is. Do you remember anything scary in the movie?
Not really, just the mean stepmother. Especially when she locks Cinderella in her room.
Oh yes, I'll have to be sure to watch that part with her.
I think she'll like the movie. However, I'm sure she'll want glass slippers afterwards.
Good point. I better be ready for that.
Yes, get the credit card ready for shoes and dresses!
