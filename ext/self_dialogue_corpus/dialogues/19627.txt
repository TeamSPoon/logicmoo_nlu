Did you see BTS at the Billboard awards?
I don't know them - are they the Korean guys?
Yeah, they're the K-pop group.  It was pretty exciting to see them win.
What did they win?
It was the social artist award.
They give out awards for that now?
I know, I don't get it either.  But it was still cool to see an Asian group get represented.
Had you heard of them before?
Yeah, I actually saw them in concert last month.
Were they any good?
They're definitely very energetic.  They're decent rappers.
Koreans like rap?
It's becoming pretty popular there.  A lot of the younger groups have rappers.
Actual rappers?
Well, most of the time it's the ones who can't sing.
Ha, of course!  Because they think rap isn't music.
I don't know about that, ha.  But this group is pretty good.
What do they sing?
A lot of electronic music.  I'll send you their big hit on YouTube later.
Sounds good.  They'd better be good!
