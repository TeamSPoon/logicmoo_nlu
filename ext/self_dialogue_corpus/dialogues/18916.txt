Why do you think people like the Beatles?
I don't know. I can't stand them.
I think it must be a nostalgia thing.
I think it's just baby boomers telling us what to like and not like.
That music is annoying cheery.
A lot of the lyrics are stupid and overly simple.
It's not like the Rolling Stones!
Yeah, they were way cooler.
All you have to say is Mick Jagger vs Paul McCartney.....
I know, right?! You can't get any cooler than Wild Horses by the Stones.
I saw them in concert. Satisfaction gets my vote.
Dude that is old school. They are still going!
Yeah, Keith and Mick got to be 100!
Yeah, but they can still wear skinny pants and rock out.
It's got to be an expensive concert to go to....it was super expensive.
I bet. I'm not sure I like them that much.
It was totally worth it. They really rock out.
Even if the Beatles were still around, they couldn't touch the Stones.
Heck no! Stones rule, Beatles drool!
Even the Stone's album last year was rockin'!
