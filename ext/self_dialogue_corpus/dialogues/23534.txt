I'm a huge fan of Bladerunner. Can't believe the sequel's coming out, thirty years later.
I like the movie too!
Did you read the story?
Unfortunately no.
Oh you should its great.
How different is it from the movie?
Its much the same, except at the end.
What happens then?
Well its a happy version.
Its great Harrison Ford came back.
Yeah I think so.
They must have cast Ryan Gosling due to physical similarities.
Ford's character is a clone you know..
No I didn't! It wasn't clear to me.
You and a lot of other viewers.
Wow.  That gives the movie a whole new meaning.
I get that.  Can't wait for the new film!
Now me neither.  Maybe I should see the old one again.
I wouldn't mind that either.
Maybe you could point out the highlights to me.
