I like some genres. But, I don't like the Horror genre.
I see. What's your favorite genre?
I like foreign films.
Really? What is your favorite country for movies?
I like French movies.
Can you give me some examples?
Anything by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
I understand. Amelie is amazing! What's your favorite of his movies?
I like City of Lost Children best.
Yes, that's good as well. What other country makes great films?
China has some really amazing ones.
You mean Kung Fu movies?
No, not at all. Although, some of those are great movies as well.
Well, then, what do you mean?
I like anything by Yimou Zhang.
Yes, Jou-do is incredible!
It is, but my favorite is House of Flying Daggers.
That one is amazing! But, I think Hero is even better.
I agree. Let's be sure to see Shadow together when it comes out in 2108!
