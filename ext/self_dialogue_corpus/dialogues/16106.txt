My friend is having an album release party for the new Decemberists album. Want to come?
Maybe. What kind of music is it.
It's like indie folk-pop. Very Portland.
Hmm. I could get into that.
I think you'd like it, and even if it's a bust, it's still a party.
Any songs I would know?
They had one called The Crane Wife that was on a few sitcoms. It's based on the folktale.
Is that a thing they usually do? Base music on folktales?
They do it more often than most bands. There are a few songs like that.
Hmm.. anything else?
Lots of literary references. One of the band members has an MFA in writing, so I guess he's witty.
That could be interesting.
We could listen beforehand if you want and then decide?
That would be good. What should we start with.
The song Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect is my favorite. It's very low key.
Okay. Do you have it on your phone.
Actually no, but I bet we can search for.
Okay. Let's listen.
Here we go. What do you think?
I guess I'll come to the party.
