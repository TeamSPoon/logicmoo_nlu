Do you think rock is as good as it used to be?
I think rock comes and goes in waves. Right now, it's kind of boring.
I agree. The last rock band I really loved was The Killers.
They're great, kind of a rockier version of Duran Duran.
Are you listening to anybody else?
Right now I'm really into classic rock and roll.
You mean like Chuck Berry?
Exactly! Anything on Chess Records or so.
I'm a big Buddy Holly fan.
Buddy Holly and Elvis are two of my favorites.
