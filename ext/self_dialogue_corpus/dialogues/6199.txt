Do yoou know that there are a lot of mistakes in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?
What kind if mistakes?
When Snow White bakes a pie, at first it's round, but in the next scene it's flat.
I never noticed that.
When the dwarfs start singing Hi Ho, they just suddenly appear in an empty mine singing.
I'll have to check that out.
Another mistak is that Dopey slams a door shut, then suddenly the door is back open.
You  really know a lot of trivia.
I watched a video on YouTube that pointed out the mistakes.
I'm going to look for that video.
