Hey Bryan, tomorrow is Halloween do you want to have a monster movie marathon?
Sure Mike what movies do you want to watch?
I was thinking maybe we can start with Puppet Master, what would you want to go with next
How about we do the classic Nightmare on Elm Street
God that movie gave me nightmares when I was a kid.  How about we also add "Basketcase"
Don't think I know that one but sounds good to me, any other good scary movies?
Jeeper Creppers is a great monster flick also
Oh yeah I remember that one
I'll get the beer if you want to pick up some popcorn and chips
On my way to the store right now.  See you tomorrow night
