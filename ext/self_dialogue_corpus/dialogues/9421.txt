Is rap and hip-hop the same thing?
Not at all. They are related but not the same.
How so?
Rap is a genre of music characterized by spoken word sprinkled rhythmically over a beat. Hip-hop is a culture that involves rap.
A music culture right?
Yes, but not only is hip hop considered music, it's a state of mind, okay. The way you dress, talk, party, emote, all of it is hip-hop.
So I can be hip-hop without a single song playing. Like, in total silence.
Exactly. Rap, however can't exist without a beat and lyrics.
So if I'm wearing Phat Farm clothing in total silence, I can be hip-hop?
Right, but you can't rap until you open your mouth and spit some bars over a beat.
