I know you're a pro wrestling fan, so I wanted to ask you about movies featuring wrestlers.
Ok, shoot.
What do you think is the best movie with a pro wrestler in a starring role?
The Rock has a few good movies to his credit, but I'm going to go with Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy.
Ok, what do you think is the worst movie with a pro wrestler in a starring role?
Take your pick of any movie that stars Hulk Hogan.
Does that include Rocky 3?
He doesn't star in that-- it's little more than a cameo.  I'm talking about Mr Nanny, No Holds Barred, Santa with Muscles.
Santa with Muscles??
Yeah, his this rich bodybuilder that gets amnesia and thinks he's Santa Claus, and starts fighting crime.
That sounds like both the best and worst thing I've ever heard of.
And, a young Mila Kunis appeared in a supporting role.
Are there any movies about pro wrestling that are any good?
The Wrestler, with Mickey Rourke is pretty good.
It must've been-- it revitalized his career for a while.
Yeah, he appeared in a string of movies after that, most notably Iron Man 2.
What about bad movies about pro wrestling?
The Wrestler, from the 1970s.  So slow, dull, and they can't decide if wrestling is real or fake in that movie.
Who stars in that movie?
The guy you think of when you think of thickly muscled, intimidating men-- Ed Asner.
