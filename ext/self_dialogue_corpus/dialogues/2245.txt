Hey there! I am trying to decide who is a better football player, Eli or Peyton Manning. What do you think?
I will always like Peyton Manning better.
Why is that?
I mean come on. He is a for sure Hall of Famer and a 5 time NFL MVP. He was unbelievable.
True but Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP.
Peyton has won that award too.
Eli Manning is going to the Hall of Fame too. I mean you can't use that as a comparison.
It is tough to compare the two. They are both so good.
They also both have 2 super bowl rings.
Yeah but when Peyton was on his game, he was so accurate with the ball. He had better location than anyone in the game.
Yes but Eli can beat defense on his feet.
That's true but Peyton doesn't need to beat defense on his feet because he knows the game so well.
What does that mean?
Peyton beats defense with his brain. He knows more about the defense of the other team than the other team knows about themselves.
I guess Peyton is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
He completely is! And look at the record of them playing against each other in the NFL. Peyton's teams have gone undefeated versus Eli.
That's true too. Well maybe you have me on this one.
I think I do.
Ok, so Peyton Manning is the better quarterback. You win.
Ha! I knew I was right!
