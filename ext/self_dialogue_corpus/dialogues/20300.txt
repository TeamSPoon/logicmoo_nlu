Have you ever seen the movie Snatch?
Dude, that's one of my all time favorites.
Yeah, the characters are awesome. Turkish and Brick Top and whatnot.
My favorite was Bullet Tooth Tony.
Heck yes, my favorite scene is when he's driving the car with the dude hanging out the window.
I remember that. The Madonna song that was playing when he got shot up starts playing on the radio.
Yeah, it's funny, he looks at Avi and his face lights up. "I love this track."
Lennie James from the Walking Dead plays Sol in that movie.
Man, that guy doesn't age does he?
You're right. He looks the same today as he did back in 2000.
Could you understand anything that Brad Pitt or the other gypsies were saying?
Not at first, but I've seen that film a bunch of times and now I understand every word.
That's cool.
They are speaking English, it's just the inflection in their speech that makes it so hard to understand.
That movie really got Jason Statham's career going.
It certainly did, and Brad Pitt's character is by far my favorite of the roles he's played.
I just realized that Madonna and Guy Ritchie used to be married. No wonder they used that Madonna song.
Which song was it? I forget.
It was Lucky Star wasn't it?
That's right. Man I love that movie.
