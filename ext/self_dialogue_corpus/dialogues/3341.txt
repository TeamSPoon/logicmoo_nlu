What do you think of them redoing IT?
I am excited for it.. have you seen the trailer?
I have and I do think they did a good job creating a creepy vibe.
I think it will be even better than the original It. It was a tv mini series and this is a movie which makes me think it will be better right away.
Maybe had not taken that into consideration. Probably won't have time to focus as much on the backstory of the characters.
True,I hope they don't loose the essence of the story itself. But think it looks amazing.
The new pennywise is super scary, I love tim curry but the updated version is even scary.
Bill Skarsg√•rd is set as pennywise in the new version. i don't know him to well, but think he will give a worthy show.
He seems so young, but then you see him in the make up and trailer and he is so menacing.
He really is. I am looking forward to his performance. As well as the kid from stranger things performance.
