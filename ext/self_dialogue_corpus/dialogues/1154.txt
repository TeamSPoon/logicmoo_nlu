Hi are you reading the NFL page on ESPN.com?
Yes I am! I am catching up on news for my favorite NF team.
Really who is your favorite team?
Dallas cowboys. I really love Zeke!
Oh I do too! Zeke Elliot is such a great running back for the team.
He is one of the reasons that the team did so great last year.
Yea I know Dak Prescott and Zeke are just what the Cowboys needed to get back in the playoffs.
It is a shame that with the regular season they had that they bombed in the playoffs.
I know! I really though the cowboys would make it to the superbowl.
I guess it just wasn't the cowboys year. I really wish someone would win besides New England Patriots.
I agree. Tom Brady is hot but after deflategate, I just do not like him or that team.
I think that besides the Raiders really have a chance next year.
They are ok. The defense is looking better with Bruce Irvin and Karl Joseph.
Yea but the Raiders QB isn't too bad either.
Yea Derek Carr isn't too bad. If he is healthy this year, they will have a chance to go far in the playoffs.
Yea can you imagine the Cowboys vs the Raiders in the superbowl?
Yea that would be great since Raiders are AFC and Cowboys are NFC.
I would take a miracle for both teams to win their conferences though.
Probably. It seems when both team are starting to have a good season, a injury occurs.
Lets hope for a great season for both!
