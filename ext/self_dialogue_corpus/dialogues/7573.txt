What do you like about Diagon Alley?
I love that it's basically right next to the Muggle world, but invisible.
I kinda like that the bar is the secret entrance.
Well, it's not the only entrance.
What other entrance is there?
The floo network!
Oh, right! Harry went to that creepy shop accidentally that way.
Yes! I just like that the magic folk have their own little city.
With a ton of cool shops too, what's your favorite shop?
The Weasley brothers' shop of course!
