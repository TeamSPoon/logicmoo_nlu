Hey what do you think about Kanye West's song Famous?
I love Taylor Swift and I think he really was rude to her.
Okay I don't think that at all I think that Taylor Swift is lucky Kanye even reffered to her. Like he's the best rapper of this generation.
Okay him saying " I mad that bitch famous" was so disrespectful!"
That's just dramatic, he is rap gold. His lyric "But we still hood famous, Yeah we still hood famous." Like he came from the streets to build his empire.
I guess that is true,I don't know I just wish Rap wasn't so vulgar.
Well yeah we want to filter the world but thats not how the world is.
I don't know I just am very conservative.
Yeah I can obviously tell,you just need to lighten up.
I guess.
