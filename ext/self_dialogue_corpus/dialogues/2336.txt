HOw many SUperbowls did the Cowboys win?
I think they won five in total.
Wow, that is a lot.
Yup, I think they are the second highest team.
I remember they did win two Superbowls in two years.
They must have been ecstatic.
And rich.
Was that under Tom Landrey?
Not sure, great coach though.
He really was.
Yea but I think the new owner of the team fired him in 1989.
I guess they needed some new blood.
And new game plays too.
Well, I liked him.
I know they won the Superbowl in 92, 93 and 95 under th enew owner,
Well they are a great team no matter who is coaching I think.
Me too.
They have had some really good players over the years.
yea they have.
Great team.
