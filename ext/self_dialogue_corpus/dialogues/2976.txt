What sport do you think is the most watched?
In the world or in the country?
In the world I think it's soccer, hands-down. In the country, I'd think football.
I guess so. I know I watch it every Sunday, Monday or Thursday when it's in season.
So do I. Do you watch it at home or at a bar?
I tend to watch it at home. I like to feel like I'm getting use out of the cable sports package I've purchased
So do I! I pay so much to get Fox, CBS, ESPN, and NBC just to make sure I can see every game.
ESPN is so expensive for me. I wish I could just watch everything online.
They're really strict about that. I don't think you can really watch it for free online nowadays.
I pay so much at this rate I might as well just pay to go a couple game a season.
If you're serious about going I would go with you.
We really should. Hard Rock Stadium is pretty easy to get to from here.
To be honest though I would only go depending on who they're playing.
Have some faith in our Miami Dolphins!
Sorry, I don't deal with faith. I deal with results.
Yes, they have been disappointing these past few seasons.
Completely disappointing.
We need to have another legend like Dan Marino!
Well he wasn't the only great player on the team, but he motivated the entire team to compete well amongst each other as well as against other teams.
Yes exactly. Having one key player makes the entire team perform greater.
