Is there any good American team.
Ugh.
Seattle?
Ugh, no.
The border states.
I heard good stuff about New York.
What's the place that plays New Brunswick teams a lot?
I think Vermont?
No, I'm not sure.
it's around there.
Maybe.
Washington?
Actually, huh.
Yeah, I'd think.
They must.
They're in the area, kinda.

They do amazing.
Best team we have.
