Do you know if Green Day still makes music.
As far as I know, they do. I haven't heard anything from them recently.
True, it's been a while since I've heard something from them.
The last song I remember is "Know Your Enemy", and I believe that came out in 2009.
Wow, that song came out that long ago? That's almost a decade ago.
For real, time has flown. Just think, it's been over 20 years since Green Day came on the scene.
Yes, back in the days of High School. I still remember when Basket Case came out.
Yes, 1994, I believe it was.
They took off right after Basket Case and made hit after hit for the next decade.
Some hard following fans would suggest they sold out.
I prefer to think they made it big.
They seemed to get too political also sometime in the middle of the 2000's. I hate when artists become political.
For real. I think that the whole American Idiot album was a backlash against George W Bush.
It was around that time of the 2004 election and many people saw the album as a movement for the left.
They had a few good hits on that album. That seems to be their last big album that I remember.
Maybe the politicizing of their music really turned people off.
Could be a possibility. Not to mention they are getting older as well.
True. I do miss their older stuff.
I love the beat to their music. It is good music to go jogging or exercise to because of the rhythm and beats.
Really? That makes sense though. I'll have to put some of their music on my playlist next time I go for a jog.
