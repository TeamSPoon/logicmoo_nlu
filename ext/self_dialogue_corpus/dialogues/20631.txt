So what do you think about the movie Ocean´s Eleven?
Oh I thought it was fantastic very creative!

When they end up getting all the money thanks to Matt Damon´s mom in the movie, that was hilarious.
I know! You are right!. Who else co-stars with Matt Damon.
Oh you have very good ones, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, etc.
They are all good friends? right? they start in lots of movies.
Oh yeah, of course they also did Ocean´s Twelve and Thirteen.
Well with their movies you have a guaranteed good movie.  What other movies do you see them together?

You won`t believe it but both their voices were used in the Movie Happy Feet.
Ohh that´s so cute. I didn't see the movie, but I can just picture it. What about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt? Which movies have they shot togueter?
