I just watched LeGarrett Blount score three rushing touchdowns in the Eagles game
When was that?
Its was a repeat from a broadcast last year when they played against the New England Patriots
Must have been a pretty good game
Yes and LeGarrett Blount has pretty good stats
Isn't he their star quarterback,
No he's the running back!
Yeah but he's built more like a line backer
Yeah a guy that big - nobody is gonna get in his way
I know he has really good stats
Yes pretty impressive
Is he your favorit player?
Well for that particular team maybe
I thought you must be really impressed by him to watch a rebroadcast
Well actually I had to work that day it aired so I didn't see it live
I see.
I'm looking forward to seeing him play this year
Me too. He really is impressive with his moves
You may come to like the whole team
Maybe, though I always preferred the Falcons
