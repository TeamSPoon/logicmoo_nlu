Do you think either the Cavs or Warriors will go 16-0 during this postseason?
It's possible, but I don't think it's likely.
I don't, either. But, if you had to choose one of the two to go undefeated, who would it be?
I'd probably go with the Warriors.
Even with LeBron James playing as well as he has been?
Don't get me wrong. I don't think either team will go undefeated, but the Warriors do have Durrant.
They didn't even sweep the Cavs during the regular season!
Well, I think the postseason is much different than the regular season.
That's true. Of the two teams that are still left besides the Cavs and Warriors, which one do you think has the best chance of upsetting things and making it to the finals?
The Celtics, I think.
You really don't think the Cavs are all that good!
It's not that. It's just that the Cavs are up 2-0 while Golden State are up 3-0 over the Spurs and it's easier to overcome a two game deficit than a three-game hole.
I get that. I would love to see the Warriors lose four straight, though.
Because you hate Golden State?
Less that then the fact that I really like San Antonio.
Well, I would like to see LeBron face the Spurs again.
I think he'd win this time because Duncan's gone and the team is old.
Yeah. It wouldn't be the same.
I think it would make for a good narrative on ESPN, though.
Ha! That is probably exactly what would happen.
