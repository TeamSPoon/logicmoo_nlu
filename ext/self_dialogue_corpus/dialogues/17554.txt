My favorite album in the whole world is Melanie Martinez's album Cry Baby.
I think that album is pretty popular. I see a lot of her merchandise for sale at Hot Topic.
Really? I'll have to go check it out because I love her style.
It's very inspired by the name of her album and all of her songs.
Yes, I love how congruent the theme is.
What's your favorite songs from that album?
I love the songs Mad Hatter and Sippy Cup.
I've heard Sippy Cup before, but I've never heard Mad Hatter.
Mad Hatter is one of the lesser known songs from that album, but I love it so much.
Okay, here's a hard question. What's your least favorite song from Cry Baby?
That's a tough one. I would probably say Pity Party because the chorus is really loud.
I agree. It sounds very brash.
So what's your favorite song by her?
This is probably the most unoriginal answer, but I like Dollhouse the most.
Haha. That's definitely her most popular song.
Have you ever heard any of the remixes of it?
I've heard a few of them.
I really like the One Love remix.
I don't know if I've heard that one.
It speeds up the music and sounds kind of like dub step.
