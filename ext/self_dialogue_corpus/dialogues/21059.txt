Seen any good films lately?
Yeah, I just seen one called King Arthur.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was really good, full of action. Have you seen it?
No, it looks like every other Camelot movie. Especially Camelot.Did you ever see that one?
No, but those are both a lot like Tristan and Isolde.
I have not seen that one either. I know it is similar to Romeo and Juliet, right, like the movie?
Yes, very much like that film. Have you ever seen an other Shakespeare films?
Yeah, Shakespeare in love. Ever watched it?
yeah, it was kind of dull. I do like period pieces like that. Have you ever seen Roxanne?
That show was great!
Do you know any others like that?
Yeah, there are a few, maybe not the exact time but similar.
Like maybe Braveheart?
That is one! The movie Highlander is kind of similar, at least to Braveheart.
In a way. Well, which one do you think is better?
I would go with Braveheart. It has love and action. What about you?
Highlander, for sure. Did you ever see the second film of Highlander?
No, I know it did not do too well.Did you like it ?
I did, in a weird way. It was silly, but really entertaining.
