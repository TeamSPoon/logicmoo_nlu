Did you ever watch Batman vs Superman?
Yea, it was terrible.
I could not believe how bad it was.
The whole turning point of the fight was so stupid.
You mean the Martha scene?
Yea, it made no sense at all.
Two people trying to kill each other stop fighting because their mothers have the same name.
It is just so stupid, Snyder should stop making movies.
Yea, none of his movies have been good for a very long time now.
It has been all downhill since Watchmen and 300.
Yea, I do not understand why DC keeps signing him.
Yea, Suicide Squad was also realy bad.
I just don't get the executives.
Yea, why keep financing flops?
Maybe they still think they have a chance at beating Marvel.
We all know that will never happen.
Yea, they are just too big at this point.
And also their movies actually do well.
Yea, it seems like they have won the movie battle.
Yea, I just hope we start getting more original movies.
