Hey did you watch the super bowl?
I sure did watch it.
What did you think about it?
It was one of the greatest super bowls of all time. What about you?
I thought that it was the best example of a team never quitting.
Yes I would have to agree. Tom Brady has ice water veins.
He really does show what hard work and stone cold determination can do for a competitor.
Yea, it was laughable that the Falcons actually lost
Yea they played very cocky after getting a big lead early.
Yup. You can never stop playing when the stakes are that high.
Do you think both teams will make it back there next season?
I think that the Patriots will make it back but I am not sure about the Falcons.
I have the same thinking. That was a mentally defeating loss that could spill over to the future.
It is really up in the air at the end of the day. I would hate to have to go through something like that.
I know what you mean. I am super competitive and it hurt just to watch a team like that.
I tend to think you get what you put into it when it comes to football.
I can agree with that. Who do you think will make instead of the Falcons then.
I think the Packers will face off against the Pats.
Oh that is a good one. I can't wait to see it if it happens.
Yea they are my favorite team so I always think they are gonna go and win it all.
