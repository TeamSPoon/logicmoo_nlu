Hey, are you doing anything Friday night?
No, why?
There's really great band playing locally, I thought you might like to go with me.
Who is it?
Fall Out Boy,  have you heard of them?
No, I haven't.  What are they like?
They're a pop  punk band that I started listening to back in high school, when I bought a CD out of their drummer's trunks.
That's cool!  Have I heard any of their songs?
Probably.  They are played on the radio quite a bit and they have had some songs on movie soundtracks.
What was on the radio?
They did that song, "Dance, Dance" that was popular a while bank.  They also did "Sugar, We're Going Done."
Oh I have heard those!  They were really big when I was in college.
They also re did the "Ghostbusters" theme song when they re released the movie last year.
Oh that's awesome, I loved thae original movie!  I haven't seen the new one yet, actually.
We should watch it together sometime, I have it on blue ray.
I'd like that.  Is  it any good?
I thought it was pretty funny, and obviously I love the soundtrack.
Haha, good point.  Maybe we can watch it before we go see the show Friday?
I'd like that, why don't you text me later and we'll figure it out.
Can do, I'll get with you as soon as I get a babysitter lined up.
