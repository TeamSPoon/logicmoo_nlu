Hey do you like movies based on books?
Yeah, definitely.  Why do you ask?
Just wondering.  Some people don't like it.  What's your favorite?
Well, I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series, and American Psycho.
Oh, really?  I've heard mixed things about American Psycho.
No way, Christian Bale did an awesome job as Patrick Bateman.
I heard the acting was good but the ending was confusing.
It was supposed to be that way.  You were supposed to interpret it yourself instead of giving a concrete ending.
Oh, cool.  I haven't seen it so maybe I should check it out.
You should.  It's one of my favorite movies.  And I think it stayed true to the book.
That's cool, I'll definitely see it.  I really enjoyed Gone Girl myself.
Oh yeah, that was an awesome movie.  They did a great job.
Yeah, I thought that Ben Affleck did a really impressive job.
Yeah, he was definitely better in Gone Girl than he was in Batman Vs. Superman.
Oh man, yeah.  That movie was terrible.  The plot, the acting, everything.
Yeah, I had a hard time watching it.  I was mad that I paid for it after I saw it.
Yeah I actually drove to the theater to see it.  I could barely follow along what was going on.
Yeah, Ben Affleck couldn't have saved that movie, even if he was a decent Batman.
Well, not to bring up Christian Bale again, but HE was a great batman.
No doubt!
