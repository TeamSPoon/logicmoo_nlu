Did you know what NOS was when you watched The Fast and the Furious?
I had no clue and I still don't.
It was cool how it made him go way faster.
Paul Walker?
Everyone actually. They all used it.
That movie taught me a lot about cars.
Me too.
I loved the scene where Paul Walker put his car on the line.
Yeah, I was rooting for him.
It sucks that he lost though.
