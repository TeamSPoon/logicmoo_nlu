Today I've been listening to Isaiah Rashad.
Nice, which album?
The Sun's Tirade.
What's your favorite song so far?
Probably "Free Lunch" or "Silkk da Shocka"
I liked that album, and "Free Lunch" is my favorite song as well.
Did you ever see the video?
For free lunch? Yeah I've seen it.
Chill video as well.
If this were the only song I had to listen to for the rest of my life I'd be satisfied.
