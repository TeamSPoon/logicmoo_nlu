Do you like any Adam Sandler movies?
I'm not a fan of his, but I'll watch his movies every so often.
Oh, do you have any favorite?
I guess if I'd have to watch one of his movies right now, I'd watch Grown Ups.
Oh, that was a good one.
Yeah, in that one Sandler wasn't as goofy as some of his characters are.
Well, he is getting older.
Yeah, but years ago, he always had that same kid of character.
That wild crazy type of guy.
Exactly.  In Grown Ups it was more toned down.
You know who was funny in that movie?
There were a lot of good actors.  Who did you like?
I liked Rob Schneider's character the best.
Oh, he was so cringy!
Yeah, with that old lady for a wife.
That was so funny!
David Spader's character was funny, too.
Yeah, he was funny too.
I can't imagine how they were all friends.
I don't know but the movie was funny.
