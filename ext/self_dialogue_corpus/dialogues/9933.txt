Are you planning on checking out the new DJ Khaled album?
Not really.
Why not?
He seems to only work with newer artists. I don't know any of them.
That's not true. He's got songs with Nas, Fat Joe, and Raekwon on the new album.
That's a pleasant surprise.
And either way, his music with the newer artists isn't bad.
Who else has he worked with.
He's done songs with guys like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake. All solid rappers.
Alright, then. I'll give them a chance.
