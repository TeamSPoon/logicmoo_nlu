I've always wanted to go to a Superbowl game.
What, like sit the crowd and watch in real time?
Exactly, I feel like it would be a great experience.
Yeah, but loud and crazy.
I like loud and crazy! I wonder how people get the tickets.
They are crazy expensive, I don't know how people afford them either.
When I have money, I'm going to a Superbowl.
Well I hope that comes true for you.
Well what about you, have you ever been to a Superbowl?
Not personally, but my brother has.
Really, which one?
I don't remember the teams, but I do remember it was in 2003.
That's so long ago!
Yeah, I was a little kid at the time so I didn't go, but he talks about it all the time.
How did he get the tickets?
He won a radio contest with his friend.
Oh, nice!
Yeah, one of those "be the 8th caller" things.
Those contests are real?
Yeah, apparently!
