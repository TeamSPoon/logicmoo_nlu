What is the difference between rap and hip hop?
I have no idea.
I think hip hop is just popular rap.
Isn't most rap popular?
Alot of it is but no all of it.
What isn't popular?
Well, there are a lot of rappers you've never head of.
So any rapper I've heard of is a hip hop artist?
No I don't think that's true.
I'm so confused right now.
