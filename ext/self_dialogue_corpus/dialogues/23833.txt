So did you see the new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?
No, I didn't even know there was one!
I have to say that it was pretty horrible.
Why was it so bad?
Well, the acting was OK but the story was just sad without really being compelling...
Yea, that doesn't sound like it's worth watching...
It's a terrible feeling to have wasted close to two hours!
I know the feeling!  Was there anything redeeming about it?
Like I said, the acting was better than I thought it would be.
I can't picture Arnold being good in such a movie...
Yes, his range is limited.
At least an older action star is trying to branch out.
I'm not sure he has a choice!  I mean, he can't really do solely action movies anymore.
The one with Stallone was alright.
Yes, but it felt a bit like a B movie to me.
I understand.  What was the name of the new one anyway?
It's called Aftermath.
I guess I'm hearing the aftermath of Aftermath, then!
Yes, do yourself a favor and skip it.
I think I will!  Thanks for the tip!
