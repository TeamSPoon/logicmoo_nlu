I find that rap music more than any other genre can stir me to emotion.
I mean I've heard it's pretty angry music...
Not that, I mean it's diverse in the wide range of emotions it can contain, but there's some really sad stuff out there. Like some of the songs off of Tedashii's "Below Paradise".
I haven't listened to it.
Yeah, I think it's the speed of delivery that's so prevalent in the genre.
So it hits you with the sadness before you really know what hit you.
Exactly, with the slow sappy pop songs I can tell if it's leading to something sad and emotionally prepare myself for it, but with rap's typically rapid fire pace I don't get that.
Is that why you won't listen to Naughty By Nature's "Everything's Gonna Be Alright"?
It's about 10% the actual lyrics and the rest is because when I first heard that song I was going through a really hard time and being depressed and so every time I heard it it brings me right back to that place.
That's a shame, man.
