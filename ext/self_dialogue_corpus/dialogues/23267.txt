Whats your favorite Tarantino movie?
I have just rewatched the hateful eight twice and am still finding new pieces i absolutely believe are a result of Tarantino genius.
Inglourious Basterds. I think it's the height of both his dialogue and his characters.
I'm in the midst of watching all the Tarantino movies and so far Basterds is my favorite.
The action, suspense, and dialouge is flawless, but not quiet as quotable as Pulp Fiction.
Not a very quotable movie. But it has some of the most tense scenes. It is top 2 with Reservoir Dogs for me.
Yep, I loved Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino is great at suspense and tension which seems to be a motif in his movies.
Definitely. Tense scenes and dialogue are probably his two calling cards.
I've seen it at least four times, and the bar scene still gets my heart racing.
My second favorite Tarantino movie is Jackie Brown.
It's not the most innovative script.
I keep singing that song in my head every since man.
It's his film that's most like a film and not a series of interesting scenes.
He should work from pulp novels more. It wasn't my favorite when I first saw it but it is now, it's aged well and It's probably Jackson's best performance too.
I like Jackie Brown the best.
I'm tired of all the thick layers of irony and alternate reality in his new movies and I wish he would do something simple like that again.
It's his film that's most like a film, not a series of interesting scenes.
Id love if he worked from pulp novels again it suits him and its aged very well.
I so agree.
I'd put Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction as equal top.
