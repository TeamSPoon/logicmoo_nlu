One of my favorite Christmas movies is A Christmas Carol with George C. Scott.
Oh, is that a good one?  I've always meant to watch it.
It's the best version of the film in my opinion.
What makes it the best version?
It has so many good points, but the actors are so great in it.
It has a big British supporting cast, doesn't it?
Yes, my favorite supporting character is Scrooge's nephew, Fred, played by Roger Rees.
Oh, I know that actor.  I like him.
The costumes are very beautiful, too.
I love it when a film has pretty costumes.  It really adds to a film's atmosphere.
Yeah, and the locations look so real.
That's essential for a period movie.  I hate it when you can tell it's a set.
I hate that, too.  That really takes away from a film.
Was it shot on location somewhere?
It was shot in England, and the buildings are so great looking.
It sounds like the filmmakers did a lot to make this one stand out.
I sure think so.
Do you watch it every year around the holidays?
I do watch it every year.  It's not Christmas for me unless I do.
Well, you've convinced me.  I am going to watch this soon.
