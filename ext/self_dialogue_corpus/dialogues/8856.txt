Would you listen to Nirvana still?
You mean if they were around.
Yeah thats what I mean
I would not I was not in love with them
Smells like Teen Spirit was such a great anthem
It was but they didnt do anything specifically great.
I think they could write better than most artist.
You could say that but their songs sounded too under produced
Thats the sound they were going for.
I think they would want something a little more polished off than that
