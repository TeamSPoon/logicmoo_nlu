So did you see the new Beauty and the Best movie with Emma Watson?
I would have to say that's a hard question.
Hard question how come?
Well I do love Emma Watson, but a live action remake seems strange to me.
Well, it has gotten a lot of good reviews.
Still, I'm not sure I want to see it. I loved the animated version years ago.
Same here it was amazing!
I just worry about if they are going to be true the animated story.
I heard that they did but with slight differences.
Well maybe we should give it a try?
Yep you never know, we may love it.
Sounds good I will meet you at the theater at seven tomorrow.
Ok. Oh and maybe after we can catch the late movie?
What do you have in mind?
Let's go from  Disney to alien sci fi horror!
Hey that's right Alien Covenant is playing right after.
That move looks so cool.
Yes, and Danny McBride is starting I it.
He is such a great actor. Surprised to see him not doing comedy.
True,  it is strange but I know he will be wonderful in it.
