Have you ever noticed how dying can make a musician more popular?
Yeah! After Leonard Cohen died,  a  song of his was featured on the first and last Saturday Night Live shows of the season.
Must of got him new fans. Of course, it's a great song.
Sure. But lots of living musicians write great stuff.
Yeah. It's a wonder their managers don't do them in.
But then they couldn't keep grinding out those hits.
L. Cohen wrote great stuff all his life.
Yeah. It's strange. Poets, like he was, are supposed to peak in their twenties.
Of course, maybe we just like him because he reminds us of our lost youth.
Maybe. But then there's all those songs about aging, like Closing Time.
And divorce, like Tower of Song.
Tower of Song's about more than divorce.
Maybe for you it is. I'm still getting divorced.
Well, keep istening to Leonard.
I will. I listened to him alive, and I'll listen to  him now he's dead.
A true fan.
Yep. So are you. He was here for us, through all the phases of our lives.
And now we're old, and his stuff is still here.
Just like we're here for each other.
Yep. Wanna listen to some music?
