Did you know that Rihanna was in the movie Home?
Who is Rihanna again?
You've probably heard of her, she's a pretty popular singer from Barbados.
Oh okay, name a song.
I liked her song "Umbrella."
I know that one!
Yes she did a great job in Home as Tip.
I didn't know she was in there, my kids love that movie.
Yes my toddler likes to tell the knock knock joke over and over.
I really liked some of the songs on the movie.
I did too! Such a cute kids movie.
What was one you liked?
I'm not sure of the name but it sounded like "Dancing in the Dark."
I remember that one, that was a fun song.
Yes she was trying to teach him how to dance in the car.
They had such a cute friendship.
I will have to watch the movie again soon, I can't remember all of the songs.
Let me know when you do, I'll bring my kids over to watch it.
That would be great!
Yes we could make it a play date.
