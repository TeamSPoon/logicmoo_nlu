Are you going to the showing of The Grateful Dead Movie next time they put it out in theaters.
You bet, i missed it last time because of work.  Ive always wanted to see it on the big screen.
I know its awesome.  I love the sound of it if you go to a good theater with a good sound system.
Have they done the same thing with the other DVD's they've put out.
No i don't believe so but that would be awesome, i would love to see truckin up to buffalo on the silver screen.
Thats too bad.  Have you seen the new wolverine movie yet Logan?
Ya i did i thought it was pretty good, i definitely wasn't expecting the movie to go the way it did.
I know i didn't read anything about the movie and just went and saw it.  All the death in it really surprised me.
The R rating really surprised me too, i think it was the first comic book movie with an R rating.
You might be right i cant remember if suicide came out before that or not.  I cant even think of any other R rated comic book movies.
Me neither maybe one of the bat mans were but im pretty sure they are all pg-13.
Nah im pretty sure they are all pg-13.  But do you think they are gonna replace wolverine with his clone daughter?
Probably, they need a new cash cow since they are retiring wolverine.  People will probably go just as crazy for her as they did for him.
probably, besides i bet they'll try anything a couple of times.  Its hard to lose money on a comic book movie people will still see them even if they are terrible.
thats true i remember all of my friends going to see electkra.
O lord that was a terrible one, remember daredevil with ben affleck.
Unfortuanitely i do remember that one, i cant believe they made him batman after his terrible performance in daredevil.
Well he probably has a really good agent.
I would imagine so.  But anyways nerve came in the mail today you want to come over and watch it?
Sure, doesn't that have julia roberts niece in it?
