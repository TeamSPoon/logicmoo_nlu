Have you seen big hero 6?
Yes that movie was great.
My town did a movie in the park and they played that.
That sounds so nice, i wish my town did that.
It was nice, you bring blankets or whatever and they display it on a big screen
I bet the kids loved that
They did, and it was a really good movie
I havent seen it in a while i want to watch it again
Me too
I was thinking about buying it
