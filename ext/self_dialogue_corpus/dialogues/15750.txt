If you could get three artist to work together on a song who would you get?
I'd get Rihanna, Adele, and Eminem to do a song together.
That is an interesting mix what made you choose them?
Eminem brings an intesity to his projects that I don't think many other artists do.
What does Adele bring?
She brings realism and emotion to her music. You can't help but get sunk into her songs.
What about Rihanna?
I like the flavor of song she brings to her music. It's veri distinct and you know you are listening to her when you hear it.
Do you'd think they would make a good song together?
Oh absolutely! Ever hear of mashups?
Yeah, thast when someone mixes two songs together from different artist.
Yes, well I heard a mash up of all three of them and the sound was amazing.
What was it called?
It was called "When a tornadoe meets a volcano"
I will definintely give it a listen. What song from adel did they use?
"They used Set Fire To The Rain" from Adele and "Love the way you lie" from Rihanna
Interesting those songs don't sound liek they would sync up well.
They don't, the guy used Linkin Park's "In The End" instrumetal for it.
Wow that sounds incredible. Now I have to listen to it.
I absolutely recommend it. It's amazing.
