Have you seen the NBC musicals that they're reviving?
You mean all the live shows -- and some of them aren't live?
Yup.
I've seen a few of them.
Which?
The Sound of Music, The Wiz, The Sound of Music, Peter Pan, Hairspray.
Not all of those are NBC. Anyway, what do you think about the celebrities in them?
Who were they again? Remind me.
Ariana Grande was in Hairspray, and Carrie Underwood was in The Sound of Music.
Ahh, right. Ariana wasn't very good.
I agree, way too light in the voice.
She was completely overshadowed by trained singers and they just gave her lots of throwaway jokes you couldn't hear.
Her jokes were hilarious with her delivery, but yeah, she doesn't have the voice for live musicals.
Did you like Carrie?
She was a lot better, but again, an untrained voice against trained never really works.
She seemed a lot more comfortable, though.
Are you looking forward to their next musical?
What is it?
Jesus Christ Superstar, on Easter Sunday of next year.
Seriously? Crazy good music, but I hate the message and plot.
