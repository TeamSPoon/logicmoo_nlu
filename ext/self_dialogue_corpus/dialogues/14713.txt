Did you like Zoolander? I really thought it was funny.
Which one? The first was funny. The second one not so funny.
Yeah the first one cracks me up....I love that blue steel.
Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were so funny.
Yeah, I loved it when they were getting the info out of the computer.
Aww, man! I had that computer!
Oh and the hand model?
Wasn't that the dude from the X-files?
Yeah, man. That was so funny.
Bet there are real hand models that do that in California.
