You're a huge horror movie fan aren't you?
Yep, I watch every horror movie that comes out!
What would be your favorite horror movie
It's between The Ring, and Dead Alive
You can't pick just one?
It's hard. They are just so different!
OK, well tell me about both of them.
The ring is a straignt up horrow movie!
How scary is it really though?
I was watching the Excorcist when I was seven years old, so I've seen a lot of scary movies.......
The Excorcist, really? I still can't watch that movie!
Well, The Ring is the only horror movie that ever bothered me afterwards.
How did it bother you?
For the longest time, if I walked past a TV in the dark, I was terrified that it would turn on all by itself.
Why were you afraid of that?
That how the little girl in the movie kills you. She crawls out of the TV.
Really? The TV? Ok what about Dead Alive?
Dead Alive was made in New Zealand by Peter Jackson, it was his first movie.
Was it scary?
Oh no, it was more gory than anything I'v ever seen before, but it was also the funniest movie I've ever seen!
