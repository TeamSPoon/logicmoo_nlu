Oh man, I just saw "Inside Out" for the first time this weekend!
What did you think of it?
I was completely blown away. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I said the same thing when I saw it.
I wish that I had a movie like that to watch when I was growing up.
Haha. Yeah, I said that too.
I think Pixar really hit the nail on the head with it.
They really did, they worked with psychologists to make everything as accurate as possible.
I read that there are doctors using this movie to help troubled kids.
They are, there all whole programs developed around this movie.
I think it is a movie that every parent should watch with their kid.
I agree, its Pixar, so they still get the laughs in, but the overall message is a good one.
Yeah, like, sometimes growing up is sad, and it is ok to feel that way.
Exactly.
Can you imagine how different things would be if everyone accepted that?
I'm sure it would help a lot of kids out.
I also read that they way Riley's mind works scientifically accurate.
Wow, that's pretty neat.
I know.
I can't wait to see what Pixar comes out with next!
