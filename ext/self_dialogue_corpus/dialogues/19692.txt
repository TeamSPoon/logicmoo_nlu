Hey dude, have you heard of Prong?
Prong? No, not really.
You might like them, they're not really well known though.
What kind of music do they do?
It's like progressive metal I would say, but it's only three guys who do it.
Oh wow, that's impressive.
Yeah and they've got a real full and nice sound too for just the three of them.
Do you know any of the band members?
No I don't. I know one guy does the guitar and singing, but that's about it.
Ah, that's ok. What's some of their good stuff?
I like a lot of stuff off of Power of the Damager.
That's a fun name.
Yeah it's got pretty gruesome artwork, too. Some really good songs off of there.
Like what?
I like Looking for Them a lot, I wish I could play it myself.
What else is good?
I Beg to Differ is good, but I think that's a different album.
Sounds really aggressive with those titles.
It's very aggressive, it's very angry and it sounds like he sings through a mask.
Ooh, scary. I might like it though.
