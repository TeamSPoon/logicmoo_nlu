Hey Alfredo, have you seen any movies lately?
Oh hi, Valentino, yeah I saw Baywatch the other day.
Baywatch?  Was it any good?
Well, you know I like The Rock, so I might be biased, but yes I did!
Interesting were there any other familiar faces in it besides The Rock?
Well, David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson made cameos.
Oh, from the original series, that's cool.
Yeah, they were actually pretty funny cameos.
That's awesome, what was the plot...it did have a plot, right?
Ha ha, yes it had a plot.  It was about a hotel owner that smuggled drugs.
Oh, how did that involve lifeguards.
The hotel was on the beach, and the police didn't notice.
Oh, so it was a crime drama comedy?
Yeah, pretty much.  It had quite a bit of humor in it.
What was it rated?
It was R, mainly for language, but there was also some humorous male nudity in it.
Humourous male nudity?
Yeah.  I will have to explain it to you later.
Would you recommend Baywatch?
I would, just make sure there aren't any kids around.
