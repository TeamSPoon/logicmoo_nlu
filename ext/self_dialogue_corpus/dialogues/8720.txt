Were you a big fan of grunge rock?
Not really.  Aside from Pearl Jam and STP, I didn't really follow any of those bands.
But there were a lot of a good bands around that time.
Yeah, and I liked some songs from those bands, like Nirvana's In Bloom.
What about Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden?
I thought the lyrics were really stupid.  I sang it once at karoke and felt really stupid singing those lyrics.
Did you ever like Green Day?
I used to like them, until they tried to be political.  I'm just thinking "you're a pseudo-punk band, you're not smart enough."
So, now you don't like them at all?
I think their new stuff is so bad that it make me retroactively hate all their music.
