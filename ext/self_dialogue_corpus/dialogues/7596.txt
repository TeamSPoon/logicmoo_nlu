So what was your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I would have to say that's a hard question.
True, they were all so good.
If I had to choose I would say the Sorcerer Stone was my favorite.
Oh wow yes. That was so good.
The first movie was just so magical and wonderous.
Ever wonder what would happen if Harry was sorted into Slytherin?
I have thought about that many times.
I guess we will never know.
Yeah maybe we can write some fan fiction and make it happen!
