My mom has never seen The Departed! I can't believe it.
I've never seen it either.
What?! It's one of the best movies ever.
Really? I don't know much about it.
Yes! It's one of Martin Scorsese's best films.
So it's like a gangster film?
Yes it is, but not like the average gangster film?
Who is in it?
Everybody! Jack Nicholson, Math Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen..
That's a lot of great actors!
You bet! I think it's Leo's best work honestly.
I'm surprised I haven't seen it before.
You should definitely watch it. It's so good.
When did it come out?
2006 I believe.
Ok, so it's not so old.
No, not at all. And it's still holds up really well.
Is it long?
It's about 2 and a half hours, but it doesn't drag on at all.
Ok thanks for the recommendation, I think I will watch it later.
