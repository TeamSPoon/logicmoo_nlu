Hey I heard the new Beauty and the Beast is coming out on DVD soon. Did you want to see it?
So much, I'm really excited. I love the original so much!
So do I. It was the perfect film to grow up with.
I might still play the songs and sing along all the time in my car.
No I think we all do that. I definitely do it.
I saw a joke video about it the other day. It was Belle's song she sings in the morning.
I think it's just called "Belle."
Right so it goes, "There goes the baker with his tray, like always." And the baker says, "There goes Belle with her daily mean song."
Oh man, that's hilarious. I never thought about it like that.
Me neither. The new live-action film is a musical right?
It is. I've heard they did incredible.
I can't wait to hear it. I love Emma Watson so much.
So do I, ever since Harry Potter.
Oh she was totally the sweetest Hermione. What a dork.
But also isn't that the exactly kind of booky nerd that would turn into Belle as an adult?
You know, I think you're right. Who plays the Beast?
It's Dan Stevens.
Who is that?
You know Matthew on Downton Abbey. The one who marries the oldest daughter?
Oh right! He's great!
