What do you think of Simon and Garfunkle?
I mean. Bridge Over Troubled Water is fantastic
What about Blue Oyster Cult?
Hello darkness my old friend is the best
What about Queen?
Bohemian Rhapsody. Especially in Waynes World
I think Sia in 6 feet under is the best use of a song on TV
I liked Feists Lonely Lonely on The L Word
Yes, that was heartbreaking
There is so much good music on tv soundtracks now
Greys Anatomy is the best at using it
Nashville is really good too for that
I like Bob's Burgers
Those are some the best comedy songs being written
I love Lois' songs
Tina's one about butts was pretty hilarious
Cold Mountain is my favorite movie soundtrack
I like the one from O Brother where art thou
Mmhmm that was good
Constant sorrow is such a good song
