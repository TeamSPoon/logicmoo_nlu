What is your opinion on rap music?
Some of it is okay, some of it is really bad.
Oh?  What do you think is good?
I like Drake.  I think everyone likes Drake.
Yeah, he's really good.  Who else?
I like Lil Wayne, Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar... people like that.
These are very good rappers.
Then there's the really bad ones like the mumble rappers.
Mumble rappers?
Yeah, the rappers that barely open their mouth when they rap.
I've definitely never heard them being called that before.
I saw it on a youtube rant.  My eyes were opened to the mumble rap artists.
I'll have to go on youtube and find it.
It's a hysterical video!
I can imagine.  I actually do kind of like mumble rap artists.
Well, everyone's preferences are different.
I agree, I am more of a pop fan anyways.
Oh, really?
Yeah, but you can hear people like Nicki Minaj on pop stations and rap stations.
That's true, she has crossover appeal.
