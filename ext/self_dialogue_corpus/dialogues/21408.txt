Did you get around to seeing the Revenant?
I wanted to see it so badly! I haven't had the chance yet. Tell me more!
You know who directed it? Alejandro Iñárritu!
I didn't realize that! We talked all about him in my Mexican cinema class.
Really? What did you see of his?
Amores Perros, of course! I've seen that movie four times now.
It's an incredible film. I love how it keeps going back to one fateful encounter.
The car crash? More than an encounter, I'd say. More like an accident.
Obviously. Well, he did an amazing job of intersecting all those lives at that one point.
Did you know he was a DJ before he was a director? That's why the music is so awesome!
Now that I didn't know! It shows in the Revenant, too.
What's the music like in the movie?
There's a lot of classic music, but it's all incredibly epic. Not your classical music at a picnic with your grandparents.
Classical music doesn't need words to say what it wants to say.
Exactly. I've listened to this soundtrack alone, and just, wow. You relive every moment in the movie.
And what did you think of Leonardo DiCaprio in the Revenant?
Nobody else could have played that role like him. Survival, frontiers, the wilderness. He embodies what his character faced.
It looks like a very engrossing movie. Is it one you can't get out of your head?
Oh, for sure. I haven't stopped thinking about it since the day I saw it.
Might not be "Mexican Cinema" per say, but I think I'll understand even more about Iñarratu by watching the movie!
