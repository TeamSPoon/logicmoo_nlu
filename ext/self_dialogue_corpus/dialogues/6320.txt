Which is your favorite Disney movie?
Mulan. What about yours?
The Lion King. I watched it more than 10 times when I were young.
Yeah I like it too. What do you like the most about Disney movies?
Well, I grew up with Disney so I didn't analyze much movies when I was younger. But now I liked the stories, the songs during the movie and the funny moments.
Yeah I agree. And the villains, the way they're created. I like it
True. But I don't like the fact that they're kinda the same. You can recognize a movie from Disney just a couple of minutes after watching it.
I disagree. I think they're all unique on their way.
Still have some things in common. Like funny lines and the main characters.
Let's agree to disagree.
