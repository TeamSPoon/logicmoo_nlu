What would say is the greatest pop song of all time?
Wow, that's a good question.
I would say it's Billie Jean by Michael Jackson.
That's a pretty good choice.
What's yours?
I would say it's Bye Bye Bye by Nsync.
Excuse me, you think Nsync has the greatest pop song of all time?
Yeah, it sold a ton of cd's.
I guess that is true.
Plus, it is one of those songs that when someone says pop music and plays it, you're like that's pop music.
