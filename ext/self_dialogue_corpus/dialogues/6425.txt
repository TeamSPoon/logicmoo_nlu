Did you see Zootopia?
Yes, that was an excellent movie!
I agree.  It seems like they set up for a sequel.
Do you know when that is coming out?
I just looked and it may be coming out in 2021.
That is so far away!  Why would they make us wait so long?
It's unfortunate because there aren't a lot of other animated movies that seem really good coming out in the upcoming future.
Cars 3 is out, I'm excited to see that.
I'm not a big fan of the Cars series, so I don't much care about that.
Well, I will go see it without you then.
