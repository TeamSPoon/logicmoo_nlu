A talent for music is obviously inherited. Look at the Marsalis family. Look at Bach.
Or families can have family businesses, such as making music, or cars, or muffins. or teaching math, like me and my family.
So? They hand down a family business because what's what the members of that family are good at.
Or because the children of musicians get lessons from the age of three, and are brought up to regard themselves as natural stars.
Or they learn to play with their parents because they have a natural aptitude.
There were many Bachs, but only one J.S. Bach.
People still listen to many of the Bachs
Actually, most people don't even listen to Bach.
True. But among the people who listen to real music, many choose works from musical families such as the Bachs.
Because Bach is a brand name. It's Bach, it's certified high quality, even if you don't  actually like those icy cascades of abstraction.
That's a whole other question. Music teachers generally have musical children.
Everyone in my family considers themselves musical, and they all play. I am utterly not, and can't. Can't even sing in the shower, unlike you.
I'm talking about tendencies, not certainties. And  you have a musical speaking voice.
That's a whole other question too. A question of taste--stick to the subject.
Hmm. You can see that mathematical ability is sometimes inherited.
If you say so.
I do. Science does.
Really? So?
Everybody also says that music is an application of mathematics.
And that's inherited. So, that's why you want me to bear your child.
