Have you seen any of the final destination movies?
Yeah, they're my guilty pleasure.
Which one is your favorite?
I think my favorite would have to be the first one, it was just something so new.
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
After the first one, I think all the other's are pretty equal.  Except the 3D one.
You didn't like the 3D one?
Nah, I'm just not a fan of any 3D movies.
Why?
Well, first I have glasses, so it makes it tough to watch them.  Besides that, I just don't think it adds that much to the movie.
Ok, I can see why you don't like them.  But there are some really good ones.
Like what?
Avatar was incredible in 3D, and Tin Tin was pretty good too.
I never watched Avatar, let alone the 3D version.
What?? It's so good.
It just didn't seem worth the hype.
It really is, and if you get a chance to watch it in 3D, it's amazing.
I'll have to take your word on the 3D part, I wouldn't know where to watch it in 3D.
Well, I did just buy a new 3D TV. Why don't you come over this weekend.
Awesome, I'll be there Saturday night.
