Who is your favorite singer?
That's really hard to say.  I really love women who have a beautiful voice, no matter what they are singing.
I bet you love watching The Voice then.
Oh, very much.
Who was your favorite artist from the Voice, so far?
Well, having said that about vocalists - my favorite so far is Laith al-Saddig.
Why?
He sings real gritty blues, which I love. And it's unusual to find a new voice in the blues that is so unique but still definately the real thing.
I think I remember him. I think my favorite so far was Alisan Porter.
I liked her, but I think the real reason she won was everyone loved her comeback story.
Well yeah, because the story and getting to know the singers is really important in The Voice.
She does have a powerful voice with a lot of range though - that impressed me. I loved it when she did that Janis Joplin song.
Cry Baby.  I remember that.
You're too young, probably, to remember hearing Janis sing it.  I was surprised to hear anyone else bring that emotion out like Alisan did.
Well, I have heard the recordings of Janis Joplin singing it.  My Mom was a fan.
Alisan did a decent cover.
So what is she doing now - Alisan Porter?
She is working on an album and also, I think, performing at some smaller venues.
It's great to see her having so much success after having so many problems in her life.
She makes it a real goal to reach out and touch people with that story and give others hope, which is cool.
