Hey did you know that football season starts soon?
Yeah I cannot wait for the NFL Draft
I know i'm hoping my team picks up some good players
oh yeah who is your team?
The Cincinnati Bengals, and yours?
Same I'm a huge Bengals fan
Awesome I knew that there was a reason we got along so well
So what position do you think we need the most help in the draft for?
I would say Quarterback but i'll give Dalton another chance
I think we need another wide receiver
Defintely AJ Green needs some help
agreed he doesn't get a lot of throws because he has no help on the other side of the field
Yes being double teamed every game makes it tough for sure
I also think Marvin Lewis needs to be let go
for sure, he is mediocre at best
Mike Brown should probably get rid of him this year
He wont though because Marvin works cheap
yup half what other coaches get
guess we will have another mediocre team
sadly yes I agree
