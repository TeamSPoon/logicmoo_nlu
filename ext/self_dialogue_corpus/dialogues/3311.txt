Did you like The Exorcist?
I think it was a good film.
Not great?
I could name better horror films.
No way, Linda Blair killed her role.
She was great in it but I was not a huge fan of the flick.
I think you could say the film was pretty good.
For the time period yes.
I think the element of religion playing into it was risque at the time.
I think our nation was depraved enough by then to be able to incorporate it into a horror film.
