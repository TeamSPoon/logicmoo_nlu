This whole week has been my Pantera week!
Oh really?  That's some hard music
Yeah, hard music and awesome music, I love it!
What album have you been listening to?
Well, I started with Cowboys From Hell but for some reason, Far Beyond Driven has been my fave this week.
Cowboys is my all time Pantera favorite album, I mean, come on, it's got Cemetary Gates on it!
Oh, I love that song, soft and then boom!  Here comes Dimebag wailing away.
Some of his riffs are impossible to duplicate.
Yes, he certainly had the talent and dexterity to be impossible to copy.
So sad what happened to him, being murdered on stage.
I know, I'll never for get the day I heard the news.  The guy that opened fire was crazy, I'm glad he's dead!
They were playing in their new band, Damage Plan, right?
Yes, brothers Vinnie and Dime formed Damage Plan after they were having trouble with Phil Anselmo.
Why was Anselmo a problem?
Anselmo had side projects going, Super Joint Ritual, Down but his main problem was heroin and this led to the demise of Pantera.
What did you think of Damage Plan?
Honestly, I really didn't care for it.  To me it was kind of a band that was trying to hard and could never get the magic of Pantera back.
Even with Dimebag's guitar playing?
Yes, it was almost as if the band didn't click, great musicians that they were, it just didn't work for me,
Well, the whole Damage Plan story is tragic, but I'm glad we can still listen and appreciate the awesomeness of Pantera- the music will always live on!
