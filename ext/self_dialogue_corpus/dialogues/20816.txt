Are you going to see the new transformers movie?
I don't know, I'm not a big fan of them.
Really? You don't like transformers?
I do, I just don't really like the movies.
I thought the first one was really good.
Yea, ok. The first one wasn't bad.
The one with Shia Lebouff and Megan Foxx right?
Yea, that was was pretty decent. But they've really gone downhill since then.
Yea, I can see where you're coming from. The story isn't great.
The story is bad, and the characters are dull.
I can't believe they replaced Megan Foxx.
She probably quit, honestly.
I doubt it, they still make a lot of money, people love robots.
That's another thing. You can barely even tell what the robots are doing half the time.
Yea that can be confusing.
Pacific Rim is a way better movie if you like robots.
I never watched that, it's really that good?
Oh it's fantastic. The story isn't great but the robot's are amazing.
Ok then, maybe I'll watch Pacific Rim instead of Transformers.
Watch them both and tell me which you think is better.
