I saw Ted the other day, that was a pretty funny movie.
It is. The sequel isn't as good though.
Oh, well, Is A Million Ways to Die in the West any good? Seth MacFarlane also made that.
I've never seen it. I've heard mixed things about it.
It's weird how MacFarlane jumped from cartoons to making big budget comedies.
Humor is humor, I guess. It's sort of surprising Matt Groening has never made a film.
He had The Simpsons Movie, and there were those direct to DVD Futurama films.
I meant a real movie, unconnected to any of his previous work like Ted.
Maybe he just doesn't want to. Not everyone wants the stress of making a movie.
That's true. The South Park guys have made a couple films and from what they said it's a really stressful process.
It definitely is. Not many people can make the jump from TV to film.
J. J. Abrams did. He had Felicity, and Alias before he made it big.
But he was always a filmmaker at heart. He jumped from movies into TV before jumping back.
Actually, I guess he is similar to MacFarlane in a way. When it comes to film and TV, I mean.
How exactly do you figure? One has made several shows and a couple movies, the other made a couple shows and several movies.
They're both really good at getting film or TV projects off the ground, then leaving the hard work to other people!
So you're saying they're good producers?
Producing is the most important part of film-making. I'm sure they'd say that anyway.
To be fair, they're not bad directors either.
I guess that's why they're movies are so successful even when they're not good. They're just that talented.
