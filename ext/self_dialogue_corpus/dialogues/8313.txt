Who is your favorite pop singer right now?
I really think Taylor Swift has knocked it out of the park with her pop album.
That was a smart move for her to go more pop than country.
I also really like Demi Lovato.
Have you noticed a lot of child stars turn into pop singers?
I guess you're right.  There's Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez.  The list could go on.
Miley's younger sister, Noah, has a song out right now called Cry.  Have you heard it?
No, is it any good?
I think its great!  Although she sounds exactly like Miley.
Miley Cyrus got kind of crazy there for a while I think.
