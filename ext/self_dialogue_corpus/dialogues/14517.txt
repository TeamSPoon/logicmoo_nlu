Hey wanna play some Ball later?
For sure i am looking forward to getting some game on
I know we have not done so in quite some time
Yeah it used to be a weekly thing we would play some basketball.
I will win like the old times though you know.
We we will be seeing about that.
I got some thoughts though.
What thoughts you got?
I been thinking about  the wizards lately i love them as a team but..
What you mean bro?
Well they traded richards and are literally shooting themselves in the foot i do not get why.
I can agree he was their top scoring player  and they are just going down with this.
It is honestly just sad to see
I agree their is no telling how they will do with a unknown.
Yeah without someone you know it is not dependable
Who knows if the new kid can make 90 percent of the shots like richards could
He might have terrible aim and miss most of them
Exactly and then the fans will see their team in disgrace
Yeah its a shame to the fans and to the team
I hope that the new guy is good see you soon.
