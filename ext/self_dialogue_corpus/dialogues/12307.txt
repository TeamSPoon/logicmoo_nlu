Why was Poe Dameron so absent in The Force Awakens?
What do you mean?
He shows up early on, and then when Finn escapes, and then disappears until near the end of the movie!
He comes back in the battle at Maz Kanata's place, and then at Starkiller Base.
He shows up for a few minutes each time, though. He didn't get enough screentime.
J J Abrams spared the character, actually. He was originally supposed to be killed.
So he wasn't intended to be a main character?
Apparently not. I'm glad he is, though.
Why?
Because a third protagonist mirrors the Han, Luke, and Leia trifecta of the original series. It fits thematically.
