You up for a game of Beatles Trivia?
Aw this should be good because I'm the biggest Beatle Fan. Let's do this!
Okay what song is " Oooh I need your love baby."
That's all I get of a Beatles song? Okay, I got it. "Hold Me Love Me."
WRONG! You wanna try another Beatles song?
If that's not the song "Hold Me" then what is it?
That  Beatles song has to do with a block of time. Time hint hint!
I know the song says "I love you all the time."
You kind of rusty at this. The song is named 8 Days-"
"A Week!" Man! How could I forget that one. It was a big hit for the Beatles years ago. I should have known that one.
