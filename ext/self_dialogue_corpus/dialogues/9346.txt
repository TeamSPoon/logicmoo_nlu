Was The Chronic as big as people make it sound?
I think it was.
Dre produced it right?
I dont know if he produced it but obviously it was his album
I thought that it touched on alot of the rap that is most important nowadays.
He rapped about pot a whole lot.
Well that was the basis for most of his songs.
He did a follow up to it as well.
Yeah I think it was boring
He waited too long plus I dont think hes that great of a rapper anymore.
