I have this really old thriller movie on my mind lately and I can't remember what it's called.
Do you remember what it was about?
Yeah, I remember there was this young girl and there was something about phone calls...
It wasn't When a Stranger Calls, was it?
No, I remember that one about the babysitter, but -- Oh, it was that she was making prank phone calls!
Okay...
But something went wrong. Somehow she found out that one of the people she called had really done something bad.
Oh, that sounds like I Saw What You Did!
That's it! I kept thinking it was something like, "I Know Who You Are" but when I searched online nothing came up.
That's because that's part of the line she used in the prank calls. I remember watching this movie growing up, how she'd say "I saw what you did, and I know who you are".
