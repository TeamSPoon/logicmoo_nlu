I have a question about Star Wars that has been bugging me for a while.
What is it?
Why didn't Chewbacca get a medal at the end of the first movie?
Wow, that's an excellent question.
He should have gotten one for helping blow up the Death Star.
Especially because both Han and Luke got medals.
Chewie played just a big a role as the other two.
Does this imply that they consider Chewie as second class?
I think there are a few Wookiees on Kashyyyk that would take offense.
Also by that logic, I think the droids should have received medals too.
