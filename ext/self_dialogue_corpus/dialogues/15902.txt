Guess what I listened to this weekend?
I don't know what?
Amy Winehouse Back to Black album
That is such a great album.
I know, I had watched the documentary Amy and just couldn't stop listening to that album.
So sad that she was lost so early.
I know, she was such an amazing talent.  And that album is perfection.
I know, her voice, the music, it was so good.
She sounded like this fantastic jazz singer at the age of twenty or something.
I think that is the sign of true musically talent.
What?
When the music and singing is so good that it doesn't matter if it is jazz, pop, country.  Everyone appreciates how good it is.
I agree, good music of any genre is appreciated.
Especially when so much of it isn't good
She was one of a kind, Back to black was my favorite song from that album.
It was really, really good.
Her voice and emotion in that song is just amazing.
I agree.
She was so good.
I know.
