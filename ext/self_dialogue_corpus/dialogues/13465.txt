What is your favorite star wars scene?
The one where Yoda takes the X Wing out of the water
That scene is amazing
They played that at my church in middle school
That's sacreligious
I think they were talking about faith
Jedi training would be tough
Yoda had a great environment to train Luke
Luke was a better Jedi than him
He did beat the Emperor
