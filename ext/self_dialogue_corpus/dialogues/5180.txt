I heard there  will be another "Frozen" movie.
Yes. I am anxious to take the family.
You have to wait a long time.
Really? When will it be here?
It won't be in theaters until Noivember 2019
I am sure there will be songs we will all  be singing for months.
Disney  has a way of keeping us singing.
My children fall asleep singing, "Do you want to build a snowman?"
And I hear "Let It Go" all day.
LOL It's easier to build that snowman!
