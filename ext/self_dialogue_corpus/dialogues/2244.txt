Watching these reruns of Hard Knocks is making me excited for this season
Was it the one with the LA Rams?
Yeah that series. It's such an interesting look into the locker room
I don't make it a point to watch them, besides the season with the Jets
That season was legendary for the show.
Rex Ryan's temperament really made that series hilarious.
It does. It's a shame that series is from when the Jets were competing in AFC title matches.
That collapse happened so quickly. I feel your pain to a degree being a Bengals fan.
Their history is probably nearly as bad my Jets history. We still cling onto Namath from the late 60s.
Do you ever think that Namath was probably one of the most overrated Hall of Famers ever?
Honestly, yes. He wasn't a good player at all.
He had a few seasosn where he led the league in passing yards I think.
I believe he did, but if you look at his statistics they were brutal.
Didn't he finish with more interceptions than touchdowns
.That's an understatement my friend. He had a 173:220 Touchdown to interception ratio.
So he couldn't even manage a 1:1 ratio?
Nope. They always say it's because the football of the 20th century was a lot more physical, especially with defensive backs, but come on.
People like Mel Blount would abuse you at the line, but jeez that means you look elsewhere if hes mugging your receiver.
Exactly. Namath's stats just mean he slung the thing regardless. You don't nearly 50 interceptions more just because of an era of football.
He seems like an overrated version of Favre, except Favre threw more TDs than INTs.
