What did you think of the shower scene?
It was scary! Janet Leigh always said she wasn't able to take a shower after filming that scene.
Anthony Perkins played his part really good.
You're right. He seemed such a gentle person to turn out to be the killer.
It was kind of gruesome that he had his mother
He certainly wanted to keep his Mother around.
The hotel was really creepy.
Yes, it would make you think twice about staying in an older hotel out away from everything.
