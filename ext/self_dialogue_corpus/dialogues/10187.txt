Did you get a chance to see John Wick, Chapter 2?
Yea, but I didn't really like it.
Oh, that's too bad. Why not?
Well, it just wasn't as cool as the first one.
I thought it was better than the first. It had way more assasins in it.
Yea that's true, and that fight scene with Keanu Reeves and Common was pretty good.
Yea! That was awesome.
I guess it wasn't so bad afterall.
Yea, and the next one looks like it will be even better.
That's true, the next could be pretty good.
