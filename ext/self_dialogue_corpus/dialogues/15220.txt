The lineup for this Music Midtown concert is awesome!
Nice! Who is playing.
A lot of people but Bastille to be specific.
Oh yeah, they are good. Are you going?
I'm unsure so far. I really want to.
What's stopping you?
The tickets are a little expensive.
You will figure it out. I just checked out the complete list! And there are so many good artists.
Yeah? Who do you like on there?
Young the Giant, Manchester Orchestra, Big Sean, and Future
Oh wow. I didn't realize that Future was going to be there.
I know! That's huge. I really want to go now.
Same here. I can buy tickets, I just wasn't sure if they were worth the price.
They definitely are. I'll go with you if you're going
Sounds good to me. Have you heard the new Weezer music?
No, not yet. They will be at the concert, maybe I will hear it there.
You have to listen to it before! That's the best part
True, I just don't have enough time to listen to so much new music.
I'll send you a list of songs that you need to listen to.
Sounds good! Thank you.
