You think Disney see girls, women or princesses as second rate citzens?
No, Disney is actually quite diverse with leading cartoon women.
How so and what Disney princesses do you mean?
There was Pocahantas who was a princess and Native American as well.
That's true but can you think of any other Disney princesses that shows their diversity?
Milan, she was the Asian princess right?
I didn't see that Disney movie. Who else you got?
Disney's first Black princess was named Tiana and played by Anika Rose.
I guess Disney movies have come a long way from their early stereotypical Jungle Book days.
Have you see the Disney movie that shows their first gay kiss?
