hey there. can you tell me show timings of new alien movie?
I am not sure. first you have to tell me which specific theater you are planning to go.
Not any specific theater decided. I guess I am okay with any theater.
why don't you try searching it on google? it will show you all the theaters in which alien is currently running along with show timings.
I am not very technology friendly. by the way do you know that the first alien movie came out in 1980?
yes I know that. In fact I am a fan of alien movies.
Oh! that is so nice to hear. Have you seen all the parts of alien movie?
I am pretty sure that I have seen all the parts of alien series but I am not sure about alien vs predator movies.
there has been only two alien vs predator movies.
Oh, then I am certain that I have seen both of them.
So which one do you like more? aliens? or predators?
I like predators more. I love their use of technological weapons. Especially their cloaking ability.
yes, predators are definitely more technologically advanced compared to aliens.
But I also like aliens, especially their way of reproducing.
I think that is one of the iconic horror scenes of alien movies.
Yes, It can be really scary to watch alien babies coming out of bodies of human hosts.
anyways, I don't have much time today, So I should better figure out show timings before I run out of free time.
you know what? I will look it on google right now and tell you.
Oh, that is so nice of you. thank you so much!
No problem buddy. It's my pleasure.
