Is Noah Syndergaard the best pitcher in baseball?
I would say so though his command was off his last game.
Well he was hurt but hes got that big time potential.
I like Madison Bumgarner.
That guy can hit!
Hes got power and hes a power pitcher.
Yeah I like that in him.
Also Clayton kershaw
His playoff problems though are alarming.
Baseball is a team sport.
They often dont hit for him but thats just luck.
Go ask Cole Hamels about that.
Yeah the Phillies did not support him much early on.
That stinks but it wears on you.
Yeah he was happy to go to Texas.
Do you know that? I havent heard anything.
Philly has not been good lately.
I get that. I think the Nats win that division.
Not me, Harper sucks.
What? You are probably the only one to ever say that.
