Hey! Did you see the last playoff game between the Penguins and the Capitols?
Oh, yeah! The Penguins really beat the Caps bad!
I know what you mean! I was really surprised the game played out the way it did.
Me too! The Caps just never seemed ever to get going. It was Pittsburgh's game to lose the whole night.
I think you right. Maybe the Caps just didn't have it in them for another comeback.
Yeah, that totally could be it. It seemed like they used up a lot of their momentum just to progress the series and get to last night.
I think your right again. Pittsburgh just seemed better rested and prepared, even though the Caps played hard in the previous game.
I think so. Wow, the Caps must be pretty disappointed, right?
For sure! Especially when it looked like they right come from behind in the series. They seem to really struggle in the Post Season.
I know what you mean. They seem to be able to reach the playoff no problem, but being a deep threat just hasn't been happening for them over the past couple seasons.
You're right about that. It is kind of depressing that they seem so close, and yet so far away.
For sure! Do you think they will opt for new leadership after another disappointing post-season?
Maybe. I'm not sure if coaching is really their problem though.
Yeah, I know what you mean. They seem to have all the right pieces, they just can't get them all on the same page.
I think that might be exactly it. At least the Penguins might be exciting moving forward. You think they can make the finals again?
I can't say for sure, but they sure look like they are hot right now.
You're right about that! Ottawa's tough though, and it looks like that's who the Penguins will get next round.
That's true. It could be a really awesome series!
Totally! I can't wait!
Me too! Let's go Pens!!!
