Who is your favorite fast and furious character?
My favorite character is Dom. Specifically in the fate of the furious.
Is that the movie, where Dom turns against his entire family?
He doesn't turn against his family, he finds out he has a new member of his family who is being threatened and has to protect him.
Does he protect his new member of the family?
He does by pretending to be a bad guy and his wife is the only person who believes is still good.
Dom is always doing the right thing even if you can't see it at the time.
Yes he does, he always puts him family first, now matter what.
Was their any other parts that you liked in the movie?
They had to drive on ice, and have to take down a submarine.
