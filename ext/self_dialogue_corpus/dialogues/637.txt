Yea, well Seattle has won the big game and been to it twice in the past couple years.
Yea and for that, I would not count them out either.
Yea, having all pro safety's like Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman doesn't hurt either.
Yea, would you want to go over the middle to find either of those guys.
I know that I wouldn't and I do not think Odell does either.
Yea, I think that fear factor is one of the main reasons that they will remain in contention.
Yea, I agree. That defense will just have to stay healthy.
Yea, they aren't getting any younger, but man are they fierce.
They are. It would also be nice if Jimmy Graham brought back some of his magic from New Orleans.
Yea, he seems to be focusing too much on blocking.
I agree! His receiving is what separates him as a player. He should use it.
Yea, I mean the blocking is good for Russell Wilson, but he can do so much more to help out.
Yea, Russell Wilson could use all the help he could get.
Yea, when you're a quarterback until six feet, you could really use some playmakers.
Yea, especially since I do not even know who is carrying the ball for them this year.
Yea, me either. Better hope they have a strong offensive line.
Yea, they are going to need that to stay relavant.
I agree, but I wouldn't doubt them.
Me either. They have as good of a chance as anyone still.
I agree. They definitely do!
