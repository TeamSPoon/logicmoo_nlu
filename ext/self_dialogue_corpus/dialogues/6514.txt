I bought Zootopia on DVD yesterday.
Have you watched it yet?
Yeah, we watched it with the kids last night, they loved it.
Who is in it?
Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Shakira, and Idris Elba
oh, I love Idris Elba from Luther.
You haven't seen Zootopia yet?
No, I didn't get chance when it was in theaters, too busy as always.
Come over later if you like, we can watch it again and hang out for a while.
Great, I would love to see it. Be over about 8 if that's okay with you.
