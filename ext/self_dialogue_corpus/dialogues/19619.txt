Who was your favorite Backstreet Boy?
I think the better question is, "Who IS my favorite Backstreet Boy?"  The answer is AJ.
He was the cool one.
Yea, I wanted to be him when I was little.
My favorite was probably Brian.  I think he had the best voice.
Either him or Howie probably had the best.
Did you have a favorite song?
Well the obvious answer is, "I Want It That Way."
Classic.  Didn't the music video for that one take place at an airport hangar?
I remember that music video like it was yesterday.  My older sister bought the CD the day it came out.
CDs wow.  That really dates things.
Do they even make CDs anymore?
I couldn't tell you.
Didn't they go on tour recently?
They still tour all over.
That's really cool.  They also performed at Miss USA last year.
It's great that they're still together.
I loved their cameo in that movie 'This is the End.'
That was so funny and unexpected.  Which song was that at the end?
'Backstreet's Back.'
