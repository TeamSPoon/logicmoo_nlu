Have you seen Moana?
Yes! It was so good!
I know! The Rock did such a good job in it.
Yeah! You're welcome is a great song.
I sing How Far I'll Go everyday!
People are so sick of me singing it at this point!
I wonder if they'll ever make a sequel.
That'd be so cool. Disney does make a lot of sequels.
Well I would go see it right away!
So would I!
