Are you into any like British action films?
I am not even sure what those would be.
Well, Kingsman for one.
With the guy from Pride and Prejudice?
Colin Firth, yes,
I guess that is a British action film. I like it, so yes.
There is that, and the sequel that is about to come out.
I seen that. What other action films are British, or at least set in the UK?
Snatch was one.
With the travelers? I think they portray them wrongly.
