Did you see Suicide Squad yet?
Not yet.  I heard it was disappointing.
The critics were wrong.  Audiences loved it and so did I.
I heard it was a bit violent and over the top.
Well, it wasn't your prototypical superhero movie.
Of course not.  The main guys are bad guys.
I will say that I think Will Smith was miscast as Deadshot.
Anything that he does these days is bound to fail I'm afraid.
But man, Harley Quinn?  Wow, she's a stunner even if she's crazy.
I could support that.
