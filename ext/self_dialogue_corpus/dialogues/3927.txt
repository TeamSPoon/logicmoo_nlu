Have you ever seen Grindhouse?
Yeah, it was really good.  I liked how Teritino made the movie quality the way he did.
Yeah, it was a good device.
It started out kind of slow, but Quenton Territono always does a good job of getting a good movie out of no where.
Yeah, like right after the part where the film messed up.
Yeah, then somehow everyone knew who this guy was and he was a total stud.
Yeah, and the machine gun leg on his girlfriend was pretty cool too
Ironic that they needed to get to Mexico the whole time.
The ending was oddly happy too.
Yeah, with her having the little daughter.
