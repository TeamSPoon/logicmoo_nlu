I hear they are making a new Cinderella movie next year.
Really, is Disney doing that? That would be great.
I agree, she is one of my favorite characters.
Mine too, as well as Snow White.
Oh, yeah. I saw that movie at least ten times when I was a kid.
Me too, I could say every phrase before it was spoken.
Indeed, and the songs were always so nice.
Yes, they were. Wauw, a new Cinderella movie would really be fantastic.
Absolutely, I hope we get some more information soon.
Disney always makes great movies.
