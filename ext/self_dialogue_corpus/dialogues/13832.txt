What is lady gaga's real name?
Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta that is full and middle names.
That is a mouthful. I like her a lot.
ya me too. She is such a talented girl.
No kidding. she is one of the few truly talented singers in my book.
Ya she is one performer who does not disappoint live.
She is so good live and the fact that she also plays piano I find mind blowing.
Apparently she had studied at Tisch School of the Arts.
I believe she dropped out to pursue her music full time.
Interesting I wonder how long she had been there studying, pretty prestigious school,
