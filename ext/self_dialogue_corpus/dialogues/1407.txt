Who was that blackk guy. Played for the Canadian teams before NFL
Warren Moon.
Yeah, he was old too when he retired.
Go Huskies.
What?
I went to UW. We're Huskies. Warren Moon was our QB when he was undrafted and had to go play in Canada.
How come he wasn't drafted?
NFL didn't think he was good enough.
or that still thre were racism back then, this was when?
This was... 1978, I think. And there has been a black QB in the NFL since 1968.
Huh. Who was that?
Marlin Briscoe for the Broncos in 1968. he wasn't very good, and turned receiverer after sometime.
Who was the first starting QB who was black?
That'd be James Harris for the Bills, he started the season opener. Funny thing is Briscoe was traded to the BIlls as a receiver.
Wait, that's how Briscoe became a receiver
Yes, Bills thought Marlin would be better as a receiver, and the first black starting QB passed a few to the first black QB who became a receiver
That's a funny story
True.
This was right after the civil rights movement.
Yep, right at the end of it more or less.
