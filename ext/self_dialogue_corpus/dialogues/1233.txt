Where is the Super Bowl going to be this season?
Up in Minneapolis.
Oh, at the new stadium?
Yeah, it's called the U.S. Bank Stadium.
I couldn't remember the name.
The only reason i remembered was cause i was reading an article on it.
Any predictions on who is gonna go all the way this season?
Well, obviously New England is a contender.
Miami went to the playoffs last season.
Yeah, but they choked.
Like the Cowboys did.
Well, between the whole Romo disaster and all, i did not expect them to get far in the playoffs.
That's true.
No one made it hard for the Patriots to win last season.
Hopefully they make it hard for them THIS season.
That would be nice.
I'd like to see Tampa or Miami try to go all the way this year.
Really? i was thinking more like the Redskins turn it around.
Washington? Highly dobtful.
Why do you say that?
