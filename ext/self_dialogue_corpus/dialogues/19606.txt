Hey! What have you been listening to lately? I need recommendations.
Well, really just only Sufjan Stevens. It's kind of sad.
Who is that?
You don't know Sufjan? He's maybe my favorite artist right now.
Please tell me he's not another sad folk artist.
Well... I can't say that.
This is so bad! You need to listen to more happy music.
But Sufjan is a literal genius. His last album was incredible. I've listened to it maybe 50 times by now.
That seems unhealthy. What's it about?
Well, it's an album about the death of his mother.
Wow, are you okay?
I'm fine I swear! Sometimes you just need to cry to sad, beautiful songs, okay.
I can't relate to that, but all right.
You should give some of his earlier stuff a look. He's done a huge range of things.
Did he write an album about the death of his father, too?
Nope, but he did write a concept album about the state of Illinois.
Oh, boy.
It's seriously very good. I'm going to force you to listen to it.
I should have learned by now not to come to you when I need music...
Let me live! You'll love him eventually.
