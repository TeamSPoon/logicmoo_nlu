Do you think Han Solo is the best Star Wars character?
I think so. He has a really interesting arc in the first one.
I agree, the way he goes from a non caring space pirate to a friend is awesome.
Did you like him in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, although he did not have as big of an arc.
Yeah, the first one developed his character a lot more.
Did you like him in Return of the Jedi?
Yes, but I think they should have killed him off.
I heard that is what he wanted in the third film.
Yes, but I think someone decided it was better to keep his character alive.
