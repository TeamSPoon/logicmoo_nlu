Did you see the yankee game last night?
No, I couldnt stay up that late
I cant believe it went to 18 innings
I know that is crazy, has that happend before?
No I think thats the first time
Crazy. The yankees have the giant player on their team
Yea hes like 6' 7" and has already hit around 12 home runs
Wow he is huge. could be the next barry bonds
I hope that the cubs dont win again this year
How come?
They have so many bandwagon fans
I'm kind of a cubs fan....
When did you first become one?
Almost eight years ago
Oh then youre not a bandwagon fan
How come?
Because the bandwagon fans started becoming fans after they won the world series last year
Haha very true
We should go to a game soon, they have good beer at the ballpark
Yea that sounds like a great time
