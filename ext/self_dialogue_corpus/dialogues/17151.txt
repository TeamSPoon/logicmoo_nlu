What's your favorite way to listen to music?
Headphones, sitting on the beach, staring into the sky.
That's a romantic sight.
What's yours?
Mine is pumping my fist in the air with friends at a concert.
Wow that is very different from mine.
The great thing about music is we can experience music in so many different ways. I mean I would love to listen on the beach.
And the concert is cool too. I just couldn't all the time.
Yeah me neither, it's just my favorite every now and then.
I also enjoy headphones while doing homework, or blasting it in the car.
Oh yeah the car! Music in the car is awesome.
Helps me get through how boring traffic is.
I know. LA traffic right?
Totally. Some people listen to podcasts in the car.
I couldn't do that. I would fall asleep. Music gets me energized.
What other ways do you like the listen to music?
Let's see. I can't really think of anything.
Me neither. But music is great anywhere, and choosing how to listen to it is the fun of it.
You can say that again brother.
That again.
