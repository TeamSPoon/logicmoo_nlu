Did you see the game last night?
I did.
I can't believe it went into overtime.
Yeah, that was really something.
There seemed to be a lot more fighting than usual.
Well, the two teams are rivals.
The penalty box was overflowing.
Yeah, it was great.
You like the fights?
It's the main reason I watch hockey.
That's kind of barbaric, don't you think?
The players fight because it's expected. If they made stricter rules against it, it would stop.
Agreed. You don't see it as often in baseball and football.
I'm surprised there is so much fighting in hockey considering a lot of teams are Canadian.
Yeah, they're usually so passive and nice.
But the fans are rowdy. They're crazy when it comes to hockey.
It's funny when they throw things onto the ice.
I'd be worried about being kicked out.
Me too. By the way, what was the final score of the game last night? I can't remember.
5-4
