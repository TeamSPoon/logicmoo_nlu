I absolutely loved Celine Dion's dress at the Met Gala.
Yes. I really think choosing a black and white dress suited her.
Definitely! I didn't really like Kiko Mizuhara's outfit, though.
Agreed. I just didn't like the shirt.
Exactly! I didn't like how it was see-through.
Yeah, and I didn't like the way she wore the blazer off her shoulders, too.
I feel like she could've gone with a much better outfit.
