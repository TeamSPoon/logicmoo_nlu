I just ordered a full box hits of Prince on amazon
Do you like Prince
I sure do, I think he is one of the most talented people
He has done everything froom singing, writing and acting
He put some amazing songs together
He wrote for chaka kahn a lot
there was a song with her, and brandy and queen latifa called sister, but I think baby face did that one
Do you happen to have it so I can hear it?
I bet I can find it on you tube
I will look it up
its an amazing song
do you like classical music?
I do not, I just cant get into it
If you open your mind and listen you can see the song
really?
yes, look at disney movies like bambi, when each rain drop has a note
you know I never thought of that
any recommendations for prince his
listen to black sweat, you probably never heard that one
I certainly dont remember the name
