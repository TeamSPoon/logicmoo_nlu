Hey the NFL season will be coming up soon.
Yes, I know and I'm pretty excited.
I am too. The Dallas Cowboys were great last season.
Yes they were. I 'm sure it's going to be an awesome season.
I bet it is. I wonder who the backup quarterback will be?
I was wonder the same since Tony Romo isn't with them any longer.
Yes, and that's all good. He just wasn't a good quarterback anymore.
No he wasn't. It was time for him to retire from playing.
Yes it was. He had too many injuries the past few years.
Yes way too many injuries.
Dak Prescott turned out to be the best quarterback ever.
He really did. He's an awesome player.
He is awesome. He did a lot for the Cowboys last season.
Yes he did and I think this season is going to be great.
I think so too. Romo was good in the very first years of his career but later on he wasn't anymore.
No he wasn't. He was costing the team games.
He really was. He was throwing way too many interceptions.
I couldn't believe how many he had gotten to where he was throwing.
I know, everytime he threw the football I wanted to hide my eyes.
LOL so did I. That's pretty bad isn't it?
