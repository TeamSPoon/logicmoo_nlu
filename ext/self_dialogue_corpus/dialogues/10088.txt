Tell me what kind of action movies you like?
Oh, I think Predator is one of my favorites.
Haha, yes! With Arnold fighting the predator at the end.
Yup and the classic phrases like "get to da choppa!"
But yeah, the Predator is a classic villain.
With his night vision and voice mimicking powers.
Don't forget about the optic camouflage.
Wasn't Jesse Ventura in that movie?
Yes! He plays one of the big soldiers guys.
What a great action movie.
