I just saw that show Hateful Eight, made me want to watch some more westerns.
Well, I happen to know of a lot of good ones.
I like ones with a lot of action.
Many of John Wayne's movies are full of action.
What one should I start with.
I would go with the classic, Stagecoach.
I have heard of it.
There is also True Grit.
They did a remake of that one right?
Yes, it was good not as good as the old one.
Did John Wayne do anything beside westerns?
He did a lot of war movies and a few romance movies.
What romance movie did he do?
He did one called the Quiet One.
I heard of it, that one is like supposed to be one of the best films ever made right?
I think it is. It is set in Ireland.
Who plays in it?
Maureen Ohara, a golden age movie star.
I think I would like to see that one if it is so good.
I think you will not regret your choice to watch it, it is a really amazing film.
