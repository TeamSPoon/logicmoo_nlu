Hey what do you think of Tyrod Taylor and how the Buffalo Bills will do this year?
Hmmm, with new coach Sean McDermott, they should be able to establish some momentum.
I think the receiving corps is weakened with several key departures.
Yeah, Sammy Watkins is the only threat for Buffalo.
How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick getting a backup quarterback role?
Not sure if any teams want him due to the possible negative publicity, but he can still play.
Will RGIII be able to sign with a team this year?
He has the tools as a backup quarterback, just needs to prove himself again.
What do you think of the L.A. Chargers new logo?
It's really a rip-off - they should have come up with something better than that.
How will the Redskins do with Kirk Cousin's contract not done?
Washington is a joke and they are headed for another .500 season.
Do you think the Patriots will be in the Superbowl again?
Yes, they have all the tools yet again. A healthy Gronkowski will only take them further.
Will Tom Brady have a decline this year?
He is a system quarterback, and he knows the system so well in New England. No way he declines.
Who do you think is the best free agent pickup this year?
DeSean Jackson provides the speed and the attitude for Tampa Bay. He will be stellar in that system.
Is Christian McCaffrey going to be a bust?
That is a hard one to answer... his skills don't necessarily translate, so we will have to see.
