Which did you think was better, Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid?
Wow, that's a hard call. I liked them both.
The Little Mermaid has those amazing underwater shots, and the music is terrific.
That's true! But if we're talking animation, the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast is a classic.
True enough. Ariel may be my favorite Disney princess, though.
Why's that? I like Belle's love of reading, and her desire to help her father.
I like Ariel's curiosity, and her willingness to sacrifice everything to see a new world.
And to be with the man she loves - don't forget about that!
How could I? They're both great romances.
They really revived the Disney movie genre.
