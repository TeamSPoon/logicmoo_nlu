What is your favorite form in classical music?
Do you mean 1750-1825 or art music in general.
Stop being a snob. Art in general.
Then, definitely the fugue.
What's a fugue?
That's when you take a short idea, like one or two measures long, and subject it to a ton of crazy counterpoint.
Like what?
You transpose the theme all over the place, you can invert it, augment it, diminute it, have many at the same time.
That doesn't sound hard.
Trust me, it's insanely tough.
How so?
There are so many elements that go into it. It's kind of the height of compositional prowess.
Would I recognize any?
Probably not. Wait, it's been in a movie.
Which?
Home alone - there's a short fugue when Kevin is preparing the house.
Really?
Yeah, go back and listen to it. The theme comes back three times, I think, before going somewhere else.
I'll be sure to listen to it.
It's pretty awesome, one of my favorites.
