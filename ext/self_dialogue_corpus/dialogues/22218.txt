Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2?
Not yet, I knew it came out the other week, so I have just been working too much as usual!
Chris Pratt and Vin Diesel as well should be pretty good in it.  They usually are fun to watch!
Yes, I look forward to it as well.  Who else plays in it, do you know?
Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and Bradley Cooper are in it too.
Thanks, wow what a a star studded movie!
Yes indeed, it will be a fun ride.  Did you get to go see the Star Wars movie that came out earlier this year?
Yes!  That was great.  I like fantasy, ad Sci Fiction, so I usually hit all of those as soon as they come out.
Who was the new girl in that movie?
Felicity Jones played in the new Star Wars movie.
I loved her in this one, she was a fresh face in it.
Mads Mikkelson plays in it as well.  He always plays the villain.
I have watched Mads work on tv as well, when he played Hannibal Lector in the tv series Hannibal.
DId you enjoy it?
It was very dark and intense.  I never missed an episode ;)
Haha!  It sounds like it would be interesting.  Mads is a great actor.
Hannibal was a sad ending as it should be, Hannibal meets his end finally.
Don't tell me any more!  I want to watch it .
Ok well you can probably see the episodes on one of the Networks on demand.
Thanks!  Will do!
