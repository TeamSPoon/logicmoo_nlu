Have you ever seen the movie Ice Princess from Disney?
Is that a cartoon or real life?
It's a real life movie.
Yes, about the ice skater right?
Yes. I thought that  movie was well done, I liked it.
It was pretty good.
The girl who played the lead role was pretty. You never heard much about her.
Wasn't Joan Cusack in that too?
Yes. She's a pretty good actress too.
I don't remember the movie much. I'll have to rewatch it.
