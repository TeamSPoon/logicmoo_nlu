How many movies are in the Fast series anyway?
They started in 2001, and had 7 sequels since, not counting the shorts.
They made short films too?
Yep. They were just filler type of shorts. Not that good.
These movies made over 5 billion buvks
Yep., It's the 6th highest grossing film franchise of ALL time.
That's right behind the Tolkien's series.
Yep. people do love nice cars and stealing stuff
Good ol' family fun
Nothing says friedns like stealing stuff together in nice cars, all modded up.
