So, are you a fan of King Crimson?
Yes, I love them, though I think their discography is pretty weird and inconsistent.
Really? How so?
Well, they had a lot of different lineups in the early years and basically reformed completely in the early 1980s.
And they're still around today, too, right?
Yeah, though I really haven't listened to anything past the early 1980s albums, which I like, but are a little sterile for me.
So tell me about some of their best records.
Well, there's "In the Court of the Crimson King," which is the debut, full of weird, fantasy-based songwriting, very medieval.
And that has "20th Century Schizoid Man" on it, right?
Yeah, probably the best known King Crimson song, a real epic that shows you where they could go later on.
So, what was next for them? Is there a record where they really evolved further?
Well, that initial lineup fell apart, and I don't really understand why, but I imagine they all had very different ideas about where the music would go from there.
I think I heard a record of theirs called "Islands" from that era, and didn't care much for it.
Yeah, there's weird experimental orchestral stuff Robert Fripp, their lead guitarist, tried to do that did not gel at all for me.
So how did they get back on track?
Well, they made "Lark's Tongues in Aspic," which is a great, intelligent hard rock album with complex musicianship.
They used a lot of strange time signatures on that one, right?
Yeah, and John Wetton and Bill Bruford are an amazing rhythm section, one of my favorites.
Did that lineup last long?
Yes, for a while, and they recorded "Red," which is an amazing album, very much ahead of its time! Ot
