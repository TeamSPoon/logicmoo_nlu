I'm thinking of making a mixtape to listen to as I exercise.
Good plan - Music makes exercise less boring and tedious.
Got any recommendations for songs to listen to?
Sure. One song that always gets me fired up when working out is 'No Handlebars' by Flobots.
Oh, you played me that song once. Yeah, I could see that being good.
Another one that gets me going is 'Sleepyhead', by Passion Pit.
I'm not familar with the song, or the artist.
It's kind of Electronica music, I think. The song has this massive chorus that's really good.
OK, sounds good. I want to put a really good song at the end, sort of a reward for finishing the workout.
Maybe Etta James, 'At Last'?
Haha, that might work. But I was thinking of something a little more modern.
I was just kidding. Do you like Pharell?
Yeah, he's alright.
He used to be in a band called N.E.R.D. There's a song they did, 'She Wants to Move'.
Not one I'm familiar with. It's a candidate for the mix tape?
I'd definitely suggest it. It's a favorite of mine.
But do you think it would fit an exercise mix tape?
Definitely. I would suggest it for the last song, even.
Why is that?
It's got a joyous energy to it, and it will give you that last little spark of energy to finish the workout.
