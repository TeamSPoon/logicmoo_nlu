do you have a favorite thriller movie
i have no idea
have you seen the shining?
yeah, that is considered a thriller?
yeah, it isnt a straight up horror
it has a better storyline than horror to be honest
i agree with you. i hate horror movies
the shining was very creepy though.
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
jack nicholson did great as an actor
then he kinda played the crazy role again in one flew over.
yeah, i guess he likes being the crazy dude.
the shining was probably the biggest movie adaptation of stephen king
it is the most popular. it has a cult following
it got panned in the reviews though
even stephen did not like it at first
everyone liked it eventually though
stephen changed his mind too
i guess they just didnt like it at the time
or they got influenced by the fans of the movie
