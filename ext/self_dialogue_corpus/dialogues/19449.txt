What do you think of the singer Pink?
I think she is great.
I really like her, too.
She seems like a real singer.
What do you mean a real singer?
That she doesn't use a bunch of computers to help her sing.
Most of the people use auto-tune now.
That's what I hate about new music.  It's all made in a computer.
I think it's a good thing and a bad thing.
What do you think is good about it?
I think it makes it easier to produce music.
I guess that is true.
Well, getting back to Pink.  What is your favorite song of hers?
I like that song Just Give Me a Reason.
That is a really great song.
I like the piano tone of the song.
That is a really good duet.
I like a few other of her songs, but that's my favorite.
I also think she is a great performer.
She does put on a great show.
