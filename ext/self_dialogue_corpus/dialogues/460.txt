I was reading an article a couple days ago about the 2017 Football Hall Of Fame inductees.
When is the Football Hall Of Fame?
The ceremony is August sixth.
I'll have to watch for it on tv on the sports channel.
Kurt Warner is one of the players being inducted.
Wow, he surely deserves that.
I know, Kurt Warner is well deserving of the Hall Of Fame.
Who else are they inducting?
Jerry Jones. Both Kurt and Jerry's wives will be presenters.
That's a nice touch, since families make a lot of sacrifices for them.
Morten Anderson's son is a presenter.
What a great moment for a son to get to honor his dad.
There's only been one other wife who was a presenter, so it's pretty awesome for the wives too.
Who are the other inductees?
Terrell Davis, Kenny Easley, Jason Taylor, and LaDainian Tomlinson.
Are their families presenters too?
No, they have an agent, two former coaches, and a former player.
Who's the former player?
Lorenzo Neal from the San Diego Chargers is a presenter for Tomlinson.
I guess team mates are family to some players since they spend so much time together.
