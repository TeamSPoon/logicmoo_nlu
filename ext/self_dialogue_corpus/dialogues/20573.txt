You know there are coming out with the third Despicable Me movie.
Have you seen the first and second one.
Yes, I think they are so funny. I pretend I am watching them for the kids but I enjoy them as much as the kids do.
Yeah, there are some really funny lines in them.
I think the minions are so cute. I get a real kick out of them laughing.
Gru is funny too.
Steve Carell does a great job playing him. In the previews it looks like Gru has a twin brother.
When is the release date?
I think it said, June 30th this year.
Are you taking the kids to the theater or going to wait until it is on the television.
I will have to take the kids to the theater, they are so excited about seeing it.
Maybe we can all go together.
Sounds good to me. I guess Gru loses his job and he turns back into a villain.
I did see a preview with the minions in prison striped clothes.
I love those little girls. They are drawn so cutely.
I know they are adorable. Have they made dolls of the girls?
I am not sure but I think they would be good sellers.
I would buy them for my girls. They like the minions.
I would like to have some minions to do my housework for me.
When I was a kid my parents treated us like minions but I can't get my kids to make their own beds.
