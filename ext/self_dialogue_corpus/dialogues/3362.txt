Have you ever seen the movie, It Follows?
Yes I did, it was really freaky!
My favorite part is when they actually shoot 'it' and realize that it can't be killed.
My favorite part is the last scene where 'it' starts throwing the electronic devices in the pool to try and kill the girl its following.
Yeah that parts really freaky, how it shows up as her dead father.
Yeah it really illustrated how much 'it' wants to hurt people both mentally and physically.
It makes me wonder how it all started following people and killing them.
It is almost like it came from a demonic ritual or some type of weird spiritual thing.
Yeah, it really does. I wish they made another movie that explained it more.
That would be interesting, I'd definitely watch it.
