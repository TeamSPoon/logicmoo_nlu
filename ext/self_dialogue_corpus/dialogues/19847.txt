You ever listen to Nicki Minaj?
I actually don't listen to that whole genre of music.
So you've never heard her songs?
No, I've heard several of her songs, I just don't listen to her often.
Do you like her?
I don't like or dislike her.  I'm just not a fan.
Oh, do you think she's good?
I think she's talented, I just don't listen to her music, unless it comes up on the radio.
I see.  Do you remember her Anaconda song?
Who doesn't remember that song?  It practically put her on the map.
Do you know any of her other songs?
I probably couldn't name them.  I remember Super Bass.
Yeah, that was another big one for her.
I'm sure there were others.  I just can't put my finger on them.
Yeah, she had a few radio hits.
She really is a good rapper.  She has a recognizable voice.
Yeah, it's easy to know when one of her songs is on.
Definately.
Do you remember the song she did with Ariana Grande?
Oh, yeah!  I loved the Bang Bang song!
