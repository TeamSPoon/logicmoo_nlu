Who's your favorite musician?
Well that's a loaded question if I've ever heard one. haha
Yeah, you're right.
Do you have one?
Now that you mention it, that is a super hard question!
See what I mean?
I'd say definitely one of my top favorite musicians would be Neil Young.
Ooh, good choice.
Yeah? Waht's your favorite album.
I'd say Harvest.
Harvest is probably mine too.
What about favorite song?
Favorite song altogether or favorite Neil Young song?
Let's make it easier, favorite Neil Young song.
Definitely Southern Man. You?
Old man.
Another good one.
Have you seen him live?
Yeah, I actually saw CSNY play a long time back.
That's gotta be one of the best groups ever.
