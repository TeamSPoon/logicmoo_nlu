Whats the most recent thriller movie you've seen?
Hmm, it's been a while, but I watched the Ring a couple weeks ago.
The Ring? As in the original from years ago?
Exactly, it was recently added on Netflix.
That movie is definetely scary, if I remember it correctly.
Yep, it has the scene of the girl coming out of the TV.
It's crazy! And she looked so demented.
Sometimes I dream about that scene, no joke.
Well, I can't watch The Ring at night for that very reason.
I don't blame you.
