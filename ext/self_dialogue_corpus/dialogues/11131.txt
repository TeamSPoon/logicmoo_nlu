Oo girl I like your skirt!
Uh I'm a dude. And it's a kilt
Really? You sure it isn't a skirt?
Yeah...you see the cargo pockets and epic on it?
It looks like a skirt to me
Nope definitely a kilt.
Well what's that fluffy purse on the front.
IT'S PART OF THE KILT
Still looks fabulous to me
It's a kilt!
Ok then what is that thing on your shoulder? A purse with pipes?
That's a bagpipe
What's that?
An instrument.
It looks like a super cute celtic purse.
It's an instrument.
So let me guess your socks are super manly too huh?
Yup got that right
So why are you wearing heels then?
Because they match my kilt!
