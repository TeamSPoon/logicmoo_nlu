If you could do one thing from Fast & Furious, what would it be?
Anything at all from any movie?
Yes, anything, and it was completely legal.
hmm... I guess I'd have to go with Driving the car between buildings.
You'd really want to drive a car out of a building and into another building?
No, in and out of three buildings.
That is just insane.
That is the point. I think it would be awesome.
It probably would be, but it'd be the last awesome thing you do.
Not if I jumped out at the last minute like Dom did.
