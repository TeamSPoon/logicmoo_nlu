What kind of music do you listen to?
I like anything really.
I am the same way. I recently found someone I really like.
Who is it?
It is a singer by the name os Basia Bulat.
I have never heard of her.
Oh? She is great! She is an indie artist from Canada. but she is polish.
How did you find her?
I like to look around on youtube for different types of music and found her on a NPR Tiny Desk concert.
I have never listened to those either. What are they?
They are a toned down version of an artists work because they sing it in the NPR office.
Do famous people go?
Yeah! There was a video on there with Adele.
I love Adele. My favorite by her is 'Set Fire to the Rain'.
She is great and that is a great song.
What is your favorite album by her?
I would have to say I really like her first one.
I do too. The second one '22' was really good too.
I have only heard her new songs on the radio so for, I have not listened to her album.
You should, it is great!
