What musicals have you seen?
In person, on TV, or movies?
All three, of course!
You're far too chipper for your own good. In person I've seen Jesus Christ Superstar once, The Book of Mormon twice, Pippin once, and Miss Saigon twice.
I've heard great things about the Book of Mormon
The actual book is awful and hogwash. You know I hate real Mormons.
I meant the musical...
Oh, right, sorry. It's written by the guys from South Park and the music is a collaboration between them and the composer of Avenue Q.
You haven't seen Avenue Q?
No, but I've listened to it.
What about TV and Movies?
I don't consider movies-with-music to be musicals. So no Disney.
Gotcha.
I've seen Cats, Rent, and all the NBC musicals they've done live.
I love cats!
Me too, but I hate the musical.
Why???
Because it's the most insanely stupid thing I've ever encountered.
That's a bit much.
No, there's no plot. The music is fine, but nothing happens.
