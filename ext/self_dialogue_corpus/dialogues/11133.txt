I see you're back to wearing your floral dresses this spring, Jackie.
Yes, they say long floral dresses are in this spring.
I can understand that. It is warmer now and the warmer months are all about staying cool and looking chic.
Preferably at the same time.
I guess long floral dresses are the perfect item to have in your wardrobe.
Whether you are heading to the office, an outdoor wedding or brunch with your girlfriends, the floral dress is the perfect item to have in your wardrobe.
I see.
The best part about owning a maxi dress is that it’s the ultimate throw-on-and-go item in your closet.
You're right about that.
Another thing that is in this spring is sheer.
Sheer?
Yes. Layering isn't just about keeping warm anymore—it's about adding another dimension to your outfit.
And sheer does that?
A sheer top is a more subtle  way to show some skin this spring.
Well, not for me it isn't but to each his own.
You have to get with the times, Jasmine.
I'm sorry but walking around in sheer clothing is like walking around nearly naked to me.
You are such a traditionalist. You like being covered up.
I have respect for my body and myself. I am not a follower of all fashion trends.
I know. I know.
