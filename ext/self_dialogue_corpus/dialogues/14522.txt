You watching the NBA draft tonight?
Yeah, gonna watch it at the bar, you wanna come?
Nah my wifes excited to watch it with me
Youre so lucky your wife loves sports, living the dream.
The Clippers don't have a first rounder this year, but I heard theyre trying to trade into the draft.
Enough with the Clippers...I think the Bulls pick 18th overall, so should be something good.
I always thought theyd trade out of their pick to try to help themselves at point guard...they need experience not youth at this point.
Maybe, we'll just have to see what happens.
One of my favorite parts of draft night is how often the crowd boos the commissioner...its kind of ridiculous.
I know I love it...right of passage through hatred haha.
Who do you think the Wolves and the Mavericks will take?
I dunno...who finished their freshman year at Kentucky this year? haha
Hahaha..or Duke...becoming the same thing with them...
Its crazy how good players are so early now....I think players at 16 are more NBA ready than 20 years old nowadays.
I know, when we were kids it was serious but nowhere near the level it is today..was all heart now its all wingspan
I played with a lot of heart...I didnt even make the highschool JV team.
Haha yeah but you are 5'7"
Don't rub it in
Anyways I gotta get going, good luck to your Bulls.
Haha have fun with your wife...and I guess good luck to the Clippers *groans*.... I guess...
