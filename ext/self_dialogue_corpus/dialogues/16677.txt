Have you heard B2s new album?
They've released their new album? thats cool.
Yeah it launched yesterday.
But I thought they had split, when did they get back?
Yeah they lost their drummer and lead guitarist, some personal issues between them.
Yeah i remember, their drummer said he felt undercut by the rest of the band
Thats true, anyway they didn't reunite, they just got replacements and continued recording without their lead guitarist and drummer
I'm surprised they did, I kind of liked their signature sound, isn't that now gone with the lead?
I was concerned about that too but their new album is actually not that bad
Interesting can i give it a listen?
Sure.
It's really good
Isn't it? I especially liked track 7
Is that the one with the extended guitar solo?
Yeah thats the one
For sure I liked it. I think its the best song of the bunch
Can't wait to see their live perfomance
Yeah, when are they doing that.
They have a tour scheduled to start in two months time
Great I sure will have enough time to prepare for it
