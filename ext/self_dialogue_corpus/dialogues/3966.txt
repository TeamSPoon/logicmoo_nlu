So tell me what kind of movies you like.
Nothing can beat a good thriller.
I agree, do you know of any good ones?
Do you enjoy Bruce Willis movies?
Yes, I think he is very talented.
I recently watched a movie called Striking Distance that was really good.
I do not think I have seen that one. Who is in it with him?
Sarah Jessica Parker is also in it.
Does it keep you on the edge of your seat?
Yes! It certainly does that!
