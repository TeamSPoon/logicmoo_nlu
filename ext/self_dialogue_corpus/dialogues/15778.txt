What genre do you think deserves more love than it gets?
British post-punk for sure.
I know what punk is, what is post-punk?
Post-punk took the attitude and ethos of punk and ditched the simplistic aesthetic.
That kind of makes sense. So like the Sex Pistols wrote a loud, power chord-y punk album, and then John Lydon formed Public Image Ltd which keeps some of the attitude, but is way different.
Yeah, Public Image Ltd is super moody. A band can only make so many true punk albums before they're just writing the same song.
I don't know if I agree with that, I mean look at The Descendents.
Well, we're gonna disagree about that.
Okay, so who are some post-punk bands?
You've for sure heard of some, Public Image Ltd, New Order and Joy Division, but you might also know, The Slits, This Heat, The Chameleons, and Gang of Four.
So what's distinctive about British post-punk?
American post-punk has a lot in common with college rock, think Mission of Burma. They're more jangly and tend to be less moody.
Which of these bands do you think was having the most fun?
Out of the British post-punk bands? For sure The Slits, they're a girls group and they're having a great time.
Oh yeah, it has the snotty punk attitude, disaffected vocals, and it's joyous.
They totally sound like they're having a ton of fun. I love it.
They do a great cover of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine."
It might be sacrilegious to say this, but that's my favorite track.
Slightly sacrilegious, but it's a great track. Their fingerprints are all over modern post-punk too, listen to the keys on typical girls, that's totally LCD Soundsystem.
Right? I can so hear that, more people need to listen to The Slits.
