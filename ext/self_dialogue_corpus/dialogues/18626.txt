Do you like The band One Republic?
Yes, I like the song they sing called Counting Songs a lot.
That is a cool song. I also listen to U2 really often.
Me too, my favorite song by them is called Beautiful Day, I am sure you know it.
Yeah, I listen to them and that is a rock'in song for sure.
Those songs remind me of the band The Calling.
Yep, the vibe is the same throughout each song and band actually.
I can play the song, Where You Will Go, on the drums.
Oh that is sweet! I am learning to the the bass now.
I love music and have been playing the drums since I was a kid.
You are lucky to have learned at an early age.
I agree because I have tried to learn the guitar and it is more difficult as I get older,
Do you have any other favorite songs?
I have a million songs but I am listening to the song Superman by Five for Fighting and love it.
Oh nice song!
I really like music that is chill and easy to listen to.
Me too. It makes my day go by faster.
I agree, music can make work fly by.
A good song like that can make everyone at work happier and more helpful.
I totally agree!
