You a fan of the Cincinnati Bengals?
Not really. I've been in Cincinnati for over 4 years, but haven't followed them much
Are there die hard fans in Cincinnati?
Some fans are, but they tend to be more fair weathered than anything else.
Are the Bengals any good?
They've had their moments recently. Made play-offs five years in a row.
Wow, that's really good.
Yeah, but they've lost in the first round each year.
Who's their coach.
Marvin Lewis. Longest tenured coach after Belicheck.
Wow, the team ownership must like him.
Yeah, they're pretty cheap too.
Did they ever make it to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, back in the 80s. Lost to the 49ers both times.
Wow, that must've been hard for the fans.
Yeah, just can't win the big one.
I like their uniforms.
Can't say I'm a fan. Too busy for my taste.
I really like the orange and black.
Looks like a Halloween costume to me.
