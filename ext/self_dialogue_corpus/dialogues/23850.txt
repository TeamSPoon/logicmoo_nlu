Do you like movies?
Yes,I love  movies very very much!
What is your favorite movie from when you were a child?
I had so many that I loved I can't hardly even think of just one.
Well one comes to mind for me that is for sure, I watched "The Goonies" over and over and over again.
Man, I love that movie what was your favorite part?
I guess the one that comes to mind for me is when Chunk shook his belly.
That was classic!
It sure was!
Do you know I really liked best was when they were at the bottom of the well and they sent the coat up to the jock at the top of the well and told them that they were goonies
Another part I really liked was the scene with the piano.
That part was gripping I was scared just watching it that I would fall off the cliff.
They did such a good job with that movie and all the scenes with the Pirates and the pirate boat.
Did you think of the slide scene at the end?
I would've loved to of been able to go down those slides.
Well, I would have loved to have been able to have all those Jewels they foundin the top of the pirate boat.
You and I both would be rich!
Wouldn't that be amazing?
I wonder if they ever thought of making a sequel to that movie?
Sequels are never as good as the first movie, maybe that's why they didn't do it.
