Have you been to a game lately?
Yeah, last week.why?
Have you noticed all the ads that the stadium has?
Yes,I have never seen so many.
Did you see the one with the cat?
No,I missed that one.where was that one?
It was in the reserve level by the hot dog stand.
Oh, missed it. Yeah there are way too many ads.
I counted 32 that I could see from my seat.
Wow,I realize they had a lot, but bit that many.
I wonder how much they get.
Well they are paying for Kershaw,etiher,Jensen.
That is a lot of player with high pay.
We are one of the teams paying top dollar.
Why can't they just have a flat rate for all the players.
That would make it fare, but money talks.
Who's getting paid the most?
I don't want to find out.
I know what you mean.
I guess that's why there are so many ads and parking is expensive.
