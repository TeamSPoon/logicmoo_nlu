What's your favorite trend from the 90s?
It would probably be wide-legged jeans.
Did you wear them often?
Yeah, I wore them all the time.
What was your favorite brand?
JNCO.
Where did you buy them?
Usually at either Hot Topic or Gadzooks.
Wow, I remember those places. Do people even go to the mall anymore?
I doubt it.
Do you still have any of your 90s clothes?
I have a couple shirts, I think. My mom got rid of most of my things when I moved out.
Oh, that's too bad. I don't really have anything anymore, either, except a Tommy Hilfiger coat.
Oh yeah? That might be worth some money. It's vintage.
I'll have to check to see on eBay.
Let me know what you find out.
So what's the worst 90s fashion trend you can think of?
Guys in skirts.
Really? I thought they were kind of hot.
That's because you're gay.
