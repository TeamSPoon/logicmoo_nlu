How many NFL teams have not won a Super Bowl?
There are thirteen actually.
I didn't realize it was that many!
Yes. The Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars have never even been to a Super Bowl.
How do they still have fans?
I don't know. But what is worse is that the Bills and Vikings have been there four times and never won.
Ouch. Yes, I definitely think that is worse.
Ok, so that is six of them. What about the others?
The others are the Titans, Chargers, Eagles, Bengals, Panthers, Falcons, and Cardinals.
I'm surprised the Cardinals haven't ever won.
They've had a few good years, but never sealed the deal.
The Falcons were close last year.
Tell me about it. That may be the most heartbreaking loss!
I don't know. I wouldn't want to be one of the two who went to four and never won.
It's even worse for Buffalo.
Why is that?
They went four years in a row and lost them all.
Ouch! Was the the early '90s.
Yes. '91-'94. They lost to Dallas twice, Washington, and the Giants.
NFC East can be a bear!
