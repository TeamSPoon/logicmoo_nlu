rock music has really gone down hill
you think?
yeah! every time i turn on the rock station it's just bad song after bad songs
i guess you're right. sometimes i find myself thinking...is this even rock anymore?
i guess anything can be rock. they think the fray is rock
i think pop rock should just...stop existing as a genre
yeah, more people should be like portuglar, the man. tame impala. you know?
real musicians, real artists
rihanna did a really cool tame impala cover, though. you won't hear me complaining about that
oh yeah, that was pretty lit
