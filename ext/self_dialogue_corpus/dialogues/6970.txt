Did you like the new jungle book?
I did, but think I enjoyed disney's animated version better.
Really that surprises me. I thought the new one was far beyond the original.
Well I loved the animated so much when I was younger hard to accept the new one.
I can see that. I loved christopher walkin in the new one.
He was a good choice for sure. I did think they did a great job casting.
Yes they did scarlet johanson's voice was such a smart choice as well.
I did like that they turned it female. Made sense with the seduction aspect.
Agreed. I think they did a wonderful job with the CGI as well.
I do think Disney has really mastered that CGI well. Especially with the jungle book remake.
