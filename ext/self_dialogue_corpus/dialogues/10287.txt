Have you seen the action movie, Escape Plan?
No, who was in it?
It had Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
It sounds like an old movie.
No, it's not that old, and I watched it last night.
How did you like the movie?
I thought that it was pretty good for a Stallone movie.
I'll have to check that out. Can I get that streaming?
Yeah, it's streaming right now on Netflix.
Great. I just renewed my subscription.
