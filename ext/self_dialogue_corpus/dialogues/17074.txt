I am not familiar with the revealing new/modern ones,  but I like Blake Shelton.
Which of his songs do you like?
Well,  it is not really the songs I like as much as his personality.
Right.  But I do like  "Austin"..
I like that one too.
also, I like the one with a really good beat.
Is that the one about  chewing tobacco?
Yes!  Ha, ha.  But it's true.
It does really have a good beat.  I really like that song.
You know, a great song is the one he wrote with then-wife, Miranda.
I love that song!
Do you know why he wrote it?

That was sad for him.
