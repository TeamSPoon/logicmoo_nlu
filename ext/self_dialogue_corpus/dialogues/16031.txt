Did you hear that Penn State is hosting its first concert in the football stadium?
Yes, I did hear about that. It is in July right?
Yes, it is going to be a country concert.
That's what I thought. Who is going to be there?
Blake Shelton is the headliner. And I think the others are Chris Young, Big and Rich, Adley Stump, David Ray, and Ben Gallagher.
I know Blake and I've heard of some of the others, but I don't think that's a concert I'd go to.
I know and I even like country music.
Now if it would have been Blake Shelton with Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, Darius Rucker, and artists like that, I may be interested.
Well with that lineup you should expect to pay dearly!
That's true. Even though I like the country music that's out now, I really like the older style better.
Like the really 'twangy' kind?
Well, not necessarily. More of the like the southern country rock.
Oh, so like Outlaw Country.
Yes! I knew there was a name for it.
I like that too. It has such a classic sound, but for its time, it really bucked the country trend.
I know. And unfortunately we now have artists that think country and rap go together.
I know. Don't you hate that?
I do. But some newer artists are keeping the old traditions alive.
Not enough though.
I couldn't agree more.
