Hey, I'm going to the movies this Saturday, did you want to go?
Sure!  What are you thinking about seeing?
I'm not sure yet, any suggestions?
Well, what kind of movie were you thinking about?
I wanted to see a action movie, but I don't know if there's any good ones out right now.
How about the new Fast and the Furious?
Yes! I completely forgot about that one.
I've already watched it, but I'll definitely see it again.
Awesome, do you think it's as good as the other ones?
Yeah, this one is probably my favorite so far.
Cool, I've heard some spoilers about it, so hopefully they aren't true.
Well, I'm not going to ruin the movie for you, but I'll tell you the spoilers I heard before I went weren't true.
Which ones?
I'm not telling you, it'll ruin it for you.
Alright, too bad Paul Walker passed away, he was great in the movies.
Agreed, but I think the rest of the cast is great too.
Yeah, Vin Diesel is probably one of my favorite actors.
Mine too, what time did you want to go?
Probably around 8 on Saturday, does that work?
That's perfect, I'll see you then.
