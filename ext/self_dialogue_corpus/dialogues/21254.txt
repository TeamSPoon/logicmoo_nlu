Have you seen the movie fences?
Yes I love that movie.
Denzel Washington was superb in the movie.
I also liked Viola Davis character.
She played the victim role.Staying with a man who had an affair had a child.
I know it seemed that way , but you have to remember the time period.
Yes I guess you are right.
What do you think you would have done in her situation.
I would not have stayed with him thats for sure.
What you have to remember is that she was a homemaker, he made the money.
I know, unless a women had some skills I guess it would have been difficult to leave.
Thank God she was willing to raise the child.
I also like the sons role, I know he wanted to go to college.
Yes but the father thought it was a waste of time.
I know but I would have thought he would want his son to at least get an education.
I guess he felt getting a job was more important.
I just loved Viola Davis role in the movie, she is such a strong actress.
That was a perfect role for her.
In the future I hope to see Denzel Washington and Viola Davis paired up again.
Yes they are a excellent actors.
