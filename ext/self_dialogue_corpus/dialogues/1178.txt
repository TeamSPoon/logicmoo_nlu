Do you think the cardinals will be any good this year?
They can be pretty good.
I think they'll be in the mix for a playoff spot.
How's there schedule?
They have some tough games.
What are the tough ones?
They have the Cowboys and Giants.
Two very tough games.
They also play the Seahawks twice,the Texans and the Eagles.
All tough games for sure.
Some easier ones are the rams twice,the titans,the jaguars and the colts.
You just never know week to week.
Yes that's true.
I wouldn't count the colts as easy though.
No,I agree with that.
They can definitely improve.
Andrew luck needs a big bounce back year.
He's certainly capable of that.
He threw a lot of interceptions last year.
Yes,that was surprising.
