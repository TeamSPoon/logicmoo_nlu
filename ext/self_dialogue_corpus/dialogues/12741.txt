Have you heard about the problems with the new Han Solo movie?
What kind of problems?
Both directors are gone.
What happened?
I heard they had creative differences with other people.
Do they know who the new director will be?
It looks like Ron Howard.
Ron Howard has directed a lot of movies.
I'll be curious how it turns out.
Me, too.
