Ok, here's my pick for the Superbowl this year.  Dallas vs New England.
All right.  I think it will be Carolina vs Denver.
Oh, so you don't think the Patriots will make it this year.
I hope not.  I'm getting pretty tired of the New England Cheaters winning year after year.
Yeah, that's what happens when you win all the time.  I remember when my cowboys used to get that kind of hate.
Some of us still hate on them pretty good.
That's for sure.  All teams that dominate a decade get that.  The Steelers in the '70's and 9ers in the '80's.
And part of the '90's too.
Yeah, and the boys in the '90's.  But as America's team they have had haters for a long time.
Like the Raiders.  You either love em' or hate em'
Well, who wins the AFC East then?
Oh, I think that New England will win that.  I think they will lose to Denver in the AFC Championship.
Ok, What about the AFC north?
I think Pittsburgh and Big Ben got another year in them and will take the division.
And the South.
I don't think any team from there is going anywhere but Tennessee will probably win that division.
Probably.  Who is going to give Denver trouble in the West?
Probably KC.
Not the Raiders?
I'm not even sure they will be called the Raiders, much less them being much of a challenge for a while.
