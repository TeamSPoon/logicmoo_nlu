Who is best player in the NFL?
That is hard, there are a lot of good players.
How would you narrow it down?
I would say, who is the best quarterback in the NFL?
Ok. Who is the best quarterback in the NFL?
Tom Brady.
Why do you think that?
Because he has won five Super Bowls as quarterback of the New England Patriots and he is a fierce competitor.
Five Super Bowl wins?
Yeah.  And not only that, he was voted MVP in four of them.
Wow. That is incredible.
Yeah, especially when you consider he won his first Super Bowl in 2002 and the last one in 2017.
What? That is fifteen years apart!
That's right.  Tom Brady will be forty years old this year.
And he's still playing football in the NFL? That's truly remarkable.
It really is. And with few signs of slowing down. I mean many think the last quarter of football he played this year was his best ever.
Really? What happened?
Unbelievable fourth quarter comeback to beat Atlanta in the Super Bowl.
Sounds like he might not only be the best player now but also the greatest of all time.
Not everyone wants to admit it, but yeah, I would have to say that its probably true.
