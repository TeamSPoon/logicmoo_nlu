What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the movie where the villain has a red face.
Are you talking about Darth Maul?
I think that is his name.
He first appears in The Phantom Menace.
Yup, that is the one I like.
It is pretty good, not my favorite though.
What one is your favorite?
I like Return of the Jedi.
I have not seen that one yet.
