What's the greatest movie of all time?
Easy, Gone with the Wind
Hmm, I'd beg to differ. I'm more of a fan of The Dark Knight
The Batman movie, really?!
Yes, great movie and great acting
I guess Heath Ledger as the Joker was pretty good.
He was amazing. Amazing role for him.
I thought Aaron Eckhardt as two-face did pretty well too.
Yes, that was a good role for him.
Kind of a disturbing movie in some ways.
Yeah, the good guy didn't always win in that one.
Batman lost his girlfriend.
Yeah, I also liked the set designs in that movie.
I believe it was filmed in Chicago.
Ah Chicago, great architectural design.
Yes, very much so.
Did the Joker die in that one?
No, but Batman finally gets him in the end.
Unfortunately Heath Ledger died in real life.
Yes, RIP HL
