I saw Let the Right One In.
Isn't that a foreign flick?
Yes, Swedish.
Who directed?
Tomas Alfredson.
What's it about?
A 12 year old boy strikes up a friendship with a vampire.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
She kills the kids in school who are bullying him, and they run off.
Sounds like something Hollywood would not do.
