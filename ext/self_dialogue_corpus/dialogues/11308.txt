There was an article the other day about the top five songs on the Billboard chart for 35 years ago this week.
Who was number one?
One of the Beatles, Paul McCartney, singing a duet with Stevie Wonder called "Ebony and Ivory."
That song was really popular.
It was the longest song Stevie Wonder ever had at the top of the charts.
Did he write the song?
No, Paul McCartney wrote it. It was also McCartney's longest song at the top of the charts since he had played with the Bealtes.
I'm glad McCartney stayed in music after the Beatle's broke up.
I know, it's nice to see people go on and keep doing what they love, instead of letting circumstances end things for them.
It doesn't matter if it's not as successful as before, just that you are doing what you enjoy and you're good at.
