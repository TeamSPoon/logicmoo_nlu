What's your favorite Beatles song?
I've always loved Yellow Submarine.
That's interesting. What do you like about that song?
I like the atmosphere and vibe of it.
Oh, because of the sound effects and all that?
Right, it's put together very well. The song tells a story with the music, lyrics, and the sounds effects.
My favorite song is A Day in the Life.
Yeah, that's a great one.
I like how experimental it is. I also like seeing the clear contrast between John and Paul contained in one song.
Yeah, the differences between each part are quite overt, but somehow it all fits together and works.
