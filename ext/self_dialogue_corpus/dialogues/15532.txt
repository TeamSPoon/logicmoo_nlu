I remember there was this one artist back when I was younger who had great music.
Can you explain who they were? Maybe I know them.
It was a woman, she had pink short hair.
You mean the artist Pink?
Yes that was her name! How could I forget?
Which of her songs did you really like?
I liked a bunch of them but one that comes to mind is "Don't Let me Get Me."
I remember that one! Came out when I was a freshman in high school.
Yes I loved to watch the music video.
Did you know her actual name is Alecia?
I didn't know that actually. Interesting.
I do know she has two kids at least now.
Yep she's a mommy now. I always loved her hair.
Me too. So original.
I wonder how old she is.
She's 37 years old. I know that because she was born on my brother's birthday.
Oh wow! How weird.
Yep, my brother is also 37. We're 7 years apart.
Oh okay I see.
Now I think I will go look at some of Pink's old music videos on YouTube.
