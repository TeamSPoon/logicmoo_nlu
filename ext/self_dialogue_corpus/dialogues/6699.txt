Would you go see another fox and the hound movie?
I loved it, i think so!
The character of Copper was so cute.
Yeah I loved how they bonded at the end.
They never did a sequel right?
I cant remember.
Yeah maybe I should look it up.
Those kinds of heart warming movies are the best ones Disney does.
I agree with you, they can touch your heart.
The fox though was a little nerve wracking at first!
