Guess what I just found out?
What?
Nicole Scherzinger was the only one that was singing for The Pussycat Dolls.
Are you serious?
Yeah, I couldn't believe when I heard that.
I feel like I've been lied to.
I know. I can't believe none of the other girls were singing.
I guess none of the other girls really ever had any solos.
You're right. I can't even remember any of their names.
I wonder what Nicole is up to now.
I know she won Dancing With The Stars one season.
Wow, really?
Yep, and I think she sang in Broadway.
That's pretty impressive.
Idina Menzel, the woman who sang Let It Go in Frozen, also stars in Broadway shows.
She does have a very strong voice.
Totally. She brings Let It Go to life with her voice.
I definitely agree.
I was shocked to find out that Kristen Bell was a singer, too.
Me too, and she actually sings pretty well.
