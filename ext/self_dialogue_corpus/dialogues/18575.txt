Are you old enough to remember Led Zepplin.
Yes didn't they make the song Dazed and Confused.
I'm surprised that you know that.
I do listen to some of their stuff.
Do you know the song Stairway to Heaven?
That's my favorite song of theirs.
How about Whole Lotta Love?
I haven't heard that one yet.
I think you should look up some of their music and listen to it sometime.
I think I will, I do like music.
I know you're studying music so thought it would be a good conversation piece none the less.
I do appreciate it.
Do you know what my favorite song of theirs is?
I have no idea.
Rock and Roll.
That's the songs name?
Yep and it's a good one too.
Think i'll listen to that one first.
It's a good choice.
Thanks again.
