Man the late seventies sucked; it was all Disco Music all the time.
That's not true, there were some good rock albums released in the late seventies.
Such as?
Well let me see, there was Queen's "News of the World" for instance
Is that the one that has "We will rock you" and "We are the champions"?
Yes, in fact those are the first two tracks of the album.
Any other good songs in the album?
The whole album is good you should listen to it.
Didn't "Rumours" came that same year?
That's right! I told you, there was great music back then not just disco.
