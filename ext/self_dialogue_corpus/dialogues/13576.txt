How do you feel about episodes 1-3 of Star Wars?
I hated those movies, they were the worst.
I agree.
I think they have the worst characters, like Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar Binks was so annoying and he didn't do anything to help move the plot.
He was only there for comic relief and even then he was horrible.
I think R2-D2 was better at creating laughs.
The droid who doesn't talk gets the most laughs!
R2 was always so sassy.
We need him to make up for C3PO's stuffiness.
