What movies are currently playing at the theater?
I'm not sure. The only one I know of is Beauty and the Beast.
Oh, I want to see that! It has Emma Watson in it?
Yes it does. From the pictures she looks like a great fit.
I agree. Do you know what else is out?
No. But I did watch a movie on Netflix last week.
I do that a lot. What movie?
Bridget Jones' Baby. Have you seen it?
Yes I did. It was absolutely hilarious!
I will definitely watch it again. Did you see the part where the mom held the facetime to her ear?
That was my favorite part of the whole movie. My mom is just like that and terrible with technology.
Do you know the names of the two male actors who she thinks may be the dad?
I have no idea, but I have seen the British guy in other movies.
Me too. Do you remember the ending?
Yeah, she lives happily ever after.
Typical.
I know right? What is your favorite movie of all time?
Probably Juno. It is such a risky movie on teen pregnancy.
I liked that movie, but I wouldn't call it my favorite. My favorite is Stranger Than Fiction.
I watched that but hated it. What a quirky movie.
