Have you ever noticed the amount of time travel romance movies?
Can not say I have.
It seemed to all start with Christopher Reeves?
You mean in Superman where he reverses time to save Louis Lane.
Well, maybe that too but no.
What movie are you thinking of.
It was called "Some where in Time".
Who else plays in it?
Jane Seymour.
From the Medicine Woman movies and Tv shows?
Yes, he falls in love with her picture.
And the time travels to see her?
Yes. It reminded me of the one with Meg Ryan and the guy who plays Logan.
Are you talking about Kate and Lepold?
Yes, I loved the Logan guy in that one.
Hugh Jackman, I actually thought Liev Striver did well in that one.
The supporting actors are usually my favorite.
Did you see the one called About Time?
That had Rachel Mcadams.
Yes, it made it too similar to the one she did with the same premise, starring Eric Banna.
