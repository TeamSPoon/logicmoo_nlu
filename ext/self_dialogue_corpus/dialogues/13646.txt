What's your favorite moment where someone uses The Force?
I love in Episode III when Yoda throws his lightsaber into a clone trooper.
Yeah, we've never seen that before--their hands had to always be on the button.
Yours?
Probably when Kylo Ren stops a blaster bullet in mid-air.
More than Vader stopping them in Empire?
Far more.
Why?
Well, Vader let them hit his hand. Kylo caught it, had a conversation, kept it steady, and released it when he wanted to.
That was pretty sweet.
