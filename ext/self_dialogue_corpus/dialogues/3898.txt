What's your favorite thriller?
That would have to be Psycho!
I think the best thrillers are Hitchcock films too!
Really, what is your favorite.
The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo. Pretty much all of them.
Did you ever see American Psycho?
No, who is in that?
Christian Bale.
Oh, he is in some other thrillers, too, right?
Yeah, I think The Machinist is one of the best known thrillers he's in.
