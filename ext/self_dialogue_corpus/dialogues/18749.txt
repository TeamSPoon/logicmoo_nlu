Do you like Banks?
I'm not sure. What do they sing?
Not they. She. Her name is Gillian Banks.
Oh. I think maybe I've heard of her. Is she really popular?
No, I don't think so. But she's getting to be more well known.
Well, what's one of her songs?
Drowning is probably her most popular, but Gemini Feed is the latest one. It's pretty popular, too.
Oh, yeah! Of course I've heard of her. I just forgot who she was.
She's great. I own both of her albums.
What were they called? I kind of want to buy one. I have some money on an iTunes card I got for Christmas.
Well, her first album is Goddess, and the new one is called The Altar.
Which one would you recommend?
Both! But, seriously. I think you should start with Goddess. It's less sophisticated than The Altar, but it's so good.
Why not start with The Altar?
if you start with The Altar you probably won't appreciate how much she grows from one album to the next.
Oh, I understand. I'll buy Goddess and let you know what I think.
Yes, do. And you should listen to it a lot before you try the new one. Don't worry. You'll be addicted.
You're always so great for new music.
Aww, thanks. But you already knew about Banks, silly. You just forgot about her.
I guess you're right!
