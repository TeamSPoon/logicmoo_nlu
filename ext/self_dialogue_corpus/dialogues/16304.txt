Do you like to sing?
No, I hate it.
But you're a musician?
Yes, not all of us like to sing.
How much have you sung?
Well, it's been a while, but I was in high school chorus for a year to prep for being a music major.
Any good concerts?
Nope, I could barely remember the music. i hated it.
Did you at least have a neat concert somewhere?
Yeah, we sang the national anthems at a Toronto-Oakland game in Toronto.
Nice!
Yeah, I know the Canadian national anthem's lyrics thanks to that.
What about in undergrad? Didn't you sing?
Outside of ear training, no.
That class sounds crazy.
It is. We had to sing in front of the class and be told we're wrong. And it was for a grade.
Harsh!
Yeah, as a teacher now we don't do that. They're all private exams in our offices.
They sound nerve-racking either way.
Totally. I'm glad I'm no longer a student.
