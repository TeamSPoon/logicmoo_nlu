What's your favorite scary movie?
That's funny, because that line is in my favorite scary movie.
You must be talking about Scream.
Scream is by far my favorite horror movie franchise. I like guessing who the killer is.
I always get it wrong. I thought Dooey was the killer in every movie.
Wow! You were ay off.
Which one of the Scream movies was your favorite?
It was definitely the first one. It made me jump quite a bit.
Not to mention, it was the one that was the most unpredictable.
The only one I didn't really like was the third one.
