do you think emo music even counts as rock music?
yeah, i think so. emo music is kind of a vast genre at this point
true!
it can be anything from bright eyes to taking back sunday
but would you say those are rock bands?
yeah, i would! taking back sunday uses rock instruments, they're clearly a rock band.
what about bright eyes, though? is that still rock?
soft rock, but i would say rock nonetheless.
songs like cleanse song make bright eyes seem a little closer to baroque pop
i guess that's the cool thing about music. all the blurred lines
