Hey, did you have any disappointments with The Force Awakens?
You mean besides Han Solo dying?
Yeah, besides that.
Well, I felt the whole Leia and Han's son going to the Dark Side was kind of unoriginal?
What do you mean? I didn't see that coming.
You remmber the now no longer canon Expanded Star Wars Universe.
Yeah, so what about it?
In that universe, Jacen Solo, the oldest son of Leia and Han, went all Dar Side as well.
Oh, so you mean that having a kid of Han and Leia go bad, had been done before.
Yes, just not in the movies, but the books.
