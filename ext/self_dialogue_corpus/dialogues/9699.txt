Do you think Wiz Khalifa is a good rapper?
No, I think he might be the most overrated rapper ever.
Really? More overrated than 50 cent?
Maybe not that far.
You didn't like "Black and Yellow"?
I did like that song but that doesn't mean he's a good rapper.
True, that's more of a radio hit.
He basically just says "Black and Yellow" a million times and then it's over.
I wonder what the song was written about.
I heard it was about his pride for Pittsburgh. Those are their football colors.
