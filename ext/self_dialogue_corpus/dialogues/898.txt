Can you believe the start of the NFL season is just about 2 months away know?
It's crazy. I feel like the Patriots were just beating the Falcons in overtime in the Superbowl.
Don't remind me. I am still angry about them beating the Steelers in the AFC championship game.
How do you think the Steelers will do this year?
I am hoping for the best. As long as we can stay healthy I think we have a chance.
Adding James Connor to add depth at running back was a good move during the draft.
Definitely. We are solid on offense with Ben, Bell, Brown, Connor, and hopefully Bryant will be back to himself.
So glad Ben decided to come back this year and not retire.
I didn't believe he would actually retire.
What do you think about the defense?
James Harrison will always be solid, even if he is 40. The rest of the defense needs to step up and prove themselves.
I think they made good moves in free agency to sure up the defense.
Lets hope. Are you planning on going to any games this year?
I have tickets to the home game against the Packers. I might go to one of the Thursday night games as well.
Sweet, I'm hoping to make it to a couple as well.
Their really is nothing like the experience of a home Steeler's game at Heinz field.
For sure. Got to have the terrible towel.
There are also so many restaurants around the stadium now that game days are now an all day event.
Well let's hope for 16-0.
Either way, I think we have 2 guaranteed wins against the Browns.
