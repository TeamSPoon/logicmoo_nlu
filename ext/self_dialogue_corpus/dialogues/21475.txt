Hey have you seen any good movies lately/ Im tryimg to go see something this weekend?
The last movie I saw was Get out and i thought it was good but not as good as everybody was saying on facebook.
Really everybody I talked said it was so good.Ijust didnt have time to see since i picked up working weekends.
Yeah dont get me wrong I like it but It just wasnt as good as thought but i think its still in at the movies tho.
I hate when people hype up movies and then your waste your money to go see them. I think i might wait untill it goes to Redbox.
Yeah I hate that too but i seem to fall for it everytime haha.
what about the new pirates of the caribbean movie.
I really havent heard anything about it except that the movie got hacked i was thinking it was gonna flop.
No dude it made 650 million far from flop.
Really I know the people tha stole the movie are mad they thought they was about to see a payday.
Ha Ha yupp I might go see that sunday you wanna go?
Naw not really what about The Mummy?
Oh i forgot about that one i actually seen the trailer a couple days ago over ashleys.
Yeah it looked good you know i live my Horror flims.
Yeah I remember when we took those girls and they was jumping all over the place and we was just laughing.
Ha ha yeah so how about saturday i get off at 8pm.
Alright thats cool you sure you dont want to see Wonder Woman I remember we was talking about it
