Do you still listen to good music?
If by good music you mean Eluveitie, yeah!
Awesome! Have you listened to their new album Helvetios?
I have.
And what did you think?
I really liked it. I thought it was powerful and very story-driven, which was nice.
Yeah I thought it had a very warlike, victorious sound.
I honestly haven't heard any Eluveitie I didn't like though.
Do you prefer their instrumental songs or songs with words?
Oh man, some of their instrumentals are really catchy or contain a lot of emotion, like Anagantios, but the songs that have words tend to sound more powerful and complex.
I gotcha. I like their harder sounding songs.
Yeah me too sometimes, but I like that they have different music for different moods, ya know?
Yeah, so you can never get tired of them.
I also don't feel like I'm missing out with the instrumentals because I don't speak Gaulish anyway.
Well I don't blame you, seeing as it's basically extinct.
It sure sounds pretty though. What instruments do you favour in their stuff?
I'm kinda digging the hurdy-gurdy. What about you?
I like the ocarina. Just always been a fan of it.
I'm really glad Eluveitie's using instruments like that that otherwise don't get enough exposure.
Me too, I love sharing that with people.
