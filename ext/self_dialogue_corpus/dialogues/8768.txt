Metallica is a great band!
You're right. They are one of the most popular metal bands in the world.
James Hetfield is probably one of my favorite musicians ever,
Is he in Metallica?
He is! He is the lead vocalist of the band.
Does he play any instruments in the band?
Indeed he does. He also plays rhythm guitar.
I read that he is one of the founders of the band too.
You're correct. He is.
He must be so proud of how much the band has achieved.
