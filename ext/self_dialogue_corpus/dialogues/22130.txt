Have you seen any movies in theaters lately?
Yes! I just watched Guardians of the Galaxy II.
Oh wow! How was it?
It was great! I really enjoyed it.
Who was your favorite character?
Baby Groot, hands down.
Isn't Chris Pratt in that movie?
Yes, he plays the main character, Star Lord.
Star Lord? That's the character's name?
Haha yes! Well, his "superhero" name.
That's really funny.
And Vin Diesel voices Baby Groot.
Is it a long movie?
It's pretty short, and action packed so it goes by pretty fast.
It hasn't been out that long.
I think maybe two or three weeks?
Awesome, I still have time to check it out!
Definately!
I really lover superhero movies, I didn't know this was one!
Yes! In the Marvel universe.
