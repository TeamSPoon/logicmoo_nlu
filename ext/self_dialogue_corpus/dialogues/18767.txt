Neil Young is one of my favorite musicians.
I really like him too.
Old Man is one of my favorite songs.
Yes he has a lot of good songs.
I like Down by the River and Cinammon girl too.
Yes they are good but you know which one I like?
What?
Harvest Moon is one and Long May you run.
Did you know that Long May you Run was actually about his car?
No I did not know that.
Yea it was.
I saw him in concert a couple of years ago in Philly.
I never saw him but I would love too.
Maybe we can go together next time.
That sounds great.
Concert tickets are really getting expensive these days.
Yes , especially ones for the top artists.
Well. it is worth it to see Neil Young.
You are right about that.
Ok, lets get the tickets next time.
