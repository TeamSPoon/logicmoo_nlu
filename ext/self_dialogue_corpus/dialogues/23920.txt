Did you hear about the new Planet of the Apes movie?
There's another one? Didn't they already make one?
This one is actually the third modern version of the movie.
Oh, really? The third? I guess I never saw the first two.
The first one was pretty good, and the second one was okay. The third one looks pretty cool!
Now, when you say the first one, do you mean the one with Charleton Heston?
Charleton Heston? I don't even know who that is.
Ah, okay. He was in the original Planet of the Apes from the 60s.
Oh, I didn't know that. Is it a good movie?
It's not bad. It's a little campy by today's standards, but the twist at the end is pretty cool.
Is it the same twist as there is in the remake?
The twist is that the planet is earth and that apes took it over.
Yep, that's the same twist. It was pretty cool.
It was pretty cool in the original movie too. It sounds like the new ones are paying homage to it, at least.
I don't know, but they're good action movies.
Do the apes wear suits, or is it all computer animated?
It's all computer animated, but it's very realistic. I was kind of scared.
I wish they would bring back animatronics and puppets. Computers just can't produce the same effect.
I know what you mean. Still, I'm excited to see the new movie.
Yeah, maybe I'll have to check it out too.
