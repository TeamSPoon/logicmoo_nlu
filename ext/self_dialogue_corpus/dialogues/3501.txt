I'm on the fence about horror movies.
What don't you like about them?
I feel that they give me nightmares. I don't like being scared like that.
What particularly gives you scared feelings?
Well, take Hitchcock's Psycho. That creepy guy.
Oh, you mean the guy who has a strange relationship with his mother?
Yeah, the guy who acts her out. That's just disturbing.
Well, it is, but it's also fascinating to those who like horror.
I do like the cinematics of Sleepy Hollow, though.
Yeah, that's a good one.
