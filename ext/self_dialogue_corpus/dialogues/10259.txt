Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?
One, for sure.
Why is that?
It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.
Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.
I take it you like the second?
Yes.
Why? It's less action, but an action movie!
It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.
Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies.
