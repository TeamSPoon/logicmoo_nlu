Do you have a favorite comedy movie?
I like a lot of different comedies.
If you could pick one what would it be?
I like the movie Brides Maids.
That is a very funny one.
It has a lot of one liners.
I have seen it several times.
I have watched it multiple times myself, I always pick up on something new and funny.
That is how you know it is good.
Melissa Mccarthy is great in the movie.
Yes she is.
I like when she is trying to lift the couch.
That is a funny scene.
She has put out some great movies recently.
Yes she has.
What are some other movies you like with her?
The Heat was pretty funny.
I liked that movie.
It was not her best but worth watching.
I would agree with that.
