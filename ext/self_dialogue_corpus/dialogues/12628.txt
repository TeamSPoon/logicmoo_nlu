Do you like the character Captain Phasma?
Yes!  She should have had more screen time in The Force Awakens.
Yeah, hopefully she will remove her helmet at some point in The Last Jedi.
I think some great actions scenes with her, Rey, and Kylo would be great in the next movie.
I often wonder if Luke Skywalker is doing to die sometime in the next two movies.
Yes, that's a possibility to bringing balance to The Force.
Supposedly Rey is going to be a Grey Jedi.
Yes, I think that will be really neat - or perhaps Kylo will be redeemd?
I just don't know - I hope they have some epic lightsaber battles during the next two movies.
Yeah, I can't wait to see Luke's green lightsaber again.
