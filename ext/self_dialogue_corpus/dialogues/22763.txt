Man terminator is pretty bad without arnold
Well what did you expect
I expected something good
Nah
Why not
Because he is the sole reason the movies were good
The plot was good
It was ok by the time
It still is decent at least
Eh it is kinda plot holey
How so
Like the hole thing about time travel its just a gimmick
A gimmick?
Yeah
How so
Because it is used to explain away everything
But it works
Because it is a gimmick
I guess nah i am right
Maybe
