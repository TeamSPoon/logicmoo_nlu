Have you heard of Hamilton?
No, I have not!
Well it's a very popular broadway play with very good music.
Oh yeah? What are some of your favorite songs?
Hands down Wait For It and Take a Shot.
I will listen to Wait for it.
Wait until you hear the beat drop!
Wow they sound amazing!
I know?! Can you believe how catchy the music is?
I literally can't stop singing.
I love how it is a combination of hib hop with a bit of soulful.
The beginning of Wait for it, sounds like an Ed Sheeran song.
No! It's so much better than him!
I'm agreeing with you. I love Aaron Burr's voice the most.
His voice is so strong and smooth!
Do you have any other recommendations?
Yes, Non-stop and Yorktown.
Oh these have more of a written part.
Yeah, remember it's part of a musical plot.
Amazing regardless!
