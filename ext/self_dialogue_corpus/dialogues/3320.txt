Do you like The Evil Dead?
Yes, I love it
Have you seen part 2?
Yes, I love all three.
There are 3?
Yes, Army of Darkness is the third one.
Wow, I never knew that. I will watch it.
It is really good. Part 1 is the scariest though.
I know. That part with the pencil was cringe worthy.
The hand in part 2 was pretty awesome. That whole movie was so gory.
