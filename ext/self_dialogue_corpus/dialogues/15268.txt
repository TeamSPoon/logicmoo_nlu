What happened to music?
What at you talking about?
Song use to be about things.
They still are about things.
No, most songs now are about how much money and 'swag' a person has.
I guess that's true.
I miss songs that tell a story.
Like what?
Tracey Chapman's song fast car told a great story.
Isn't it about a guy having a really fast car?
No the song is about how she is escaping an abusive father but lives with an abusive boyfriend.
Why do you think it's about that.
It's what the lyrics are all about.
I guess I will have to listen to it again.
Maybe that the the problem.  People like you not paying attention.
I've heard the song but I really like the hook.
That's what all songs have become a bunch of non sense then catch hook.
So your saying Miley Cyrus songs aren't deep?
They are about as deep as a saucer.
I guess that is true too.
