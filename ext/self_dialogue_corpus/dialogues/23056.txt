Are you kidding me? There's ANOTHER Fast and Furious movie?
Yep. Just saw the trailer.
How many of these things are they going to make?
Ha â€” as long as Vin Diesel keeps laughing his way to the bank.
Right. Man. Well, this one at least has the Rock.
You a Dwayne Johnson fan?
I mean, I don't mind if he's in a movie. I don't go out of my way to watch his films, but I don't mind him.
I hear you there. So will you watch Baywatch?
Oh yeah, I heard he's in that too. I actually think that sounds kind of good. Kind of.
Well, good in that campy kind of way, right?
Oh yeah, totally. These aren't movies you take too seriously.
Right! Action films are fun, cheap entertainment.
Speaking of, apparently there's yet another one of these Transformers movies.
Oh gawd.
Yeah, there's five of them. Five too many, if you ask me.
I thought the first one was OK.
The first was sort of entertaining, although I'm not entirely sure I understand the message. But boy did that Shia LaBouf go off the deep end.
That made for some interesting headlines for awhile.
Yeah, what's with that guy?
Guess he turned out to be a whole lot more than meets the eye.
