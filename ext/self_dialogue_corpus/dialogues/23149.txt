What's your favorite romantic movie?
Well personally I'm a big fan of The Notebook. I know it's a common one, but that's because it's the best one.
I agree with you that it's pretty good. I think my favorite one has to be PS I love you.
That was all right but it was so sad! It almost made me cry.
Do you watch musical movies often? Things like La La Land?
Oh absolutely. The two musicals I love more than anything in the world are La La Land and Moulin Rouge.
I forgot about Moulin Rouge. I remember how good Ewan Mcgregor was in that though.
He's an excellent actor. Everything from Star Wars to Big Fish.
Big Fish was an interesting one. I won't say it was my favorite, but certainly interesting.
Sometimes those indie type of movies can be really good. Did you ever see American Beauty?
No but I've heard it's good. Is it worth watching?
Kevin Spacey is excellent in the movie. I'd definitely give it a watch if I were you.
I've never seen a Kevin Spacey movie I didn't like up until now, so I will do that for sure.
You've never seen a bad one? Even Kpax or Superman Returns?
Okay I actually liked Kpax. It was kind of like The Usual Suspects, with aliens.
I can see that. But you can't deny that Superman Returns had the worst plot of any Superman movie.
I'll give you that one. But I'm a big Superman fan in general so I think that gives it a little extra credit.
As far as superhero movies go I guess I've seen worse.
Yeah, I mean Catwoman with Halle Berry? Hello.
Oh don't even mention that movie to me. I tried to watch it on Netflix the other day and almost threw up it was so bad.
