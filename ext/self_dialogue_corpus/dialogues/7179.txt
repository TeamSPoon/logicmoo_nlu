Have you seen the new Beauty & the Beast movie?
No I haven't! It was my favorite growing up. Did you have a favorite Disney movie?
Yes! I can say, without a doubt, that it is Cinderella.
That is my daughters favorite also! I am also a huge fan of Sleeping Beauty.
We love that one around here too!
We have been trying to decide which Classic to pick up next for the kids. Any suggestions?
Maybe Bambi? Or Dumbo? Do they like movies that revolve around animals?
Yes they do! The animals ones are my youngest sons favorite. We have dumbo already and Bambi is definitely going on my list!
I'm glad I could help! Disney movies are my favorite.
Thank you so much! They are my favorite too.
