Are you a fan of old school rock bands?
Like Nirvana?
No, like old school for real, like The Who.
Who are the Who?
The band, they sing "Who are You".
Oh, I did not know that. I think I like them then.
They have hits spanning decades.
Well, I think I will have to look into them.
Look into the Ramones too, you might like them.
