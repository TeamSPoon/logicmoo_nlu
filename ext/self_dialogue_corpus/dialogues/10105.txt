I watched Kong Skull Island last night with my folks.
That's the King Kong remake starring Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson right?
That's the one, John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson also star in it.
I heard John C. Reily is also in there.
He is in there he makes a surprise appearance, but his character was so funny.
Did you like the movie or was it just like the past remakes?
I actually enjoyed it a great deal. It was very action packed, suspenseful, and I thought they did a great job avoiding some typical action movie cliches.
How was Kong? Were they just trying to battle him the whole movie?
Kong was enormous! They actually start out with you thinking Kong was the villain but you soon realize he's actually the hero.
Sounds amazing! I'll have to try to catch it soon too.
