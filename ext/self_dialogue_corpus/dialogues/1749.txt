Is the NFC East back?
No too mediocre.
Cowboys favored to win division right?
I like the Eagles.
Why is that?
Like the addition that made at wide receiver.
Yeah, but Dak Prescott a winner.
He hasn't performed well when the running game isn't supporting him.
What about other divisional teams?
Washington wasn't committal on Cousins as there franchise QB.
I think he is better than Prescott.
Yeah but Wentz has the most ability with arguably the least amount of talent around him.
Who passes for more yards this year, Wentz or Prescott?
Wentz no question.
Probably right, Cowboys a run-first team.
Elliot so good behind that line.
Who is starting for Giants?
No idea, probably a platoon situation.
Remember the days when one back got 300 carries a year?
Sure do. That won't happen again with the way teams throw the ball nowadays.
