I am getting excited about football season.
You're getting excited about football?  It is the beginning of July.
Rookie camp starts in two weeks.
Rookie camp?  Come on man, that's not that exciting.
It is to me. I can't help but think of all the effort that these guys put out to get to that spot and I get excited for them.
You're a good fan. Any predictions for this year?
I predict the Patriots do not win the Super Bowl.
Oh really, so who is going to win?
The Pittsburgh Steelers, that's who!
And why is that?
Because they have more talent on offense than anybody.  Roethlisberger, AB, LeVeon and now Martavis is back.
Yeah the offense is strong but I think defense wins football games.
The defense will be better too.
Why?
Because Cam Heyward and Bud Dupree are both injury free.
That's really the key isn't it.  I mean, staying healthy that is.
That is the most important thing of all.  I can't even begin to tell you how many games have turned on injuries.
Games have turned and unfortunately, so have careers.
Man, I know, it is the worst part of the game.
Always terrible to see.
