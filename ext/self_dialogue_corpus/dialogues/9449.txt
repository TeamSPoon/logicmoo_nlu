I know one artist who I thought was nasty.
Nasty? Who do you mean?
He rapped that one song "Crank That".
You mean Soulja Boy?
Yes him! He looked so nasty.
I guess so. I kind of thought he was cute.
Well we may have different taste but I hated that song.
I'll be the first to say he was not a favorite but the song wasn't bad in my opinion.
I think he could use more original ideas in his music.
I'm not even sure he makes music anymore actually.
