What do you think of Pod Racing?
Like in the Star Wars movies?
Exactly.
I love it, though it is a little extreme.
I agree, no holds barred appraoch to winning is a bit much for my taste.
That being said it's awesome.
I wish I could drive one.
Me too, it's like Nascar but with hovercars.
I want one now.
Let's build it.
