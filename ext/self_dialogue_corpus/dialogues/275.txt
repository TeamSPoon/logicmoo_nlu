What do you think about Wonder Woman?
I watched this movie last weekend as I was surprise.
Why where you surprised?
I didn't think I would like it, but the movie was great?
Really, what did you like about it?
I liked the movie because it was filled with SO MUCH action.
I can't wait to see it. I haven't had a change to see it yet.
Which super hero movies do you like?
I really like the Guardians movie from earlier this year.
Oh yea, that movie was amazing as well.
