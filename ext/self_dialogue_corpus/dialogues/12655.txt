Is Greedo the creepiest looking Star Wars villain of all time?
I'd say so, Rodian bounty hunters are spooky.
You know Greedo shot first right?
Of course I know that. Everybody knows that.
Everyone doesn't know that but most people are well aware.
You'd think the Mos Eisley Cantina would have a bouncer wouldn't you?
He wouldn't last a day with all that villainy and treachery.
Yeah, it's definitely a rough crowd in there.
Do you think they have a ladies night?
Sure they do. But I doubt it's the type of nice Tatooine ladies that you'd want to meet.
