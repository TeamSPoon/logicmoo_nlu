Did you like Biggie or Tupac more?
I have to go with Tupac but honestly I don't listen to much of either.
Yeah, I liked his west coast style a little bit more.
I have to give them both respect, though. They were ahead of their time.
Definitely. They are legends now.
I wonder if a lot of the east coast versus west coast rap drama was real.
Well, they did made diss tracks about each other.
True, but I think some of that was for publicity.
Yeah I doubt people really cared that much which coast their rap music came from.
Exactly, I think it was just the rappers involved.
