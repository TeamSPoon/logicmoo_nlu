One of these days, I'd like to see a back story on what happened with the New Republic after Luke destroyed the Empire.
Me too, at least a short backstory on things going right, then taking a turn for the worst.
Like how Kilo Ren turned.
Or maybe the business as usual aspect.  While the Phantom Menace wasn't the best of movies, seeing the Senate was important to the whole of the Star Wars plot.
It was, it showed that at one time the world had hit's problems but was stable to say the least.
And that the Jedi Order was once well known, and were great peacekeepers.
I'd like to see how the Jedi worked under Luke as Grand Master.
Yes, was he the same as Yoda?  Or did he have a different approach.
Like about the vows of celibacy and poverty?
Exactly, was that something he did?  Or were there new rules allowing for families?
