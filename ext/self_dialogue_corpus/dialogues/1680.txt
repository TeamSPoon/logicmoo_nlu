Did you ever see the clip of that quarterback breaking his leg?
Yes. It kills me every time.
What was his name?
Joe Theisman
What team did he play for
The redskins
Oh, I should have known that.
Is RGIII still the QB for them?
No he got injured too much
Who is the QB now?
It's Kirk Cousins right now
Isn't he an older player?
He's only 28
Looks like his contract negotiations aren't going so well for this season
Yeah. his completions were only like 68 percent last year
That's pretty bleak
For sure. I'd like if they got a new QB
They need a new owner and coach and all
True. Their owner is a moron
A literal insane person with too much money.
