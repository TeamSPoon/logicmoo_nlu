Did you like Dumbo?
Yes I did. One of disney's best in my mind.
I loved it as well. I heard they are making a remake.
Really? I wonder why?
I think disney is doing that lots in general.
Ya these days most studios are.. nothing left originall I suppose.
Or they are lazy to come up with new ideas.
Ha! Maybe true. I am intriuged at a dumbo remake though.
Well it is said to be a real life version.. kind of similar to what they did with beauty and the beast.
Oh that maybe pretty neat! I wonder how they would manage a flying elephant... cgi probably.
