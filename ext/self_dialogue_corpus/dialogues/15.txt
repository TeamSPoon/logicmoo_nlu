what move are you looking most forward to?
There are many, but I'd say Thor Ragnarok
That does sound like its going to be good
I love the Avengers but especially Thor
And the action scenes from the previews look amazing
There's that too, and the fact it will set the groundwork for the final Avengers movies
I like that they are bringing Spiderman into the Avengers movies
So do I, the Infinity War movies should be awesome
With DC coming out with Justice League and Wonder Woman and the new Spiderman coming itwas a tough choice to make
There are a lot of worthy answers to your question, but Thor has always been my favorite
