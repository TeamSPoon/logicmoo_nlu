Do you think Rogue one is a good film?
I think Rogue one is the best film Since Empire Strikes Back. I loved K2SO.
He was a fun, intelligent robot. I cared about him.
I did too. I cried when he died.
I cried when everyone died.
Me too. I don't know how they could possibly make a sequel.
If they did one, it would have to be with a completely different group
When would it be set, do you think?
My guess it would be between Empire and Return of the Jedi, when the Rebellion is in shambles.
That could be very interesting.
