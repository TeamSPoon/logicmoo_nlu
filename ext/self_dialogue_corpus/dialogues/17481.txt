What do you think of Audioslave?
I loved them in college.
It's so sad that the lead singer died.
Chris Cornell from Soundgarden?
Yep, I loved them in the 1990's too.
Do you have any new bands you like?
I'm into the Black Keys
The lead singer Dan Aurbach produces a lot of good music from other people too.
Oh, I know. I love Valerie June
You should also check out Benjamin Booker.
Is it a similiar sound?
Sort of. It's more rock than folk though.
Leon Bridges is the best.
Yes. I love his voice.
He's like a new John Legend for me.
John's voice is amazing.
All of me is one of my favorite songs
It makes me cry every time I hear it.
You know who else is good is Ray LaMontaigne.
Oh, Jolene is such a good song
