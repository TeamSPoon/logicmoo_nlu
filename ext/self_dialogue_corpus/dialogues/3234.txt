What is a good horror movie you've watched recently?
I watched The Thing again the other night.
You watch that a lot, you must really like that movie.
Yes, it's one of my favorite horror movies. Not only that, I think it's one of the best movies of any genre.
Who directed The Thing?
John Carpenter, same guy that made Halloween.
Oh, that was really good too. He is a talented director.
Yeah, he has a great mind for horror.
Doesn't it take place in Antarctica?
Yes, that location is really unique for a horror movie. It also helps create a tremendous feeling of isolation and claustrophobia which really adds to the level of tension and fear in the movie. That's a big reason why I love it.
