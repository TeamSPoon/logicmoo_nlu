So, are there any other rap groups/songs you like?
Uh... a few here and there.  I like DMX's "X Gonna Give It To Ya"
Oh, yeah, remember hearing that on Deadpool!
Yeah, a lot of people do, but that's not where i first heard it from.
Really, where did you hear it from?
Film called Cradle 2 The Grave.  It had Jet Li and DMX.
Don't think I saw that film.
It wasn't too bad, had a lot of action in it, and some comedy as well.
Cool, I'll have to look it up.
But, yeah, that song was a big part of the soundtrack.
