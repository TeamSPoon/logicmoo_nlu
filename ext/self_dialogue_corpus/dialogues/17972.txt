What do you think about dubstep?
Dubstep is really hit or miss for me. I get the complaints about it, but there can be some really catchy songs.
Do you think dubstep has died out?
I don't think it's died out entirely. I think it's moreso become more integrated into other genres of music like pop and rock.
You mean like a lot of club music has sirens and similar noises?
Yeah, but also in that a lot of pop musicians have collaborated with dubstep artists like Skrillex.
What's your opinion of Skrillex?
I think his music's alright. I think he's a bit overrated in the dubstep world, but that's probably because he was the one who made the cornerstone in the genre.
Dubstep reminds me a lot of freestyle street music that they made in the 90s a lot. Like banging on trashcans and tapping along fences.
You're right, it is very similar. Except the sounds are being produced electronically instead of manually.
Which would you prefer; dubstep or freestyle street music?
I'd honestly take freestyle street music. I just think that takes more effort, creativity and ingenuity than dubstep.
What do you think is the best part of both?
That really anyone can try to make their own music in that genre. Dubstep really only requires a computer an editing software, which can be free, and freestyle street music can be created anywhere.
You said pop music and other genres have integrated dubstep into their mixes more often. Do you think that's a good thing?
Like any form of music, you're going to have good and bad songs. Ultimately, though, I'd prefer dubstep to be within pop and other genres than on its own.
Do you think we'll see a dubstep revival?
I don't think dubstep is really that dead since it's still pretty big in clubs, but it's very possible that we could see a big dubstep revival of sorts. Old classic and forgotten genres like funk are making a comeback.
What's your favorite dubstep song?
First of the year (Equinox) by Skrillex. It has a fantastic beat and I love the flow.
