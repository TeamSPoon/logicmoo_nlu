Do you know who Imagine Dragons are?
I am not sure, can you tell me one of their songs?
They sing a song called "Radioactive".
I remember that from the radio!
Yes I put the song on my phone so I could listen to it over and over.
They kind of remind me of One Republic or something similar.
They kind of do. Also remind me of Fall Out Boy.
Yes them too!
I love "Uma Thurman" by Fall Out Boy.
Me too! It's my son's favorite as well.
