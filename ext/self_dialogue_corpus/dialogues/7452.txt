What's the first Disney movie you ever saw?
Snow White, my grandma took me.
That's awhile ago.
It was the 80s and she loved it.
I think mine was Sleeping Beauty.
I hated the ugly stepsisters.
The little mice in Sleeping Beauty were cute.
I like the animals in Bambi.
Bambi was sad though.
Yeah but Thumper and Bambi were cute.
