Ever heard of Kimbra? She's a pop artist from New Zealand, I think.
Oh, yeah! I love her!
Me too! Both her first and second albums are so good.
I agree, but I prefer The Golden Echo.
Yeah, she did a lot of growing up on that album.
True. Her songs are much more mature with a lot of deep lyrics.
Except for 90's Music. That one was just really fun.
Actually, I really found it to be about her growing up. The lyrics are about how she's grown up but she still misses and loves that time.
And she's clearly talking about some old lover she had.
That is such a great album.
