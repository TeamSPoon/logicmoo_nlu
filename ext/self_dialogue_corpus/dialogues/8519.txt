Would you consider Elton John pop?
Absolutely, he was great too.
I loved Crocodile Rock.
Candle in the Wind is my favorite song by him of all time.
I think that was great as well.
He was such a terrific performer its a shame hes not making new music.
Well everyone gets old at some point!
His music though spans so many generations.
Yes my children love it too.
Rocketman is a song that has stood the test of time!
