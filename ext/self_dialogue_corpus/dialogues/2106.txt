I don't know anything about the history of the NFL. What can you tell me.
The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association.
How many teams did they have at the time?
There were 14 teams in the league for the 1920 season. Only two remain in the league today!
Which teams?
The Chicago Cardinals (now Arizona Cardinals) and Decatur Staleys (Chicago Bears).
Did they have a championship game?
Championship in 1920 was awarded to the Akron Pros, the only undefeated team that season.
So there was no Super Bowl?
No Super Bowl until 1967. Akron was awarded the championship based on their record.
Teams now play 16 games in a 17 week season. How many did they play in 1920.
It varied, actually, Scheduling was left up to the individual teams. There were no official standings.
Wow, that is crazy!
It was! The teams varied in how many games each played, and some even played non-league opponents.
So if they were the American Professional Football Association, when did they become the NFL?
They changed their name to the National Football League in the summer of 1922.
Any other notable firsts?
They began an annual draft of players from the college level in 1936.
Oh, that is neat. The draft is a big deal these days.
And the first televised game was held on October 22, 1939.
