Have you checked out 'Thor' movies?
I watched the first one.
Do you know Thor: Ragnarok is releasing around November 2017?
Well, something to look forward to before Xmas.
Whenever I think Thor, I'm reminded of Chris Hemsworth.
Same here, feels like he was especially made for Thor.
I love his hammer, wonder how much must it weigh.
I think it must be light weight in reality.
How funny must it be then for him to act as if it is really heavy?
That's why they are actors, they can act.
