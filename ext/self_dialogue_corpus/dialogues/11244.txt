Did you see the outfits at the Met Gala this year?
Yes, wasn't Rihanna's outfit crazy?
It looked like it was made of old wallpaper. But Halle Berry's dress was great.
I loved that it looked like record albums.
I loved Chrissy Teigen's dress, too.
I know, and John Legend in his white dinner jacket was a nice accessory.
Speaking of men, Kanye's starburst jacket was pretty cool.
Yeah, but Kim's dress was awful.
Not as awful as Pharrell Williams' wife, though.
She looked like an inflatable Gumby doll.
You know who looked surprisingly good, though? Janelle Monae.
Yes, she wasn't as crazy as she is sometimes. I liked the feather skirt.
Jennifer Lopez was pretty toned-down, too.
Her dress was a pretty color, but really blah style.
Serena Williams, too: great color, bland style.
Oh, I didn't see her. What was it like?
Gorgeous green, full skirt, vee neck. It showed off her baby bump nicely.
Maternity red carpet looks are always a mixed bag.
Agreed. Chrissy Teigen always wore great maternity clothes.
Yup. And Jenna Tatum, too.
