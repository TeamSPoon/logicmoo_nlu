Did you see the Twins game tonight?
no, who did they play.
The White Sox and they won 7-6
Oh, that's good I have given up on them this year.
Why is that?
Well, all there young talent offensively is not mature enough yet.
To make matters worse, there pitching is awful.
What part The starters or relievers?
Well, both. But especially there bullpen.
Yea I know. The pen has been bad especially their closer.Who is he again?
Brandon Kintzler. He just doesn't have lights out stuff, but tonight he got away with it.
Well at least he got the save.
Yes, but not without some nail biting.
Perhaps they can trade for a closer
Perhaps, but they would have to give up one of their offensive prospects.
If they did, who would you give up?
Probably Byron Buxton.
That's risky as he is their numeber one prospect
I know but he is only hitting .180
I get it. We can't wait any longer.
