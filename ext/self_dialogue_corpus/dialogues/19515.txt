So do you know if Counting Crows are releasing a new album soon?
I really don't know but I hear that they tour a lot.
Yes, the do!  Now that you mention it, I've never seen them live.
I haven't either but it might be fun!
Maybe we should go together next time they come around?
Definitely!  What is your favorite album of theirs?
It has to be their first one, August and Everything After.
I have to agree with you on that!
Yes, it's one of those rare albums where every song is remarkable.
I know!  It has no filler!
Do you have a favorite song from it?
Yes, probably Perfect Blue Buildings.
That's a beautiful, yet sad, song.
True.  How about Anna Begins?
Another favorite!  That's such a well crafted song.
Of course, Round Here was a huge hit.
It sure was.  You may as well mention Mr. Jones while you're at it.
Of course.  I still remember the video.
It is sad that the 90's feel like the good old days right now?
Maybe!  Time moves so fast...
