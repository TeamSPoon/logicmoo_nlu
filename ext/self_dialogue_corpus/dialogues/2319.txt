Are you excited for the football season this year?
You know it, I can't wait for the Patriots to play.
I don't think they are going to do very good this year.
How could you say that? They just won the Super Bowl.
Time is finally going to catch up with Brady.
Ya he is getting up there in years.
He got hit pretty bad in the Super Bowl.
If they don't improve their line that could keep happening.
The AFC west looks like it's going to be pretty tough this year.
Belicheck will be able to make the changes that they need to prepare for that.
I don't even think they will make the playoffs this year.
There is no way they aren't going to make the playoffs.
First time since Brady's knee injury in 2008 they won't be there.
You're crazy.  I don't know where you come up with this stuff
Well maybe if they start cheating again and have another "spygate" or something.
That's what everyone goes to complaining about them cheating.
Well if you cheat people are going to bring it up.
If a team wins that's all that matters here in Boston.
Well I'll see you on Sunday and hopefully I'm wrong about my predictions.
I hope you are too bud.
