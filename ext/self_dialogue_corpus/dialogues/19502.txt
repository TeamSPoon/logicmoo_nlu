What kind of music do you like?
I like everything but country. How about you?
I love pop and hip hop.
Have you heard Harry Style's new album?
No, what's it called.
"Sign of the Times." It is unexpectedly good.
Oh,I heard the first single. I didn't know it was him.
Yeah. He's really grown up.
I love Wilco a lot.
My brother loves him. Are they good?
They are great. Very underrated.
I also love Lady Gaga.
Oh, she's the best! She's great in concert.
I saw her last year. She's excellent.
I also love Backstreet Boys.
They were my first concert! Oh, I loved them.
I have all of their CDs. I still listen to them.
You have good taste in music.
Thank you! So do you.
Well, thanks so much!
