I'm listening to the new Mariah Carey album.
She's still singing?
Yeah, but not very well anymore.
Oh no, what's going on with her?
She sounds raspy and off pitch.
Are the songs at least good?
No, I don't care for her writing style anymore.
I used to love her music.
Me too, she was my favorite singer when I was growing up.
I think she is trying to stay young and not growing up with her fans.
That's exactly it.
She needs to do more age appropriate music.
I agree, I don't want to hear these types of songs anymore.
Then why are you listening to it?
I'm just giving it a try.
To make up your own mind?
Yep, absolutely.
I do that too, I like to decide for myself if an album is good or not.
well this is not good at all.
thanks for the heads up, I may skip this one.
