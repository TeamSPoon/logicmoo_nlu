Did you ever see Bad Santa?
Yes that was funny
I liked that one a lot. Billy Bob Thorton was great in that movie.
He was. That kid was so cute also.
Did you see the second one?
No.
Neither have I.
We will both have to watch it to see if it is any good.
I looked it up it isn't rated as all but still looks good.
I will watch it when I get a chance.
