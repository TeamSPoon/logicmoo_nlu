What was the latest Disney movie you've seen?
I've seen Moana quite recently. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
Oh, I haven't had the chance to see Moana yet. What is the movie about?
The movie is based on stories from Polynesian mythology. It's about a little girl who goes on an epic journey to help restore the balance of nature on her island, with the help of a demigod called Maui.
What did you enjoy about the movie the most?
I think the best part of the movie was just watching Moana's perseverance through all of the difficulties she had to face. She never gave up.
Sounds like she will be a good role model for little girls everywhere.
I believe so. She is portrayed as a very strong, independent young woman who follows her heart and does the right thing.
I think I will check this movie out very soon.
You should. It also puts nature in focus, which is an additional element that really makes this movie worth watching.
