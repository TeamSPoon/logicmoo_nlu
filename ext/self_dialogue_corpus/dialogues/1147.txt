Do you think this year will be the year for the Washington Redskins?
I have lost my optimism a long time ago for the Washington Redskins.
Same here. I really wonder what it will take to the Washington Redskins around.
They have been a decent the past couple of seasons with Kirk Cousins.
They have been better, but they always seem to hit a wall.
Robert Griffin's first season was the Redskins was probably the last time I had hope in the team.
The Redskins were actually fun to watch when Griffin was on playing well!
I am not sure what happened to Robert.  I don't know why he can't replicate what he did back in 2012.
I think his injury during the wildcard game back in 2012 against the Seahawks is what started his downfall.
He was very athletic back then and that injury seemed to take something out of him in the years that followed.
I think the problem is that he needs more help on his fundamental skills.  He depends too much on his athletic ability.
That may have something to do with it.  I have some other ideas.
What are your thoughts?
Well, all the teams that he has been on seem to have a terrible offensive line.
You aren't wrong.
Both the Redskins and the Browns could not keep the pressure off of Griffin.  He never has enough time to sit back in the pocket.
Why do you think that Kirk Cousins seems to be doing better with the Redskins offensive line than Griffin?
I don't know.  From what I hear, players actually seem to like Kirk Cousins.
Did the Redskins players not like Griffin?
That is the rumour.  If it is true, that may be one of the reasons why the offensive line didn't put any energy into defending Griffin on the field.
