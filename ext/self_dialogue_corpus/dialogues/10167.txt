Have you seen the Taken movies?
Yes I like them.
I like all of them. They did them all right, I was sad when they killed Lenore off though.
Yes me too.
I like Liam Neeson. I watch a lot of his movies.
Yeah he is pretty cool.
Did you ever see The Other Man?
No.
Really good movie, his wife dies of cancer. After she dies he finds out she was having an affair.
Not his typical kind of movie, but really good.
