Where does baseball go from here?
Thats kind of a vague question, what do you mean?
Do they grow the game internationally?
I think its predominantly Latin right now
Yeah but can you see Mexico getting a baseball team?
I dont know about that, theyre a poor country
They love baseball though.
Players would have a tough time finding a place to live.
Well you just need a hotel for most of the time.
True, I just dont see them thinking thats the direction they want to go in
Do you think another expansion team will come into play?
I think they need to fix something.
I dont like the interleague play at all.
I think its ruined the sanctity of the game.
They should never have moved Houston to the AL West.
I agree, they didnt think that through
Heres the thing I bet they did
And thats the best  they  came up with?
Sure, they arent the brightest minds
How can you even say that?
