What did you think of Aladdin?
An absolute classic, the songs are great and the characters memorable.
I especially loved the late Robin Williams as the genie
It really was the perfect role for him in many ways.
What's your favorite some from the film?
It may seem like an overly trendy choice, but a whole new world.
I don't see it as overly trendy at all, it's probably the most popular one for good reason.
Yeah I remember I was a child when the came out, would sing the song for days after.
I think we will both agree on this one, it's one of the better Disney films.
You're right I do agree, it's in my top five for sure.
