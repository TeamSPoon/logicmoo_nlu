Well, I tried looking for that weird movie I saw as a kid, around 1970. No luck.
The one about "Don Quixote", with a comedy bit at the beginning?
Yes, it's "Sanco Panza" who was Don Quixote's sidekick, not " PANCHO", like I said.
You were probably thinking of the "The Cisco Kid" TV show, with Pancho.
This sidekick gets thrown out of a Cadillac at the beginning of the movie, gets a big laugh.
And there's a train wreck at the end of the movie, you told me.
And I don't know the name of the movie. No one does.
Oh, hey, I saw that "Eraserhead" movie you mentioned.
What did you think of it? It's a black and white Surrealist film from around 1980, I think.
David Lynch, 1977. Reminded me of my old neighborhood in Los Angeles 1968 to 1972.
The opening sequence was mind-warping and stomach-turning, but I guess it was a Creation Myth.
The whole movie is mind-warping, full of dark comedy and seems to be an alternative world, I suppose.
A chicken on a plate, that gets up an dances around after it's been stabbed by a fork...
A miniature, rubber-faced woman singing a song in a spotlight on top of a cigar box ...
I had a fever once of 105, Easter 1970, and saw something very, very similar, oddly.
I didn't want to see the end of the movie. I turned it off. Didn't want to see the "baby".
I don't blame you. You know how much I hate movies like "Beetle Juice".
You said that was the worst movie ever made, and that you turned it off after the first ten minutes!
I did. But I always like Surrealism, at least I did when I was 16.
And the characters in "Eraserhead" reminded you of the old neighborhood. You're very sentimental like that.
