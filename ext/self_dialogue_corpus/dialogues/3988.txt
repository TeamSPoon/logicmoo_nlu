I am in the mood for a thriller.
Me to! We should rent a movie.
Do you like Sam Rockwell?
I do, but I do not think he has any movies that are thrillers.
He played in a movie called A Single Shot.
Cool, I had not heard of that one before.
Yea, the preview to it looks really good.
Do you know what it is about?
Rockwell accidentally shoots a lady and finds a mysterious box of cash.
Sounds like my kind of movie. Let's watch!
