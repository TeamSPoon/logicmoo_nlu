Do you remember The Wallflowers?
Oh, Bob Dylan's son.
Yeah.  They pretty much had their heyday in the 90's and disappeared.
'One Headlight' is one of my favorite songs.
There were plenty of good songs from that album.  What was it called?
Bringing Down the Horse.
That's right.  Whatever happened to them?
Like most bands, they just kind of faded away from the limelight.
That's a shame.  Would be better than most music these days.
Completely agree, but what do you do?
