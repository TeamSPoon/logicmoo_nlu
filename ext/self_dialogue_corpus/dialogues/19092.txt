What do you think of white rappers?
I like some of them.
Do you think they are just as good as other rappers?
Yes, Eminem is an amazing rapper and he is white.
I love Eminem, his lyrics are so raw and real.
Have you seen any documentaries on him?
Yes, I watched a few that explains how he got into the rap game.
It took him a long time to get noticed, but when he did he blew up the rap scene.
When he first started, his lyrics were crazy!
Well I agree, but as he has gone on, his words became much more better.
He had to deal with a lot to get into music and get noticed because he was white.
I know, but he has made millions and millions of dollars.
Would you say he is your favorite rapper>
He is definitely one of my favorite rappers.
Same here, I like rappers that speak the truth and about their lives.
Yes, he reminds me of Tupac with the way he talks about his life in his music.
Could you imagine if Tupac were alive and him and Em did a collaboration together?
That would have been history right there.
It would have been such an amazing concept if they had been able to duet.
I agree, two of the best in the rap game.
