Remember that RETURN OF THE JEDI movie?
I think that is the movie that starts on that ice planet.
I think so also. I think they went to a jungle planet also.
I think the Wookies lived there.
The Wookies helped a lot.
Darth Vader had some kind of base there in the forest.
And they had a big chase scene there also.
And they made that big 2 leg walking thing fall over.
And used their blasters i thing to get in.
That was a great sequel.
