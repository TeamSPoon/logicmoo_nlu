Can you recommend a good comedy for me to watch tonight?
Sure, what type of comedies do you like?
Funny ones that also have a really good plot, not just slapstick humor.
Those are hard to find.
I know, that's why I wanted your recommendation.
I would recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
What's that about?
A man who dresses as a woman to see his kids once he gets divorced.
Who's the lead actor?
Robin Williams.
Aw, I love him so much!
Me too! I was so sad when he died.
Yeah, I actually cried.
He was so good in the movie "Flubber."
Oh, yes! That was a childhood favorite.
Mine too! I can still remember seeing it in the theaters.
I'm so glad you recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. I'm going to watch it tonight.
Yay! Let me know if you like it!
I will let you know but I'm sure I will because I really love Robin Williams.
Glad I could help!
