When is the next Jurassic Park movie out?
I'm not sure. Have they started filming?
I think so. I read an article about it.
What is it going to be about?
I'm not sure. But I bet it will be exciting.
Is Chris Pratt going to be in it again?
I think he will be.
Good! He was my favorite part of the last one.
I was a big of the dinosaurs.
Yes, those special effects were amazing.
It was one of my favorite movies of the last year.
Did it win any academy awards?
I don't think so.
Why didn't it win any?
They usually don't give action movies like that many awards.
That's a shame. It was great.
Maybe the franchise will win an award after the next movie comes out.
I hope so. They deserve it.
Even if it does not, I am sure it will be a box office success.
I certainly know I'll be going to see it!
