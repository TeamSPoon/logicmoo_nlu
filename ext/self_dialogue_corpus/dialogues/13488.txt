I like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
That is a great movie.
It was intense when Luke finds out VADER is his dad.
And we saw Vader in that chamber thing.
And it put his top on.
It was weird when he had his face mask taken off.
Yes. He looked strange.
Was that the movie that Luke's arm got cut off?
I think so.
I think he got a transplant.
