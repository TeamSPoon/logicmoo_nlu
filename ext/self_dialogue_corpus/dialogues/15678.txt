Have you heard of Shane Owens?
No, what does he sing?
He is an uocoming Country artist.
I like Country I will have to check him out.
You should, especially if you're a fan of traditionalist country.
I am a fan of the old classic country tunes.
His brand new Album is titled Where I'm Coming From.
I will look for it.
Randy Travis also makes a cameo in his video Country Never Goes Out Of Style.
Wow. A country music legend like Randy Travis pairing with him he must be good.
He is, he has been working on his music for years.
I bet he was happy about his debut then.
I would say so, and he has so many good country stars supporting him.
Who would you compare him to?
I would say any of the classics, George Straight, Randy Travis etc.
What is his hit song called?
Country Never Goes Out Of Style.
I am going to pick up the Album.
You will be glad you did.
Yes he sounds like a great artist.
