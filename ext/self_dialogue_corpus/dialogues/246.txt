Did you see the new Wonderwoman yet?
Yeah, I saw last night. You need to see it asap dude.
I know!! God that movie looks so freaking good.
It really is. It was action packed from start to finish. Not a single dull moment.
I'm jealous you already saw it. Gal Gadot looks like she plays a great Wonderwoman.
Oh man she did a fanstastic job. Her acting was beyond excellent.
It's got some WWI scenes in it huh? I saw some war scenes on the trailer.
Yup, the entire film is basically Wonderwoman trying to find the god of war "Aries" in the middle of WWI.
That sounds like a crazy storyline haha!
You have no idea man, I was expecting the film to play out like it did but I was super happy at the end of it.
