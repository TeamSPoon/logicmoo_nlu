What type of music do you like?
Country, hip hop, pop, alternative. You?
Mostly pop. Do you like Christina Aguilera?
I don't know much of her stuff. I know her song Dirty and Beautiful, but that's about it.
She's really good. Her voice is amazing. You should look into her more.
I have always been a fan of Britney Spears. You?
Oh yes, I'm a big Britney Spears fan! Do you have her albums?
I do! I actually have them all, even Glory which is her newest one.
I don't have Glory, but I have Britney Jean, Britney the Remixes, and Circus.
Oh Circus is an awesome album! Have you seen her in concert?
I did years ago, when she first came out. Her Baby One More time album was out.
Oh, she must have opened for someone then. Did she?
Yes, she opened for N'Sync. That's when I saw her.
What do you think of N'Sync?
I like them a lot better than 98 degrees and The Backstreet Boys that's for sure.
You don't like The Backstreet Boys?
Not at all. Too corny for me.
What do you like about N'Sync?
I like Justin Timberlake, I think he's really talented. I like his solo albums, too.
I agree, he's a great musician, actor, everything he touches turns to gold!
