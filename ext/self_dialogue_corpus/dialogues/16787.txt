Do you have satillite radio?
I do. I love it.
Me too. They just got a Beatles channel. Everyone's excited about it.
I'm not a huge Beatles fan actually.
They're OK but I'm not crazy about them. The channel is boring.
Which channels do you like?
I love the one hit wonders one and the covers one.
I like the classic country and bluegrass.
I'm not huge on bluegrass but I need to listen to it more.
We can listen on the way to the store if you want.
OK. I don't know much about the genre so you'll have to fill me in.
I will.
I do enjoy fiddle music a lot.
So do I. It's so beautiful.
The fiddle seems to capture emotion a lot.
I definitely know what you mean.
It can sound sad or happy or anything.
It really can sound sad.
I wish their was a Celtic channel.
That would be great.
