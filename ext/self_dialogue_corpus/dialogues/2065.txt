The preseason is coming up already!
Yeah, might watch a game or two on my big TV.
I heard about that! I'll have to come over for the opener.
San Francisco, I think.
They are beatable! They can't even make up their minds about the quarterback.
You mean they don't still have Capernick?
They shuffled him off over that whole prayer thing.
No, it was the Anthem.
Right. Anyway, the year is looking good.
No doubt. 11-5 for sure.
These are those good times.
I'm a little worried about the playoffs.
Let's just enjoy the regular season for now. Really, man!
If they keep them out of the backfield, everything will be alright.
Yeah, maybe 32 sacks last year.
They should have drafted some O-line.
Those guys are hard to get.
Dallas has no trouble getting them!
Forget Dallas, what about that AFC Championship game last year?
Kind of a massacre.
