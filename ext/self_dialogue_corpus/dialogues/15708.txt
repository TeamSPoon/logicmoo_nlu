Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
I'm not sure, what is that?
It's Korean pop music and it's great!
What are some good bands? I'll have to check it out.
Monsta X, G-Dragon and BTS are really popular right now.
What's your favorite?
Right now, I'd say Monsta X. They have a great sound and good image.
Is their music really catchy?
Oh yes! It's very upbeat and unique, I'd call it fun and exciting.
Cool, I'll definitely check it out sometime. Have you listened to much Metallica?
Oh yeah, I love older Metallica stuff like Battery.
So K-Pop isn't anything like Metallica, is it?
Definitely not! It's kind of like American pop, only with different themes.
To be honest, I don't listen to much American pop, I like metal and rock better.
Yeah, I can understand that. Metal and rock are really intense and have a totally different sound.
That's so true! I probably like older rock the best like Motley Crue and AC/DC.
Yeah, I like that stuff too, since that's what I grew up on. I'd say I like a little bit of everything.
It's nice to have variety in music, that's for sure.
Yeah, every variety of music offers something a little different.
Definitely, you can't listen to the same thing all the time and sometimes you want quieter music instead of louder music.
