I just saw Pontypool. Have you seen it?
I've seen that it's on Netflix, but haven't seen it.
You should check it out.
What's it about?
It's sort of a zombie movie.
Sort of?
The entire movie takes place inside a radio studio and you don't see anything until the end.
Ooh, like War of the World where you just hear the aliens?
Yeah, sort of. But this is new because the virus is spread aurally, instead of a blood infection.
That sounds like it could be either really boring, or awesome.
