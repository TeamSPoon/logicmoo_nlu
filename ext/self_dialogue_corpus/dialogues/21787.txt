you know which movie I just saw on FX?
No, Which one?
It was Interstellar
Oh that was the movie with Matthew McConeghey and Anne Hathaway
Yeah, even though it came out in 2014 I never get tired of that movie
Really? Me too!
Even though I have watched it two times already I was fixed to the screen.
Yes! the movie is so dramatic.. you never know what will happen next.
What was the best part for you of the movie.
I think when the robot contacts him back (Tark) from within the space time continuum and he is able to escape that demension then he returns to earth to meet his daughter.
Yeah that was a very touching moment
I really thought he was going to get back to earth a lot sooner.
I didnt expect him to return to space
Yeah me too. I thought he would be tired by now and just want to relax on the new earth.
I thought the most exciting moment was when they found out that Dr. Mann was a fraud and he was trying to sabotage their mission
Yeah I also felt like the entire mission would be just stopped right there
I was holding my breath because I thought Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) had destroyed the mission
I hope I can watch it again next weekend
Yeah check your cable network.. I think it might be on again
Ok I will buddy! Thanks!
