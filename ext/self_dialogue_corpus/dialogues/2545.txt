So who is your favorite team?
I like the Packers.
Why do you like them?
I like that they are a small market team.
Yeah that is pretty cool.  There are no other professional sports in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Yeah.  I like that they are publicly owned too.
I think they are also the only publicly owned team in the Big 4 sports.
Yeah, the city of Green Bay owns them.  It is pretty cool.
So there is no threat of the team moving to another town.
Yeah.  Hahaha.
A couple of years ago, the owner of the San Diego Chargers tried to sell the team to the city, but the NFL wouldn't let him.
That is interesting.
Yeah.  They can't have cities owning the teams.
If the cities owned the teams, the teams couldn't threaten to leave.
I wonder where NFL will threaten to take teams now that Los Angeles has teams.
I would bet London.
St. Louis would be a good bet too.
Yeah, but the NFL wants a team in London.
It would give it a global reach.
It sure would.  The schedule would be a nightmare for a London team though.
