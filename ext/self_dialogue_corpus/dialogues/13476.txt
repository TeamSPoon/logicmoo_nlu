What do you think Luke has been up to all this time?
I think he pulled a Yoda and went into hiding.
Well, Yoda was disappointed in himself and that's why he went all recluse.
The next movie is called the last Jedi, so maybe he knew he was the last one and wanted to be around to teach the next generation.
"No there is another". Leia could have been a Jedi, right?
Maybe, but she never was a Jedi, she doesn't have any training.
So is the last Jedi Luke? or is it Rey?
I'm not sure, I bet it could go either way, but I imagine it is probably Luke.
Technically Rey isn't a Jedi. At best she would be a youngling or a Padawin.
True, but was Luke ever made a master? Is he even allowed to take a pupil on?
