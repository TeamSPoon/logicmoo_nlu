the Cleveland Indians are really spinning their wheels so far
yeah really, tell me about it
it's like, one day the pitching is good...
but not the hitting, and then the next day they give up a bunch of runs and can't hit!
exactly, it's frustrating!
the bullpen has been tough though
yeah, I think Tito will figure it out going into June
injuries are starting to pile up though
yes, but they're pretty deep still
especially the pitchers
yep. how do you think they'll finish up?
well, nobody in the central is really good either, so probably they'll win the division at least
then it'll all come down to winning playoff series
and now they're battle tested
do you think they can win the AL?
yes, but that's not the question...
yeah, I know, the question is 'can they beat the cubs'?
exactly
and?
they better. :-)
