Were you ever into the Back to the Future movies?
Wow, I loved those!
Which one was your favorite?
I liked the first and the third the most.
Why not the second?
I think the setting was just too dark for me.  I understand that's what they were going for.
It did have it's moments though right?
Oh, yeah.  I loved when they ordered the pizza in the second one.
And the hoverboards were pretty cool right?
Yeah.  I liked when he looked at the sign and saw the Cubs would win the series.
Oh yeah, because the Cubs were horrible back in the eighties.
Right, but they were playing against Miami or against some team that didn't exist.
You like the first one better though?
Yeah, mainly because it was the original.  I also liked the atmosphere of the fifties.
There was a lot of good moments in that one, too.
All of the movies had their moments.
Do you still watch it?
If any of them come on television, I tend to watch bits and pieces.
Do you think they should do a part 4?
Absolutely not.
