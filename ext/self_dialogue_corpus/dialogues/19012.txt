Have you ever seen The Story So Far live before?
I have not. I love their music though.
They're definitely my favorite band. They're great live, too.
What's your favorite CD by them?
Their first one was good, but I think "What you don't see" is a masterpiece.
That CD is really good. I'm actually partial to their self-titled.
I've only listened to that one a couple times.
Yeah, it takes a couple listens but it really grew on me.
What's your favorite track on it?
It's probably "Heavy Gloom".
I'll have to go back and give it another listen.
If you like them, you should check out Four Year Strong.
Four year Strong is awesome.
When they came out, their sound was so original.
Yeah, there weren't too many bands doing that style at the time.
I think Set Your Goals was the only other band in that category.
Yeah, I would say A Day to Remember was a bit similar.
I could see that, A Day to Remember had more heavy parts though.
Yeah definitely. I think their heavier sections were what set them apart.
Those do seem to be the parts that everyone remembers.
