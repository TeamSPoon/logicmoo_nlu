What are your thoughts on the remastering of Episodes 4, 5, and 6?
Well, that's a tough question.  On one hand, it allows Lucas to fulfill his vision of the universe.
How is that the case?
Well, better special effects allows him to make every shot look exactly like he thought.
That sounds like it's a good thing, overall.
It certainly could be, but don't you think that this diminishes from the original work?
How do you figure so?  The original was rife with poor special effects!
That's true!  But somebody on the production team made those special effects.
Ah, so you're claiming that by redoing those effects, you're removing those artist's work from the movies.
Exactly!  And because the original versions aren't also released, save on VHS, we may lose those forever.
