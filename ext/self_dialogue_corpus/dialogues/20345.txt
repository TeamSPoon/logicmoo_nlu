Soo bored today, I think we are gonna go to the movies. Any suggestions?
Hmm... what kind of movies do you like?
I love thrillers and action. Not drama or romance as much.
I saw Fast and Furious 8. I didn't think I would like it, but it was enjoyable.
Is that with the Rock and Vin Diesel.
Yes and Charlize Theron is in it too.
I don't think I have seen any Fast and Furious since the first one. That love scene between Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. OH my.
This one doesn't have any of that. Lot's of cool cars, but soooo unrealistic.
We were also considering Guardians of the Galaxy 2, have you seen that?
No but I heard it is really funny.
Too bad Baby Driver isn't out yet. I would love to see that.
I haven't heard of that one. Who is in it?
Jamie Foxx I think.
Is it a kids movie?
No, it's a thriller. Supposed to be really good.
Oh, hmm. Speaking of the Rock, did you see Baywatch?
No, I thought it looked kind of stupid.
Yeah, probably, but he doesn't wear a shirt for the whole movie soo....
Lol, true, might be worth watching.
We are going later, I'll let you know.
