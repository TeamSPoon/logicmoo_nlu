Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
No. I haven't been able to keep up with them.
Well another one is coming out in December 2017!
Wow. Which episode will this one be.
It's the eighth.
Oh okay. I need to re-watch them all before December!
Yes you do! This one is being Directed and Written by Rian Johnson.
I have never heard of him. Has he directed any of the previous ones?
I don't think so. But I'm not sure.
Well Disney always does a great job with them.
