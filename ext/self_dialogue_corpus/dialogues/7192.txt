Did you enjoy Moana?
I really liked Moana. I liked the animation and the songs a lot.
My favorite scenes in Moana were at the beginning when she's still a baby. That beach scene with the baby turtle was really cute.
I loved that scene! When she flips over the baby turtle and then shields it into the ocean with that big leaf.
I don't hear people talking a lot about Moana but it was a really good Disney movie!
The Rock was really good in it too!
I didn't know the Rock could sing, other than doing silly karaoke singing.
Maui! The Rock was really good as that character. It was a very fun Disney adventure movie.
The animation was fantastic! The ocean looked so realistic.
I liked those little coconut guys. The Kakamora! I thought they were really adorable too but overall fantastic Disney movie.
