What's your favorite Disney film?
I would probably have to say Beauty and the Beast.
That's a good one, but do you mean the live action or the animated one?
Animated.  The live action one was a fine remake and Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle, but I didn't love her singing.
I agree with you.  Disney is really pumping out a lot of live action movies lately.  The CGI was cool in The Jungle Book, I can't wait to see what they do with The Lion King.
I can't image there being a live action version of the Lion King, there aren't even any people in it.
Good point,  Hey, did you hear they're making a new Frozen movie?
No I did not!  I can't imagine what direction they'd be able to take that movie in.
Me either, but I have high hopes for it.
I hope the songs are just as good as the first one.  Let it Go was in my head for at least a year.
