What do you think of Lionel Richie?
I love him! Who doesn't?
I know, he so good.
He's touring in our area soon. We should go see him.
Yes, I'm down to go. I love his music so much.
He's a brilliant songwriter. One of the best ever.
I agree. I like his collaborations a lot too.
I know. When he sings Lady with Kenny Rogers, I get chills.
He wrote that song for Kenny. How cool is that?
I know. And Endless Love with Diana Ross is another favorite.
It's such a beautiful song. And who can forget his time with the Commodores?
Yeah really. I like his solo stuff best though.
Yeah me too. What's your favorite song?
I like most of them, but You Are is a favorite.
That song makes me so happy.
Me too! And Truly is my favorite slow one from him.
I'd love for someone to sing that to me.
Maybe Lionel will at his concert.
One could only wish! He sings it so beautifully.
The lyrics and melody make me want to cry, it's just so good.
