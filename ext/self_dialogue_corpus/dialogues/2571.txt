Hey, how do you think the Eagles are going to do this year?
Honestly, I'm not quite sure. I hope Carson Wentz doesn't experience his sophomore slump.
I don't think he will, after his play last year. He was undefeated through the first four games.
Yeah, but things kinda fell apart after that.
I don't think you can blame the remainder of the season solely on the quarterback.
True, but he does set the tone for the team.
I just hope they beat the Cowboys this year, I'm sick of hearing about Dak and Zeke.
They did do well, but I think others teams will figure them out. They were so one dimensional.
Yeah, I hope our revamped defense is up to the challenge.
I don't see any other team troubling us, except, maybe, the Giants.
Yeah, it's hard to tell what team will show up when we play "Big Blue."
I would love to see them beat New York and Dallas at least once each, or sweep one of them.
If we did, I bet we make the playoffs.
That would be so cool.
Yeah, the City would love it, especially after the way they turned out for the draft this year.
Did you go?
I was there the first night. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Yeah, I hope they do that again. The NFL knows how to throw a party.
Are you planning on going to any games this year?
One for sure. How about you?
