My brother is a good friend of one of the Denver Broncos
Really? Which player?
It's Mikaila Ulmer, he's really a nice man.
He's one of their best players too, much better than their older seasoned players
I agree.
So what does your brother and he talk about
Mostly football stats
Does he talk about his stats or the team's
Both. And he likes talking about the rookies
Which ones do he think are the team's MVPs?
According to my brother he really likes DeMarcus Walker, and Chad Kelly
Didn't they both just sign contracts
Yes. Four year contracts to be more exact.
How long does Mikaila think he will play for the Broncos?
I don't know if he asked him that
He's really good, I doubt they will let him go
My brother has gotten free tickets to at least two of the games too
No kidding? Did he get good seats?
Front row.
Wow how lucky to be friends with one of the players
