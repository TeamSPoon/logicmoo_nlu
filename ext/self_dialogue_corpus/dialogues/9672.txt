Did you see the recent claim by that Rolling Stone writer that Bob Dylan invented hip hop?
Yeah, I did. What did you think about it?
I honestly thought it was really inaccurate. While Dylan's music shares elements with hip hop, lyricism, subject matter, sing-talking, etc., he didn't invent it.
Agreed. Hip-hop has its origins much earlier than Dylan in African-American music.
Yeah, I think it's attributing a little too much to Bob Dylan's influence. The man already has enough recognition.
Right! He just got a Nobel Peace Prize.
Bob Dylan certainly never did anything like an MC before hip-hop. He didn't use samples, he didn't DJ, he didn't strut around the stage like a rapper.
Yeah, the comparison is honestly a little too much for me to handle. It's like the writer who made it doesn't know much about hip hop.
Yeah, he probably just knows some of the bigger artists and seminal records.
Right, and then he just makes connections based on similarities he hears that are historically without basis.
