Did you know less people are watching the NFL?
I am not sure how true that is.
Why do you say that?
A lot of people, myself included are watching via the internet and streaming methods.
Good point. The ratings might not factor that in.
The NFL is also growing in international popularity.
Good point. They are playing games in Europe now.
Don't forget the Canadian Football League.
Oh yes. A lot of former NFL players play in the CFL.
I am surprised Tim Tebow is not playing in the CFL.
He must not be that serious about playing in the NFL.
He is a talented guy. He will do well in baseball and broadcasting.
A lot of high profile college QBs flame out in the NFL.
Very true. Johnny Manziel, Colt McCoy, and Brady Quinn were some others.
Interesting. I think all of them played for the Browns.
The Browns have chewed up and spit out a lot of quarterbacks over the last 15 years.
They are finally focusing on building their defense up.
It will take time.
Everyone has to rebuild their teams every now and then.
The Browns have been rebuilding since the franchise restarted over twenty years ago.
