How excited do you get about the All Star game?
I think its the best in sports
I agree its always compettive
Baseball is such a one on one sport
Yeah the pitcher is always trying to get the hitter out
And the hitter wants to hit a homer off the best
You dont have that lazy play you see in other sports.
They didnt need to make it count in my opinion
Yeah that was the league really messing that up
I am glad they no longer made it have such big implications
I cant believe it took that long for it to happen
Baseball isnt as progressive as we think
I dont know how accurate that is
What makes you say that?
Because they introduced the world to analytics.
I think all the sports would have gotten there eventually.
I think you might be right but may be wrong.
Its tough to say to be honest, I think it could have went either way.
I wish they would get rid of the every team needs a rep rule
Yeah thats a bit stale as well
