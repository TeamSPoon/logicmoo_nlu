Do you have a favorite superhero movie?
Definitely Deadpool.
Me too! That movie was hilarious.
Yea, and the action was great too.
I really loved how he would break the 4th wall and make jokes about themselves.
Yea, like the scene at the Xmen's mansion.
Yea, or how about at the end when he talks to the camera?
Yea, they did the whole Ferris Bueller thing. That was so good.
I can't wait for the next one.
Neither can I, Cable is going to be in it!
