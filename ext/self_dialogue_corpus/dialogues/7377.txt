Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
No, I haven't, but I liked the first three.
I didn't like the fourth one, because Will and Elizabeth weren't in it.
It was the same for me. The first three had very good characters.
Davy Jones and his entire ship were really creepy, though.
That's true, but it made him a good villain.
Barbossa wasn't as creepy, I ended up liking him a lot!
The scenes with all of the pirates fighting together in the third movie were my favorite.
I especially liked that Elizabeth ended up with her own ship during that battle.
She also was the pirate queen!
