Do you know about the Grateful Dead?
I have about them, but I never listened to their music.
They have a huge following, did you know that.
Yes I had heard about the fans.
They have those fans for a reason.
That does make sense.
The reason is largely because they have some of the most intelligent lyrics.
Oh really, I did not know that.
Yes the song writing is perhaps the best in history.
Wow that is quite the endorsement.
Yes I do appreciate their brilliant lyrics.
That is good, I am happy to check them out.
You won't regret it, they are really super special.
Wow I like the sound of that, it sounds deep, and does it sound good?
Yes they have some good sounding songs of course.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
It is their lyrics that really separate them from every other musical group.
Wow that is interesting.
Yes, when we listen to them, it may enrich our souls.
That sounds good, thank you for telling me.
