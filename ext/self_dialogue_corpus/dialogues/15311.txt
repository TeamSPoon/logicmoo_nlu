What have you been listening to lately?
I've been on a bluegrass kick, so I've really been listening to Greensky BlueGrass almost everyday.
Didn't we see them at the Bluegrass Festival a few months ago?
We did! I really like their take on bluegrass.
Their musical composition and arrangement is not structured like most bluegrass songs which gives it a unique feel.
Honestly, I wasn't sure I was even going to like bluegrass, so I'm really glad we met.
A lot of people don't really understand what bluegrass music is until they hear it.
I'm definitely one of those people, I always thought bluegrass was just country music.
You stop right there. Blue grass is miles away from country music.
Well, now I can see that, but before I really just didn't know.
That's why I like Greensky, they make it very approachable for non-bluegrass types.
I would love to hear more from them.
You should look them up on YouTube. They have a lot of good videos up there.
Do they have a lot of songs out? More than we heard at the show?
They do! They also have some great covers of songs that you can't imagine being bluegrass.
What songs do they cover?
My favorite cover that they do is Pink Floyd's "Time/Breath in the air (reprise)."
You're right, I certainly can't picture Pink Floyd as blue grass!
Give it a shot! I bet you'll like it.
I will. Thanks!
