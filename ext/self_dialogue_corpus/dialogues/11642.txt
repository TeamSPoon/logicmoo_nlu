Have you ever wondered what the song I Am the Walrus is about?
Yeah, I once heard that John Lennon wrote down a bunch of silly phrases and stuck them in a hat. He used those to write his song.
John Lennon seemed to write a lot of really strange songs, like Lucy in the Sky with Diamond.
Lucy in the Sky with Diamond was supposed to be based off a drawing his son Julian made.
I think John Lennon's songs are the best.
I really like George Harrison's songs, especially While My Guitar Gently Weeps.
You know who didn't write very many songs? Ringo.
Ringo didn't sing in many of the songs either.
Did you know that Ringo is left handed?
Paul McCartney was left handed too.
