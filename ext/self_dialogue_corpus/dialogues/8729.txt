Did you ever listen to KISS?
Not much, they were kind of strange.
They dressed weird, but they had some great songs.
Who was the one with the long tongue?
That was Gene Simmons, he is a pretty cool guy. I seen him on some reality show awhile back.
What were some of their songs, maybe I'll recognize one.
Rock n Roll All Night and Party Everyday, and Beth
They both sound familiar, name another one.
Love Gun. They made more money on their costume and get ups than anything.
That's what I heard but they made bucks!
