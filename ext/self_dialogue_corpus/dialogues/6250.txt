Are you excited for Cars 3?
Not really. I am not a fan of the first two. You?
What, you are kidding me! The Cars movies are so fun!
I'm not really sure, they just didn't pique my interest. I have heard Cars 3 is better than the second one though.
I think it has a chance to even be the best, from what I've heard.
I will probably see it when it comes to video. Are you going to see it in the theater?
I will definitely go to the theater. I might even wear Mickey ears!
Haha, you are so silly. Who is your favorite character?
Mater! He makes me laugh.
I don't get Mater. I just don't think he's funny.
