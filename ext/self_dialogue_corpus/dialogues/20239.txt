Such a shame the movies i loved were never that good
I mean is that mostly the case
Huh
Well we always recall things better than they were
I guess possibly
Just gotta take them for face value
How
Like enjoy it for what it is
I know just let down is all
How are you let down
Well the spy kids movies arent as good as i thought they were as a kid
That is part of life
I guess
Nah it is
I tried watching them and well
Well?
The acting was stilted and the effects
Were they bad
The effects looked so fake
But that does not make it bad
