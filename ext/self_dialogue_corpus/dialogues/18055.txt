Who is your favorite band at the moment?
I have to say Nothing.
Is that a band?
Yeah. That's their name - Nothing.
Oh. haha. What kind of music do they play?
They're an awesome post punk band.
Just post punk? Or other genres as well?
They have some  shoegaze elements.
Nice. I need to check them out.
You should. Tell me what you think.
Will do. Any good place to start with them?
I say their recent record "Tired of Tomorrow"
Awesome. How does it relate to their older stuff?
It's a little more accesible, but not too bad.
Nice. I'll listen to it when I get home today.
Awesome. It's still a little bit heavier.
I like heavy music. So this is good.
Yeah, it's a nice release sometimes.
A positive release at that.
This is true.
