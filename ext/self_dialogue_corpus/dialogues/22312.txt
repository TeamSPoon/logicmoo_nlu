Is movies good?
Yes I love them.
Who is your favorite actress?
Melissa mccarthy, all her movies are hilarious.
Yes they are, I just saw the boss the other day.
That one was funny, my favorite part was when the sofa bed threw her into the wall.
That part was great, I laughed so hard.
My favorite movie, was probably the heat
That one was really good, her and Sandra bullock make the perfect pair
Their personalities match perfectly.
They do, they should make another movie together
They should, it would be a top selling movie.
I like Jennifer aniston
Shes a great actress too
I loved the break up, and along came polly
Those were funny movies, and the bounty hunter was great too.
I love that one
She has a lot of movies out
I think I've seen most of them
Me too.
