Toy Story was a good movie did you like it
I did like it, I like the idea behind it
the toys coming alive and having feelings was neat
it was who did you like?
I like the potato heads the most
they were funny , like when they lost their noses and mouths
I know that part was really funny
can you imagine if they were real and kids could change them like that
I know that would be wild !
Buzzlightyear was a cool guy, I bet he was an expensive toy
