What did you wear to the party last night?
I wore my leggings with a tank top and my black jacket.
I love your black jacket. Who makes it?
Thanks! It's Michael Kors actually.
Where did you get it?
I bought it a couple years ago at Macy's. It was pretty expensive. Do you like Muchael Kors?
I do. I love his line.
I also have a beautiful gold sequin shirt from his line.
I bet it's gorgeous. Where do you wear it?
I was going to wear it to a bar or club but I haven't had the chance yet.
Do you ever wear dresses out at night?
Sometimes, I have some beautiful mid calf length dresses that work well at night. What about you?
I prefer jeans or pants at night. I usually like a nice pair of dark jeans made by seven jeans or Paige brand.
I love those brands too. I like the length on them since I'm kind of tall.
Have you ever tried true religion jeans?
Yes, I like the length on them but they are most hip huggers and I like high waisted jeans a little better.
I know what you mean. I don't like hip hugger jeans that much but I like the larger pocket on true religion jeans.
Ya I like that they are funkier than the average jeans brand.
Me too. I like a lot of their washes.
Me too. They have some beautiful light blue washes.
