Do you have any good stories?
I have a football story.
I love football.
Well, this is a sad football story.
Why?
Well, it is about the year I moved from Buffalo, NY to east Texas.
Let me guess...Bills fan?
YOu got it. I moved to Texas the first year the Cowboys played the Bills for the first time in the Superbowl.
That must have been really something!
You're telling me!  I moved from the shadow of Rich Stadium, in Orchard Park, NY, where a Buffalo Bills sweatshirt is considered a thing of beauty, to east Texas, where a Bills sweatshirt was considered a practice target for gun holders.
Fun.
My fun started when the Bills made it to the playoffs, and played Houston in the first round. If you weren't a Cowboys fan, then you were an OIlers fan.
That's right! That was the year of The Comeback!
That's right! The Bills overcame a 32-point deficit to defeat the Oilers in overtime!
That was a good game!
I never saw it because the game was blacked out where I was living!  So, after that game, I was a Bills fan in the Lonestar state...with a target on my back!
And then?
Then, somehow the BIlls made it to the Superbowl, only to face the other Texas team, the Cowboys.
No!
Yes.  And when the Cowboys crushed the Bills, every Texan in a 100-mile radius of where I was living felt that it was their personnal obligation to rub it in my face!
