I can't wait for football to start this year.
Last years Superbowl was crazy.
I still can't believe the Patriots pulled it out.
I know that was insane.
I tried not to lose faith during the game.
Me too but it was really hard.
My boyfriend stayed confident the whole time, he knew they were going to win.
One of the biggest comebacks ever.
I really love watching Brady.
Me too he is literally amazing.
I have tickets to some preseason games at Gillette.
Wow thats great.
You should join me, they are really fun.
I would love to go.
I'm also going to see a Dallas Cowboys games, one of my friends is a huge fan.
I've heard that stadium is amazing.
I don't really like the Cowboys but it sounds like a fun experience.
That would be a great trip.
I also enjoy going to watch the Patriots in Baltimore it's such an easy trip from Boston.
They also have a beautiful stadium.
