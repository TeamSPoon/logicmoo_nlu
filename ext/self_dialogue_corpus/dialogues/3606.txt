Are you familiar with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
Yes, it's one of my all time favorite horror films.
Do you think it is the best?
No, but it is in the top ten for sure.
What about part 2?
I love part 2 as well. It's way different though.
How is that?
Part 2 is more of a cult movie and part 1 is much scarier.
Yes, that scene with the hook is really frightening.
I agree. That movie seemed so realistic.
