Do you like the Bears?
Sure, I do.
Who is your favorite defense player?
Adrian Amos is my favorite Bears player on defense.
What ever happened to Cutler?
He got injured and release from the Bears.
I like Grossman, he got us to the Superbowl in 2007.
Yeah, that's true,
Too bad he just couldn't get going after that.
Yes, I agree with that.
Some people just are lucky enough to keep winning and some aren't.
Yeah, that's just part of the game, I guess.
Its tough to get a ball down the field when you have a pack of five to ten 300 plus pounders going after you.
Yeah, its a tough job, quarterbacking.
I like the tailgating at the games.
Yeah, me to those are nice to go to.
I like to tailgate whenever I can.
Yeah, its the best way you can support your team.
I get tired of watching because my teams never make it.
Then you need to get on the bandwagon with the Patriots!
