Who is your favorite Disney Princess?
Hm, I'd say it's a close call between Mulan and Pocahontas.
Neither of those are princesses!
Pocahontas was a chief's daughter and Mulan can be a princess if she wanted to because she saved all of China.
I guess that's true.
I think I'm going to say Mulan, since most of Pocahontas' story isn't historically accurate.
We're talking about historical accuracy in Disney Princesses?
Mulan was based off a Chinese poem, Pocahontas is an important historical character. There's more leeway for fiction than actual historic events!
Fine, fine, I almost regret I asked. My favorite is Rapunzel.
Haha, is that because you're blonde like lizards?
