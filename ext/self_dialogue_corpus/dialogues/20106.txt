What do you think Adam Sandler is up to?
Making a bad movie for Netflix.
Why do you say that?
He hasnt done anything thats been funny lately.
I suppose, what were your favorite films by him?
I loved Billy Madison.
Yeah that was great, he peaked in those years.
He stopped being that kind of guy and tried to mature.
Well they dont all wanna do slapstick comedy their entire lives.
His wasnt slapstick it was just funny.
I loved Happy Gilmore.
Oh that was great too, showcased his talents.
How do you feel about Big Daddy?
That was a good film and signaled his end.
You could see him be a bit more serious in that role but not overtly.
Yeah he mixed it up and by the time it was over he went full on.
Little Nicky wasnt serious.
It was not but it was bad as well.
I dont know what happened to the guy.
It happens to all comedians, Seth Rogen hasnt done anything funny lately either.
