What was the last thriller movie you've seen?
I just finished Fracture. It was a great movie.
I don't think I have heard of Fracture. What is it about?
It's about an attorney who is about to get a high paying job but first has to defend a guy charged with murder.
Sounds interesting.
It stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.
Is Ryan the murderer?
No, he plays the young attorney. It has some great twists in it.
I will have to watch it.
You can buy it on Amazon.
