Did I ever tell you about seeing Dumbo as a kid.
No, what happened.
Well, we went to the drive inn.  I was 9 and my brother was 7.
Sounds like fun, love Drive Ins
So me and my brother were on top of the station wagon and I noticed he was gone.
Where did he go?
So, I get down and hear crying.
Did he fall?
No, he was so upset that they took Dumbo's mother that he broke down in tears and ran to my mom.
Ah, that's cute.
