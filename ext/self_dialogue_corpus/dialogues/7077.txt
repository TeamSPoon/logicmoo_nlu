So, are you into Disney movies?
I love almost all of them!
Really, me too. What's you favorite from the classics?
Well, Peter pan has always been my favorite. Disney created an amazing world with that one.
I agree, neverland world seems just too amazing!
I know, i mean, who would ever wanted to grow up if we had the chance.
And don't forget about Tinkerbell, she's the magical character in the movie.
Did you like the second part of the movie? Peter pan 2?
I think i liked that one even more than the first one.
It was great, but definitely the first one has my heart!
