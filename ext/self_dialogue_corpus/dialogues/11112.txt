That's right! I absolutely loved the flared look and think it was very fitting for her body type.
Right, along with her simple yet stunning necklace and shoes that might have been my favorite look!
Oh those shoes were gorgeous!  Do you remember what designer they were from?
I'm not sure, I don't really remember other than it looked great!
Agreed.  I also loved her partner's look also.  It was a perfect compliment to the dress.
Could you imagine how long it took for them to get ready?  Or how many outfits they had to look at before they decided on, "the one?"
I couldn't even imagine.  How fun would that be?
Right.  Black is such a nice, elegant color for a red carpet occasion, how could you go wrong?
Kate Hudson's Giorgio Armani suit was also stunning and such an eye catcher.
Totally agree.  Her simple hair style complimented it in such a way.  It was simple yet so gorgeous.
I don't know how she can pull of a suit like that, but I wish I could!
Haha.  Right?  The details were so ornate.
Her shoes also complimented the outfit.  Simple tan.  How does she walk in those?
No clue.  But after standing on the red carpet for a couple hours I bet she was ready to take them off.
If I were to wear a gorgeous Armani suit with those shoes and looked as good as she did, I don't think I'd ever take the outfit off.
Totally agree.  It actually looked pretty comfortable.  More comfortable than wearing a super tight dress or something that barely covers the body.
Jennifer Aniston always looks so timeless on the red carpet too.
Yes!  She never has a bad look. Always so elegant, confident, and beautiful
I feel like Jennifer could walk down the red carpet in jeans and a T shirt and everyone would still love the look.
Haha.  Seriously though.  I need some fashion advice from her.
