I just saw Pee Wee Hermna's Big Adventure -- have you seen it?
Yes, that is one of my favorite movies!
What is your favorite part?
Hm, there are so many good parts. The Large Marge incident might be my favorite part.
Yeah that part was really funny.
What's your favorite part?
The scene where he wears those platform shoes and dances on the bar.
That's hilarious! Such a great movie. Did you know that the creator is Tim Burton?
Yes, I am a huge Tim Burton fan.
What's your favorite Tim Burton movie?
I really like Big Fish, I think because I like weird and whimsical stories. What about you?
Edward Scissorhands is my favorite.
Ah yes. That is a classic.
That reminds me, I also really liked Beetlejuice.
Yeah that came out when I was a kid, I was too young to get it. Isn't Winona Ryder in that one too?
Yes, and Alec Baldwin and other people I can't remember.
It's funny that Tim Burton has done these kind of quirky films and then really mainstream ones like Batman.
Yeah. His movies tend to veer towards the morbid though, which I like.
Yeah, like Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd. He seems to really use Johnny Depp as his muse.
Yeah, Johnny Depp is also in his Willie Wonka film adaptation.
