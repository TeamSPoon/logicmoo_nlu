Do you think Bruce Springsteen will put out a new album?
I think he will but I'm sure he's enjoying just touring and relaxing.
True, I just love hearing new stuff from him and seeing where his head is at.
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of High Hopes though.
Agreed, though that was more of a collection of covers and random songs.
Wrecking Ball on the other hand though, wow what an amazing record.
Wrecking Ball is one of his best outputs ever, which is awesome considering how late it came in his career.
Truly a masterpiece, especially after the weaker Working On A Dream.
Yeah Working On A Dream was pretty soft and weak.
But I think in contrast and in recession to Wrecking Ball, it's almost perfect.
