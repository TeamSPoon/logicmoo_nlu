Which droid from Star Wars is your favorite?
I personally love K-2SO from Rogue One.
Even more than R2-D2 and C-3PO?
I know he's newer, and dead now, but K-2SO has the best personality.
What about B-B8?
He's cool too, and is probably my second favorite.
I'd say B-B8 is my favorite.
I'm excited to see him in the new movie in December.
Yeah, the trailer for that looks amazing!
I know, I can't wait to see Luke Skywalker training Rey.
