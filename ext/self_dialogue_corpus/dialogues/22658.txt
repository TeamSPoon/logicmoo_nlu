Have you seen Jurassic World?
Yeah, it was just ok.
Yeah I know.  Still kind of fun though.
The best parts were them acknowledging the original Jurassic park.
Which was an epic movie.
They would have been better sticking with T-Rex.
I think so too.  This half raptor thing was kind of over played.
Chris Pratt was really good though.
He was, he plays an awesome action hero.
Yeah he does.  He was really good in Guardians of the Galaxy.
That movie was hilarious.
It was.  I need to see the second one.
It was really good.  I won't spoil it for you.
Thanks, I hope he's in more action soon.
Well now that he's super fit he will be.
Like that movie with Jennifer Lawerence.
Yeah, I heard that was a little silly though.
Either way.  I like him and he's getting work.
Yeah me too.  He was the best part of that movie.
Especially how he said he's the alpha.
