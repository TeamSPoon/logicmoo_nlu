Do you know how many times they've made a King Kong movie?
I can think of at least 3.
What are the ones you can think of?
There was the original old-school one made in the 30s, the Naomi Watts one, and then one I didn't see that took place entirely on the island.
The one with John C. Reilly?
That's the one!
It's kind of amazing that they've done the story as much as they have.
I guess people enjoy a movie with a giant Ape!
The crazy thing is that there have actually been 8 King Kong movies.
Whoa, I had no idea!
Yeah, there was a sequel to King Kong that they made in the 1930s, and then some various Kong movies in the 60s through 80s.
Oh yeah! There was the movie where King Kong fights Godzilla.
Yep, that was made in the 1960s.
I guess I underestimated how often movie makers have gone back to well with that story.
It's obviously served them well financially, if they keep making movies on the topic.
The funny thing is that for me, I don't even find the concept that cool.
I'm not super excited to see a random King Kong movie, but I've found them to be kind of fun.
There is something surreal and entertaining to see an ape the size of a building fight a dinosaur.
Exactly!
Well, here's to another 8 King Kong movies in the future!
