We watched two Lethal Weapon movies this weekend.
A blast from the past.
Yes, comedy and lots of action.
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were great in those movies.
They were. Can't picture any other actors being in those movies.
They were so young.
Joe Pesci was funny in the second one.
He was a cooky character.
They should make one in the current day.
They should. It would still be a good movie.
