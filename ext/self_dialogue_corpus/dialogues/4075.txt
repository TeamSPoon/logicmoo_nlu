Did you ever see Memento?
A few years ago.  Why do you ask?
I'm just a bit confused by it.
I think everyone was confused by it.  What part in particular?
The ending.  So the whole movie was really in reverse?
Kind of.  It kind of progressed and went backwards all at once.
I feel like I need some sort of graph or something showing what's happening and when.
I think it did make the film more interesting though.
True.  If it would have been chronological, wouldn't have had the same impact.
Exactly.  Was definitely an interesting experience.
