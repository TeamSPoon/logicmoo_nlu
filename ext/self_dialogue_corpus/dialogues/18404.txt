I've been listening to the Siriux XM Lithium channel lately.
Really?  That's alternative music, right?
Yes, it has brought back a lot of memories for me and reminded me of the great bands that came from the West Coast.
What bands do they play?
Bush, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Green Day, tons more.
Green Day!  I haven't heard them in a while
Yes, not since the Woodstock mudfest, but listening to the music made me miss them!
I love the song Longview, he sounds like he has an English accent.
Who?  Billie Joe Armstrong?  He's not English.
I know, I remember they came out of California, but to me, he sounds English.
I think they might just be putting on that accent to sound more punky/new wavish.
Yes, there are other songs that sound English as well.  Does the channel play songs by Bush?
Of course they do!  I still think Sixteen Stone is their best album, I heard Everything Zen yesterday on the radio.
I love that song, when was Sixteen Stone released?
It came out in late 1994.
Does the Lithium channel play Stone Temple Pilots?
Oh yeah.  You know, I really miss the lead singer, Scott Weiland.
His voice was so awesome on the song Plush, such a strong voice yet so smooth.
Dead and Bloated is a crazy good song by them as well.
Yes, it is dark but so loud and in your face.  STP was a fabulous band for sure.
