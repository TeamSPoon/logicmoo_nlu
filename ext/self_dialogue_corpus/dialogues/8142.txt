How do you like Marina and the Diamonds?
I like her a lot.
Me too. I find I relate to a lot of her music.
Same. What's your favorite song of hers?
Probably Scab and Plaster.
Oh that's a good one!
Do you have a favorite?
I need to listen to her newest album to make a decision.
Oh yeah I need to listen to that too.
But I really like her song Bubblegum Bitch
