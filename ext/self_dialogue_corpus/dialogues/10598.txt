I love the Fast and Furious movies.
Why? It's mindless garbage.
I think it's fun and enjoy the action.
I think it's made for idiots. I don't get the appeal.
It's supposed to be ridiculous. It's over the top and the corny dialogue makes it even better.
The only reason I'd watch it is because Ludacris is in it.
Yeah, he's great in all of them. I think they're all worth watching besides Tokyo Drift.
Maybe one day if I catch one of the movies on TV...
I highly recommend 2 Fast 2 Furious. That's the funniest one by far.
I'll remember that, but don't get your hopes up.
