Have you ever heard of Ricky Garcia?
No, who is that?
He's in a boy band called Forever in your Mind.
Really? Interesting. Tell me more.
Well, i accidentally discovered him on a TV Show called Best Friends Whenever. He was a neighbor boy who hung around.
Ha ha, cool.
He did a couple of songs on the show so i looked him up and found out he was in a group.
Very cool. How long has he been singing?
Since 2014. He and another kid appeared on X-Factor.
Really? that must have been exciting for them.
It was. Simon Cowell asked them to remain on the show
No way! What happened next?
Well, they wound up forming the band they are in now, Forever in your Mind.
That's incredible.
Yes, then Disney picked them up and they started doing songs for Disney shows and movies.
Right on, and they are still performing?
Yes, Ricky was doing his TV show up until the end of this year and Disney is working on doing a TV show for the whole group.
Well, sounds like Ricky is doing quite well.
Yes, and if he doesnt continue singing he can always fall back on acting.
Lucky for him he is multitalented.
