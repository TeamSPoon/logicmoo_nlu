I think people forget Old Yeller was a disney movie
Well I think it was originally a book
Yeah they adapted it onto the big screen
What a sad story though
He was a good dog
Who starred in that film?
Fess Parker I guess would be the biggest star
Yeah I know it was on older film.
The scene where they have to take him out is so sad.
It was the ultimate heart strings pull
