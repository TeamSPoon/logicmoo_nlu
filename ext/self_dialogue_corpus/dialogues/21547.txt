I'm a huge fan of Greta Gerwig.
So am I! What are your favorite Greta movies?
I think my favorites are Mistress America and Frances Ha.
Frances Ha is definitely my favorite movie of hers. She's so witty and her improvisation is outstanding.
I really enjoy that about her plus she always plays such a lovable character.
She's always the free spirit and so optimistic. It simply makes you feel good watching.
I agree. I also caught her recently in 20th Century Women which was a fantastic movie by the way.
I haven't seen that yet, but is that also the one with Elle Fanning and Annette Bening?
Such a good movie! Yes they're also in that along with Greta. It's basically about three generations of women in the same household raising this boy.
Did Greta's performance blow you away like in her previous movies?
She was terrific! I forgot to mention Billy Crudup is also in there. He lives in the house with them too.
He's a terrific actor. I still remember his performance from Big Fish as well as Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen.
Yeah 20th Century Women is a terrific film. I have to thank Greta's presence for bringing it to my attention.
I'll check it out. Now I'm tempted to watch Mistress America and Frances Ha again.
Mistress America was number two for me. I really like Lola Kirke. She's so underrated.
She was awesome in Mistress America opposite Greta. They had such good chemistry.
Lola's hasn't failed me either in any of her movies, but I think she needs to do more work with Greta, the banter they pull off is spectacular.
I haven't seen any other movies with Lola but I did really like her in Mistress America too as the struggling college student looking to find herself.
I think I'll throw on a few of those movies later on tonight.
I'll try to look for 20th Century Women!
