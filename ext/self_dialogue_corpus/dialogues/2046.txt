Who do you think is the best QB in football?
It has to be Brady right?
I mean I don't think anyone is wrong for saying that, but man its hard not to take Aaron Rodgers.
But Brady has 5 rings?
Well, if it wasn't for a terrible defensive collapses, Rodgers could easily have 3 or 4 himself.
Come on, you could say the same thing about Brady!
I mean I guess, but back to the topic - Rodgers or Brady for just this season.
While if you're asking it that way, probably Rodgers then.
Yup. Totally. He's clearly on another level.
I guess. I really hope the Packers can put together a respectable defense with him.
Well, how about this - wouldn't you love to see a Brady and Rodgers Super Bowl before Brady retires.
Oh my god yes. It would be legendary. It would probably be the best QB matchup in Super Bowl History.
Hmmm. What would even some comparable matchups be?
Well, Kurt Warner-Roethlisberger was good. Brady-Eli happened a few times.
Favre-Elway back in 97 was pretty darn good.
Oh yeah. That one will be tough to top.
What about Trent Dilfer and Kerry Collins back in 2001?
Bahhahhaa. Good one!
Yeah that is probably the worst ever.
Yeah that was probably one of the first super bowls I vividly remember.
