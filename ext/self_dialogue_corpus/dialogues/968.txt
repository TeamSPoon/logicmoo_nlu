Only a little over a month before the NFL season starts. Are you excited?
I am so excited. It seems like a really long time since the season ended.
I know. I'm even looking forward to the pre-season games which are always bad.
Ha ha! I know what you mean. I'll be watching pre-season also.
Who do you think is going to be really improved this year?
I really don't know. It sounds the the KC Chiefs are looking strong and maybe the Houston Texans since they got rid of Osweiler.
Oh I forgot about Osweiler. I wonder what he's doing now.
He's competing for a starting position with the Cleveland Browns.
That's right. The Texans traded him and lost big bucks.
Yes, and now the Browns are paying big bucks for a random quarterback.
I wonder why they traded for him. He was so lousy last year.
Because he came with a second round draft pick. I read that the Browns wanted the second rounder and Osweiler was just thrown in as an extra.
Yes but why would they want to keep him.
They put him on the market but no one was interested so they kept him on to see how he played before pre-season starts. They have to pay him so they may as well see what he can do.
Hopefully this will teach him some humility.
Yeah, that was his biggest problem. He thought he was better than what he was. People learn so he can too.
Do they still have Robert Griffin III? He's gone, isn't he?
Yes, they released him. I'm not sure if anyone picked him up. He's been hurt so much during his career, it's probably over.
That's too bad. Of him and Andrew Luck, I liked RG3 better.
Same here. I hope he heals up and plays again.
