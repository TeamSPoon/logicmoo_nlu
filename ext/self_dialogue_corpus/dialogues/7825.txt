So who is your favorite character from the Harry Potter movies?
Oh gosh, I don't know. There are so many!
But if you had to choose just one, who would it be?
This may be unusual, but I like Snape.
Well, that is different. Why him?
He sacrificed so much in order to help people.
And he got little to no recognition or thanks.
Exactly, he is such a great character that way.
It is funny because you hate him for almost all of the movies until the very end.
That is why he is the best character.
