I just recently watched Mad Max again.
I love that movie!
Just out of curiosity I read some about it online, and it was fascinating.
Really? Like how?
Well they had a very small budget. They even used an actual biker gang and paid them in beer instead of hiring actors.
That's hilarious.
Yeah, and the bikers had to ride to the set everyday in their costumes, and with their prop weapons, and they were given a letter from the director explaining things if they were stopped by the cops.
That's funny, like a Get Out Of Jail Free card.
That's exactly what the cast started jokingly calling it.
What else did you learn?
They had such a small budget that of all the leather-clad cops, only Goose was wearing real leather and everyone else was wearing cheap faux leather.
I never noticed that.
If you rewatch it, look at their knees. The cheap fabric would frequently rip out so you can see lots of knees or repaired knees.
What else? This is interesting.
They had such a small budget that they didn't have roads closed for filming, they just closed them themselves to film - illegally.
Did they get in trouble?
The police caught on, probably from stopping bikers, and they were nice about helping them close roads to film.
That's cool.
And I had forgotten about the big, tough-looking bald cop being named Fifi.
That's awesome!
