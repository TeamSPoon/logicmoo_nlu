So, what did you think about the last Harry Potter movie?
It was very good, I was sad for the whole movie set to be over though.
I know the feeling, it's so easy to get emotionally involved in all of the movies!
At least I have the whole set now and can rewatch them when I want.
So jealous! I've been wanting to get my hands on the movies set, myself.
You can order it online like I did. You won't regret it.
I'll have to do that. So what was your favorite character throughout the whole film.
I honestly loved Dumbledore more than any of the characters, he was so wise and kind (most of the time).
He was one of my favorite too, but I loved Harry Potter, personally.
Yeah, I was just so sad when Dumbledore died...
