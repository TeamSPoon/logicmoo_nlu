Did you hear that there is a new Doom track coming out?
An actual new song or just reusing his old beats?
Supposedly it is Doom and Jay Electronica.
I think there was a track that was leaked last year with them two.
It is actually a different song from what I hear.
You mean they did two different songs together?
Yea, the one you are talking about is called Light Years.
Yea, that is the one.
I think the new one is a different track.
Well, hopefully it is good.
Neither one of them have put anything out in so long.
Yea, especially Doom.  He just keeps re releasing old albums.
Yea, what was his last album, Born Like This?
There was JJ Doom after that.
Oh right, I did not like that one too much.
I thought it was fine but neither were that great.
Nothing will stand up to the old stuff like Madvillainy.
That and also Operation Doomsday.
He used to be so prolific and great.
Yea, it is unfortunate he has really slowed down.
