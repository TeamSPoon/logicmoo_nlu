Who is your favorite NFL player?
Of all time or currently?
How about of all time?
I would say Lawerence Taylor from the New York Giants.
Why do you like him?
I love the way he played.  He was vicious.
Taylor is said to have been a game changer.
He made the linebacker position more of a complete position.
Who is your current favorite player?
I like watching Le'Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Why him?
I like the way he waits for the hole to open in the line before he runs through it.
He does have a strange running style.
It works really well for him, but not for most running backs.
I don't think I have a favorite player anymore.
What are you talking about?! You have like 3 Tom Brady jersey's.
I guess that if fair.
As I get older I like the team more than a single player anymore.
I understand that.  You see so many players over a lifetime.
Yeah and after a while they start to blend together.
