Did you see that new Cars movie? From what I heard it is pretty awesome.
Yes, we have watched all three now. It is actually one of a few animated pictures that has three parts to it.
How was it?
My daughter liked it a lot. Especially, that new character Cruz Ramirez.
What is that character?
It is a mechanic car that helps the main character, McQueen, to train for the race.
OK, don't spoil it for me. I think I am going to watch together with my family.
It is a great movie, I would go for a part four if they decide to shoot it.
Yeah, I will order it on demand tonight. Thanks, buddy!
You are welcome! Enjoy your movie tonight!
