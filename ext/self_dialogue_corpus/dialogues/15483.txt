So what if you could only pick ten albums for the desert island -- what would they be?
Geez, that's always hard, but I have some that are always on the list!
Like what?
Like Crimson's "In the Court of the Crimson King."
Oh, yeah, that's totally on my list, too.  That an Eno's "Another Green World."
I completely agree.  His vocal music is totally overlooked for the ambient music.
Yeah, and now that he's singing again, he makes it worse! His early vocal albums were so good, and he's so awful now!
I agree. It's like Beefheart had the same problem. His music just couldn't get appreciated sufficiently to keep him going with it.
I know. He said he'd give up after Ice Cream for Crow if it didn't sell well, and he did.
What's your favorite Beefheart?
Mmmmmmm, I don't know.  I love Troutmask, Shiny Beast, Doc, and Ice Cream for Crow.
Me, too. I keep going back to Troutmask Replica, though. I think it must be my favorite.
I think whichever I'm listening to at the time is my favorite!!
Speaking of Beefheart, did you ever hear the GTOs album? I forget exactly what's it's called -- something like Totally Deranged, but it's not that at all.
Permanent Damage.  It's great!!!
Isn't it totally insane?  I love the one about the gym teacher.
So do I!  And how about "Bart Baker, you're a heart breaker!"
He just screams, "Brian Jones!"
That kills me.
Me, too.  I absolutely love it.
