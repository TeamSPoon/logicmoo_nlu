Do you like older or newer Disney movies?
I am a fan of older movies.
Me too.
I like the Lion King.
That is a great movie.
I watched it quite a bit as a young kid.
I think the movies from that time were better than what they make today.
They make some good stuff today but I really liked the older ones.
Lion King teaches some great values.
Yes it does.
