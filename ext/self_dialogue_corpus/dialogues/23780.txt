Did you like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard more?
Die Hard, hands down.
Now that they've done the recent sequels, I'm not sure if I agree with you.
Okay, fair. Die Hard only up to With A Vengeance.
Is that the one with Samuel L. Jackson?
Yep. It was my favorite one of them, too.
Really! I never got around to seeing it.
Dude, you have to check it out.
Is it just because Samuel L. Jackson's awesome?
No... I mean yeah, but mainly it's just fun watching the two of them act off each other.
Bruce Willis and Sam L. Jackson had a good dynamic?
A really awesome dynamic. So much great humor. Also, the bad guy is awesome.
That's good. I didn't think the Russian bad guys in the second one were very good.
Yeah, it was a little hackneyed. This one is much more like the first.
Oh with Hans Gruber?
Yeah. I won't give anything more away, though.
That's cryptic, haha. Okay, though.
And also the action pacing of it is fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
Okay, okay, I get it. I'll pick it up soon.
You should call me when you do. I'll totally watch it with you now that I'm thinking about it so much, haha.
