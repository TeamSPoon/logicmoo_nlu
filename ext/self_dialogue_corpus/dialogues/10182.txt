Have you seen John Wick 2 yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like an action movie.  Did you like it?
I have not seen it, but plan on going to see it.  I liked the first movie quite a bit.
Who plays in it?
Keanu Reeves, Ruby Rose, Ian McShane to name a few.
Is this one as detailed as the first movie?
Retired super-assassin John Wick's plans to resume a quiet civilian life are cut short!
No doubt, John Wick will probably always be in that business!
I heard it was action packed, and full of violence.
We should go see it!
