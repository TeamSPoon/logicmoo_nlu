Did you like Rogue One?
I thought it was exceptional.
Me too.
I like how they do the back story on the Rebels getting the Death Star plans.
I thing that a smart move by Disney.
They're going to milk this sacred cow for all it's worth.
It's working for them.
They're making money hand over fist.
I think The Force Awakens was the highest grossing film in history.
Wouldn't suprise me.
