Hey Jack, what's up
Oh, hi Ellen. How's it going?
Good. What are you doing there?
I'm writing a movie review.
Really? What for?
My new job.
Oh, right...I heard you were looking. Congrats on the new job.
Yeah, thanks, but I'm begining to think I made a mistake.
What do you mean?
Well, the job requires I watch varoius, pre-selected movies, and then provide a detailed review.
What's wrong with that? You love movies!
Yeah, I know I love movies...
And you are an oustanding writer...with great experience...job recommendations from some of the biggest names in Hollywood...and a vocabulary like nobody's business.
Well, thanks, but...
And you're a pulizer prize-winning author. You are perfect for this job, and they are luck to have you!
Gosh, well, maybe, but...
This is a match made in heavan, Dude! So what's the problem?
The problem?
Yeah.
They are all Barney movies...
