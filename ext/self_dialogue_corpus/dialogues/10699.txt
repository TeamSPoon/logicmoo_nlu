Is there anything about the Fast & Furious series that you particularly like?
That would definitely be the action.
I knew it! Which one do you think had the best action scenes?
That's definitely Furious 7.
Some of those scenes were ridiculous!
I know! Driving sports cars through buildings in Dubai? That's just nuts!
But you have to admit, it makes for great fun.
Of course. That's why I liked it as much as I did.
I also liked how in the first few minutes, Luke literally gives a Rock Bottom to one of the bad guys.
You know, sometimes I forget that Dwayne Johnson was ever a wrestler.
