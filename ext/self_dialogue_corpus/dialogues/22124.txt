What are you doing this weekend?
Probably gonna catch a flick.
Oh, yeah. Which one?
I was thinking about Aliens.
Covennant?
Yep.
Haven't heard much about it. What's the premmise.
Not sure. I've just seen them all, so I'd hate to break a streak!
Ha! Maybe I'll tag along?
That'd be great!
Is it a Riddley Scott?
Sure is!
Good. I hate it when they change up directors.
Me too. Did you catch the last Alice?
Through the Looking Glass?
Yup.
No. I heard that Tim Burton wasn't directing.
Your smart, and he didn't.
How'd it turn out.
Ghastly!
