We watched a classic thriller movie the other night.
Yeah, which one?
Seven.
It's just called Seven?
Yes. Brad Pitt is in it.
What's that about?
A killer who uses the seven deadly sins for his basis to kill.
So you mean like greed, wrath and so on?
Yes. It's great. Old but great.
I'll have to check it out. I never saw it.
