Who is your favorite team in the NFL?
I have loved the Green Bay Packers since I was a kid, what about you?
That's awesome! I'm a huge Detroit Lions fan, so it looks like we are rivals!
Being a Lions fan is rough, so I commend you on your loyalty.
Yeah, it's a been a tough go of it, but I think we are getting better.
I think so too, although your head coach needs to be fired.
Most fans agree with you and I think Caldwell will be fired if we don't win a playoff game next year.
It's been forever since you've won one, so it might be a longshot.
We haven't won since we have been in the NFC North, so that tells you how long it's been.
I think you guys are tough opponents and I always looking forward to our games twice a year.
It would be nice to see you at least three times, right? How great would a Lions/Packers playoff be?
Oh it would be awesome, especially since I think we are the top two teams of the division.
Not much competition there, have you seen the Bears lately?
Well, the Vikings didn't do much better this season, but really both our teams are one injury away from looking like that.
I know! I couldn't believe that Teddy Bridgewater injury at training camp, he is so young and talented!
I hope for the sake of their franchise and our division he returns healthy, because I'm tired of Sam Bradford.
I can't believe that Vikings fans think he is so talented! He is so overrated!
Yeah he is! He is nothing more than a systems quarterback with no pocket presence.
Beyond that, he never seems like much of a leader in the huddle.
I wonder if that was because he was new, or if he has a hard time gaining the offense's respect?
