Have you heard of the singer Drake?
Of course! He is so famous!
Yeah! You know his real first name is Aubrey.
What? Really?
Yeah. Aubrey Drake Graham.
That's cool. He became recognized on that teen show Degrassi.
His thank me later album went platinum. This guy is talented.
I love his songs called over and find your love.
Those were all released back in 2010.
I went to his concert in Miami in September of 2010 for his away from home tour.
I bet it was great. I wish I was there.
It was good. He is a great performer.
He has another album called take care that is also really good.
Yeah! I have that one.
Me too! It's so cool that he is from Canada.
So is Justin Bieber. Some really good artists come from Canada!
Yeah. His take care album became platinum too.
Wow! That's really great.
It's good to see talented people become successful.
Absolutely. He was fifth on the list of the Forbes five for the wealthiest rap artist!
