Only a few more months until the start of the NFL season.
I know, I am already getting excited.
I feel that my Cowboys are going to win it all this season.
They are good, I think that my Seahawks have a shot at the Superbowl too.
Well maybe we'll play each other in the playoffs for a spot at the big game.
That would be an amazing game.
Yes, if it comes to that, we should go watch the game at a restaurant together.
Yes, that would be great, I can rub it in your face if we win.
I think my side will be the the victorious side in this match up.
Well I think the only competition for our teams are the Packers and Falcons.
Yeah, I don't see other teams giving us trouble, one of these four teams will represent the NFC at the Superbowl for sure.
I am most worried about the Packers, I still think that Aaron Rodgers is the best player in the NFL.
It is very hard to disagree with that.
Yes, there is some solace knowing that the Packers defense is not that good though.
I agree, I think they will have to run up points on the offensive end to keep up with the Cowboys or Seahawks.
Yes, it will be hard for them to run up points though, both teams have good defenses.
I am in total agreement.
Anyway it should be a very entertaining season.
I hope so, I really want to watch some close games.
Agreed, hopefully we can have that Cowboys versus Seahawks match up in the playoffs, it will be a great game of football.
