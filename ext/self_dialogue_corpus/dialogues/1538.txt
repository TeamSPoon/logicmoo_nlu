So what team do you think is favorite for this NFL season?
I think that theres no clear favorite yet but the Patriots are always in the fight.
I dont know, it seems unlikely to win the Superbowl two times in a row
Yeah its hard and dont think many teams have done that but it would be great.
Actually theres 7 teams that have that, no team has won 3 in a row though.
Oh that fact is interesting I thought the number was way smaller.
So do you like any other teams for this season?
Well I always liked the Broncos but generally I just like to watch the games without a favorite, what about you?
I like the Steelers, since I was a child I liked them.
And do you know it they recruited any interesting players this season?
Yeah theres actually a few interesting players im exited to watch this season.
Oh I see, looks like you really know about football.
Well I do like it a lot and plus I play a lot of Madden that helps!
Im not much of a video game person myself but Ive heard its a great game.
Yeah I like it because you can use different teams and alter their tactics.
Sounds like a lot of work, do you also use the Steelers in that game?
Yeah I use them all the time I just like all about that team.
You really are passionate about that team!
I am, hopefully theyll win this season althought theres a lot of good teams this year.
Yeah the competition is hard but we will see.
