Do you like The Yellow Submarine album?
I do actually, not my favorite Beatles album, in fact I feel it's near their worst, but since it's The Beatles still has it's moments.
What would your favorite be then?
I can't really choose between Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or Abbey Road.
I sometimes think I'm alone in my adoration for yellow submarine, it's not very highly regarded amongst their albums.
I mean it's The Beatles, so it still has some redeeming value and some great songs, although the title track I always felt was cheesy, sorry Ringo Star.
I think it's ultimately a reflection of my musical taste as a whole, I tend to go against the grain.
I just think you need to give the two albums I named another try.
I'll give them a fresh listen.
Please do, surely you will end up liking them better than Yellow Submarine.
