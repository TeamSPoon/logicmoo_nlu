I am a crazy fan of Toni Braxton's love music in fact all of her music it just gives me a deep down inside good feeling how about you?
Yeah her songs is very soothing relaxing and enjoyable she 's also very beautiful.
Yeah i have to have a whole stack of her Cd's I have almost every song she came out with.
I don't but i would sure like to have a huge supply of her records maybe i can borrow some of yours sometime.
Oh no cannot do that you have to get your own when it comes to Tony Braxton.
Ah really that's being stingy but i understand if you don't allow anyone to borrow from your stash.
Nope sure can't let nobody get any of my Cd's they costed me a lot of money and i have to hold on to that music.
Yeah she really makes you feel so in love if your'e in a relation-ship too.
I have to listen to her music every time i feel sad or depressed or just want to think about how happy i am being in a relation-ship.
So that makes two of us. I have my headphones i take them with me and listen to her sing one of my favorites.
Yeah what's one of your favorite records by Toni? Tell me yours and i will tell you mines.
It's how could an angel break my heart. she moves my spirits with that song.
I like that too that is also one of my favorites and breath again. Make you want to fall in love all over again.
I watch her videos I also like her wasn't man enough for me the video has Robin Givens flashing her engagement ring at Toni.
Yeah that was a laugh Toni said i already had your man i don't want him no more.
Yes it was a really cool video. and Toni just looked so beautiful and can dance very well.
Music sweet music in mostly all of her videos she so gorgeous and i know she has to know it.
Her makeup her hair styles and the way she dresses is amazingly gorgeous.
Yes I wish i had some tickets i would go see one of her concerts.
Yeah me too in the future maybe we can find out where she will be having one and go see her in person someday..
