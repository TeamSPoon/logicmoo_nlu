Hey what's your favorite pop band?
My favorite pop artist probably is Tove Lo.
Oh yeah, isnt she from Norway?
No she's from Sweden!
I thought she was from Norway, maybe you are right.
Her English is pretty good - its hard to tell its not her native language when she's singing.
Yeah that's true, I dont think I would have known had I not read about it online.
My favorite song of hers recently is My Gun.
Oh that's her? I heard that on the radio the other day.
Yeah, I heard she records a lot of her music on her phone when she's on tour and so that's how she's so prolific.
