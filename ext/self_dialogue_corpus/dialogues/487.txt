What do you think about Drew Brees?
Well, he's good, but he's getting older.
Yeah, he's not as good as he used to be.
Right.  I cringed watching most of the games last season.
Even the year before last was kind of tough.
I know, right?  I really wish they had given the backup quarterback a chance that year.
Who were the back up quarterbacks over the last couple years?
The ones I remember were Luke McCown and Chase Daniel.
Oh, yeah, I remember them both.  Wasn't McCown in that commercial?
Yeah, the one for the telephone company.
Yeah, that was it.  I had to laugh at that one.
Well, why not make the money however you can?
I guess not.  Even if you have to laugh at yourself.
How do you think the team as a whole will do this year?
Hopefully better than last year.
Yeah, I know what you are saying.  Every year it's disappointing.
I watch a few games with high hopes, only to be let down.
Hopefully things go better this year.
Well, we will see.
Do you know when the season starts?
