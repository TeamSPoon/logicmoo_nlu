Do you know who the fab four are?
Of course, they're the Beatles!
Alright, alright. I just found out today that one member of the Beatles isn't an original member.
Oh, which one? George?
No, not George.
Who then?
Ringo Starr wasn't the original drummer.
I didn't know that, who was the original drummer.
A fellow named Pete Best.
Interesting. It's such a weird counterfactual to imagine the Beatles without Ringo. No "With a Little Help from My Friends."
