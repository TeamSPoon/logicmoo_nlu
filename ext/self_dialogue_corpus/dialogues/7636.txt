I finally figured out the problem. They treat Snape much more sympathetically in the movies than they do in the books.
Right? I think it's all Alan Rickman's performance, it makes him way more likable.
That and the fact that he's rarely even in the movies all that much, and when he is he's actually kind of funny.
Yeah, him hitting Harry and Ron over the heads with books shouldn't have been as funny as it was.
I just really hate how him cradling Lily's body in the last movie has been over-romantacized.
You're just saying that because there's a crying, bleeding infant in the background.
...Yes, yes that is exactly what I'm saying.
It DID make me cry the first time, I admit, but now I just kind of giggle at it.
Oh my god, did you see that one convention shot with those two cosplayers? They were a couple and they brought their baby, and they placed the baby on the ground while the guy dressed as Snape wailed over the woman dressed as Lily while she pretended to be dead.
I DID NOT SEE THAT AT ALL, YOU NEED TO SEND IT TO ME RIGHT NOW!
