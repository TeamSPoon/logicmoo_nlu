What do you think was one of the most controversial plays to happen in the NFL
Does it specifically have to be a play?
No anything is fair game it sounds like you have something juicy in mind.
Sort of I think it just stood out to me because it was during the holidays.
Which incident was it?
It was the 1998 Thanksgiving day coin flip.
What happened.
Well the running back of the steelers called tails and the ref said he called heads-tails.
What?
Yeah I know but here is the kicker.
Go on
The coin landed on tails and detriot took possesion of the ball
How!?
Exactly my reaction.
What happened then?
Detroit kicked a winning feild goal in a sudden death overtime.
Are you kidding me!?
I kid you not, thats why it's my top controversial instance in NFL history.
That is crazy.
I know man.
