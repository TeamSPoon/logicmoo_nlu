I was listening to Sum 41 the other day and it brought back so many memories.
I remember those guys.
Do you remember their song "Fat Lip"?
Yes, of course. It's their most popular song.
That song has so much attitude.
Their whole sound seems to have a lot of attitude.
I think that comes along with the genre.
Definitely, that's what makes the genre appealing to me.
Those type of bands hardly exist anymore.
I know, it's sad.
New Found Glory was another band like that.
Their music is so much fun.
I used to blast "My Friends Over You" through my stereo system.
I remember seeing the video for that on MTV.
That was off of their album "Sticks and Stones".
I have that CD in a box of my old stuff.
I have it somewhere, too.
The whole album was good. It only had one popular song, though.
I agree. Have you heard any of their newer music?
No, I haven't listened to them in a long time.
