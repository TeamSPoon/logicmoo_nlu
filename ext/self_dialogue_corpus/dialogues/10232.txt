Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes, it was awesome! Have you seen it?
Yes, and it is my new favorite movie! I love how Marvel brings to life these charaters.
Me too! The battles were epic and the are like the outlaws of the space world.
Precisely! It fun because the crew reminds me of a motley crew.
Right, without getting specific, this father-son dynamic, is the driving force behind the tension in the movie.
Yes and that goes along with the original movie and stays with the theme we are used to.
What about that Baby Groot!
Baby Groot steals the show with his big eyes and sweet demeanor.
The movie has every aspect of being a great movie to take teenage kids to.
