Which Fast and Furious movie was it that they found out Lettie is alive?
That was Fast Five (Fast and Furious Five).
How did they explain her death?
She was in that car accident in #4 and then she crawled out.  She had amnesia.
Did they explain how Dom had a relationship with that Brazil cop?
They did show them together at the beginning, but it sort of dropped off after that.
I heard in Fast 8 that the Brazil cop and Dom had a baby, is that true?
Yes they explained they had an affair while Lettie was "dead".
What did they name the baby?
Brian -- after the character in the movie, but I think they should have named him Paul.
