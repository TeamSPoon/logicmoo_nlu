It's difficult for me to pin down a definition of what a thriller movie is.
Isn't it just a movie with a lot of suspense?
Maybe, but that can mean a lot of different things tonally.
Isn't suspense a tone?
Yes, but that's not what I mean. Like, Home Alone has a lot of suspense, so is it a thriller?
That's really a comedy though.
Some thrillers are also comedies though! The lines are really blurry.
Okay, then let's say Home Alone is a thriller then. What difference does it make?
Not a whole lot, I guess.
Exactly.
