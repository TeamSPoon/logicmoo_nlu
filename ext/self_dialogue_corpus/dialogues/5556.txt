Hey did you know that Cars 3 is already in theaters now?
No way! It is?
Yeah I want to go see it really bad. It looks good.
I loved the first cars and second one.
This new one is about Lightning McQueen still trying to prove himself in a new generation of racers.
Oh okay. Well should be really good.
Yeah it looks like they have some new characters as well.
It's always exciting when there are new characters.
I am just glad Mater is in it again.
Mater is the best character. I love the guy who does his voice, Larry the Cable Guy.
