Mulan has got to be my favorite Disney movie.
Really? I like the Princess and the Frog the most.
That was a good one, too. Tiana and Mulan are both very strong characters.
Agreed, and their sidekicks really bring out the best in them.
Mushu and Cricket were great in Mulan.
Ray was my favorite sidekick in the Princess and the Frog.
It seems that a lot of Disney movies have a lot of great sidekicks.
You're right. For some people, Olaf is the main reason they like the Frozen franchise so much.
I can see why. He is very lovable and provided great comic relief.
I know. I'm just happy he didn't melt.
