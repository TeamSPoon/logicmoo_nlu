Are there any good thriller movies out in theaters?
No. "The Mummy" is atrocious, but "American Assassin" might be fun.
Isn't that based off of the Mitch Rapp novels?
Yes. The trailers make it look fun.
I wonder how they might make it different from the Jack Ryan movies.
It should be more energetic and modern.
What makes you think that?
Hollywood likes to repeat itself a lot, but I think that Michael Keaton will take it to the next level.
If he's in it, I'm going to see it.
I'll get some tickets when they're available!
