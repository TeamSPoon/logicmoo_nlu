What's your favorite song from any Disney movie?
Lion King has always been very memorable for me with Elton John's Circle of Life song.
Lion King is always on everyone's top list because of the memorable songs in there plus it's one of Disney's most powerful animations too!
I also think it's underrated but I liked Phil Collins song in the 1999 Disney Tarzan movie.
You mean You'll Be In My Heart?
Yeah that one! It makes me irrationally choke up every time I hear it!
That's funny. I don't want to say the cliche response, but Frozen's Let It Go is really, really good.
Let it Go will be always so memorable because of how great Frozen was as a whole. Disney really knocked it out of the ballpark with that film.
I think the songs relate to how good and memorable the Disney movie is.
Yeah the best ones will have the most memorable songs. Aladdin, Pocahontas, The Lion King, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast!
