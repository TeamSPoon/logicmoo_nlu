Did you like The Force Awakens.
For the most part I did.
It sounds like you had some problems with the movie.
I didn't like the way they killed off Han Solo.
Everyone was upset about that.
I didn't think Kylo Ren was a strong enough villian to take out Solo.
He was sort of a whiner.
I thought Rey was pretty great.
Did you like BB8?
He was fun but he's no R2D2.
