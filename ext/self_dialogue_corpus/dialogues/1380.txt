Hey buddy, want in our Fantasy League this year?
Of course, why wouldn't I?
Figured i'd ask haha. Who do you think's going to take it this year?
I'd like it to be the Eagles, but it'll probably be the patriots again.
Yeah, I don't know how they keep they're team so stacked.
Right?  They picked up Brandin Cooks man, they don't need that skill.
They're going to be unstoppable, I'm excited to see how him and Brady click together.
They finally got another decent corner too.
Really who?
Stephen Gilmore.
Jeez man, they're stacked again this year.
I really don't know who's going to be on their level.
Well Dallas made some good pickups this year.
I sure hope they don't have a decent team this year, but as long as the Eagles beat them I'll be fine.
You really are a huge Eagles fan.
Win or lose brother.
Good on you, my team's not too much better so I can't say much.
Who's your team again?
The dolphins.
Yeah, they're not much better haha.
