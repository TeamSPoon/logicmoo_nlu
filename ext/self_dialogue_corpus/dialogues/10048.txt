Did you ever see Face Off?
One of my favorites!
I know! It was so good!
I think what was most compelling is Cage and Travolta trading off.
Yeah, they both get to play the good and bad guy.
Very cool.
And the action was super intense.
I didn't care much for the "procedure".
Yeah, that was a bit gross.
I'm shuddering just thinking about it!
