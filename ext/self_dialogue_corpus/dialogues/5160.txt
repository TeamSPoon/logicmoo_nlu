have you seen the movie Brave?
are you talking about the movie where a red haired girl with a bow?
yea
Yea I've seen it, it was such an incredible movie, great music score too
I can't agree more, I listen the soundtrack on spotify all the time
Disney is really trying to give the troubled world a lot of good vibe
that's true, taking this movie for example, it's trying to promote social realization of female's importance in the world
yeah, that's the underlying tone. The magic with Disney movie is that, most of them are suitable for both adult and kids
yeah, now when I look back at some movies I watched, I can gain different insight as my life's knowledge build up
agreed
