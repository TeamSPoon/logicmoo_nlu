Do you like Anthony Hopkins movies?
Sometimes, when I'm in the mood for serious drama. I feel like watching an action or thriller tonight.
Have you ever seen the movie "Solace"?
The James Bond flick?
No, that was "Quantum of Solace." I'm talking about the movie "Solace," with Anthony Hopkins.
I don't recall if I've seen that one. What's it about?
Anthony Hopkins is a psychic that the FBI hires to help solve difficult murder cases.
That sounds really cool. I don't think I saw that, or I would have remembered it. Is it good?
It's not Hopkins' best movie, but I think the plot is interesting and it's definitely worth seeing just for that.
How was it rated in IMDB?
It was rated 6.4.
I see what you mean: not great, but probably worth seeing for the entertainment value.
Right.
So what's the plot like?
Hopkins is retired from doing the psychic thing, but an investigator convinces him to take on a very difficult case. It turns out that the perpetrator is a very powerful psychic as well.
I see, so it becomes a battle of psychics pitted against eachother.
Exactly. As the movie unfolds, the psychic abilities of Hopkins' character and the perpetrator becomes more and more astounding, almost like a superhero movie.
It sounds like it could almost be like a comic book type of movie.
I would say that it does have a certain resemblance to some of the more offbeat movies based on comic books.
That could be interesting. Maybe I'll check it out.
