what is your favorite kind of movie
I love John Travolta movies
oh really like what
I love Grease
oh yea that is great what else
Urban Cowboy is another great one
I did not like that one a little too country for me
It was but still a fun movie and I like Debra Winger too
I of course like Saturday Night Fever
well that is one of the classics
any others
well I do like The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, old and B but still good
what about some more current ones
I did like the Look Whose Talking movies
those were so silly
they were but so so fun to watch
how about Face Off
I only saw it once but it was good
do you like Pulp Fiction
That is one I did not care for
