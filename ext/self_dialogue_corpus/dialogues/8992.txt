Heard any decent new rock bands lately
Yeah I just got turned on to a new band called "Gold Class"
I've never heard of them‚ are they local?
No they are from Australia‚ a friend posted a video on Facebook
Oh cool‚ what kind of music is it
It's what I would call alternative rock
What's the name of a good song to listen to
"Twist In The Dark" is the one that got me into them
I'll give it a listen
You really should‚ I really like that song
