What is your favorite genre of movies?
I don't really have one-- like for example, I could just watch horror movies the rest of my life.  I'd get bored of it.  I like variety.
Fair enough-- how about your favorite comedy?
There are so many sub-genres-- like, dark comedies, and slapstick comedies.
Ok, well, narrow it down for me.
Just a few I like are Big Lebowski, which I consider a comedy, but the humor isn't slapstick.  I don't know how I'd describe it.
I like that movie too-- I think I'd describe the humor as witty, and subtle.
Yeah, I can agree with that.  As far as slapstick comedies, the Naked Gun series always makes me laugh.
Me too-- Leslie Nielson was the greatest.
I also have a soft spot for 80s teen comedies-- especially when they have a song you can tell was written for the movie.
What kind of action movies do you like?
I love Predator.  Did you know that Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally the Predator?
Yeah, but they decided to make him larger and more imposing.
Do you know how the idea of the Predator came about?
No.  How?
Some producer joked that Rocky had fought everyone but E.T.
Haha, that's pretty funny.  I don't think I'd like to see that fight though-- I was conflicted with Rocky fought Hulk Hogan.
I know right?  Who do you pull for there?
I always liked Die Hard-- especially Die Hard: With a Vengeance.
Did you know that the writers of that movie were actually interrogated because the crime was so logical and realistic?
