Have you watched all of the Harry Potter movies yet?
Yeah, I have. I don't know how I feel about the Ginny-Harry love thing.
Really??  I love Ginny!  She's a kick-ass girl.
Yeah, but I mean, how many people marry their high school sweethearts?
Hello!  It's a movie!
Yeah, I know, but isn't it a little creepy to marry someone who was so crazy about you that she was lured to the chamber of secrets?
You do have a point there . . .
And her brother was a pseduo-brother for Ron.
I get your point.  Like they were kind of like family.
Yeah.  I mean, he didn't have to end up with anyone from Hogwarts.
