Have you seen The Little Mermaid?
I have. I went to see it when I was living overseas. It was huge over there as well.
I adore the music.
Under the Sea!!!!! Yes!
I had a friend who had trouble seeing, She went to the eye doctor and got glasses. She went around singing A Whole New World
Why?
Because she could finally see so it was truly a whole new world for her.
Oh, OK. That's cute.
We should have a Disney movie night some time at my house.
I'll be there!
