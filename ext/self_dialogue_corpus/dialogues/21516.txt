I have been wanting to go and see it. When do you want to go?
Today at 3pm. I know what you mean, I have been wanting to go see it for along time too.
. Yes, 3 pm works for me. Ever since the first trailer preview I was hooked.
Did you know she was pregnant while shooting some of the action scenes?
What?! She truly is a Wonder Woman,
Yeah, She was 5 months pregnant.
One would never know she did an amazing job. I love Gal Gadot.
I agree. She was the perfect actress for this role.
yes, and so was her co-star.
Who's her costar? I can't remember.
It's Chris Pine.
Oh yeah! I love him!
They both had amazing chemistry.
They did. Both on and off the movie screen.
This movie was just so empowering to everyone.
It's amazing how it was directed and produced by woman only.
And it was the best reviews ever!
Just reading the reviews gets me so excited and wanting to see it more!
Me too! Can't wait for 3 pm to get here so we can watch Wonder Woman!
