Isn't it really exciting when TV shows make the jump to the big screen with movies?
Yeah, it really is.
Like when The Simpsons Movie came out, that was really kind of an event.
I don't think anyone thought it would actually happen until it really did.
Yeah, or to use a smaller example, when Aqua Teen Hunger Force released the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters.
That title is a mouthful!
That's part of the joke. The DVD release had an even longer title.
Well, you can't say that their humor isn't irreverent!
Yeah, but my point was, even though it's kind of silly it's hard to not get excited when you see a show you like become a movie!
What about when old TV shows are remade as movies?
Like 21 Jump Street?
Something like that, yeah.
That's a little bit different, since the show has been off the air for so long. It's not a direct continuation.
I guess the Reno 911 movie would be a better example, huh?
Yeah, that's more what I'm talking about. It doesn't seem like it happens often, though.
It's probably really hard to translate what works on the smaller screen onto the silver screen.
I imagine you're right. That's probably why we end up with lots of reboots instead.
Well, it makes sense. If it worked as a movie once, it could work again.
Like the three different versions of The Thing!
Or even better, the dozen different King Kong movies they've done.
