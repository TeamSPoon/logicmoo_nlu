What types of music do you listen to?
Mostly hip hop, and pop what about you?
I would say mostly the same but I sometimes listen to country?
Really I didn;t think you would be a country fan.
Yeah it comes and goes most people don't think of me as a country fan either. Have you ever listened to country music?
Only when it was playing in the background and I didn;t have a choice lol.
Yeah I hear ya, some of its pretty terrible.
YOu can say that again.
Who is your favoite hip hop artist?
Oh man thats tough there are so many, I would have to say Beyonce
Really whys that?
Beecause I think she has really re-invented herself recently with Lemonade and I want to support her in that.
Oh yeah I agree that was pretty dope.
What do you think about beyonce?
Yeah I like her too, shes been around for a while now and I find myself listening to a lot of her music.
Have you seen her lemonade music videos?
I saw some of them, and the people around me that have watcehd all of them say they were really good.
Yeah they were really pretty good. I liked how it told a story over the entire soundtrack.
Yeah that was totally cutting edge.
I agree.
