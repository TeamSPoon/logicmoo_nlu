What is your top beatle song ?
I always loved, Help!
That is a interesting choice.I often forget about that song.
Glad I could help you remember it.. hahaha.
What is your top pick?
I would have to go with yesterday.
Yesterday is such a beautiful melody I can see that being many people's favorite.
The lyrics are so moving, like many beatles songs. True lyrical genius.
I agree one of the strengths of theirs was in the lyrics. I think they all wrote certain songs.
I believe you are correct though most were paul and john I think.
