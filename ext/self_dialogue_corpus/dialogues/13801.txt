One of my favorite Lady Gaga songs is Bad Romance.
Yeah I like the video with her laying with a skeleton.
I like that Lady Gaga sings with Tony Bennett who is a legend.
She looks so great in the Macy's Christmas commercial.
I love Lady Gaga's Born This Way.
She has this one dance move that I love in the video.
Lady Gaga's newer song is about abuse.
Yes whenever she sings it she tears up.  Lady Gaga is a strong activist.
I love Lady Gaga's dancing in all her videos.
I love how she wears the craziest set of shoes and dances in them like in Bad Romance.
