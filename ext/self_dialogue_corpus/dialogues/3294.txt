Have you seen all of the Leprechaun movies?
Yes, except the one that WWE made. That was not good.
Which is your favorite?
Part 1 of course. But, part 2 and 3 have a special place in my heart.
What happens in Leprechaun 2?
He kidnaps a girl and then marry's her.
That sounds crazy. What happens in part 3?
He is in Las Vegas in part 3.
Wow, cool and where is part 1 set?
It takes place on a farm mostly.
