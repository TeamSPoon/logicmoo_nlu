Remember back when Jessica Simpson was popular?
Yes I do! I liked her music.
Wasn't she related to someone from 98 degrees?
She was married to one of the singers.
Do you remember which one it was?
Yes it was Nick Lachey.
Oh that's right! I remember now.
I also really liked 98 degrees.
Yes they had pretty good songs.
They weren't as popular as bands like Nsync though.
