So what is your favorite band?
That's tough to answer as I like so many!
Ok, then.  Who is your favorite band today?
I'm going to say Radiohead.
Interesting.  I liked it when they were more radio friendly...
I understand but their more experimental music is extraordinary.
Really?  Don't they have a new album coming out soon?
It seems like they're always working on something!
Didn't they cover a Smith's song?
Yes, it was The Headmaster's Ritual.
I loved that cover!
Yes, they did an excellent job with it!  How did you hear about it?
I don't know, actually.  I was on youtube one day and I noticed it.
Are you a Smiths fan?
Yes, I have been since the 80's.
Morrissey is too out there for me.
He is eccentric but one of the best lyricists and most unique singers of all time!
I wouldn't argue with you on that!
You know, I think I'll find my Queen Is Dead album!
Oh, that's their best I hear!
