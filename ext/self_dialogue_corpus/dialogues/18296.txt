Do you like the Drop Kick Murphies?
Yes I do.  Isn't that a requirement if you're from Boston?
I guess so.  What's a song you like from them?
Well immediately I think of Shipping up to Boston.
Great song with that heavy base.
Remember when Paplbon used to come out to that?
Yeah, he was an awesome closer.
I also like the State of Massachusetts.
Good song.
They just do a great job of mixing that Irish sound with hard rock.
Yeah I agree.  I heard they are good in concert too.
Yes!  A couple years ago I had floor seats to them.
Oh man!  How was that?
Amazing.  They really engage the crowd.
Wow, how did they sound?q
They rocked the roof off the place.
Such a good band.  Have you ever heard their Christmas Song?
The Season's Upon Us?  Isn't that about my family?
Ha I thought I was the only one.
Yeah, I love that song.
