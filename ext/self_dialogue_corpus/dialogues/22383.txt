Did you watch the latest Fast and Furious movie?
No, did you?
Yes, it was pretty spectacular
How many are they up to now?
I think this one is #8
Wow! Eight Fast and Furious Movies!?
I know, pretty crazy. Who would've thought?
Is Vin Diesel in this one?
Yes, he goes rogue in this one
Oh really...what a cliffhanger!
Well they always have to have some drama
What did they do to Paul Walker's character?
You'll have to watch it to see what happens
That's too bad that he died in real life
Yeah, a tragedy
What about The Rock, is he in this one?
Yes, he's in this one. It also has Charlize Theron
Whoa, that's crazy since she is a big time actor
Well that's what the Fast and Furious attracts now, big time actors
Apparently so.
