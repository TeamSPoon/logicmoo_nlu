Had you ever seen The Breakfast Club?
I hadn't seen it in a while, but yeah.
Wasn't it a great movie?
To me, it was better when I was younger.
Why do you say that?
I don't know.  A lot of things are like that.
Aren't as good as you remembered them?
Exactly.  I really did like it growing up though.
Was that Molly Ringwald's first movie?
I don't know, but I really don't think so.
She sure did a lot of movies in the eighties though.
Yeah, most of the actors in that movie did pretty well in the 80s.
Who else?
Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, pretty much all of them.
Anthony Michael Hall is still in stuff, right?
I see him in things every now and then.  I just can't remember what.
Do you ever see Molly Ringwald in anything?
I really can't remember.
As big as she was, she kind of fizzled out.
Yeah, she kind of did.
