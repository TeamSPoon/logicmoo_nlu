Do you know what one of my favorite scenes was from all of the Star Wars movies was?
I don't even know how you can choose, there was so many awesome scenes in that series?
Well, one of the best, in my opinion, is the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan on Mustafar in "Revenge of the Sith."
Oh yeah, that was an great scene.
All of those choose Jedi flips and stuff over the lava was amazing!
And that scene really sets up the whole Anakin going bad thing.
Yeah, that was really sad when Obi Wan left Anakin. I always wished he had just taken him with him.
I know right. He shouldn't have left him there, with the Emperor coming and all.
It was still a cool scene though, no matter the outcome.
Yeah, makes me want to watch that one again.
