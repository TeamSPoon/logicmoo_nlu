Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes, I am a huge fan of Rocket.
Me too, he is probably my favorite character.
Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Yes! It was amazing, the effects were quite a visual treat.
I couldn't imagine how much work it would be to create those stunning visual effects.
On top of creating them they have to render, the amount of computer power required to render that much cgi is mind boggling.
Right? I wonder how many server farms it took to render all of that movie.
The art style from the Marvel movies is really nice, I am a fan of how consistent it is through out all of the different movies.
Yes, despite some Marvel movies being substantially different characters and planets it still feels like its all part of one universe.
What about Star Wars?
What about it?
Do you think they went overboard with the cgi in Force Awakens?
I kind of do, I think it was more of an issue with what they did with the cgi rather than the amount of it.
What do you mean?
Well I think they have unlimited potential when working in computer created worlds yet the scenes felt very small and limited.
Can you give me an example?
For starters, the space scenes only featured a hand full of craft in each battle.
Oh yeah, I kind of noticed that too.
The scale of the various computerized scenes just did not feel as grand as the prequels for example despite them being almost 20 years older.
