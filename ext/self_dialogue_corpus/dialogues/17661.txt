Who is your favorite female singer?
I'm not sure I have one.
You have to have one, everyone does.
Well, if I had to choose a current one, I guess it would be Ariana Grande.
Oh. I never listen to her.
Well, I rarely do, but you wanted my favorite.
What about Taylor Swift?
I like her, too. But I still rarely listen to female singers.
Taylor Swift, Ariana, and Selena Gomez. Are they the most popular now?
Taylor and Ariana definitely are. Not Selena.
Who would be more popular?
Katy Perry and Beyonce.
I completely forgot about those two.
Yeah, they have a cult-like following.
Well, most celebrities do.
Not like Beyonce.
That's true. Her fans are more than obsessive.
Yes, but she is very entertaining and seems nice.
Yeah. She's also been around forever.
Yupp. Back since Destinys Child
