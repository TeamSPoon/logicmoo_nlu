I'm having a few friends over tonight nad we want to watch a thriller. I don't normally watch thrillers so can you recommend something?
I have a great one in mind if you don't mind a bit of an older movie.
I'm OK with that. What's it called?
It's called The Da Vinci Code.
Who's in it?
It stars Tom Hanks.
I really like Tom Hanks. Is it scary?
Not real scary, but more tense.
I'll go find a trailer for it.
Let me know what you think and if you like it, it has a follow up called Angels and Demons.
