so what are some good movies going on in theater right now?
lots of cool movies going on!
really? tell ,me about them!
first one I would suggest is pirates of carrabean
oh is that the one with jhonny depp?
yes that is the one.
so is that a series or just a solo movie?
it is a series. I am surprised that you didn't know that!
well, I am not a huge fan of jhonny depp.
but the series is not about jhonny depp. it's about pirates of carabbean
still, I somehow do not like movies which star jhonny depp.
that's strange. I haven't seen many people like you.
okay so tell me about the movie, have you seen it?
oh yes! I watched it on the first day of release.
so how was it? did you like it?
yes! absolutely! I loved it!
that makes me a bit more likely to go watch it.
trust me, you should definitely go watch it!
I guess I'll trust your words.
yes, trust me, you won't regret it.
