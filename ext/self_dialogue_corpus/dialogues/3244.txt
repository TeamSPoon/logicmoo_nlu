Is the Conjuring series really based on a true story?
Sort of. The characters are based on real people, Ed and Lorraine Warren, who claim to an exorcist and a psychic.
The Amityville Haunting was also supposedly based on a true story, but it turned out to be hoax.
It is hard to make a horror film that is an actual true story. What matters is if it feels real.
Okay, so does The Conjuring series feel real?
Almost, except the characters based on the Warrens are too perfect.
What is a horror movie based on a true story that feels like it could have happened?
I think Ti West's films qualify, like The Innkeepers.
What is that about?
It is filmed in a real inn that is supposedly haunted. Some employees try to see if they can prove it is, and then weird stuff happens.
