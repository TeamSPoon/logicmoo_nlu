I think Chris Evans is the best looking Avenger.
He does do a good job as Captain America, but not the best.
Really?  Who would you say?
For me, I would say Robert Downey Jr.
Wow.  That's a bit of a shock.
I think it's his attitude and confidence.  I have to admit, it's kind of alluring.
But Chris Evans looks like he lifts weights in his sleep.
He probably does, but having huge muscles doesn't make you a superhero.
Of course not.  Wearing a funny costume does.
You got me there.
