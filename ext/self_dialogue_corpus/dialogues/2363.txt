Are you ready for some football?
You betcha! You who got this year? You're still not a Cowboys fan are you?
America's Team, baby! Their new offense is awesome. Romo had his moments, but he could never really deliver.
Yeah, well he's probably delivering pizzas now.  For me, the Packers are going to put it together his year.
The Packers? Their defense is a sieve.  They were ranked near the bottom of the league.
They're going to tighten that up this year, plus Aaron Rogers just keeps getting better, smarter, luckier.  I know they'll own the Cowboys.
Outside of the Packers, who do you think will win it all?
Well, the Cowboys will be last, but other than that, about twelve teams will end the season tied for the best record.
That's true. Parity has made the league almost unfun. You gotta gave some bad teams for everyone to beat up on.
Yeah, if you don't have some 2-14 records, you won't have any 14-2 records.  One year, I think the whole league will finish 8-8.
Well, that can't happen. Not with Cleveland.
Oh so, true. You totally have to try to be that bad. What are they doing there?
I'm pulling for a city, though. I don't particularly like either the Rams or Charges, but how about Los Angeles?
I know, right! No football for twenty something years, now two teams. And I think both could go to the playoffs. That's amazing. Exciting!
I think we agree on something! Los Angeles to the playoffs! Go Rams!
You mean, "Go Chargers!"  The Rams are still the hapless Rams.
It figures. Okay, crunch time. Pick a Super Bowl winner.
Packers. Team loyalty man. Of course, if we're putting money down, the Patriots.
Ohh, I hate the Patriots. I would rather give money away than bet ON the Patriots.
Well, at least you can celebrate six times this year when the Cowboys win.
