Do you like the movie Tangled?
Yes, I do! I thought it was a lot of fun.
I thought Flynn Rider was a great character.
Yeah, he was really the lovable rogue with a heart of gold.
And Rapunzel was an interesting heroine.
She's so innocent about the world, and really conflicted about leaving the tower.
Yeah, I thought it really worked to show her struggle with coming out into the world.
Mother Gothel was a scary villain!
Even scarier because you could see how she manipulated Rapunzel.
And I loved the chameleon! He was a really fun touch.
