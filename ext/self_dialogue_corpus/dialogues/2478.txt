Hey, I just heard that Sammy met Peyton Manning the other day. Have you ever met any NFL players?
I lived in Dallas, Texas for about 10 years, so I ran into a few of the Cowboys players from time to time.
Tell me about some of them.
Well, to begin with there was Roger Staubach.
You met him in Dallas? I thought he retired a long time ago.
He retired, but he still lives in the Dallas area.
So how did you meet him?
Actually, it was a bit of a fluke. My friend and I were at lunch one day in the town of Addison and we passed Roger on the street.
What was he doing?
Roger Staubach has a big real estate presence north of Dallas, which is where Addison is located. He was visiting one of his properties and nearly ran into us while walking on the sidewalk.
Did you say anything to him?
Not much, we just both looked at each other, realized who it was, and said 'Hello' to him.
Who else did you meet in Dallas?
Well, there was this one time when we had lunch in the same restaurant as Troy Aikman. He was sitting at the table across the aisle from us.
He was just sitting there in the middle of a restaurant?
Yes he was. It was a P. F. Chang's and he was eating lunch with someone who was an obvious business partner or attorney.
Did you say anything to Troy?
Again, we didn't say much. I don't like to bother celebrities because I understand they are just people like I am.
Ok, so you didn't say much. But what did you say?
Once again, I was with the same friend. We just looked across the aisle and he looked back at us and we all just said "Hi."
