Do you prefer guy rappers or girl rappers?
Do you think there's a big difference?
I think girls tend to rap a bit harder because they think they need to prove themselves.
I'm not sure about that.
Well look at Angel Haze or Cupcakke.
But Busta Rhymes goes just as hard.
Yeah, but female rappers make it a point to never be lazy.
That's true. Azealia Banks is another one.
Also M.I.A., although she definitely blurs the lines between rap and electronic.
She's too experimental for me.
