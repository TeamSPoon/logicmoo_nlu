I really enjoyed Moana.
Oh? How come?
I found the music composition very enjoyable.
Hmm... I will have to disagree. I felt like it tried to compete with Frozen with something super catchy.
What song made you feel that way?
"We know the way."
Are there some songs that you genuinely like though?
I liked "Your Welcome," actually.
Haha, me too. It's silly but cute.
Easy to sing with too even if you can't sing well, haha!
