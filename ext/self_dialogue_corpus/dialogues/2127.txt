Marshawn Lynch is flat out a great player. He's tough to lose.
Its Marshawn Lynch we're talking about. He's like 30.
You know, but if he can still play, he can still play.
Do you know any runningbacks that are actually successful into their 30s?
Theres some, but most just fizzle out.
Yea, I agree! Maybe Marshawn will be an exception, but I do not know.
Yea, I'm kinda tired of his act, but he's a great player.
Yea, what is with him and that. Is something wrong.
Well, he's socially awkward, but I think he is illiterate.
Yea, he very well might be. Something is weird there.
For that reason alone, the Seahawks will be okay without him.
Nobody needs somebody like that in the locker room regardless of how good they are.
What are you Chip Kelly? We saw in Philly that doesn't work.
Touche. You are right about that one.
Yea, talent trumps everything else in this league. Its been proven.
I agree! Its still professional football at the end of the day.
Yea, sometimes its tough to separate their personal lives, but sometimes its necessary.
Yea, I agree. At the end of the day, the most important thing is whether or not they can play.
Yea, that is extremely important.
That is obviously what wins and loses football games.
