Do you like baseball?
Yes, love it!
Do you have a favorite team?
I live in Colorado, so it's the Colorado Rockies all the way!
How are they doing this year?
Not too bad, but probably not good enough to make the playoffs
Do you watch them on TV, or go to the games in person?
A little of both, plus some radio as well.
Where is their stadium?
It's in downtown Denver.
Is it hard to get to?
No, great parking and close to light rail, too!
Isn't it expensive to ride light rail to the ballgame?
No, not if you are a senior citizen!
How many games do you go to each year?
Maybe 6 or so, depending on how well they are doing.
Are you a fair weather fan - you don't go if they are losing?
My husband is, but I just love to go sit in the stadium on nice days and people watch!
Have you ever gone to a baseball game by yourself?
No, but I think it would be fun, so I'll try it sometime!
