Have you ever heard of a band called The Hold Steady?
I don't think so. What's their last album?
The last one they released was called "Teeth Dreams."
I haven't heard it.
You should check it out. It was pretty awesome.
What kind of music do they play?
It's pretty solid rock.
I like rock. But what kind are we talking about?
It depends on who you ask. They're technically indie rock, but you could call it alternative.
Alternative? I don't know about that.
It's kind of post-punk. It's kind of old-fashioned rock.
Oh okay. I like that kind of music.
I know! They got started singing songs about the midwest.
I mean, I'm okay with the midwest.
It's just like their songs are kind of stories. The lead singer, Craig Finn, is really good at character development.
That's different.
Yeah, it's something you don't really hear too much of.
So his songs are stories.
Yeah. Check out the album, or maybe some of their earlier stuff. Then we can talk about it.
For sure.
