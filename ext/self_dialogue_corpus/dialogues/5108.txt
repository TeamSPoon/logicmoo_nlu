What do you think of the progress of the Diamondbacks this season?
They are doing better that I expected.
What do you see that makes you think that?
First of all, their record.  They have been near the top of the division so far.
What parts of their game do you like?
You have to start with Paul Goldschmidt.  He is an all-star and if his performance continues he will be a Hall of Famer.
What other hitters impress you?
Pollack being back after a year off strengthens the line-up.
How about the pitching?
The starters have looked pretty strong.
Which ones have you liked?
Grienke, Ray and Corbin have been strong.
How about the bullpen?
Archie Bradley is vastly improved.
Who else?
Their closer is 40 years old and has had some pretty weak outings.
Do you have an opinion on the new manager?
So far I have liked his style.
What in particular?
I like it that he doesn't yank pitchers too quickly.
