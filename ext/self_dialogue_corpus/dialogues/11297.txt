I think Rubber soul is a unique album
Was that a less popular album
Yeah it did not catch on later on as much as the others did
I mean some tracks did though
Yeah but i mean the album as a whole compared to the others
Yeah i see that
I just love the way the songs are written it is different
They did have something special about them
Oh most definitely they did
I am sad their will never be more
