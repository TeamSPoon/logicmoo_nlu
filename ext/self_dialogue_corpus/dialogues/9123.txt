I wish rock music was the same as it used to be.
I know!  What happened to the days of Nirvana and Soundgarden?
Aren't both of those lead singers dead?
They are.  And that is a terrible tragedy.  They would be embarrassed by the songs on the radio today.
I'm sure.  Who wants to listen to rap songs all the time that repeat words the whole song?
I know.  I just put in my Silverchair CD and ignore mainstream radio.
Sirius makes that so much easier.  Did you know that Pearl Jam even has their own radio station now?
Really?  Does it only play Pearl Jam songs?
It does.  But a lot of it is the live stuff that you haven't heard.  It's awesome.
I'm going to have to check that out.
