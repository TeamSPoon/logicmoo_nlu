I love the movie Frozen.
Me too.  It's so creative.
Disney is amazing in all they do.
I love to hear their music in the movies especially.
What was your favorite Disney movie?
Mine has to be The Jungle Book.
I love that one too.
They have great music as well in there.
You never forget the tunes.  They are performed by top notch musicians.
I can't wait to see Beauty and the Beast.
