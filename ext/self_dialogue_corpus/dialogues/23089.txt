Finding Dory is better than Finding Nemo.
No, you're wrong.
I know its an unpopular opinion, but its just so much better and original.
How is it more original than the actual original?
Well, the story. And its funnier.
No, it can't be more original when its the sequel to the oriignal.
Okay, well do you think it was funny.
Yeah, I like Ellen Degeneris' voice. It suits cartoon characters.
I know, Dory is hilarious.
Dory was the funniest character in Finding Nemo.
I think those seagulls were.
They were, too.
What was the funniest scene from Nemo?
I don't remember the whole movie, but my favorite was when Dory was doing the whale call.
I know! I remember cracking up when we watched that in school.
Same here. We watched it on the last day of 6th grade.
The turtle, squirt was so cute.
He was. And his dad or brother or whoever was funny.
Yeah, the idea of a surfer dude turtle was great.
Maybe the'll make a Finding Squirt!
