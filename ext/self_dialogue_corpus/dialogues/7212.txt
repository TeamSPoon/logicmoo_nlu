What did you think about the first Avengers movie?
I thought it was awesome!
Yea it was probably my favorite Marvel movie thus far.
Yea, same here. Who was your favorite character in the movie?
I really liked Spiderman.
Yes! Tom Holland is such a good fit for that role.
I can't wait for his standalone Spiderman movie to come out.
It's next up on their release list, so it won't be too much longer of a wait.
Do you want to go see it together when it comes out?
Sure, that sounds great.
