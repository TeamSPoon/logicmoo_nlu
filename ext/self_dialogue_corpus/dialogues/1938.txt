Hey, do you like watching football?
Yes! I am a huge fan!
Awesome! What is your favorite team?
The Patriots! What about yours?
My favorite team is the Eagles. They never get very far but I have to stay loyal.
Yeah that's true. I'm lucky to root for a team that has been successful but I agree. If my team never got very far I couldn't imagine switching for that reason.
Yeah winning isn't everything but it does get pretty exciting.
And it gets pretty frustrating when we never win.
Yeah I hear you. So who do you think will get far in this upcoming season?
Well it's no surprise that the Patriots are looking promising. But the Packers and Steelers are looking pretty good too.
Yeah, I think the Seahawks have potential too.
I'm really excited for this season, we'll see who makes it to the Superbowl.
Yeah the Superbowl is pretty great, but I enjoy the whole season leading up to the Superbowl too.
Yeah of course, the Superbowl is the height of it but the whole season is pretty enjoyable.
Especially when teams that look promising go against each other, things get crazy!
Yeah I also really enjoy watching it with friends and family and make an event out of it.
Of course! The social aspect of it is all part of the fun!
I agree, it's all pretty exciting. Can't wait for this season.
Same here, the anticipation is killing me.
It'll be great. I wonder who will end up in the Superbowl. It's always hard to guess because you never know what'll happen.
