Hey Jerry, have you heard of Fitz and the Tantrums?
No. Who are they?
They are this awesome music group I have recently been turned on to.
Really? Would I know their music?
Possibly.
What kind of music?
They are a indie/pop kind of a band. Pretty talented too.
Oh really?
Yeah. None of this auto-tune crap we hear all of the time. These guys can really sing and make good music as a live band.
Where did you hear them play?
I first heard them on one of those artsy interview show where they talk with the band and them let them ply live.
Was that one of those Direct TV Guitar Center Sessions?
Yeah. I think so.
Those are pretty cool. Right?
Absolutely. And, when I heard Fitz and the Tantrums perform, it reminded me of some of the great pop bands of the eighties.
Really? Like who?
Hall and Oats was the first to come to mind. In fact, the lead vocalist is a guy that sounds alot like Darrel Hall.
Nice.
Here. You gotta listen to this song.
OK.
