What's your favorite Friday the 13th movie?
I don't really know.
I like them all, personally.
Friday the 13th, that's the one with Freddy Kruger, right?
Yeah that's his movies.
Those movies all blend together.
Did you know Johnny Depp was in one?
No, really, I didn't know that.
Yeah it's the second one, I think.
Man, he's been in a lot of movies.
