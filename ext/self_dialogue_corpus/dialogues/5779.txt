Who do you think was the best Disney villain?
I personally think it was Queen Grimhilde.
Which one was she again?
She was the one who poisoned Snow White because she was jealous of Snow White's looks.
I remember now.  It's also extra evil that she poisoned someone who was her own stepdaughter.
That's why she is my pick.  What about yours?
I think Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid' was way worse.
What was her evil plan again?
She used blackmail and deceit to win King Tritonâ€™s throne.
I would say that in my opinion, the two characters are very comparable in terms of who is more evil.
