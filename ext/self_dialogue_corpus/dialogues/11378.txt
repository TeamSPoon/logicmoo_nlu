I feel like Love Me Do was the Beatles best song
No way that wasnt a bad track but nowhere near the best.
So what would you say is the best?
Hey Jude.
OK I can see where you are coming from
Actually anything from Abbey Road as well.
So nothing from Peppers?
Peppers wasnt bad, but there was too much variety for me to nail a song down
I think that was the point of the album
Yeah it was a concept album in a relative sense.
