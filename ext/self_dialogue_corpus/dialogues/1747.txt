Did you watch last year's Super Bowl?
Of course I did. I watch every year, but especially if the Patriots are in it.
Oh then you must have loved this game.
Well, not all of it. The first half and most of the third quarter were a bit frustrating.
I don't think I've ever seen a game like that.
I don't think anyone has. To come back from 25 down in the regular season is nearly impossible, but in the Super Bowl?!
Unheard of until this year.
That's true. I think ten points down was the biggest comeback.
They even did it all without Gronkowski.
They had to. I hope he's healthy this year, and I'm excited that James White is coming back.
Yeah, I think the Pats will see a lot more of him.
I completely agree. They also added some excellent free agents and drafted pretty well too.
Belichick always has a way of turning nobodies in to sombodies.
Very true. I mean, Brady was the 199th pick.
Isn't that amazing?
They just have a way of getting these underrated guys and turning them into machines.
I wonder what would've happened if Christian Hackenberg went there.
I think it would've been pointless for him. With Garappolo and Jacoby behind Brady, there's just no need for someone so unproven.
That's true. It probably wouldn't have been a fit for anyone.
No. But then again, if you can learn from Brady wouldn't you take the opportunity?
