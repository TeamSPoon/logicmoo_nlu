Which Star Wars heroine do you like the most?
I really like Rey, but Princess Leia will always be my favorite heroine!
I also like Princess Leia the most!
I think it is sad that we won't get to see her in the upcoming Star Wars movies anymore.
I know, I was so bummed out when I heard what happened.
This means that the mantle will be passed down to Rey.
I have faith that Rey is going to become a great main character!
So do I!
I can't wait to see her fighting more with the lightsaber!
I wish the next Star Wars movie came out already!
