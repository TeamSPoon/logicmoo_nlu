That Camaro was sweet too.
Yep, 1969 Yenko Camaro.
427 cubic inches of solid american steel. 425 horses.
I think I prefer a 60s camaro over a mustang from the same time any day.
Well they haven't used a Shelby in any of their movies.
Oh Yeah Shelby GT is the best Mustang of them all.
Shelby Cobra GT 500. That's the car that needs to be in the movie.
That will be so rad. 1969 Shelby GT 500. Now that is the quintessential American muscle car
That's an icon of its day. Big bad, and beautiful. 428 cubic inches of American power.
7 liters of gasoline burning inside that engine. That's a lot of power.
