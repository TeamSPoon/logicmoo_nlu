Who do you think is the best RB ever?
Wow, that's some tough competition.
Oh sure.  You can make a case for a number of guys.
For me, I'll go with Jim Brown.
He was definitely a load to bring down.  A man among boys when he played.
Right, they couldn't stop him.
I'm not sure how well he would match up these days though.  Players are much bigger, stronger, faster.
Fair point I guess.
I would give the edge to Barry Sanders.
Hard to knock you on that.
To me, he was the best back ever even if he doesn't have many records.
Playing on a bad line didn't help him out.
He was so shifty though.  Can you imagine how well he would have done with a better line?
You mean one like Emmitt Smith had?
Right.  A good OL makes all the difference.
Within reason.  I mean, Smith had a great line, but he was also a great back.
Not discounting him, just saying it's easier to get yards when you have huge lanes to run through.
And Sanders never really had that advantage.
Exactly.  I bet he would have the single season and career record with a better group.
Guess we'll never know for sure.
