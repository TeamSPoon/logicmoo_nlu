Would you go to an all pop concert?
You mean like Justin Bieber?
Or Katy Perry?
I would love to hear California Girls in concert.
I bet the ticket cost is through the roof.
No they are a pretty average priced artist group.
Yeah I still do not think that I would afford the cost.
Katy Perry has alot of hits.
Yeah she could do a show of just singles.
What about other songs she has? She could do cover songs.
