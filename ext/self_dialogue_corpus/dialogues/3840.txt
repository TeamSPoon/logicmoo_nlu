Have you seen the movie called"Chucky" ?
Yes I have, is it about that doll that looks like a clown?
Yes, they are coming out with a new version this summer?
I like to watch those chucky movies they are scary.
One of the versions of  the  Chucky movies,he has a wife. The movie is called"Chucky's Bride".
The movie "Chucky's Bride" is really funny and scary.
The original "Chucky" movie was really  scary when the doll came to life.
Yea, I remember that part ,it was shocking.
The little kid in the "Chucky movie  knew chucky was a live, but know one believed him.
I like all the Chucky movies, I will be seeing the new one when it comes out this summer.
