I just saw Three Extremes.
Never heard of it.  What's it about?
Three short horror films directed by three separate East Asians.
Which film was your favorite?
Dumplings, by Lillian Lee.
What happens?
An aging actress buys dumplings for her youth.
Sounds innocent.
The dumplings are made from aborted fetuses.  She kills her own fetus to eat it.
Sounds gross!
