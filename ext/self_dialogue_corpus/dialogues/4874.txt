Did you see the Braves Blue Jays game?
No, what happened?
There were 5 near fights during the entire series.
Wow. Between those teams?
I know. They're not even rivals.
They play each other once every 3 years.
It got heated. The Blue Jays beaned 7 batters, including Freeman.
I hope the Braves retaliated.
Freeman's wrist was broken off one pitch.
Let me guess: Bautista had something to do with all of this.
Yeah, Bautista did a bat flip after hitting a homerun.
I think every team hates that guy.
The homerun and bat flip occurred when they were down 7-0.
The go has no class. I hope the Braves went after him.
They hit him the next game.
Did the benches clear?
No. It was that got him in the thigh. It didn't look like it affected him.
I can't wait until Bautista is out of the league.
He's always causing problems on the field.
It makes fans and teams hate the Blue Jays.
