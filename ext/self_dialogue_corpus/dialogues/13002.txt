This is going to sound weird but I kind of felt bad for Darth Vader.
I don't get how he was bullied around so much when he had so much power.
That always bothered me too.  Seemed like he could have destroyed anyone that crossed him.
I guess I felt bad for Vader until we met the Aniken version of him.
Aniken was super annoying, and he had so much crazy rage in him.
I think it was Hayden Christianson playing him though, I didn't like his acting.
I also thought he was a little bit stiff, but I think that is how he was supposed to be.
Ewan McGregor wasn't stiff though and he was a jedi.
I loved him in those movies!  He was my favorite.
Liam was pretty good as Qui-Gon Gin too.
