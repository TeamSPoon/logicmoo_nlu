I love to sing in the car when I'm driving, I don't even care if anyone sees.
Me too, my favourite is to blast some Blondie and get all Debbie Harry.
Yes! I prefer Demi Lovato, she makes me feel fierce.
True, ooh or what about Shakira?
Shakira is amazing. What about Joan Jett?
With the Runaways or the Blackhearts?
Either one. They both are so fun to rock out to!
They really are. I also love to get into some Heart.
Heart is legendary, my favourite is Crazy on You.
That's a great song! What about Never?
Never is fantastic. You know who else I really like, Rihanna.
Of course, I mean Rihanna is a modern classic. Not as much as Beyonce, but still.
Ooh Beyonce, yes she is a queen. Singing her stuff makes me feel very powerful.
Taylor Swift?
I hate to admit how much I like her. Especially when I'm driving around.
I know. But her songs are so catchy!
That's true. I also really like Elle King.
I know, her songs are kinda edgy but really fun. I can't believe her dad is that little guy from the Adam Sandler movies.
I had no idea? What about Katy Perry?
No. Never, Katy Perry.
