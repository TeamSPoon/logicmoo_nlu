Hey, you know those movie where a cop is investigating something, and in the end it turns out to be paranormal or supernatural?
Yeah, what about them?
Well, is there a name for that type of movie? Is that a genre?
Maybe conspiracy thriller?
No, I don't think so. Conspiracy thrillers usually have corporations or governments behind things.
Yeah, but it could turn out that the government is being run by demons or something?
Sure, but that's not really what I mean.
Maybe there's not a name for it? It's just a mashup of genres?
You'd think there would be. Like take The Devil's Advocate for example.
Yeah, that's supernatural, kind of a drama.
Yes, but it's also a thriller, because the characters don't realize that Al Pacino is the devil, and that Keanu Reeves is his son.
So you're looking for movies like that?
Well, not exactly. Take the other Keanu Reeves move Constantine, though.
He's been in a lot of supernatural thrillers, huh?
Yeah, but you're missing the point.
Which is that the two movies are similar, or they aren't?
They sort of are. It's more of a supernatural, action movie though.
Wait! I think that's an occult detective story!
I think you're right. That's the genre I was thinking of.
It must be! Those stories always start out normal, but then they end up involving ghosts or monsters or something.
