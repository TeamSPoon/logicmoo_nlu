That movie Taken was really good.
Yeah,  Liam Neeson is really good.
He's really become quite the action hero in his old age!
He's not that old!
He's 65.
That's getting up there a bit.
Not to take anything away from him. He's super good at doing action.
60 is the new 40!
Ha!
They just shouldn't make any more sequels.
