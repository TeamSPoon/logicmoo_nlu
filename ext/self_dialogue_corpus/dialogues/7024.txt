Do you like Pinocchio?
There are scenes I like but overall I did not.
The scene where he is talking about the strings attached to him.
I think that was probably the best one.
Thats some generous words.
I just think it stood for more than what was in front of you.
I agree it was a great scene.
And also where Jiminy Crickett was offering advice.
He did that alot.
That was sort of his role for the film.
