Do you like thriller movies?
No, what's that?
It's the kind of movie that usually have elements of suspense in it, and plays with characters with psychological instability.
Oh I remember my cousin mentioned Blair Witch Project. Does that count?
I guess so. That's an old one though, but very famous.
My cousin got so scared that he wanted to sleep in my room.
Funny, how old was he?
Sixteen. He got so scared that he avoids the garage at night.
Poor boy.
I don't think I would want to feel like that.
