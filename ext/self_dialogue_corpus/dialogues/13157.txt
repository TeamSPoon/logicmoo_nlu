Maybe it's just me, but I like Episodes Four, Five and Six the best.
How can you even say that!
I don't know, I just like vintage better?
It's so cheesy! And Luke's part is kind of lame.
It seems cheesy until you realize that hardly anyone had done a full length science fiction movie up to that point.
So they were pioneering the style and film techniques?
Exactly.
Okay, I can give them that.
Besides, the first three Star Wars movies filmed have Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Can't get better than that!
I guess they don't hurt anything!
