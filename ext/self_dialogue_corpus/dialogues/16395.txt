Do you want to talk about music?
Sure, music is universal
I love music, it always puts me in a better mood
Me too and no matter how you're feeling you can find a song about it.
Exactly, music is great.
Do you like classic music like Elvis?
Yes, I love Elvis
He was a great artist.
He was too bad there will never be anyone else like him
I know, he was one of a kind
I love jailhouse rock
Me too, my grandma used to have a phone that was elvis and it would play that song when it rang
That sounds great, I wish I had one of those
I would Der if they have elvis ring tones for sale.
I'm sure they do.
I'm going to get one, then I can listen to elvis all the time
It would have been so cool to see him in person.
It would have been.
He has a lot of great songs.
He really does
