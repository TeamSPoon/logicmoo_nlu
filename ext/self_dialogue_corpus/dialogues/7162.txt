Have you seen Disney's Sleeping Beauty?
Yes, of course. It's a classic.
I just love the music in it so much.
Have you heard the soundtrack to the live version of the movie?
Lana Del Rey's cover? Yes. It's so pretty and eerie.
I loved Maleficent.
I liked her better when she was evil to be petty rather than due to a tragic backstory.
Yes, but it has to make money doesn't it?
But if I know you, I know what you'll dooo. You'll love me at once, the way you did once -
Upon a dream.
