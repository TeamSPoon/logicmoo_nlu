What kind of music do you listen to while drunk?
The same thing that everyone does.
Which is?
Classical music with tons of brass, percussion, dissonance, and chromatic harmonies.
Umm, I don't agree with that.
No really, I enjoy it and analyze and appreciate it more when tipsy.
Why do you think that is?
Probably because my mind is open more and I hear things I hadn't before. What about you?
Teen pop music with female singers.
Seriously? You're a 35 year old male.
Yeah, I know.
Ok, who specifically?
Well, I subscribe to Katy Perry, Sia, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Lady Gaga to start.
Some of them are pretty talented.
Some?
Well, neither Katy nor Selena can really go full-on when live, and Ariana's voice is a bit too light.
True on Ariana, that's why she wasn't good in Hairspray.
I like Sia as her voice carries forever.
I'll try your drunk classical. Recommend me something?
Shostakovich Symphony no. 10, movements 2 and 4.
