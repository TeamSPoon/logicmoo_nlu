Did anyone see My Rachel yet, the movie?
No, I have not. What was it like?
I haven't seen it yet, but I do love thriller movies.
What is the story line?
Philip is a young Englishman who finds his cousin Ambrose dead after traveling to Florence, Italy. He vows revenge against the woman he thinks did the murder.
So Rachel must be the murderess!
I think so, but I haven't gotten to see it yet.  I am sure there is a twist in it!
It sounds like a great movie.  Who is the director?
Roger Michell is the director.
Who is the production company?
Fox Searchlight Pictures is the production company.
Who acts in it?
Rachel Weisz, Holliday Grainger, Iain Glen, and Sam Claiflin star in it.
I bet Rachel is the wealth stealer, and kills men to get to their money.
I wouldn't doubt it.
If you go on Saturday, I can go with you!
Are you sure?
Yes, do you want me to pick you up?
Yes, pick me up at noon, we will see a matinee.
Ok thanks!
