Did you see the point guard for the Celtics play?
No what did I miss?
Man he is a super human.
Oh really is he big?
No, he looks like a small guy out there.
How tall is he.
He is listed at 6 foot 3.
Oh so he is probably 6 foot 1 then
Yes because they measure him in his high tops, and round up.
Wow so he looks small out there, but is kinda big in real life?
Yes that is correct.
What did he do in the game?
He moves so well.
Oh really?
Yes he must have the most perfect body in the world in my opinon.
Wow those NBA point guards are amazing.
Yes they show what the human body is capable of.
When do they play next.
They play tomorrow.
Ok thanks I will watch him play.
