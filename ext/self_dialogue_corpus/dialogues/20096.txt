Do you like sci-fi movies?
Yes, I love them!
Which one is your favorite?
That's a tough question, but I think Blade Runner is probably my favorite.
Yeah, that's a classic for sure.
I love the look of everything. The production design is amazing.
And of course the soundtrack is amazing as well.
Yes, definitely. Vangelis was the perfect choice.
My favorite sci-fi movie is the original Star Wars.
That's probably most people's favorite sci-fi film.
I've loved it since I was a kid. And it still completely holds up to this day.
Yeah, you can't say that about a lot of movies.
It's great that they're coming out with all these new Star Wars films.
I agree. The more the better.
Right. It sure beats going 20 years between films.
The two most recent Star Wars films were really good.
Defeinitely. Which one did you like best?
I thought Rogue One was slightly better.
That's interesting. I thought the same thing.
I wonder if that's how most people feel?
