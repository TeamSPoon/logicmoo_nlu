Hey , do you like Disney movies?
Yeah, of course , I have been watching them since I was a kid. I still do.
So , who is your favorite Disney Princess?
Easy , That would be Jasmine
Jasmine ? Why so ?
Let's see , She is beautiful , smart and adventurous, a princess who doesn't need saving.
I agree , she got the goods . What's the best thing about her though?
She has a kickass tiger for her pet!
Oh! I totally forgot about it , that is pretty rad!
I know right! A freaking tiger as a pet , I don't know anyone who wouldn't be impressed.
