I'm so sick of radio these days.
Which songs?
All of them I'm afraid.  I can't find a decent rock song anymore.
It's a genre which just doesn't get the airplay.
It seems like all the rock artists are just being poppy now.
They have to actually get some radio play.
I know, but it's irritating.
I want to hear actual guitars, not drum machines.
Drum machines aren't that bad, it's the auto-tune garbage.
Which artists are doing that a lot lately?
For rock?  Well, it seems like I've heard that from Kings of Leon.
I think they're doing that to make their voice clearer, not necessarily auto-tune.
I know some country artists are pulling the same crap too.
The best auto-tune shall always be T-Pain.
Man, he was such garbage.
But people bought it up anyway!
Because people are sheep and will listen to nearly everything.
Well, everything but rock apparently these days.
Yeah, it's a sad world we live in.
Get used to it, buddy!
