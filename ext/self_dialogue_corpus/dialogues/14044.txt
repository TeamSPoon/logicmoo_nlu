Have you heard that new Justin Beiber Song?
Which one? I feel like he has a new song every day now.
The spanish one.
Oh that Despacito one? I don't think that's a Justin Beiber song, he is just featured on it.
Oh well that makes sense then.
What do you mean?
Well, he doesn't even know the words to the song.
Really? That's messed up.
I saw him at  a concert, and when that song started to play, he just said "Blah blah" for most of the words.
Wow, that's pathetic.
