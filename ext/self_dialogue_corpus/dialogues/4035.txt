Have you ever seen the movie Unfriended?
Is that the one about cyber bullying?
Yea that's the one!
I didn't like that one.
Oh, why not?
It just wasn't scary, and it was pretty supid.
I thought it was pretty intense.
It was just really difficult for me to watch a whole movie over skype.
Yea that part was pretty weird.
Yea, I definitely wish I could Unsee that.
