Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Oh my gosh, yes! It's so good!
I know! What was your favorite scene?
I love the opening. That first scene is fantastic.
Oh yeah. How cute is Groot?
He is hilarious, though I'm really looking forward to seeing teenage Groot.
I have to say I love the scene when they are taking back control of the Ravagers' ship.
Oh that is a fun scene, though I think Rainin' Men would have been a better song choice.
Agreed. Too bad we don't get to choose.
Yeah. Plus, hindsight is twenty-tewnty.
