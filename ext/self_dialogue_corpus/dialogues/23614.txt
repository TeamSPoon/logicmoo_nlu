Have you ever watched any Will Ferrel movies?
Of course!
Really, I just started. I like the Stepbrothers one.
Oh yes, that is classic. Seen any of the Anchormen movies yet?
No. Those are the ones with Paul Rudd right.
Yes, and the guy from the office and tons of cameos. They get funnier and funnier.
What other ones of his do you like?
His, oh Ricky Bobby, Taldega nights. So funny.
I have not seen it yet.
Wow, I have at least twenty times. It has Sacha Baron Cohen in it, pre-Borat.
Really? I like Borat, is it as raunchy?
No, more just funny not so many bad words. Have you seen Elf yet?
Yes, oh my I loved it. A young Zoey Dechenal.
She did great in that film.
Does he only do funny movies?
Mostly, but he did some more kind of drama.
What was that?
Stranger than Fiction. Tidbit, there is a cameo of those Sonic commercial guys before they were famous, they were just extras in that film.
Wow. The one show, what was it called, oh, The Campaign, had me in stiches.
That one had so many great lines.
