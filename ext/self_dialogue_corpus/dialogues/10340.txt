Did anyone get to see the Fate of the Furious yet?
I saw it, it was fantastic! I love the cars!!!
Oh yes, that is so much fun to see all those beautiful flying cars!
If I had the money , I would have twenty cars in my garage!
What was the movie about?
Well Dom and his team go into retirement of sorts, but had to be called out of it due to some unexpected villains.
Who is in the movie?
Charlize Theron, Vin Diesel of course, the normal crew, even Kurt Russell was in on this one.
Sounds great, I definitely want to see it.
You should, the cars are amazing.
