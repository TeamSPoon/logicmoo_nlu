I was reading a page of Yoda quotes from Star Wars, and I thought about how true they are today.
Yoda was so cute. What were some of the quotes?
“You must unlearn what you have learned.”
That's true. Sometimes we learn things that aren't good for us, and we have to learn to forget them.
“Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.”
That's especially true of politics and religion.
“Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future…the past. Old friends long gone.”
That's what people who believe in Heaven believe will happen to them someday.
"In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way."
That is true about how we often in life have a hard time, but using knowledge helps us figure out what to do. Yoda was pretty smart.
