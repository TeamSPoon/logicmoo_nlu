What is your favorite year of your favorite team?
I loved the 2007 Indianapolis Colts.
That's an odd choice.
The Colts are my team.
Is 2007 when they won the Super Bowl?
Yeah, we were the champions.
Who did they have on that team?
Peyton Manning was our quarterback.
Didn't they have Bob Sanders?
Yeah Bob was our free safety.
Bob Sanders was a beast.
Yeah he was great when he wasn't injured.
Who else did they have?
We had Dwight Freeny as our defense end.
Dwight was a great player.
We also had Reggie Wayne.
Did they have Marvin Harrison.
Oh yeah, Marvin was on that team.
That's a stacked team.
I agree. That's why we won the Super Bowl that year.
