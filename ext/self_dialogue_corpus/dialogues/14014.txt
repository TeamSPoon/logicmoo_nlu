Hey, Did you know that  Lady Gaga's name was inspired by the Queen song, 'Radio Gaga'.
Really, I didn't know that.  I loved her Gaga debut album The Fame.
Yes, I liked The Fame very much but didn't know about her then.
I liked her second song "Born This Way."
Amazing lyrics of that song.  My favorite one is:  Don't hide yourself in regret Just love yourself and you're set
I wish we could always remember this.  I think Lady Gaga must follow this advice and it made of successful.
Is there another song of hers that you like?
I love her Alejandro song.
I love the costume and special affects in that album.
Yes, but I don't the coffin being carried.  It looks a bit morbid.
