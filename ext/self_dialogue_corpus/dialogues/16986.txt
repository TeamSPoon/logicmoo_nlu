What are some modern classical music genres that I might like?
Um... how will i know what you will like?
I like atonal stuff, I don't l;iek classical period like Mozart, but I like Bach and Chopin. Oh and Atonal stuff
Hm. Don't liek MOzart, you might not be a music fan
Haha you think you're so funny.
Well the thing about the modern era, that is a period starting from, say, 1890s to 1970s, is that there were plenty of pleurality
That's a BIG word for you.
Haha, now you think you're funny.  Anyway, plurality in this case referring to the presence of multiple genres coexisting
Not one dominating like Chopin in Romatic period?
Precisely.
Well name some popular one then
Popular now or then?
Either way. Why is this so difficult?
It's not difficult, just that there are so many. I guess best known Modern composer might be Debussy., but really that's my favorite, not the best per se.
Debussy, even his name sounds modern.
it doesn't sound modern, he's just French
Ah, that country again.
Anyway, there are a few things he did in his music that was totally new at the time.
Like what?
Like... use of pentatonic scales borrowed from eastern music, whole tone scales, bitonality, and abundant use of paralle chords.
