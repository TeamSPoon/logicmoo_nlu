Katy Perry really has been a chameleon, hasn't she?
I know she's done a few things.    What are you thinking about?
Well, currently she has a completely new look with her new album.
Yes, I heard Witness, and liked it more than some of her other stuff.
Then before that was the Roar single.
Good song, loved the outfit in that video and on Graham Norton.
Did you like that more than the whipped cream video for California Gurls?
I had forgotten about that.      Yes, and wasn't there a rapper in that video too?
Yes, Snoop Dogg was at the beginning.
Didn't she also tie some sort of chart record?
I believe so.       I think she had five number one singles from her most popular album.
Which album was that?
The Teenage Dream album
That's the one.     Anyone do that it the past?
Maybe Michael Jackson with Bad.
One thing about her though, I think her second album made her popular.
Really?    I don't think One of the Boys was as popular as some of her others.
It wasn't, but it had that song I Kissed a Girl
Understood!    Yes, the sexiness launched that song.
True, and even a marriage to Russell Brand could not stop that train!
