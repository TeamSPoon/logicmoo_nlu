The kids and I watched Moana today.
How did you like it?
It was really good.  I had no idea Dwayne Johnson sang that well.
I remember he sang really well in The Mysterious Island.
Oh yeah, with the ukulele!  I'd forgotten that.
I can see why.  It's the berry scene that sticks in my memory.
That's always what I think of first too.
Was Moana worth seeing in the theater?
Yes, I think it was.  Even if you have a big television, you can see the artwork better on the movie screen.
Maybe I'll take my kids next week.
