Do you watch NFL football.
Yes, I am a big fan.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Chicago Bears.
Really? I don't know any Bears fans in this area.
I have been a fan since I watched them win the Super Bowl in 1986.
I don't think they have won one since then. Have they?
No, but I am hopeful that they will soon.
What teams are some of their rivals?
Right now, the Lions and the Packers are big rivals of the Bears.
Oh, that's interesting. I know a lot of Packers fans.
Don't introduce them to me!
I'll try not to. Why should I root for the Bears?
Well, their 2016 season wasn't very good, but I think they are bound to turn things around this year.
Who are some of your favorite players?
Mike Ditka is one of my favorite old players, but I like Jay Cutler, too.
I think I heard Jay left the team.
Yes, he did. What a shame.
So do you think I could watch a Bears game with you some time?
Sure, just bring some snacks!
