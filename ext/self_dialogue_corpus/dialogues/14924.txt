Do you have a favorite comedy movie out right now?
Yes, I really like Baywatch.
Oh yea, Baywatch was amazing when I watched it.
I really like how the Rock is branching into comedy movies.
Yes, I agree. His career is really taking off into the next level.
It is good to see him transition from one career to another so easily.
What comedy do you like?
I really like Fist Fight.
That one was great as well with Ice Cube.
Yes, Ice Cube was very funny in that film, just as he is in the others.
