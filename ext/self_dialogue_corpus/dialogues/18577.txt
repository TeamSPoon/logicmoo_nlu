I use to really like Smashmouth.
Me too! They were great!
I'm suprised they only have one album.
No, they had five albums. Only one had hits on it.
Really?
Yes, they had an album called Fush Yu Mang that had Wlaking on the Sun on it.
I remember that.
Then they put out Astro Lounge that had All Star and When the morning comes. that was their prime.
Oh wow, i thought all those songs were on the same album.
No, you may be thinking of their greatest hits album that had all of them on it.
They had a greatest hits album?
Yes. They even put out a Christmas Album if you can believe that.
No way! That's awesome.
Yeah. Their last album had no hits on it.
Unfortunately by around 2008 band members were turning around like resturant workers,
Thats sad. Any reason why?
Rumor has it that it became difficult to work with frontman and vocalist Steve Hartwell but no one knows for sure.
Unfortunate, they had a uniques sound.
Yes, it was another SKA Band that had a hard time with main stream.
Like No Doubt?
