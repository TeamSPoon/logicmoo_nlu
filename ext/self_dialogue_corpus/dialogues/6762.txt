Do you watch disney movies?
Yes, do you?
Yes
Have you seen inside out?
That was the cutest movie
I enjoyed it.
It gave a wierd and different perspective to the human body
It did.  I thought the ending was funny where it showed again conteolling the man
And sadness controlling the woman.
They should come out with another one
