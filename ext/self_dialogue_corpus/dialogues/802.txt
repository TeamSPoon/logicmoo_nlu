Are you ready for some football?
You better believe it!  Who is your team?
America's team!
Hahaha. You can't mean the Dallas Cowboys?
Yes, the Dallas Cowboys!  They have won 5 Superbowls!
Not in this century!  My team is the New England Patriots.
The Patriots?  They are nothing without Tom Brady!
Well the Patriots have Garoppolo as a backup!
Garoppolo is garbage!  If he becomes starting quarterback the Patriots win no more Superbowls.  I doubt they even go 8-8 with Garoppolo.
Garoppolo will proof you wrong.He has a QB rating of 113.3.
Now if you want to talk about a run for the Superbowl lets talk the Cowboys.
Cowboys?  Are they bringing back Aikman or Staubach?
That's funny!  But we did get 5 Superbowl wins with them.
True but that was back in the VCR era.
Well the Cowboys are a true team and not a one hit wonder.
Tom Brady has 5 Superbowl wins.  That is hardy a one hit wonder.
Whatever!  The Cowboys will prove they are America's team with Dak Prescott.
Prescott is a kid that has not done anything yet.
Well the Cowboys went 13-3 last year under his leadership.
And lost to the Packers!  Prescott still has to prove himself.
