Have you seen Silence of the Lambs?
That was a good movie.  Anthony Hopkins was incredible.
Hannibal Lecture is one of my favorite bad guys.
I know, he's smart, and sophisticated.  Yet a total monster underneath.
Jodi Foster was really good too.
I guess that's why they both won Oscars.
Yeah that movie swept the major awards that year.
With good reason.  That whole thing had you guessing the whole time.
What about Hannibal's big escape?
That was a thing of masterhood.
They way he tricked everyone.  And was in the ambulance the whole time.
Maybe the best part of the movie was when he took that face off.
Don't forget his final line about "having an old friend for dinner."
They guy was just pure creepy.
Speaking of creepy what about Buffalo Bill?
That guy was a freak show.
Yeah, put the lotion in the basket is one of the creepiest and well known lines from movies.
He sure did like that dog though.
Who cares if he liked the dog he skinned women to make a dress.
Nobodies perfect.
