I wish they would make more musicals.
I do, too. When I was a kid, my favorite movie was Oliver!
Isn't that the movie that has the song Consider Yourself?
It is and it was sung by Jack Wild in the film.
I liked a Chorus Line and One is my favorite song from it.
Oh the dancing in that movie was so precise.
Another musical I like is Sweeny Todd.
I've heard of it, but have never seen it.
It's rather out there and not something for kids to see.
Who is the star of it?
Johnny Depp.
Johnny Depp can sing?
Johnny Depp has a really good voice. There's a song he sings called Friends and his voice has such a good tone to it.
A musical I've heard a lot about, but haven't seen is Mama Mia.
I've heard it was good.
Me, too and I've listened to the music a lot of have enjoyed it.
What about the classic musicals. Do you have a favorite?
The Sound of Music.
I haven't watched that in a long time.
Neither have I, but now that we're talking about it, I want to see it again.
