Are you going to see Wonder Woman?
I'm not sure yet. I'm kinda burnt out on super hero movies.
But this one has really good reviews.
Oh yeah? Where did you see that?
On Rotten Tomatoes. It's currently rated at 95%.
Wow! That is surprising. I know the last few DC movies haven't been great.
Sadly, that's true. I'm a big DC fan, but Marvel has been killing it in the theater.
The Marvel movies are pretty great.
Warner Brothers just promoted Geoff Johns, one of DC's best writers to the head of DC's film division.
Interesting. How do you think that will go?
I think the results are already showing. Wonder Woman seems to be much higher quality than the last two movies.
I saw Suicide Squad. It was amusing, but pretty average.
I agree. I still think it was better than the critics said, though.
How did you feel about Batman Vs. Superman?
Pretty much how I felt about Suicide Squad. It was not great, but way better than the critics indicated.
That's fair. I wonder if the critics were a little biased, comparing it to Marvel movies in their mind.
I think it's only natural to do that, since Marvel has done such a great job, but I feel that each movie should be reviewed on it's own merits.
Right. Not everything should be a competition.
Well, I'm going to see Wonder Woman tonight at 8pm, if you want to go.
I'll check my schedule and let you know.
