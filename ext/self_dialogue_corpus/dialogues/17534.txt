What do you think of Britney Spears?
I don't know, I used to like her.
Me too, I loved her music back in the 1990's.
She went crazy after all that fame.
I remember that, but she still makes great music.
Her voice is unique.
Yes it is, I still like her songs.
I sometimes still listen to her older albums.
Me too, my favorite album of hers was Oops I Did It Again!
Mine too!  I love the song Lucky!
Yes that is a great song but her song Crazy is my favorite!
Hopefully she makes a huge comeback.
Yes, I love to see that.
Have you ever been to any of her concerts.
Yes, years ago I went to one of her concerts and it was great!
I'd attend one of her shows if she went on tour again.
The ticket prices are high, but she has great energy!
What was your least favorite album of hers?
I didn't like her Circus album much.
Me either.
