The fall season is months away and you know what that means
Another season of some football?
That's right. Another season of me hoping anyone but the patriots win.
You can say that again. I don't think I can stomach another repeat of that last Superbowl.
Do you think there are any sleeper teams who could dethrone them this season?
I legitimately think that the Giants could.
Really? Tell me more.
Well their defense is a top 10 defense and Brady always seems to struggle against such.
What about the Giants' offense? They struggled mightily.
That is one of the main things that makes it a huge gamble if I were a betting man.
I know their offensive line was bad last year, but jeez Eli looked pretty bad too.
Their running game could definitely use some help too.
They don't need to be a top running team to be a threat. It just has to be a threat to the opposing defense somewhat.
Yeah. Any kind of running game would make their receivers even more of threat.
Hopefully they do make the necessary changes. If they do then I definitely agree with what you are saying.
Odell is always a big factor as well.
Yeah, his mental toughness is almost non-existant
He is such an amazing receiver. All these antics need to stop.
Even the front office said they were tired of it and that he needs to mature.
He does or else he is going to end up being the next Terrell Owens and universally hated and ringless.
