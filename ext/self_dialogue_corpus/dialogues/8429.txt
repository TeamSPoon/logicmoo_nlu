Have you heard any good pop music lately?
I'm really into that new Ed Sheeran song.
Do you mean, "Shape of You"?
Yes! That's the one! The beat just makes me want to get up and dance!
I totally know what you mean, I find myself dancing in the car to it when it comes on the radio.
Do you have any other songs you've been into from the pop genre lately?
Of course! Since it's one of my favorite genres, I know a lot of songs in the category.
Name another one that you really like.
I love Bruno Mars' new song, "That's What I Like."
You know, I was really surprised because I love that one too! I don't like much of his new stuff.
