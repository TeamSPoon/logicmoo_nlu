Do you like the Killers
Is that Brandon Flowers' band?
Yes, well yes and no.
What do you mean?
It's not necessarily his band, but he's a part of it.
I thought Flowers did his own work as well.
Yes, he has done a lot of work on his own.
Okay, anyway, yes I like the Killers
Yes, I really liked Mr Brightside. Great song.
Yeah, I really liked their Sam's Town album.
Oh yeah, that was a good one.
Yeah, When You Were Young is a great track.
Yeah, that's a good one.
I also really liked For Reasons Unknown
I don't remember that one. What is Sam's Town anyway?
I think it is a casino somewhere in Vegas.
Yeah, they have a lot of connections to Vegas.
I think that's where they started.
Ah yes, that makes sense then.
Yes, always a connection of some sort.
