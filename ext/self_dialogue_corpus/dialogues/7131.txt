I wish they would make another movie like The Emperor's New Groove.
That was a great movie! It was so funny.
Even the villain, Yzma, was funny!
I loved her and her sidekick, Kronk. I'll never forget that "Pull the lever, Kronk!" scene.
Also, Kronk could talk to squirrels.
I guess he was more Disney Princess than villain, since he could talk to animals!
Does that mean Kuzco was the ultimate Disney Princess, since he turned into an animal?
I don't think that's how it works!
My favorite part was when Yzma detailed her evil plan, though.
That was hilarious!
