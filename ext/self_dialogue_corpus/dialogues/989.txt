Will the NFL expand ever again?
No I think they have a good thing going with the franchises they have.
I think they could go global.
I see London as a huge hurdle.
Whys that?
The currency exchange, the 6 hour time difference just to name a couple.
They play more games there this year than they ever have.
I know and I am sure theres a lot of grumblings from players about it.
You almost always do have to take a bye when you get back
Right and imagine having to take a bye on week 2
Or if you are a division opponent
Yeah so you are put at a disadvantage.
Exactly and players wont want to live that far overseas
How about in Mexico
I think the problem there is fans like soccer more than football
They always sell out the stadiums there
Yeah for one or two games a year
True but they have shown they have an appetite for it
That would be a better location than London
But Trump might put a hold on those plans
