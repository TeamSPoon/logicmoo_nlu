It is Friday night! I am in the mood to see a good thriller movie!
Oh geez! You know how I feel about thriller movies.
I know! I love watching you jump during the scariest part of the movie.
Well, don't let me hold the popcorn this time. What do you want to see?
How do you feel about Annabelle; Creation?
I have never seen any of the Annabelle movies because they're too creepy.
Annabelle is one of my favorite thriller genres within the last five years.
How about we see a romantic comedy?
No thanks. If you see a thriller movie with me tonight, I will see a romantic comedy with you next time around.
Sounds like we have a deal!
