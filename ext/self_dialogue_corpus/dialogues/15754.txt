Do you like Kanye West?
Oooof. That's a tough subject, he's such a contentious figure.
I know, right? His early stuff less so, but his public actions and recent work inspires a lot of love and a lot of hate.
He's definitely a master at curating all these different sounds. Think of The Life of Pablo, how those old gospel samples run behind a Kid Cudi lead and are followed by a Kanye sing-songy lyric.
That song rises and falls so gloriously.
Right! And even if you don't like his lyrics it just sounds so good!
Yeah, his lyrics have never been that great to me, but he has gotten so egotistical and crass.
Those lyrics about Taylor Swift weren't clever to me. They were just crude and attention seeking.
Yeah. We have to touch on something else though.
Okay, what is it?
The Life of Pablo is such an interesting concept.
Why because of the gospel of Paul and Pablo Escobar being such disparate figures.
Well, that's something, but I was thinking more about how it got updated.
Oh yeah! That was a huge and strange innovation, that the album wasn't done completely and might be updated for a long time.
Mmm-hmm. Remember the famous "Imma fix Wolves" on Twitter?
Ha! Ha! Ha! That was the best moment of the whole saga.
Yeah, it raises some interesting questions though. In the digital age, why shouldn't albums get updates just like games get patches?
For one, if it gets updated too much, it can get confusing what album one is listening to. Why not just release B-sides and alternate mixes.
I guess that's true. A complete erasure of the previous "version" does make me feel odd.
I agree, but I may just be out of touch.
