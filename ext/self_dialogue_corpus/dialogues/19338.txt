Hello there which standard artist was better in the mid 60s?
Well there were many during that time lets say Perry comp?
Perry Como, wasnt bad Dean Martin was better .
Dean was very smooth and a lady's man.
Yes he was. How about Mel torme he had a voice smooth as velvet.
Oh I forgot a out him he was very cool.
I think I would hvae to choose the chairman of the board frank Sinatra.
Yeah he was hip back then and all the ladys loved his voice. But darin was just as good.
Darin who?
Bobby Darin he could sing with all of them and really make a number jazzy
Yeah I forgot about bobby.
Yeah my favorite song by him is mack the knife.
What about if I were a carpenter?
That song was okay , the musicians back then sang sane songs.
Your kind of right avout that.
I think standards is the music of life.
Yes it truely is goea with a out anything your going through.
Yes any e can relate.
Sinatra really made standards meaningful.
They all did in there own way.
