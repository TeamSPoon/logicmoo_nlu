Have you ever listened to Fiona Apple?
I'm not sure, is that a singer?
Yes, a female singer. She had a very popular album about 20 years ago.
What were some of her songs?
Well on her first album she had Shadowboxer, Criminal, Sleep to Dream. The entire album was fantastic.
The song titles sound familiar. Did she play the piano?
Yes, she did. You may remember her winning a Grammy award for Criminal.
Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now. What was her first album called again?
Her first album was Tidal.
That album was wildly successful right? I remember that album being a big deal with a lot of people I went to school with.
Yes, it was. On top of the Grammy she won for Criminal, the album went either double or triple platinum.
Did she ever do anything after that? I can't remember if she released music after Tidal.
Yes, she did. Actually, interestingly enough she named her next album after a poem she wrote. It was in the Guiness Book for longest song title at the time of release I think.
Wow, I hadn't heard that. She was kind of different wasn't she?
She seems very creative and like she doesn't filter her self expression. I mean, she's an artist so it makes sense.
I can remember liking that about her even though I didn't listen to her music all that often.
I think a lot of musicians in the art pop genre are very different and expressive in ways that aren't the norm. I also like that she plays the piano beautifully and writes her own music.
That is so cool. I thought she left the music world for awhile.
Yes, I think she went on hiatus for awhile but eventually came back to record and release more music.
I'm actually starting to remember liking her voice a lot. It was really soulful and different.
