Have you seen the movie Brave?
Yes - it's one of my favorite Disney movies in a long time.
Merida is such a cool Disney princess.
Her hair is perfect, too!
I was glad that she didn't have to get married until she chose to.
Guess all it took was turning her mom into a bear.
As with every Disney movie, it all worked out in the end.
What was your favorite song?
I liked the "Learn Me Right" Mumford and Sons song.
I liked that they used Gaelic songs in the film.
