I heard you're kind of an expert on films, is that true?
Sure is, I see one just about every weekend!
Whoa, that's commitment. Can you suggest one for me then, maybe?
Sure, what genre do you like?
I wanted to go see a movie with my brother this weekend, and he likes sci-fi.
Okay, how about The Circle?
What's that about?
It's about a woman who gets a job at a social media company, then discovers some big-brother style secrets.
Who's in it?
Emma Watson, John Boyega, and Tom Hanks star in this film.
Oh, I loved John Boyega in Star Wars!
Yeah, he's quite the breakout actor.
And Tom Hanks, he's in everything.
Yeah, I don't think there's a single film genre he hasn't been in at some point or other.
I love him in Saving Private Ryan, but boy is that a tough one.
He doesn't shy away from the tough roles.
The Circle isn't as rough as that, is it?
Oh no, The Circle's much more tame. More of a B-type dystopia movie.
Okay then, I guess I'll see it. Thanks!
No problem, enjoy your film!
