I can not wait until September!
What is so great about that month?
The NFL will be back and I am really excited about it!
Who is your favorite team?
I am a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan.
Are they supposed to have a pretty good team coming back?
We should be pretty good yet again, at least I am hoping!
How did the team do last year?
We were pretty good; we finished 12-5 and went undefeated in the division.
That sounds like a really good season. What happened in the playoffs?
That did not go so well! We lost to the Steelers by two points.
I bet that was a very tough loss to swallow.
It most certainly was. I did not watch the rest of the playoffs after that.
Wow, you must have been devastated in order to miss the rest of the playoffs.
I was; I do not take losses like that very well at all!
How do you feel overall about the coaching right now?
I feel that Andy Reid has done a pretty solid job so far.
Has he ever guided a team to the Superbowl?
Yes, he actually took the Philadelphia Eagles there several years ago.
Well, maybe he will get the Chiefs to the same point.
