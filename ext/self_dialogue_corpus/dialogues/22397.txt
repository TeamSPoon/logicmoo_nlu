My sister and I never agreed on movies. She liked Disney, I like Depp, except in Disney.
Did she drag you to those pirate movies?
Yes. That's how I know I didn't like Depp in them.
I bet she liked Lord of the Rings, too.
Yes. Everything magical, anything elfin.
So Harry Potter, stuff like that.
I've seen all the Potter movies. That's sisterly love--of course it's better than wrestling.
I don't think there are wrestling movies.
At least not yet. God forbid, but you know, we both liked Edward Scissorhands.
Oh, I liked that one too. A good old movie.
Yes. Depp's really acting in that, not posing.
And Winona Ryder was excellent too. We saw her change from frowsy slug to Edward's idea of her.
Exactly. That's a truly magical movie.
It made me cry.
Oh, me too. At the end there--movies almost never make me cry.
You don't want to be manipulated, right?
Oh, I don't know. A film's supposed to move you. Thing is, it made my sister cry too.
You cried together. A good thing.
Yeah. It's a sweet memory of her.
So sorry, still.
