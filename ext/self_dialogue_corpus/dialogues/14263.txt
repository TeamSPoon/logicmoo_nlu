So who do you think are going to the finals?
It's going to be a rubber match between the Cavs and the Warriors.
Who will come out on top?
Well they both have a victory over the other so it's hard to tell, but I want the Cavs to win.
Lebron is looking scary but the other star players aren't playing their best and they can't win the championship if he doesn't have help.
He makes everyone around him better they'll be fine.
That's not going to be enough against the Warriors.
Well the Warriors are starting Zaza so I think were're covered.
Neither team has lost in the playoffs yet which is incredible.
That's why I say they will meet in the finals again.
Warriors don't have their coach Steve Kerr to help them later in the playoffs.
I think they would need him to win the finals so I hope he gets well soon.
Don't sleep on any of the other teams. Huston and San Antonio have a chance.
Yeah but San Antonio just lost Tony Parker and they can't win a championship without him.
Do you think Huston can contend with the warriors?
I think the might beat them once maybe twice but could not beat them in a series.
You're probably right about that.
But it's the NBA anything can happen.
Guess we'll just have to wait and see.
The sooner the better.
