Have you seen The Fate of the Furious?
No, not yet. I'm dying to. I love those movies.
I heard that it's one of the most expensive movies ever made.
I can't imagine the price tag. But it's killing at the box office, I'm sure.
Remember the first one that came out?
Of course! I can't believe that came out, like, 16 years ago.
Vin Diesel was astonishing in that one.
I was hooked from the very beginning. Totally. Blew me away.
Now I have the watch the first one again. Maybe tonight!
Sounds like a plan.
