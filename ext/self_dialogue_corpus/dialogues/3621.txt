Did you see the movie Get Out?
Not yet! I missed it in theaters and was going to order the blu ray.
It's Great! Jordan Peele is clearly a horror movie fan.
Why do you say that?
You can pick out references to others classic horror movies.
I think I read something about that in a review in relation to the commentary.
Did you know that Katherine Keener is in it?
What? I had no idea.
Yup. She plays the mom of Rose. The Co-lead.
Oh! That's her? I read that the mom was scary!
