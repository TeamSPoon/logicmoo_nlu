Would Biggie still be relevant if he was alive today?
I doubt he would be.
But his style was so good.
I dont think he would be able to survive the lyrics.
What do you mean?
His lyrics wouldnt be able to hold up
He would be able to freestyle?
Yeah but thats something thats not hard to do.
Professionals are pretty good at it
Yeah and he lends himself to being able to do it
