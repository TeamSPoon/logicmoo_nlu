I can recall seeing the December 1967 NFL Championship game on tv when I was 4 years old.
Oh my gosh! That was the "Ice Bowl", the Cowboys against the Packers.
Yes, in Green Bay. Minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit! Then it dropped to minus 20...
That's considered to be one of the greatest games in football history. Lucky seeing that!
I remember wondering why people were sitting there on stone benches in Lambeau Field, trying to stay warm.
Right. Fifty-one thousand people! They could have been home in Milwaukee or where ever watching on tv.
Vince Lombardi was the coach, Bart Starr the Quarterback...
A lot of the Green Bay Packers had a hard time getting to the game. Their cars wouldn't start!
Oh, that's right. I think it was the a Linebacker who had to hitch a ride to get to the game on time.
And the Referees wore ear muffs! The opening whistle actually stuck to the Ref's lips!
Right. They had to use voice commands for the rest of the game.
Shame no regular person had a video recorder back then. No full copy of the tv broadcast is known to exist.
What? You're kidding me! How stupid.
Only the Cowboy's radio broadcast, and the Green Bay radio recording.
I remember Don Meredith, the Cowboy's Quarterback, handing off the ball in the fourth quarter, and the RUNNING BACK making the pass!
Yes, a 50-yard pass to make the score 17-14 for the Cowboys.
I remember Packers slipping on the ice near the 1-yard line! They said one player actually scored, but the Ref didn't see it.
Some players on the COWBOYS years later said they thought that Anderson scored a touchdown.
And Bart Starr ran the ball in himself, making the score 20-17 for the Packers, 13 seconds left.
Game ended 21-17. Bart Starr didn't even tell his own players that he was going to try running it in. Only Lombardi knew!
