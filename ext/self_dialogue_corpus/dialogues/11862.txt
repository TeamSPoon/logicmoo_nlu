Do you like Hey Jude?
Yeah I think its one of the best songs they ever wrote.
I loved the instrumentatin on the song.
I think alot of the song parts were written well.
The switch of pace worked well in the song.
And I think the vocals were almost too perfect.
Yeah the inflection used made a huge impact.
I dont think anyone has tried to even cover it
Sure they have thats the point of music
But could anyone have written a track like that?
