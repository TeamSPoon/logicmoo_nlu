I just watched the movie American Pie. Have you seen it?
Yes! That movie is comedy gold.
I thought Jason Briggs was so funny as Jim Levenstein. Who is your favorite?
My favorite character was Michelle Flaherty played by Alyson Hannigan.
She is funny. I really like her as an actress in general.
She was also in How I Met Your Mother and was really good.
All the characters are really good in this movie. I liked Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum to.
Wasn't she played by Tara Reid?
Yes she was!
Oh yea. I liked her too.
