Ever heard of Nick Hakim?
No, man. Who is that?
He's a hiphop artist. I think he's kind of new.
Yeah, I've never heard of him. What's his music like?
Well, it's hiphop, like I said. But he's also got this really funky 70's vibe going on.
Like a psychedelic thing?
Yes, exactly. You should check out the song Roller Skates. You'll never get it out of your head.
Now you've got me curious. Does he have any videos?
Yep. In fact, Roller Skates has a really trippy video. You should look it up.
I will, man. Thanks for the recommendation.
