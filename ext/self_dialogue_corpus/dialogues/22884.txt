What is your all time favorite movie?
I would have to say Forrest Gump.
No way! I really love that movie.
What's your favorite part of it?
When Forrest wins the scoring touchdown and runs right through the endzone.
That is a great part.
Is that your favorite part as well?
No my favorite part is when he runs all the way across the country without stopping.
That part is a classic!
What's your opinion of Jenny?
I didn't like her at all. I thought she was mean.
I have the same view! I don't understand why everyone seems to like her so much.
Forrest deserved someone much better.
I wholeheartedly agree!
Little Forrest is probably my favorite character.
He is just too cute!
I agree. Him and Forrest were such a great pair.
I agree. One of my favorite father and son pairs from movies at all times.
I never really thought about who my favorite father and son pair was but they would definitely be up there.
Glad you agree!
