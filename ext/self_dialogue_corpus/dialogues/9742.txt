Do you ever listen to Drake music at all?
I do a good bit actually!
Isn't he hot?
Of course he is! I love his voice too.
Yes it's different. In a good way!
What's your favorite song of his?
I liked his song "Hotline Bling".
Me too! I remember when that came out.
The music video is kind of weird though.
It's a little strange. He looks great in it though.
