I'm lucky, being older than you.
How do you figure that?
I got to see Braveheart in the theater.
Okay, I admit it's probably really cool in the theater.
Yes. And I saw Gladiator in the theater. These big sweeping historical movies are completely different in the theater.
I never thought about it.
I got to see Fight Club in the theater, before everybody already knew every spoiler in it.
Yeah, when I saw it I had already heard most of the lines.
It was completely different in the theater. And I saw Sixth Sense in the theater.
How was that?
It was this movie that you weren't sure if it was supposed to be scary and about ghosts or what, there really hadn't been a lot of hype about it.
That's hard to imagine.
I know. It just blew everybody away. That was before everybody knew the little boy says "I see dead people".
What else did you see in the theater that I'll never have the chance to.
I saw Predator, Alien and Aliens in the theater.
Dang, I bet that was an awesome experience.
And I saw Star Wars in the theater.
Which one?
The first three.
You mean 4, 5 and 6?
