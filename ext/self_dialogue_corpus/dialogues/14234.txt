What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?
The cure is really good
Really? I find it to be boring
Why is that?
I just prefer her dance tracks that's all
What song is your favorite then?
I love Poker Face!
It's a good song, but isn't it overrated
I don't think so, I just think a lot of people like it because its so good
I can't argue with that
