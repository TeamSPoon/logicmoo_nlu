What do you think of Eminem?
I think he had a very rags to riches story.
Why do you think that?
You don't know his life story, they made a movie on him.
No they made a movie about him?
Eight Mile.
What was found out?
Well he lived in a trailer had a hard life and fought his way to even get a gig when Dre saw something in him and took him under his wing the rest is history.
That's awesome, I didn't know he had a rough life.
Yeah it's sad but also happy.
