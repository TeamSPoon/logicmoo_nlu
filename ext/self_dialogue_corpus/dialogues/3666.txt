Did you ever see Shivers?
I don't think so. What was it about?
A guy creates a parasite creature that starts infecting people in an apartment building and making them deviants to reproduce itself.
Sounds like something I'd like. Who's in it?
The only star I recognized was Barbara Steele from the old Dark Shadows and Piranha.
The old one from the 70s?
Yes, she was one of the doctors.
That was a great movie!
I liked it too. It was much better than the one from a few years ago.
Yes, I only like thrillers too.
