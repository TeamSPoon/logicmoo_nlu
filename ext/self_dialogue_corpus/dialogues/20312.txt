Have you seen the latest Star Wars movies?
No, I have no real interest in watching them to be honest.
Oh? Why is that?
Well, I just feel it's the same rehashed stuff all over again with minor nuances.
Man, it's so good, you really have no idea.
How so?
There's just twists and turns you wouldn't see coming.
I would because I've read all about them.
Whaaat why???
Well, I wanted to see what they were about and gauge my interest. Really it was just the episode 7 one.
Oh okay so you haven't ruined all of them for yourself yet, haha!
Not yet but eventually I will.
Well what types of movies are you into?
Lately I've been watching a lot of older movies rather than more recent ones.
Very cool, like what?
I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2 for the first time, damn good movie.
I don't know man I just can't get into those Tarantino movies.
Okay, we have totally different movie tastes, it seems.
Maybe so, but we can watch each others' interests and broaden our horizons.
Yeah, more so your.
