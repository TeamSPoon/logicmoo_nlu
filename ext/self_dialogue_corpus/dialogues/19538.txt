What are you up to today?
I'm going to stand in line for concert tickets.
Whose concert are you going to see?
I'm trying to get tickets to go see Miranda Lambert.
Oh I love country music. I'll come with you and get tickets to.
I love country music too. Miranda Lambert is one of my favorites.
She has an awesome voice. What are some of her songs that you like best?
I like The House That Built Me, More Like Her, Famous In a Small Town, and Me and Charlie Talking.
All of her songs are good but I like her older stuff best.
Didn't she do a song with Carrie Underwood?
Yeah she did. I believe it was called Somethin' Bad.
Oh yeah that's it! I love that one to.
I am a big Carrie Underwood fan to. I would love to go and see her in concert one day.
I've not heard many of her songs. What are some of her best ones?
Her most prominent song is probably by far Jesus Take the Wheel.
I've heard that one but what are some of her newer songs?
Dirty Laundry, Something in the Water, Heartbeat, Little Toy Guns, and Blown Away.
I will have to give those a listen someday. I love the songs of hers that I have listened to.
Yeah, I think you'll like her.
Once I listen to them we will have to go to her concert next!
