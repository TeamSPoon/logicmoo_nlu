Hey Tom, did you see the big game last night?
I think so. You mean the hockey game right?
Yeah it was the Pittsburgh Penguins against the Chicago Blackhawks.
I was glued to that game from start to finish.
Same here! So many shots were fired just in the first period.
Not only were they fired, but they were scored goals too!
Yeah by the second period both teams were already up 3 points, which is crazy for a normal hockey game.
No doubt! Did you see how Smith from the Blackhawks completely knocked out Barry on the Penguins?
Of course! They only replayed the highlights of that all game long!
It was honestly one of the most brutal hockey clashes I have ever seen.
Same here man, I just wish I could have been there to see it in person.
Right? That would have been incredible! Have you ever been to a hockey game yourself?
My father actually took me once when I was about 8 years old, we saw the Kings going against the Bruins!
That must have been amazing! Were you hooked from then on?
Definitely, I had never been at such an exciting event in my life; needless to say I was a fan for life from then on.
That is great dude! So...you were obviously rooting for the Penguins last night, right?
Not just rooting for the Penguins, I cheered, screamed and ran around the house for the Penguins. They had to win!
I was probably not as hyped up as you, but I was extremely excited to see the Penguins take a 4 point lead in the final period.
It seemed like after the second period ended, the Blackhawks were tired and falling apart.
Definitely! That is why the Penguins started mopping the floors as soon as they took that one point lead!
