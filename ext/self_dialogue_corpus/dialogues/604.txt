So are you excited about the Packers this season?
Of course, as long as Aaron is the quarterback.
I think he's the greatest quarterback in Packers history.
You think he' better than Favre?
I do!
What about Bart Starr?
Without a doubt.
What about Don "Magic Man" Magkowski?
Now you're being funny.`
I don't see anyone in the division overtaking them.
What about the Lions?
Nah, they have no defense.
What about the Vikings?
They don't have a good quarterback.
What about the Bears?
Now, you're making me laugh again.
Yea, I think they will go to the Superbowl.
You think they will win?
I don't know, New England is always tough.
Yea, it should be a good season.
