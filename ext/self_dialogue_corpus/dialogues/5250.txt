Do you know The Incredibles is coming out with a sequel?
Yes but have to wait till July 2019.
I almost did not watch this movie as I was not impressed with how they looked.
Too bad, had you skipped and missed this movie.
I am super excited for the sequel as the story ended with the whole family joining in the act.
It was really funny and interesting especially the youngest's actions.
I remember the mom took pains to keep her kids away from all the super powers and adventures.
But that proved to be fruitless when the family got in trouble.
It was satisfying to watch the family fight to save each other.
It was super entertaining. I hope the sequel goes beyond and does its best.
