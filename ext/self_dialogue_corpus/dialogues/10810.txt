Do you think that the 'Fast & Furious' movies objectify women?
Now that's an interesting question.  I would definitely say yes, but I have mixed feelings.
Can you elaborate?
On one hand, this franchise has so much gratuitous and random shots of scantily clad females.
That's almost a cornerstone at this point.
But on the other hand, women should do whatever they feel is empowering to them.  Also, the coolest characters are female in the series.
Letty is definitely the coolest and toughest of that whole crew next to Dom.
Those two characters are perfect for each other.
Gisele, portrayed by Gal Gadot, I thought was also pretty empowering as a character.
Don't forget the woman who played the police officer from Brazil.  She was a strong female character too.
