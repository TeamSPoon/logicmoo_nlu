Do you remember the red guards in Return of the Jedi
Yeah, who were those guys?
They were the emperors special guards.
I never saw them do much though?
There's a deleted scenes clip on youtube that shows them in action?
Really? Like fighting and stuff.
Well not a big fight, but they pull out their spears.
Interesting. I wonder why that scene was cut.
Probably to save on time and was unnecessary.
Yeah probably right.
