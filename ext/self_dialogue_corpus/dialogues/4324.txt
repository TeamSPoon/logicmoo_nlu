Have you seen shutter island?
I have I enjoyed it but not as much as the book.
I didn't even realize it was a book first. I wish I would have read it before viewing the film.
Hard to say what is better because you may have enjoyed the film more not knowing the twist first.
That is true, it is a different movie watching it a second or third time, knowing what happens.
Exactly, even though I knew the twist.. I still really enjoyed this film overall.
I thought the best performance outside of Leo was Mark Ruffalo.
Mark Ruffalo was superb, I feel he doesn't always get due credit for his acting chops.
True he may be underappreciated in hollywood.
Or maybe by audiences since he is rarely the main draw, he may get overlooked for people like leo, super a-list.
