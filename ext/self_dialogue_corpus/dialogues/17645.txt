Have you been following the whole Nicki Minaj, Remy Ma confrontation?
Yes I have,  It seems like it had got pretty serious.
Some of the things said were a little too personal.
I saw that Nicki Minaj had said something about Remy Ma leaving her son.
I heard that too. Things like that have led to violence in the past.
I just hope that they learned a lesson from the whole Notorious Big, Tupac fight.
I know that was a tragedy that should've been avoided. In the end everyone lost by the passing of both icons.
It's so sad and sometimes people like to start confrontation because it sells records.
Drama is the number one most marketed product in America media.
Yes, but once famous people have drama it bleeds down to their followers who are more prone to take action.
I think thats what happened in the Notorious Big, Tupac feud.
It makes no sense to be so powerful and still fall victime to such pettiness.
Hip hop artist of their stature need to be better role model for the fans who idolize them.
I agree.  They have more influence on our children than we do at a certain age.
I love hip hop, but I'm in no way a fan of glorifying violence and ignorance.
I hear you. Either Nicki or Remy needs to be the bigger person and stop the feud.
I don't think it was smart for Nicki to start with Remy in the first place. Remy just got out of prison.
She allegedly shot another female, am I right?
Yes. I don't remember what it was over, but Nick doesn't have a status like that.
Yeah, she needs to be smart and not try to be someone who she isn't.
