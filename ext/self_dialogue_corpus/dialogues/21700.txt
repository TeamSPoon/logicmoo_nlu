You know what I was watching yesterday?
No what?
Forest Gump.
I love that movie.  It had it all.
I know right?  Emotion, war, drugs, comedy.
It is one of my favorite movies.
And shows just how great of an actor Tom Hanks is.
Yeah the guy is something else.
What was the best part of the movie?
I'm going to say when he runs out of those leg braces.
I loved that part.
What was your favorite part?
I liked the part in Vietnam.  It really effected forest and he really lost a great friend.
That was a good part too.  I wanted to cry for him.
Oh yeah and don't forget when he jumped out of his shrimp boat to see liutenant Dan.
Perfect movie moment.
I also like when he became rich.
Yeah, such a good story.
That's why I loved it so much.
True American Classic.
