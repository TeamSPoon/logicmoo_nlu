Who do you think is the best band of all time?
I think I am in the majority when I say The Beatles.
They sold a ton of albums.
They really broke ground in terms of the music scene as well.
Yeah they definitely were life altering for many people.
In addition to that, I think they knew what they were doing.
It was shocking that the music scene took that long for a sound like that.
Their music expanded so many genres.
What would they be considered today?
I would say pop music.
Strange because they all play their own music.
Yeah but they make ear worm type songs
I can name you some songs that would get stuck in your head that isnt pop.
I know they exist I am just saying they did it before anyone else.
Its strange to consider them a band even they played their own music.
Why do you say that?
Because they almost always wore the same thing.
So are you saying more of a boy band.
Yeah but they didnt sit there and have people write their music.
They all contributed to things collaboratively
