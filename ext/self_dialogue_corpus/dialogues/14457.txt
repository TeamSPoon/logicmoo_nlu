Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?
Yeah, but they've been pretty terrible this year.
I know, they should have just skipped the playoffs and had the finals.
Everyone already knew we were getting a final's trilogy.
Yup, Golden State and Cleveland are just so much better than everyone else.
It's sort of unfair to the rest of the league, don't you think?
Well, both the Warriors and the Cavs have historically been bottom dwellers, so I'm okay with it.
I guess.
Think about it, more than half the titles ever won in the NBA have been won by just two teams.
You're right, the Celtics and Lakers spent decades tormenting the rest of the league.
Exactly, let these two teams enjoy their time in the spotlight, it will be short lived.
You have a rooting interest this year?
I'm torn, it's the best player versus the best team.
I'm siding with the Warriors, basketball is a team sport, I can't stand guys like Lebron James.
I know, but this is like watching this generations Michael Jordan, we can tell our kids, we saw Lebron dominate the league for years and years.
He's also a total egotistical diva.
True, people didn't hate Jordan until after he retired.
Yeah, people have a million reasons to hate Lebron in the past, present and future.
You've convinced me, go dubs!
Chef curry with the shot!
