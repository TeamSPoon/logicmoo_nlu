I need to get some movies to play on rainy days at a kids camp. Any suggestions?
Can the movies be rated PG or do they just have to be rated G?
I probably need to find both rated G and PG movies.
For younger kids you probably can't go wrong with classic Disney movies, and people you know probably have DVDs at home that they could bring.
This camp is an overnight camp in the woods, do you have any nature themed suggestions?
The original "Parent Trap" starts out at a summer camp and they go camping in the woods as a family.
Was there more than one version? I saw one about 20 years ago I think.
You must've seen the one with Lindsay Lohan. The original one starred Hayley Mills back in the 60s.
This camp is a church camp so I probably need some movies with a vaguely Christian theme.
You could always watch one or more of the Narnia movies.
I saw "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe", were there more than that one made into movies?
They made the next two in the series, the ones where Lucy is a main character and still a little kid.
So is that "Prince Caspian" and the "Dawn Treader"?
Yeah, the first two got pretty good reviews but "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" didn't get good reviews.
Any thoughts on Christian movies for older kids or teens?
Wasn't there a movie by the newsboys?
"God's Not Dead" by the Newsboys probably would be good for older kids.
When did that come out? If it's fairly recent that might be a good choice. How about "A Walk to Remember"?
."God's Not Dead" is less than 10 years old now.
"A Walk to Remember" is a little bit older and it is about teens who are Christian.
