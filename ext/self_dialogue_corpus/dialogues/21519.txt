Hey Tony, have you seen that movie about time travel?
Oh, hey Jack...a time travel movie? Which one?
You know, the one where those guys go back and forth in time...
The one with Keano Reeves?
No, no, no, no...the one with the three guys in a pub.
Hmmm. Three losers in a pub...talking about the good old days? That sounds like my life.
Right. If you had two friends...
Ouch. Accurate, but still painful.
No, I'm talking about the movie where those three guys inadvertantly stumble into a time leak located in the Pub's bathroom.
A leak in the men's room. Still sounds like my life.
Very funny.
And we're in a pub right now!
And you're acting a bit pissy, too.
Sorry. Sorry...
It's the one where those three guys chase that chic around alternate timelines in a quest to become time lords.
Oh, right. The three guys, the pub, the chic, time leaks, timelines, time Lords...
Right!
No, I haven't seen it.
You haven't seen it?
Well, at least not in this timeline. But if it's really important to you, I could head to the bathroom and look for one of those leaks.
