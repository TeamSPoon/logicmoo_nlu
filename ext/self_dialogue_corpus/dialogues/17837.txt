Which decade had the best music?
That's a tough one. I'd say the '60s.
Why the '60s?
It started with great pop songs from The Beach Boys, and it covered the entire career of the Beatles. The Stones. The Doors . . .
Well, that's all true. But I'd say the '90s.
Really?
You had the grunge movement. Who was better than Nirvana?
Didn't grunge start in the '80s?
Technically, yes. But it exploded in the '90s. I don't think there's ever been a better song than "Smells Like Teen Spirit."
"Losing My Religion"? That's my favorite song from the '90s.
Sure. REM is great. Pearl Jam is great. But Nirvana was in a category of its own.
Yeah, but were they as great as the Beatles?
I think so. The Beatles had some great songs but their early stuff was so simple. Nirvana was always deep.
We'll have to agree to disagree. The Beatles were revolutionary. They redefined popular music.
OK, so what about the '70s and '80s?
The '70s started out great. It was really just a continuation of the '60s. But then came disco.
Don't remind me.
The '80s were better. But it seems like the music from the '80s was mostly about creating a great video to get on MTV.
I used to love MTV. I watched it all the time.
Me too. My favorite bad video was "I Ran" by a Flock of Seagulls!
