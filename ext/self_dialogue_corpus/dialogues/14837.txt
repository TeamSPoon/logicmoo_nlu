Have you seen Dodgeball?
Yes, Ben Stiller is hilarious in that movie!
Agreed! He is one of my favorite actors, I also loved him in Zoolander.
That movie was hilarious too! That's the one where he costars with Owen Wilson right?
Yes it is, I also love Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents.
That movie was hilarious. Meet the Fockers was great too!
It was! One of my favorite Ben Stiller movies is Along Came Polly.
That's a really good one, I love Jennifer Aniston in it!
Agreed, she plays a pretty different character than usual in that movie.
She does! It's the same in We're the Millers, where she plays a stripper.
