So what was your favorite Disney movie when you were a kid?
It's kind of hard to pick just one, for me. I had a friend who loved Beauty and the Beast and my mom loved Mulan.
Those were good ones. I kind of liked Great Mouse Detective.
Oh, and The Recsuers Down Under! Those smaller movies that weren't all about singing princesses really stood out, sometimes.
The Jungle Book, Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh...
Peter Pan, too.
Didn't they do Robin Hood?
Yeah, with the main characters as foxes! And they reused some of the animations for the dancing in The Aristocats!
Ooh, I almost forgot that one! It's been so long.
Too long.
