Have you seen the movie Moana?
No I haven't, what is it about?
It is about a girl who needs to save her island
Island? Where is it based?
It is based in Polynesia. I don't think that it is a real island, but it takes inspiration from islands such as Samoa.
So its like Lilo and Sitch?
Similar, but it is based upon traditional stories from the Islands, including that of Maui

Maui is the demi god of air and water
It sounds so good, I'm going to watch it!
