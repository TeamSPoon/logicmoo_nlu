Have you seen any good documentary films lately?
Documentary? Didn't those go out of style years ago?
I didn't think so, I just thought that interesting ones wheren't being made.
To be honest with you I think the only documentaries I've heard of that are recent are about crime.
Oh really?
Yeah, Last year they made one about O.J Simpson.
Do you remember the title of it?
I think it was O.J : Made in America.
Did they just cover the crime?
Oh no. They covered his early life, career, and then got into the dark areas of his life.
Oh so it was more of a biography then?
I wouldn't go that far. I mean yeah they talked about his early life and stuff but the main focus was the crime aspect.
I'm pretty sure they did that on purpose.
Of course they did. I'm not even sure what sparked the idea to revisit this event.
I'm sure money was pretty much the goal of it.
You are probably right on that note.
Was the film at least interesting?
It had it's moments, I mean I knew everything there was to know about the crime, but his early life was all new to me.
Yeah, I'm sure it was new to all the viewers.
At least it wasn't some kind of short segment, they were pretty detailed about his early life.
