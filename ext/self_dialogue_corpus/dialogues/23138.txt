Have you ever seen the movie Without A Paddle?
Yes I have.
It is one of my secret pleasures to watch over and over.
I have seen it several times myself.
I really like the actors in the movie.
I am a fan of Dax Shepard.
I am too.
Have you ever seen the movie where he drives the awesome black car?
I have.  What is the name of that again.
It is called Hit and Run.
That's right.  I really like that movie as well.
Apparently that car is his in real life.
Wow.  He has it all doesn't he.
He does.  Dax is also married to Kristin Bell.
That's right, I forgot about that.
They did a commercial together not too long ago.
I remember seeing it.
I hope he is in more movies in the future.
Me too.
He is funny enough to land some roles I think.
