What is the last concert you went to see?
I saw Kelly Clarkson with my 8-year old son.  He loved it.
He loved Kelly Clarkson?  Really?
Well, he really enjoyed Pentatonix more than Kelly.  They were the opening act.
Who is Pentatonix?
You've never heard of them?  They do acapella music.  They make the drum effects and other sounds with their mouths?
Oh, yeah.  I think I've seen them before.  Somebody shared them on Facebook. I thought they were only Christmas music.
No, you should look them up again.  They used to do mostly covers, but they do have original hits now.
I never heard of their original music before.
My favorite is "Can't Sleep Love".
I'll look that up sometime.  Okay, what was your first ever concert?
Oh, wow.  You are going back in time.  When I was a kid, my parents took me to see John Denver.
The guy who did "Rocky Mountain High?"
Yes, among other songs!  My Dad loved him and listened to him all the time.  I love him, too.
What ever happened to him?
He died years ago in a plane accident.
Seriously?  I don't remember hearing about that.
It was 20 years ago.  He died in 1997.
Oh, well, I was a child in 1997.  But, I have heard of him.
He was great in concert.  I can still remember it even though it was long ago.
