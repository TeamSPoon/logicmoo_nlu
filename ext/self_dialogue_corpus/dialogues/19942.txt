Do you ever listen to Alanis Morissette?
No. Is that a band?
She's an alternative singer from the 90s, you would like her.
What does her music sound like?
It's singer-songwriter stuff, with a lot of angst.
Wait, did she do that song 'Ironic'?
Yes, that's one of her songs, do you like that kind of stuff?
I think so but I haven't heard her whole albums really.
Well you should check out the 'Jagged Little Pill' album, it's good.
Ok, I think I will.
The 90s had a lot of good alternative music.
What else is good from that genre? I remember a few songs but I was a kid back then so I don't know much.
Do you know Blind Melon?
I'm not sure.
You've probably heard their songs before, like 'No Rain.'
I'm not sure I know that one.
Do you remember "All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain"?
Oh, is that with the video with the girl in the bee costume?
Yes! See, there's plenty of memorable alternative music from the 90s.
I know, I've got to listen to more of it.
