That new Predator movie looks interesting.
What's the plot?
Some military guy is trying to convince his friends that the creature exists.
More marines, huh? Is Schwarzenegger in it?
I think so. I don't think he has a major role.
I guess it can't be any worse than that last one.
I liked Predators. It was good.
Not as good as the first two.
I liked the second movie the best.
I wish Hollywood would follow up on that ending.
How so?
You saw the samurai sword and the gun from the old west in the alien ship?
Yeah, so?
The Predator likes to hunt where there's conflict doesn't he?
That's what I heard.
So, why can't they do a movie set in the Feudal period? Or the old west?
That would be different.
Yeah, I mean, the set up was there.
I would love to see a Predator dual a Samurai. That would be cool.
It would be alot better than that joust in Predators, that's for sure.
