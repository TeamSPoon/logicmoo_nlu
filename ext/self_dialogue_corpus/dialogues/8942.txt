I have tickets for the Smashing Pumpkins concert this weekend, do you want to go?
No, I used to like that band, but I didn't like it when they broke up and got new band members.
I know what you mean. Jimmy Chamberlin was a great drummer, and that new kid doesn't compare.
They were great in the 90s, but now their music is ho-hum.
I know, I still go to their concerts just hoping they play some old songs.
They used to have great music videos back in the day when MTV used to play music videos all the time.
Oh man, I MISS MTV music videos. They were the best!
80s rock music videos were even better than the 90s. Remember "I Want My MTV?"
OH, and remember when Beavis and Butthead used to do the commentary on music videos?
Beavis and Butthead ROCKED.
