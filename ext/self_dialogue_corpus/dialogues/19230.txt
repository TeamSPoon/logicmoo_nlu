what band do you love most?
Aerosmith has always been one of my most loved bands.
I love steven tyler.
He is the epitome of a rock star to me.
Ya I agree. Have you ever seen him judge on american idol?
Ya  I watched the idol seasons with him.
well haven't you noticed he still is typical rockstar hitting on the young girls?
That is true, he does, all the time.
what  is crazy to me is the first aerosmith number 1 was from armageddon.
Wow that is late in their career. What about dream on?
It was never number one.
That is just so shocking none of the other past songs made number one.
Did you like armageddon?
I did I thought that song I don't wanna miss a thing added so much to the popularity of the film.
Kind of neat that liv tyler is steven's daughter and the romantic lead girl.
It is a nice connection.
I guess originally it was supposed to be a celine dion song.
YA, but I guess steven somehow got the rights before her or something.
Interesting, she would have been good on this song too.
Well I am glad aerosmith finally got a number one song.
