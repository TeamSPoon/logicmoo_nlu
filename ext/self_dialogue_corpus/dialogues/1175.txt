So what do you think about the Ravens' chances this season?
I hope they do better than last year but I don't know if the offense will be good enough.
Yeah, losing Steve Smith was tough.
Definitely! Perriman is unproven and Wallace has had a good season before only to tail off the next year.
I'm personally hoping they'll sign Gary Barnidge.
I am too. He's not the greatest tight end but he's decent.
I'd also like to see them sign Nick Mangold. We need a center.
Yes we do. I don't understand why nobody has signed him yet.
Me either. How do you think Flacco will play this year?
Hopefully good...he needs to elevate the players around him.
USA Today just listed him as the most overpaid player in the NFL.
I don't agree with that. He's overpaid, but so are most quarterbacks.
If he would just be postseason Joe all season long!
Absolutely, he's a beast in the playoffs!
How about the defense? Will they be feared again?
I sure hope so..that's what we've always been known for, defense. They need to play better in the secondary though.
They do...but I think Tony Jefferson was a big signing.
He definitely was. Hopefully he and Weddle will lock it down this year.
Let's hope so...GO RAVENS!
Absolutely man, we'll find out in a few months!
