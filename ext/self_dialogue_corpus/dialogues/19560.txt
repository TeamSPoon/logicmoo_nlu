Do you like British invasion music?
So much!
I love all of it except the Beatles.
Uh but the Beatles were Pioneers.
I agree but I don't like the sound.
Fair enough. Which ones do you like?
The Kinks, the Who, The Yarbirds, stuff like that.
What about Herman's Hermits, or the Zombies?
Yes! Time of the Season is my favorite Zombies song and maybe my favorite song in total.
Does Petula Clark count?
She's not a band but she was part of the British Invasion, so yeah.
I think she has one of the prettiest voices.
And she's one of the only female artists in that time from the invasion.
True, most of them only have male members.
Wait, Marianne Faithful is also one!
How could I have forgotten Marianne?
'As Tears go by', so pretty.
She also dated Mick Jagger.
Really?
Yeah it was really well publicized.
