Did you ever happen to see the movie In Good Company?
No, I think I missed that one. Who's in it?
Scarlett Johansson, Topher Grace, and Dennis Quaid
Those are pretty big names, but it's not ringing a bell.
It was kind of advertised as a romance, but that's not what it was really about.
Weird. So what's it really about?
Topher's character basically comes into Quaid's company all new and shiny and becomes his boss. It's sort of how older workers aren't respected.
And Scarlett works there too?
No, she plays Quaid's daughter. And eventually Topher's secret girlfriend.
Oh my. I'm guessing dad is not pleased?
You would guess right. But there's a sweetness to the story I wasn't expecting.
How so?
Like how it kind of becomes clear that what Topher's really looking for is a father figure.
So Quaid comes around eventually?
Yes and no. You don't want me to spoil everything do you?
I guess not. We should watch it sometime.
We should. I just feel like it was a really good movie that kind of slipped through the cracks.
I hate it when that happens.
But then we get to have the fun of discovering them.
Very true. Now I want to go explore Netflix.
