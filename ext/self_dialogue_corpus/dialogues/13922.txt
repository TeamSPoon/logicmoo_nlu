Have you ever seen Lady Gaga in concert?
No I haven't, have you?
Yeah, I saw her when she came to town last year!
Wow, how was it?
It was great, she sounds amazing live.
Oh, just like the album?
Yep, she did all her hits like "Born this Way" and "Just Dance"
I LOVE Telephone, did she play that one?
Yeah, and Beyonce even came out!
OMG, I wish I would
