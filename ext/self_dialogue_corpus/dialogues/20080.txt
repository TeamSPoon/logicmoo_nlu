What did you think of this new remake of Beauty and the Beast?
I liked the acting. Emma Watson was a lovely Belle.
I agree. The music wasn't great, though.
No, all that auto tuning was painful.
I prefer the music in the original one. Belle had a great voice in it.
That's true. I did like how faithful the remake was.
Yes, even most of the speech was the same.
I was glad to see that but it almost seems pointless to have remade it.
I can see that.
I'm not sure why Disney keeps doing this.
It's like they're out of ideas.
I really wonder if that's it.
They're doing more as well.
I heard about the Little Mermaid one.
Do you plan to watch it?
Probably but I won't be too hopeful.
Neither will I.
How are they doing the underwater stuff?
I have no idea.
Maybe they'll skip it.
