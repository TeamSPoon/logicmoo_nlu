I saw the worst movie ever last night on Netflix.
What was it?
Freddy Got Fingered.
You're kidding me.
Nope, actually watched it.  The one with Tom Green.
When that came it out, it was one of the worst reviewed movies of all-time.
And well-deserved too.  I thought about turning it off.
Why didn't you?
Because I accidentally fell asleep watching it on the couch.
Trust me, you missed nothing.
