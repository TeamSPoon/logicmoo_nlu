What's with all the football hype?
What do you mean?
Why do Americans like the NFL so much?
Lots of people, myself included, think it's a fun sport to watch.
American football is not a fun sport. Real football is.
You mean soccer.
I mean football.
I'm not saying soccer isn't fun to watch. I love soccer. I just think football is fun too.
Why do they call it football when you don't even kick the ball?
You kick the ball for field goals. But does it matter?
I guess it doesn't. How often do you watch the NFL?
I watch the NFL with my family every now and then.
Do you have a favorite team?
Dallas Cowboys baby!
I have never heard of them.
What teams have you heard of.
Patriots.
Because they keep winning?
Yeah.
Figures.
