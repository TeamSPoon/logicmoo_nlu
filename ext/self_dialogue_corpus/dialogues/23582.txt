Were you a fan of those older horror movies?
You mean like the slasher flicks?
Yes!  Movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th.
You know what is interesting about that?  I don't identify with the movies as much as I do with the actual characters.
I know what you mean.  Most people don't point to individual movies.
Exactly.  Instead people talk about Jason or Freddy Krueger.
I don't know if you'd agree with me, but I think Freddy Krueger is the most iconic of all of them.
I do agree!  I think Freddy is the only character that made its actor an icon as well.
Robert Englund, right?
Yes, Englund.  One of the best actor and character combinations of all time.
I agree.  Going beyond just this horror genre, Englund's portrayal is simply among the best in movie history.
Yes.  He made the character of Freddy Krueger so iconic.
So what do you think about the newer slasher flicks, like Scream?
Well Scream is over twenty years old.  It's not exactly newer.  But I know what you mean.
Yea, Scream is pretty old now, but it did kind of resurrect the genre.
I have watched all the Scream movies.  They definitely are well done.
I agree.  I thought they were excellent homages to the earlier slasher flicks while bringing something new to the genre.
Scream also helped resurrect Drew Barrymore's career a bit.
True, she was in the movie for a short time, but everyone remembers her role.
Yes, one of the more shocking moments in any movie.
