Which Disney princess movie came first?
I believe it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, okay. I never really liked that one too much.
Why not? Some of the songs are decent.
Yeah, but the story never really interested me too much.
It's a little bit duller than some of the others, but you have to remember how revolutionary the animation was.
I guess that's true, but it doesn't mean I have to be a big fan of it or anything.
I know. I just appreciate it for what it was.
That's cool. I respect that.
Plus, I like to whistle while I work!
