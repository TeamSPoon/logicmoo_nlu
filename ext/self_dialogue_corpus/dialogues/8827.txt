What era of music do you like best?
I love the 50's and 60's they had the best songs back then.
Yeah, I like what they call jukebox music. I remember spending many quarters playing Diana Ross songs.
Oh yeah, you almost knew who was in the room by the songs that were playing. My favorites were from the "Beach Boys".
Those songs were fun. They made me want to move to California and buy a surf board.
I also liked "The Mamas and the Papas" and how about "Chubby Checker"?
Let's do the twist. You weren't cool if you did not know how to twist.
Oh, I remember a great one,"When A Man Loves A Woman" by Percy Sledge.
I wonder how many movies that one has been in.
It was a great song for the movies it is so romantic.
