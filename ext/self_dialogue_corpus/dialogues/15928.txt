What is your favorite music genre?
I like rock the best.  Classic Rock.  How about you?
I like rock too, but I have a thing for 80's music.
Oh, me too!  I love the 80's.  Who is your favorite band from the 80's?
I used to love Cindy Lauper back in the day.  Girls just wanna have fun!
That is a great song.  I also liked Time After Time.
I love that song too.  DId you ever listen to any of the hair bands?
Like 80's rock?  Sure did.  I loved Dokken.
I like that song of theirs, Alone Again.
I like that one too but I like some of the fast songs like Burning Like A Flame.
Weren't two of the band members brothers?
Yeah I think the singer and one of the other members.  Did you ever get into Motley Crue?
I saw the Crue back in 1988!  Best rock show ever.
I am so jealous.  I love that song Kickstart My Heart.
My mom used to think I was into bad things because I had the Shout at the Devil album.
That is too funny.  My mom thought the same thing when she heard me "shouting at the devi".
I had 3 Vince Neil posters on my bedroom wall!
Vince Neil definately made his mark in the 80's as a lead singer.
Once I saw Posion open up for them.
Oh!  Brett Michaels.  That is a whole nother story!
