What's the worst horror movie that you enjoy watching?
I loved watching The Stuff when i was a kid.
I never heard of it before. What is it about?
It had to do with some yogurt that was being sold that was taking over the bodies of people after they ate it.
Wow, that actually sounds pretty scary.
How about you? What horrible horror flick did you enjoy most?
I think my all time kid favorite was The Gate.
I remember that one. It was about a family that lived in a house that had a gateway to hell in the basement. What year did it come out in?
I think it came out in 1987.
Yeah that sounds right, i was about 8 at the time. No wonder it freaked me out pretty good.
