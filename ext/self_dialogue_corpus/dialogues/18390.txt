What year do you think was the best for music?
Recently or all-time?
Let's go within the last 10 years.
2010
Really? Why do you say that?
All genres had great songs and artists.
What are some examples
Well for starters there was Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Black Eyed Peas and Kings of Leon
Oh yeah, Lady Gaga was huge back in 2010.
Yes, it seemed like every one of her songs was a big hit
Yeah, I really liked Poker Face
Yes, that was a good one as was Just Dance
Oh yeah. That one had a really good beat.
Whatever happened to her?
She kind of fell off after The Fame
Yeah, Born This Way wasn't as big a hit
No I heard she had issues with her producer as well.
Seems to be the case with many.
I thought she did a good job singing at Super Bowl 50 though
Yeah, me too.
