I am trying to find a good nighttime tune for my baby.
Let me think......Ragdoll Blues is a classic!
I know.  Listened to it during my pregnancy!
She might remember it then!
Haha.  Lucy Bluee is good too.
Never heard of it.
Lucy is the sleepy baby who has the blues and doesn't want to nap!
Oh ok, I get it.
Any other ones you know of?
Moonlit Crib is a good group for baby songs.
I heard thier song Crybaby Classic!
Yes, that is a funny one.
I guess Nella is too young to get the punchlines!
Yes she is.
Moonlit has another good one called Binky No More.
That's for toddlers.
I'm starting her early!
Good idea.
Think I'll try Guitar Goodnight for her nap later.
I hope it works!
