I loved watching Disney movies when I was younger.
I still watch them now.
I have a few that I will watch even if the kids are not in the room.
Me too.  And sing along!
Yes, the Disney songs are true Classics.
Every movie has that one song that pulls it together.
But sometime you get real tired of hearing it over and over.
"would you like to build a snow man?'
Funny!
You know you want to sing the rest of it.
