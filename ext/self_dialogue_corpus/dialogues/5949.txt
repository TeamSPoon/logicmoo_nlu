We watched Nemo last night.
Never too old for that movie.
I think that is so cute.
It is. There's so many good characters to like.
Yes there is. I love the turtles.
They are good. The way they talk.
Yes, like surfer dudes.
I wasn't a fan of the sharks though.
They were just okay.
I could watch that every time it's on.
