Do you listen to foreign music at all?
Yeah sometimes when I am studying I listen to other stuff. What about you?
Well lately I have been listening to alot of French Jazz.
Why French, Jazz?
Probably because I have been back and forth to France within the last few months
And what type of songs do they listen to?
Well. That's the funniest thing. At every shop or market  or even in the hotel lobby where I was staying there was always American artists playing on the radio
That is really odd. Did they play any french music ?
Sometimes. But mostly they would switch back and forth between American and french
You know when I listen to French music I hear the accordion as the prominent sound
Yes I know. Even in their jazz music you hear the accordion
But apparently they prefer American music?
It's so odd. When I think about that because alot of people there don't even speak English yet they listen to American lyrics
Yeah that is odd. You should ask about that, the next time you go there.
I intend to. When have you ever gone into an American establishment to hear French music playing ?
Wow... Never . I guess they think these English speaking artists are the best!
Maybe. But in the meantime I will continue to listen to French Jazz
You ought try to attend a concert the next time you visit
Yes I intend to, that's definitely on my list
Just make certain it's not an American Group playing....
