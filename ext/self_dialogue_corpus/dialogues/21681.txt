You know, I've never seen Weekend at Bernie's.
How is that even possible?
I've just never gotten around to it. I dunno.
You're missing out, man. It's great.
Should we watch it?
Sure, but we have to also watch the sequel.
There's a sequel?
Yeah, and this is the thing, like all 90s sequels, they have to go out of their way to make it possible.
What do you mean?
Well, you know how like, after watching Home Alone, you think "there's no way they'll ever leave that kid at home again."
Yeah, more or less.
But then they manage to do it in a way that's totally plausible. You buy it.
Sure. But that's just Home Alone.
It's not just Home Alone though--like, there's a sequel to Speed that takes place on a cruise ship.
With the same characters?
Some of them. In the same situation twice.
That's absurd.
And Weekend at Bernie's does it best.
How?
We just need to watch it.
