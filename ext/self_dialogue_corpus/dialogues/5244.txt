You know the opening song in The Lion King?
Yeah I know it, the one that everybody makes up the words to cause they don't speak the actual language.
That is the one. Did you know that it translates to "There comes a lion. Oh yes it's a lion" and its just repeated a bunch of times.
I didn't know that, but that's pretty funny!
Yeah I read about it the other day online.
Here's something I bet you don't know...
What is it?
The Lion King was the first Disney movie that was completely original. Think about it! Every other Disney movie before that is from a story.
Wow I never realized that before! That's really interesting.
Yeah but if you look at the original story of some of the Disney adaptations, the Disney movies are way different.
