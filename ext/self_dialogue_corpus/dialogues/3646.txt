What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?
That is a very tough question.  I would have to go with Jaws.
That is a good choice.  I hadn't thought of that one.
What about you?
I would say Sixth Sense. The twist at the end just shocked me.
I wasn't a fan.  I saw it coming.
Really?  I had no idea.
Yeah, it was kind of obvious to me.  But it is still a decent movie.
Decent?  Best thriller ever!
If you say so.  Agree to disagree.
