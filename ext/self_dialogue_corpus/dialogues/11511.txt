Hey man, do you listen to the Beatles?
Yeah, sometimes I do.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
"I wanna hold your hand"
I like that song too.
I have a bunch of their old records at home.
Wow, that's awesome.
Yeah, maybe I will show you later, if I have time.
This is going to be cool.
Yeah, I have all their albums right here at home. My parents have been collecting Beatles albums for years.
