what 80s song do you love?
So many, I shamelessly love 80s music.
I think a lot of 80s songs were great as well especially love songs.
Oh so true, the best love songs.
what is your favorite?
saving all my love for you, whitney houston.
I love whitney and that song.
How about,  it must have been love, by roxette?
I had forgotten about that song, so good.
I feel like so many great 80s songs are forgotten about.
It is hard to keep up with all the great songs out.
True, always a new steady supply coming in .
Yep, and not really like dj's are focusing on the older stuff.
Well unless it is a special channel dedicated to those eras.
I love radio channels that play a mix of all eras.
Me too and especially love the 80s stuff.
I wonder how many closet 80s lovers there are out there?
I bet a ton !
I don't know why people are embarrassed to love it, or admit it!
Well it is cheesy.
