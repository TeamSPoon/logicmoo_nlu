Did you know Madonna came out with a new album?
No way! Is it better than the last.
I think so. I wasn't a fan of her last work.
Yeah me either. She tries too hard to stay young.
Yeah I wasn't a fan of her dubstep songs.
Well I'm glad she's going back to her roots,
Same here. She needs to do more Vogue stuff.
I think she would if people listened.
Yeah a lot of people don't like older music nowadays.
I know I still do!
Me too! It's such a shame.
I think she will continue to put out good music.
I do too. I think shes a great performer.
Will she be touring anytime soon?
I'm not sure, I'll have to look!
Please do! I'd love to see her live in concert.
Same here. I've never seen her.
Me either. I bet she puts on a good show.
I've seen some videos. She's a great singer and dancer.
She definitely is!
