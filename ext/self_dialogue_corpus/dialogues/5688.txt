In Aladdin do you think Ja'Far hated Aladdin or the Genie more?
I think Ja'Far hated everyone.
I think he was irritated by the Genie but I think he hated Aladdin.
What makes you come to that conclusion?
I don't think Ja'Far sees Genie as a threat because he thinks his magic is stronger.
That can happen when you are a narcissist.
Aladdin got under Ja'Far's skin though and I think it was because he was always happy.
Especially since he was a street urchin who had nothing.
I think Aladdin is one of my favorite movie.
I like Aladdin too.
