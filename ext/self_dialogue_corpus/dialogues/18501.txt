Michael Jackson had some awesome career.
He sure did.
I think he was about 8 when he started and kept going till his untimely death.
That was when he was with the Jackson 5, all his brothers and Janet too.
They were great! I loved the song One bad Apple.
Oh and remember ABC?
I do.
He started out solo in the 1970's though.
Yes I remember, Thriller came out then.
Yea, that was his top selling album of all time.
Really, how many albums sold?
Over 65 million albums.
That sure is a lot of vinyl..
He had an odd personality didn't he?
He did and all those plastic surgeries too.
I really loved some of his music though.
I liked Man in the Mirror and Black or White.
Yea they were both good and number one hits too.
It is a shame he is gone.
There could have been a lot more hits if he were still alive.
