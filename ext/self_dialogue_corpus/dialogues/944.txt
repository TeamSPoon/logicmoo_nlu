How do you think Tom Brady will do this season?
He is good every year so probaly good.
It seems like the guy never ages.
yea, he is basically immortal.
I think he will slow down eventually and retire.
They really should start giving his back up a bigger role.
He gave them great minutes when Tom was out.
yes, it is a shame he has to sit the bench and wait.
Im also excited about marshawn
ohh yea he is making a comeback .
Wonder how good the team will be.
I think they will do alright this season.
Yea I just wonder if he's still got it.
I dont know .
Only time will tell.
Father time always wins in the NFL.
Yes it does.
Who are you rooting for?
Browns.
No response.
