Can't believe Terminator 2 came out 25 years ago.
It's crazy, isn't it?  Still one of the better action movies I've ever seen.
The whole Terminator series was awesome, but T2 brought it to a whole another level.
Arnold was a complete boss in that movie.
He was overwhelmed.  The T1000 was the superior machine.
Yeah, but the T800 is no slouch.  Plus he looks like Arnold.
The rest of the series got pretty bad though.
Yeah, once James Cameron left the director's chair, it ran off the rails.
Think he'll ever get back in it?
I doubt it.  Doesn't change the fact they were great movies.
