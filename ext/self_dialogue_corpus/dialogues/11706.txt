The Beatles have 23 songs in Rolling stone's top 500 songs of all time.
Who cares about Rolling Stone's list? It's a stupid magazine
I care! Anyway I just don't like their rankings though
Then you shouldn't care. What are they using to rank them anyway?
Magic 8 ball. I don't know.
Ok What's the highest ranked song?
Hey Jude ranked at no 8.
See, I knew it was gonna be Hey Jude. Real Beatles fan don't listen to Hey Jude.
I listen to Hey Jude all the time. It's a great song. 4 minutes of na na na na  hey jude. it's great
4 minutes of silly na na na na hey jude doesn't make for a great song.
