What's the last movie you saw in theatres?
It's been a while, I think the last thing I saw was Hidden Figures.
Was that movie good?
Oh, it was great. What's the last thing you saw?
I just saw Wonder Woman last night.
I heard that movie is awesome. Did you like it?
Yes! It's nice to see such a strong female lead.
I really want to go. Would you be willing to see it again?
Definitely! Let me know when.
I want to do a double feature with Wonder Woman and the new Baywatch movie.
I heard that movie was cheesy.
I'm sure it is cheesy, but I have a soft spot for bad movies.
Plus all the cute boys!
Yes, that too. I also still need to see Moana.
You haven't seen Moana?! It's incredible!
That's what I've been hearing. Do you have the DVD?
Yes, I just got it for my birthday. You should come over and watch it.
And then we can go to the movie theatre?
Yes, I'd love that.
It's a date!
