How many times have you seen Phish live?
Oh, probably close to 25 or 30 times.
Wow, what was your favorite concert?
Red Rocks 2009. It was amazing.
What did they play?
Tweezer, YEM, 2001. All the epic songs. Incredible sound at Red Rocks.
That's what I've heard!
Then Billy from the Grateful Dead came out to play drums that Friday night.
Are you kidding? That is amazing!
It made the concert even more special. What's your favorite Phish song?
I would probably have to say Ghost.
Love that song. Do you have a favorite version?
From 2009 Festival 8 concert, Halloween night.
Yes! That song was so dirty.
I wasn't a fan of their cover of the Stones album, but the festival was great.
I was there, too! I loved the acoustic set.
Yes, Bouncin Around the Room was just killer.
So many great memories from Phish tour!
Agree! Loved Hampton, and Alpine and Deer Creek of Course.
See you out on tour!
