Nowadays they seem to be coming out with marvelous movies for children.
I agree. I've seen a lot of them.
One favorite lately is the movie "Sing."
My daughter got that for her birthday!
It is such a super cute movie.
It really is. I think it carries a good message too.
I loved how all the characters were animals in the movie.
Remember the woman pig who had over 20 piglets?
Oh my yes! How crazy was that?
She sang beautifully.
I think my favorite was the gorilla.
He had such a gorgeous voice as well.
It made me sad when his dad walked away from him in prison.
Yes, he should have supported his son.
He did later on in the movie but it was still super sad.
Remember when the koala bear tried to tell the giraffe that he was in the contest?
That was so funny. Poor guy couldn't hear him.
I know!
My kids love this movie and play it all the time.
Mine have too lately.
