Have you see Tangled?
Yea it was really cute!
Unpopular opinion, I think its way better than Frozen
No way Frozen is great!
Tangled is so cute though, I think it was highly underrated
I mean it was good but not compared to Frozen, Frozen's songs are just so catchy.
I think that's why Tangled didn't do as well, the songs just weren't as catchy. I think the humor was way better though
Why?
I just really love the sarcasm and dry humor in it! It was just really funny!
Yea it is pretty sarcastic. and has some pretty funny re-occurring jokes. but Frozen is just so cute and I love the snowman!
Did you know that Rapunzel from Tangled actually shows up in Frozen?
No way! When?
When they open the gates and everyone is entering the ball, you can see Rapunzel for a quick moment walking into the castle!
No way! Does that Mean they're related in someway?
Well there's a theory that they're cousins and Anna an Elsa's parent died going to Rapunzel's wedding
No way that makes so much sense now!
Yea and there's a theory that Hans is related to the two bad guys in Tangled that capture Flynn because they all have red hair and Hans says he has 14 siblings.
Woah that actually makes so much sense, I wonder if its true?
I dont know but  it's really crazy how supposedly all of the Disney Movies are in the same universe
yea that's really crazy, I wonder how they come up with all of that stuff
