Are you guys going to do a Fantasy Football draft again this year?
We do. Why? Do you want in?
I was considering asking if there might be a slot.
I think I can make one this year. Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm even willing to do research for draft picks!
Oh yeah?
Yep. I've been looking at some of what's out there.
What are you thinking so far?
I can't tell you everything! I've gotta keep some stuff close to the vest.
At least give me something.
Well, I know that the way NFL points work, you never draft a kicker first.
That's a no brainer.
Yeah. So I guess I might still be at the starting line.
I mean, you're picking NFL players. Who do you think will do well?
Maybe Antonio Brown?
That's a pretty reasonable pick. People would say that's a smart choice.
Yeah, and I'm a big Steelers fan.
Again with the Steelers.
I can't help it! I like them.
Well, good for you!
