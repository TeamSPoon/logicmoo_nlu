I am digging 300!
300, what is that?
Have you not seen 300? The one about the Spartans?
No, I have seen the trailer. Been wanting to see it.
I just got finished with it, the CG was flawless.
Was there a lot of CG, Hollywood is getting carried away with it in my opinion.
There is a fair amount, mostly in the battle scenes. When He kicks the messagner in the well, epic.
How epic can kicking somone in  a well be.
Ok, so this messagner comes to Sparta to tell Leonius to surrender and serve him and the town will be spared. He backs him up to the town well and kicks him in the chest!
That does sound pretty awesome. That isnt the end is it?
Far from it! Leonius gathers his men 300 Spartans, to hold off this weird guy and his army of a million.
A million? Seriously?
yes, I think the first wave was 100,000.
How are 300 people supposed to stop 100,000 warriors?
Spartans historically were fierce , each Spartan on the battle field was said to be worth no less than 10 men.
Still those odds seem pretty steep.
Leonius stopped them at first with a wall.
I guess a wall would work for a little while
It was no ordinary wall. It was made of the corpses of the enemies. It was like 50 feet high and twenty feet thick.
Yuck! can you imagine the smell? It would be an effective image to be sure!
