Did you hear that they are making a Cars 3 movie?
Yeah! I just found out about that when I was watching TV the other day.
I'm so excited! Who is your favorite character?
I love Lightning McQueen! How about you?
Same! I'm excited to see the new characters in Cars 3 though.
Me too! Have you been to Cars Land in Disneylan?
Yes! It is so awesome. I feel like I am in the movie.
Same. Especially with the music they play.
My favorite is the song Life is a Highway.
I hope they have it in Cars 3 too!
