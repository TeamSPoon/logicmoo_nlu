What song always cheers you up?
It is cheesy but that shaggy song it wasn't me.
That is a cheesy song. But fun and funny. I can see that working.
Well it does the trick for me. What about you?
I think Happy by pharrel williams.
I liked that song initially but it got so overplayed.
I still like it, always outs a smile on my face.
I find it does the exact opposite for me these days. Played out.
Well do you like pharrel in general?
I do . I like beautiful girls that song with snoop dog.
That was a good song. Another one you may like is come get it bae.
I love that video. The dancing girl audition idea was so good.
Ya I agree. The choreographer is fatima robinson.
Is she the lady with the asian jacket on in the video, with the dreads?
Ya that is her. she is is so great. Worked with lots of artists including Michael Jackson,
Pretty cool. Miley cyrus too , also in the video.
Yes miley too. Have you heard her new malibu song?
Yes,I liked this softer song from her.
I think she has matured recently. It is nice to see.
I think so calming down now from all the partying scene or persona.
