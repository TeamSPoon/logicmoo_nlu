What genre of movies do you like?
I like comedies and horror films.
What is your favorite comedy of all time?
Definitely "Grown Ups 2" with Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and Kevin James.
That was such a good movie! Did you like the first "Grown Ups" movie?
I did, but not as much as I liked the second. Adam Sandler is a great actor, he's so funny!
Have you seen "Billy Madison"? Adam Sandler was pure gold in that.
That's a favorite of mine. I love the field trip part of the movie.
That part was funny. What horror movies do you like?
I like the "Scream" series the best, and also "Halloween", "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "It".
The "Scream" series is great. I was never able to guess who the killer was until the end of the movies.
Same here. I thought they did a great job putting it together. It was hard to determine the killer.
Did you know that Julia Robert's niece, Emma Roberts was in the final "Scream" movie?
Yes, she turned out to be one of the killers. She's a great actress, like her Aunt.
"It" was also a great movie. Stephen King is the master of horror.
Yes, "It" is a terrifying movie. It is a long movie, but keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I was always scared of the sewer parts. You knew "It" was there, but never knew when he'd pop out.
Yes, I agree. When he turned into a spider, I thought the spider looked a little fake though.
You're right, it did. But the movie was made so many years ago, they probably didn't have the best effects.
Did you know they're coming out with a new "It" in Summer 2017?
