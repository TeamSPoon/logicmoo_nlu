Hi, NFL season is just around the corner. What are you most excited for?
I can't wait to fill out my fantasy draft and root on my team!
Which team do you support? I'm a fan of the Carolina Panthers.
I like the Panthers! They were close to winning the superbowl a couple years back. I prefer the Los Angeles Rams.
Rams are cool too! Though they haven't been doing well as of late. What do you think of their recent move?
I'm a fan because my parents grew up supporting the LA Rams. Do you think it'll be good for the team?
In the long run, yes. Right now, no. Once this new stadium works out it'll be exciting.
I agree! Do you think the Rams will have a shot at making the playoffs this year?
There's always a chance. I think it's unlikely given their division, but certainly within the realm of possibility. What do you think about the Panthers?
You're the Panthers fan, but I think they're a good team. They have a growingly hard division though and may have to get a wild card spot.
Speaking of the playoffs, what did you think of last year's superbowl game?
I thought it was so exciting! I could not believe it came down to the last play. What did you think?
I thought it was great. I like to root for the underdog but it was still exciting to see the Patriots come back.
Yes, I too liked the comeback. I actually predicted in the middle of it they would come back. Do you think the Patriots will be good again this year?
Yes, I do. I think they are a perennially good team. Who else do you think is a good team always?
I think the Packers and Broncos are continually good teams. Your Panthers could get up there in a few years!
It'll be a while, but yes I think that's plausible. Are you excited for your fantasy draft?
Yes, I can't wait to pick members from my Rams and other teams.
Cool! Hope you're excited for the season.
I totally am and wish you the best!
