What's your favorite album from Avril Lavigne?
Umm, it's a difficult question, I like a lot of her music. I like both The Best Damn Thing and Let Go
why is that?
because I feel her music has soul in it, and from song to song in an album, the overall feelings are the same, so I could listen to them all day long
what are some of your favorite songs from those 2 albums then?
to be honest, I like most of the music she published, but maybe Innocence and Complicated would stand out just a bit of more
They were such a sensation back in high school, right?
you bet, I feel the psychology in some of her music beats at the same rate as high school teenagers
her later music has become more mature, I think she has moved on
indeed, so did we
