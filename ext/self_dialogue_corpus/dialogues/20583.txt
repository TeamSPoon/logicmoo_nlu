Who is your favorite actress?
My favorite actress is Cameron Diaz.
You know I used to underestimate her acting abilities, but she has been really good in the dramatic roles she's been in.
Oh, I totally agree. I love her in In Her Shoes.
Definitely. The relationship between the two sisters was great and so believable.
It was Toni Colette that played her sister, right?
That's right. Have you ever seen her in Little Miss Sunshine?
No, but I have heard a lot of great things about that movie.
And it was for good reason. It won two Academy Awards.
Wow. I'll have to rent it sometime.
I'm telling you, if you like dramatic movies you will love it.
I do really enjoy dramas. That is my favorite movie genre.
I like dramas too, but I'd rather watch comedy most of the time.
Oh, do you plan on seeing the new Baywatch movie?
I don't know if I want to wait to rent it or see it in theaters.
Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson might be quite the comedy duo.
That's true, but I've been disappointed by Zac Efron in the past.
Really?
Yeah, I didn't think he was very funny in Neighbors.
Oh. I didn't really enjoy that movie either.
