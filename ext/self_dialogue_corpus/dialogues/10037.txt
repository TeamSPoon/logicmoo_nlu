Favorite action movie?
Does Terminator count?
Well, it's sci-fi, but it's still action.
Terminator it is! Back befor the Gubenator.
Ha! He was a much better actor that politician.
You can say that again.
Why would you say it's your favorite?
It just hits all the action essentials.
In spades.
In fact, I kinda wanna watch it now.
