Do you like Dave Matthews?
They are ok, why?
I have two tickets to their concert.
Sounds interesting, what type of music do they play?
Mostly soft rock, kind of bluesy
Sounds like fun.
Do you want to go?
I think so, are they good live?
Yes, they put on a great show.
Then count me in.
Do you want to drive?
Maybe I should, I have the beeter car.
That would be good.
Your car might not make it there.
That would be bad, being stranded at a Dave Matthews concert.
Might be a good story at least.
True enough.
We could hitch a ride with the band
Future roadies here we come!
Let's take your car!
