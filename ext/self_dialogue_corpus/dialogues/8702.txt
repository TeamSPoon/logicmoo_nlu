Why do The Rolling Stones keep making music?
Not sure what you mean.
They haven't produced a good album in probably 30 years.
I have to admit, I can't think of a single song that's come out recently.
In my opinion, they're just old and don't care.
Well, they have their money, their fame, their women.
At this point, it's just kind of creepy.
Drugs probably caught up to them too.
Yeah.  Mick Jagger might explode if he tries to dance anymore.
That would be pretty cool to see.
