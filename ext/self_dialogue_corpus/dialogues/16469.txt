I really love Jason Isbell.
Really, who is he?
He's a guy from Alabama, he used to be in Drive By Truckers. He's really blowing up right now.
Have I heard any of his songs on the radio?
Well, not on terrestrial radio, no. Americana doesn't get much playtime, unless you're listening to NPR
Oh. Well what songs of his should I check out?
Try Alabama Pines, Cover Me Up, or basically anything off the last three albums.
What are the last three albums?
Here We Rest, Southeastern, and Something More Than Free are the last three of his solo albums.
Are there others albums of his?
Oh yeah, you should also check out Southern Rock Opera, which is the best album he made with Drive By Truckers.
Are his live shows any good?
They're amazing, I've been following him for over a decade and his shows just keep getting better.
Where does he tour?
He plays everywhere in the U.S. and Europe, decent sized venues. Not stadiums, but large theaters.
Oh, awesome! Where have you seen him?
I've seen him in Birmingham, Atlanta, Mobile, Nashville, Portland, Seattle, and a couple of other places.
Does he ever play any festivals?
He played Hangout one year, but he's since stopped, so only solo shows for now.
I'll have to check him out!
