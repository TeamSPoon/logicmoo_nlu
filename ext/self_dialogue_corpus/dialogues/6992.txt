What's your favorite Disney movie?
I really liked Aladdin.
Oh yeah!  Robin Williams as the Genie; he stole the show for sure.
Yeah.  What about you?
I really like The Lion King.
Another fantastic Disney classic!  I like that movie too.
There's just something about them back then that made them so much more.. relevant?  I don't know.
They were so impressive and grand--it took years to make a movie like that, and now it takes, what, months?
Maybe that's it. I don't know.
There's just something about old Disney movies that can't be recaptured.
