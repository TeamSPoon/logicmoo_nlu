So big question, who is your favorite NFL team?
I guess I'd have to go with the Dallas Cowboys.
Really? You live in Pennsylvania?
I know, and believe me my neighbors aren't happy about it!
Do they give you flack on game days?
More than just game days! And sometimes it gets really heated!
I can only imagine.
Trust me you have no idea!
Do you have a favorite player?
I'm gonna go with Troy Aikman on that one.
He was a quarter back right?
Yep, and he got us three Superbowl rings!
Awesome. Didn't he also play with Emmit Smith and Michael Irvin?
Absolutely, and having receivers like them makes it easier on a quarterback.
Well yeah I guess so.
The 90'2 were good to the cowboys.
And don't forget about the cheerleaders.
Best looking group out there.
And talented.
Makes a good game even better.
