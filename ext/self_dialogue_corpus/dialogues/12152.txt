What did you think about Rogue One?
I thought it was great. It fit really well into the over-arching Star Wars story.
I agree. I thought it shoehorned very cleanly into the existing narrative.
I really like that Disney and LucasFilms has been incorporating strong female leads.
Yeah, Jyn Erso was a great character in Rogue One and Rey was a great character in The Force Awakens.
I'm really interested to see where the story goes with Rey in the next saga movie.
Yeah, I'm super excited for The Last Jedi to be released.
There's so much speculation right now about what is going to happen in the next story.
Yeah, I don't get too wrapped up in that as I don't want to know too much of the storyline going into the next movie.
Yeah, I like to be surprised too.
