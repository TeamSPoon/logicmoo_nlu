Did you know Up came out eight year ago?
Really, man time goes by quick.
Yeah, I watched the opening scene again yesterday and it still makes me cry.
Oh man don't remind me. I can't believe Ellie died that was too much.
Yeah I felt way too many feelings. Thought it was just going to be a fun adventure movie.
Boy, you were wrong. Although the rest of the film is really funny.
It's also so cute.
Yeah I love the dog. What's he called.
Dug.
Or is it Doug?
