So, what did you think of  Rogue One?
I don't know, I didn't really like the beginning at all.
Yeah, I agree, the first half hour of the movie was really slow.
Yeah, and it seemed like there were four different beginnings all just bolted together.
Well, the special effects were cool.
Sure, everything in the movie looked really great, I just thought the plot wasn't that great.
Well, they had to wrap everything up because it was a prequel but none of the characters are in any of the original movies.
Sure, but why not just have the characters ride off into the sunset instead of killing everybody?
I don't know, I guess they wanted to make sure nobody would be expecting sequels.
I guess. I'm excited for the next side story movie, though.
