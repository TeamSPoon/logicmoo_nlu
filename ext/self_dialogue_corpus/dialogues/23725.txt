Have you seen frozen?
Yes.  My kids have made me watch it a million times.
I love it, such a good movie
It has a good message too, not all true love has to do with a man
I know, it reminds you true love is family to
It's the sweetest
I love Elsa and ana
My favorite character was olaf
He was so fun you and cute
I love his summertime song
Me too, he is adorable
Definitely my favorite part of the movie
Definitely.
I hope they come out with a second one
I think I heard talk of a second one, but I'm not sure
That would be great
I wonder what the plot would be
I'm sure it would be really good
Me too, I really hope it's a thing
Same.
