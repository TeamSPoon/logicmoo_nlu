We watched a few Stallone movies over the weekend.
Which ones? He's got tons of movies.
Rambo was the first one.
Great movie. Sort of felt bad for him in that.
Yeah, me too.
All he wanted to do, was pass through town.
See racism in a different form.
I know, just because of the way he looked.
He did some crazy things to those soldiers.
Yes, they didn't know who they were messing with.
