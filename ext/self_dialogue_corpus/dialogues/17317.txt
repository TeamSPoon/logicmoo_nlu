who was your favorite boy band?
I don't want to admit it, but hanson!
haha, that is not really my def of boy band but I suppose it was a boy band.
Ya  A little different since they were brothers.
I actually enjoyed them too.
Mmm Bop was a huge mage hit back in the day.
It was on like ever time the radio was playing in the car.
I am glad I am not alone in my hanson love.
Did you have a favorite brother?
Well Taylor.
I liked Isaac and Tyler. Zac was way too young to crush on.
Very true. I think he may have aged the best though.
Did they get together again recently?
Their latest album was released 2013.
Oh, i didn't know they are still actively making music.
They are, anthem is decent but I am not a die hard fan of the newer stuff.
To me they are forever the young boys back in the 90s.
I think that is most people image. Hard for them to shake.
Now I feel guilty for not seeing them for what they are, grown!
Well why not give the newer stuff a listen, see how you like it.
