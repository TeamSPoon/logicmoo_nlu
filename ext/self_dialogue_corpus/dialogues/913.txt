Which football player do you think had the hardest time retiring?
Brett Farve 100%.
What makes you say that?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I don't recall anything about him that was that bad.
He retired 3 times man,
What? When?
First from Green Bay. I think it was the off season when he did that.
Okay.
Then he retired from the Jets.
I forgot he was on that team.
Lastly he retired from the Vikings.
Ok I totally forgot he was on the Jetd and the Vikings.
It got so bad that nobody cared if he was going to retire anymore.
I guess considering how many times he announced it people got burned out on the information.
I certainly did. The guy just didn't want to let go of his career.
Well maybe it was the fame, or the competition you know?
Yeah but come on the guy is almost 50 years old.
What agre did he retire?
He was forty when he finally hung it up.
