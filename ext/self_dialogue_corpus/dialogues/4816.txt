do you think pete rose should be allowed in the hall of fame
thats a tough topic
yeah i know i think he should be in
he did bet on baseball
but is that a thing other people arent doing
i think it would be sniffed out right away
it could be but i dont see how it affected his games
he had a passion for the game
how is it any worse than taking steroids
those guys arent in the hall either
yeah but they can get jobs if a team hires them
thats true maybe he should be
i just dont see how you ignore what he did
he probably gets in after he dies
thats terrible let him see it
i think thats the worst kind of punishment
then they need a progressive thinker
As a comissioner?
I think that Manfred does an OK job
He hasnt had any controversies so far
