Does Jennifer Lopez still make music?
I think she does! I heard her on the radio recently.
She used to collaborate with a lot of different musicians.
That's true. She had a very popular song with Pitbull several years ago. It was called "On The Floor"
Now she is on the TV though.
She's an actress?
Yes! She has a big role on a police show.
What was the title?
The title is Shades of Blue
Cool! I love her music and I am sure I will like her TV show when I watch it too.
