Do you like the Dallas Cowboys?
They are the best.
Their web site is dallascowboys.com.
I'll check it out.
They used to play in Cotton Bowl Stadium.
That's in the Fair Park part of Dallas.
Then they moved to Irving Texas.
Yeah they got another stadium.
Then they moved to Arlington.
I liked it when Tom Landry was their coach.
They won several Super Bowls back then.
And Tony Dorsett was quarterback.
I liked Tony Romo.
Their main office is at Valley Ranch.
I think that is in Irving Texas.
They were established in 1960.
That's 57 years ago.
They play at AT&T Stadium now.
Actually their new headquarters is in The Ford Center at The Star.
That's in Frisco Texas.
