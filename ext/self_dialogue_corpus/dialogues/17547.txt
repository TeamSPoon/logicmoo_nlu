Do you like any of Johnny Cash' music?
Yeah quite a bit actually.
He's a giant figure in the country music industry.
Right, really impressive.
They say he's one of the bestselling musicians of all time.
Something about his persona likely sold all those albums globally.
He did seem like a good ol' boy.
What songs do you like?
Since his voice was so soulful, I like the sad ones like Ring of Fire.
I like that one a lot.
Then Folsom Prison Blues. Sorrowful, he really mastered the sound.
There was controversy about that song too.
By performing it in Folsom Prison?
That, and then the lyrics too.
I'm surprised. How so?
I heard it was something about a man dying, but its hearsay.
That's how the rumors start. I think he had a rough life.
He played that up by always dressing in black.
But isn't that song Man in Black stating his ideas about racism?
I think so, after he'd talked to some college students he wrote it.
