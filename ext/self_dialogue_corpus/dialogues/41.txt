Will  you be seeing Wonderwoman?
Probably not.
Why not?
I'm not really a big fan of Wonderwoman.  I wish they'd make a Supergirl movie though.
Yeah, that would be good.
The effects look good in the new Wonder Woman movie though.
Yeah, I've heard that.  That's one of the reasons I want to see it.
I'm gonna see it when it comes to DVD though.
Well, I'll let you know how it is!
Yeah, do that!
