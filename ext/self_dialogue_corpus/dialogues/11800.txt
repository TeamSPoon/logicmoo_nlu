One of my friends went to a Billy Joel concert last weekend in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Was it a good concert?
She said it was. He sang "A Day In The LIfe" from the Beatle's album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
So Billy Joel is a Beatle's fan?
She said he's a big fan. He was talking about how he just got out of high school when it came out, and it was the summer of love, and how he loved that album.
Oh, the wild sixties they tell all those stories about.
She said he talked about how that was his favorite band, and how it inspired him to become a singer too.
Billy Joel's had a long career and a lot of hits.
He's played a lot of Beatle's songs during his career she said, so his fans were happy to hear him singing something he enjoys so much.
I'm sure the Beatle's would be glad to know their music lives on with another singer. .
