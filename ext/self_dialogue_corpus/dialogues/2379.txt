I really, really like Marshawn Lynch.
Me too, what is it that you like about him?
Mostly I like his attitude and ability on the football field.
I agree because he seems to let his play do the talking.
He definitely does, even during the Superbowl media coverage he would hardly say anything.
Honestly, I would prefer to hear what he thinks more often.
I'll be happy to see him play again.  Did you hear he's playing for the Oakland Raiders this year?
I did hear that and I'm quite excited about it.
As a Seattle Seahawks fan I really wish he was still with my team.
Yeah, it's kind of sad the way that second Superbowl ended.
I think he definitely deserved that second victory and I'm mostly just disappointed at the play calling there.
I'm sure most people were.
The worst part of it is, even though so many people agree that play calling was terrible, that guy is still with the Seahawks.
At least we'll probably get to see Marshawn Lynch run the football in this upcoming season.
The Raiders made the playoffs last year so maybe having him will make them a real competitor.
You never know, sometimes football seems like pure chance with the injuries and all.
Speaking of injuries, that's another thing I really love about Marshawn Lynch.
What's that?
It just seems that he's a super tough guy and is very durable.
You definitely need durability to be an NFL running back.
