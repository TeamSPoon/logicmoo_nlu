Are you looking forward to Transformers: The Last Knight?
No. No, no no no no. Never.
Why? It's our childhood.
Michael Bay is NOT our childhood. He ruins everything he touches
I don't think so. They're entertaining.
Then you're a child. His movies have so many cuts and so much action you can't follow who is doing what.
It doesn't matter! It's just robots beating the crap out of each other.
Which is part of what makes it unwatchable: we don't know what's happening and with whom.
Well, I'm going to see it. The plot looks good.
What...IS...the plot?
You don't know what it is?
I've seen the previews and have no idea what it's about other than robots on Earth again.
It's about the Last Knight.
Who is the Last Knight?
umm, I'm not sure yet.
See? You're hardcore and don't know what it's about!
It's about why they keep coming back to earth.
You  just looked that up. WHO is the last knight?
Markey Mark!
Ha, no. My guess is that the Earth's core has something vital to them.
