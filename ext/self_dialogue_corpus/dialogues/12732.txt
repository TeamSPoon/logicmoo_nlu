Whatever happened to Hayden Christensen?
Oh, you mean young Darth Vader.
Well, he was Anakin Skywalker at the time, not Darth Vader.
He technically was Darth Vader at the end of the third film.
Fine, whatever.  My point is that he doesn't seem to have done much after Star Wars.
He probably made a boatload of money from portraying Anakin.
Speaking of which, how did Darth Vader even survive?  I mean, he was pretty beat up.
Guess they got him those new body parts just in time.
I wonder if his suit has good air conditioning.
You have way too much time on your hands.
