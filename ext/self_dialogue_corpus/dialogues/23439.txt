Did you see Girl on a Train?
Actually yeah I did.
What did you think?
Well first let me say I read the book.  The book is better.
That's what I heard too.
So to me they didn't get the main character right in the movie.
Something felt a little off there.
You got that too?  Did you read the book?
No I didn't.  But in the movie it felt like they couldn't create that character right, she was too whiny or something.
Okay I see.  And the mystery wasn't so mysterious.
No it really wasn't.
I read the book - what did you think about the mystery and drama in the movie version?
Halfway through I thought, its Justin Theroux.
Right?  Like, this guy can't be this perfect.
And then they made all the women so flawed.
That's true.  None of them were really sympathetic.
Right.  One stole a husband, another drank endlessly, and the other slept around.
Its so sad.
I mean what is the author saying about women?
Well they got redeemed.  I think it was a message about society.
