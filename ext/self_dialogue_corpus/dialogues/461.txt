Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Love it!
Oh? What's your favorite team?
The Bills
The Bills!?!?
Yea man.  My hometown.
Well I can see liking them as a kid.  But after you get older how can you like them?
I dont know.  I guess I just never stopped cheering for them
I see.  But they haven't been to the playoffs since like... the 90's!
Very true.  But I'm hopeful!
That's all you can be with a team like that!
Well our roster is looking pretty mean this year
The thing is, it has several other times in the past as well
True.  But this year it will be different
People keep saying that every year!
Yea but you gotta keep the faith alive!
I gotta run
Yea, we'll talk later
