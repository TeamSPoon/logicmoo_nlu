When I was in Chicago some years ago I was staying in a hotel next to the theater where the Lion King stage musical was playing.
Did you see it?
I tried to. I waiting in line at the Will Call.
What's the Will Call?
If someone hasn't shown or there are extra tickets they'll sell them to you the same day for that night.
Did you get in?
I was third in line. The two ahead of me got the last tickets.
Oh no!
I was sorely disappointed. But I saw in a few months later when I returned.
That's good!
