Are you into classic rock?
Like 60s and 70s era? Yeah, definitely.
What are your favorite bands from that era?
Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, that kind of thing. You?
I love Led Zep and Pink Floyd too. Do you like The Rolling Stones?
I always thought they were a bit overrated to be honest.
Wow, really?! What have you listened to?
Not much beyond the really well-known stuff, if I'm honest.
That's the problem then - the Rolling Stones best stuff is their least known stuff.
Like The Beatles, huh? What would you recommend?
Just play a classic Stones album through - the non-single tracks will show you what a great band they are.
I will do, thanks. I had the same thing with The Beatles. They're best stuff is the least-know.
Yes, all the early pop Beatles that everyone knows is way before they started experimenting.
With both drugs and different genres! That was most bands back then, though.
What's your favorite Beatles album?
Probably 'The White Album', because it has so many different types of songs. You?
'Revolver' or 'Abbey Road' - they're both really different but I love them equally.
The Beatles never made a bad album, which is pretty extraordinary.
All four were so talented and in tune with each other... there'll never be another band like that.
Maybe one day, you never know. That was a great era for rock music though.
