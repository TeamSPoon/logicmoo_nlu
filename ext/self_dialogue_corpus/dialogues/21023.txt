Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy Movie?
I haven't seen it yet.
You totally should! I'd even go see it with you just to see it again.
Really? Do you think it's really that good?
Yes, I totally cried at that movie and I never cry at movies.
I wasn't sure I would see it, actually.
Why's that?
Well, I've heard some really mixed reviews about it.
What do you mean by that?
Well, some of my friends loved it, but others really hated it.
I honestly can't believe that. I can't think of what they could possibly hate about the movie.
Well, someone told me they thought that the plot was too all over the place.
I definitely disagree. There were a few different plot lines going on, but they are came together in the end.
I also heard that it was a bit too over the top.
What big box Hollywood movies aren't over the top right now?
True. That is true.
What good feedback did you hear about the movie?
Well, my friend Kristopher told me that he thought it would be this generation's Star Wars if that franchise wasn't still going on.
I think that's a pretty accurate description. Why don't you decide for yourself? Want to go see the movie tomorrow night?
Sure thing. Let me know what time and I'll be there!
