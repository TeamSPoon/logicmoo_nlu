So how do you feel about Green Day?
I guess Green Day is ok.
Do you like the lead singer?
Yeah Billy Joel's okay I guess.
You don't sound like you like him very much.
Well at least he's from Berkeley so he grew up in the same neighborhood as me.
What does that have to do with it?
I don't know there's something about an artist being from your same town that makes you like them more.
Yeah I guess that makes sense.
Have you scene American Idiot yet?
No I haven't gotten a chance to go to the theater.
Yeah me either supposed to be really good though.
Hard for me to imagine Broadway along with Green Day music.
You don't think Hard Rock mixes with theater?
Not really but I guess things are changing.
Yeah shows like Book of Mormon coming out the type of music at Broadway shows it is totally different these days.
How often do you get to the theater?
Almost never.
Yeah me either I talk about it like I do though.
Yeah I like to act like I'm cultured but I'm really not.
