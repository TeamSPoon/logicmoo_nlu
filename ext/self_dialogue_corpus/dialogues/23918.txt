Have you seen the movie Moonlight?
No but I really want to see it! It looks really good. Who created it again?
It was written and directed by Barry Jenkins.
Oh yeah, and who is in it again?
Some of the actors in it are Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali.
Yeah I really hope to see it.
I like films that do that showing a storyline through someone's life, at different stages of their life.
Yeah it's a really cool way to do movies.
What other things do you want to see? Have you seen Inside Out?
Yeah it was cute!
It was! I like how they represented different emotions as different people.
Yeah that felt like something I could relate to.
Me too, and the animation was good.
It was. Do you want to see any other movies?
I want to see Black Panther when it comes out.
I would like to see that too. When does it come out?
On February 18, 2018.
That's a while. Did you see the trailer?
I did. It looked good.
Yeah, it looked intense!
