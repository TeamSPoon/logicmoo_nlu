What are some good folk music groups that you like?
Like modern folk music?
I guess so, well groups that are still making music today.
I like Iron and Wine a lot.
What do they sound like?
Most of their songs are just acoustic guitars and gentle singing.
That sounds very peaceful.
It is, and they sing in such a soft way that you feel like you're being sung to sleep.
That's very nice. What do they sing about?
They sing about romance and simple things in life, like saving money for the weekend.
That's pretty refreshing. A lot of people sing about more complicated things.
I guess some of their songs can be complicated.
What is their guitar playing style like?
They play a decent amount of chords, but do some arpeggiated stuff that can be really intricate.
I've always liked it when people do that.
Me too, so much of folk music today is just people playing guitar chords and singing.
Sometimes the simplicity is nice though.
Yeah, I can understand that.
Sometimes you really just want to hear the singer's voice, and have some accompaniment.
That's understandable, as long as their singing voice is good anyways.
