Hey. Any new movies coming out you're interested in?
I'm hearing great things about Wonder Woman.
That stars Gal Gadot, right? She looks like a great choice for the role.
She does! Chris Pine is in the movie too; I love him.
There's that kid's movie Captain Underpants coming out too.
I remember reading the Captain Underpants books. The animation of the movie looks very stylish!
I agree. It looks different from stuff you'd see from Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. I hope it does well.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales just came out recently too.
I've heard OK things about it. I think I'm a little tired of the Pirate movies in general, though.
Yeah, hopefully this movie wraps things up and they move on to something else.
Have you seen the previews for the new The Mummy movie? The one with Tom Cruise?
I have. I think it looks awful.
I much prefer the 1932 version with Boris Karloff. Classic.
My favorite is the 1999 version with Brendan Fraser. Great movie with great comedy.
Agreed. The sequels and prequels to that one got pretty bad, but the 1999 one is top notch.
Have you seen the new King Arthur movie?
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword? No; I've heard mixed things.
I've seen it! I thought it was actually a lot better than I had been expecting.
Oh, really? Maybe I'll have to go see it.
Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur, and he was a good choice, in my opinion. I think you'll enjoy it!
