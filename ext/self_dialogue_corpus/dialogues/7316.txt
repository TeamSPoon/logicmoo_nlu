What do you think is the most memorable Disney musical?
The one I remember most of the songs from is Mary Poppins.
Did you listen to those songs when you were a kid?
Yeah, I sang those song too quite a bit. It's very memorable for me.
Did Mary Poppins have a lot of songs?
Yeah, I remember Supercalifragilistic...You know what I mean.
I know, that's a lot to say. I actually remember Let's Go Fly a Kite and Just a Spoonful of Sugar.
See? There are a lot of memorable songs, aren't there?
Yeah, and Feed the Birds with the old lady in the park.
Yeah, I know there's a lot more songs I can't remember off the top of my head too.
