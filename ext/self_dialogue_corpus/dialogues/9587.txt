I think Nas rhymed better than anyone
NO way he was a great stylist though.
How can you not say Illmatic was dope.
It was good but not the greatest.
I dont know if you know your rap.
Enough to know I can name 2 better artists than Nas.
OK then name them
Tupac and Biggie
Wow they are probably 2 great ones.
Great ones? They were both better than Nas!
