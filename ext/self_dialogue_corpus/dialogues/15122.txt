Have you ever seen Blast from the Past?
Not for a long time.
Was it any good?
Yeah, it's worth a watch.
My buddy has been trying to get me to watch it.
What's the hold up?
Not so big on Brenden.
Christopher Walken alone makes it worth your while.
I didn't know he was in it!
Yeah, he's pretty awesome!
