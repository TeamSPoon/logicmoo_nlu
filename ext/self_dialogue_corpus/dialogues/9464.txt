Are you a fan of Drake?
I think he releases some decent stuff every now and then, but I wouldn't say I like him.
Any particular reason why you don't?
Honestly, I just feel that the majority of his music is a little too emotional.
What specific examples do you have to support that idea?
Well, for instance, 'Take Care' was a great album but all his songs are too focused on how the women of his life shaped him.
Isn't that what a lot of music is about?  Also, is there a different standard for male hip-hop artists to not be as emotional?
Well I would rather listen to how other events shaped him as well, rather than just the women.
I personally believe that vulnerability is a fresh angle to hip-hop and rap, since it is so rare.
I will concede that to you.  Drake does stand out from the crowd in that genre.
