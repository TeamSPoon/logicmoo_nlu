I always loved to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs when I was little.
That was one of my favorites, too! I loved all the cute animals.
The dwarfs were pretty cute, too.
Dopey is definitely the cutest.
I liked Dopey, but Bashful has always been my favorite.
The way Bashful blushes is very adorable! Even Grumpy is cute.
For someone named Grumpy, he's not that bad after all!
I'm glad the Evil Queen lost in the end, and I was very glad she didn't hurt the dwarfs.
Yes, I would have actually been more upset if something happened to the dwarfs than Snow White.
Snow White was a nice person, though. At least she ended up safe!
