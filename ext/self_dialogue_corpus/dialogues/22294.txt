Do you watch any foreign films?
Yea, I'll occasionally watch foreign films that come out on Netflix.  How about you?
I do sometimes.  I actually just saw a Korean movie called "Confidential Assignment."
What was it about?  Was it a spy movie?
Close.  It was about a North Korean and South Korean detective teaming up to catch some villains.
Oh that sounds interesting.  What genre was it?
It was an action comedy.
Where'd you see it?
It was in a local theater that sometimes shows foreign films that are really popular.
I've seen a couple of Korean films in the past.  Anyone I'd know in it?
Do you know the actor Hyun-bin?
Yea I do.  How was he?
He was really good in this role.  He played the North Korean detective.
I saw him in "The Fatal Encounter."
You'll like him in this.  This movie actually reminded me of 'Rush Hour.'
With Jackie Chan?
Yea, because at first, in buddy-cop fashion, the two don't get along.  But eventually, they get past their cultural differences and work together.
I loved 'Rush Hour' 1 and 2, so I'm really excited about this.
I'd be down to go see it again.
Let's go Friday.  This sounds like a movie I'd enjoy.
