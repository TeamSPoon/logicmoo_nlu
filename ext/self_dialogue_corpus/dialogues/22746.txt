You know what was on last night that's a good movie?
Nope, I was busy all night.
Forest Gump.
Oh man I love that movie.
It really had it all.  Drama, lots of comedy, good feeling plot.
When I was a kid my mom told me that it was based on a true story.
And you believed her?
Yeah I did.  It gave me hope haha.
I can see that.  His life was incredible.
From college football to Vietnam.
Even running across the nation.
Yeah and he named all these famous things just by being him.
My favorite part of the movie was when he was talking at DC and saw Jenny.
Oh yeah I love that.
After the emotional speech that no one heard.
Then the crowd clapped for him.
I also like the joke about the Watergate Hotel.
Oh that was classic.
Another good one when he met JFK.
Yeah, and all he says is "I gotta pee."
