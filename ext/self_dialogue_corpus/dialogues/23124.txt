My kid loves the Minions.
Mine too, they are awesome.
Yeah, I actually liked that movie.
The Minions just have a way of making you smile.
I think everyone seems to like those little guys.
I liked when one of them was following that girl in the banana dress.
That was funny.  And when they found the cloths.
That was great too.  When they accidentally killed the T-Rex.
Yeah.  They're always happy too.
That's what gets you.  You can't understand what they say but you can see how happy they are.
Yeah, I think their language is a couple different ones combined.
Yeah, you pick up one or two words and then gibberish.
You know what was awesome?  When the met Gru.
That was great.  It was such an ironic ending.
Yeah, I never liked scarlet anyway.
Oh, remember when they were trying to torture the minions but they just had fun instead?
That was awesome.  See you can't be mad at those guys.
Only Scarlett.  That's why I never liked her.
King Bob was funny too.
Yeah it was.  That whole movie was just kind of charming.
