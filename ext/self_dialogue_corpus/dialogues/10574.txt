Hey. How's it going?
Great. It's good to see you again.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
Yeah. It's been about six years.
What ever happened with your girlfriend?
We actually got married and had a little boy.
How old is your son now?
He's five and has completely taken over control of the house.
I hear you. When my son turned four, he started commandeering the TV remote control.
Yes, my kid has done that too! We never watch what we want anymore because he'll throw a tantrum.
Haha! That's exactly what happens to us.
The worst thing is when I want to watch a movie. He won't let me.
Yeah, that's very hard to put up with. The other night, I wanted to watch Captain America, but we had to watch Paw Patrol for the umpteenth time instea.
I know exactly what you mean. If my wife and I want to watch a movie at home, we have to wait til late night when our boy goes to sleep.
Right. And it's hard to enjoy a nice movie when you have to be awake in six hours for work.
I hear you loud and clear!
But i just want my son to be happy. And at least we spend time together watching his shows.
Yes, soon enough he'll be off doing his own thing.
Well, it was great to see you again. It ws great to catch up with you.
Likewise. And I look forward to movie time soon, haha!
