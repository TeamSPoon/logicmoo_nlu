Who was one of your favorite rock bands?
Ted Nugent was great, I loved his songs.
Me too, I like the song Cat Scratch Fever, what song did you like?
Stranglehold was the best, it had a good beat.
Yes and I loved his long hair and mustache.
Where was he from anyway?
I think he was from Detroit.
I never knew that. Have you been to his concert?
No, but it would have been nice.
I wonder what he's doing now.
