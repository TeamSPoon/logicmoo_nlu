Janet Jackson was very big back in the day.
Well it didnt hurt she was born into music royalty.
So you think she rode the coat tails of her family?
Yes I think she got a boost with them
Rhythm Nation was a massive hit
Its what really started her career
And then the Super Bowl incident
Thats what gave her life in the 2000s.
I think she is still making music
Maybe but who would know?
