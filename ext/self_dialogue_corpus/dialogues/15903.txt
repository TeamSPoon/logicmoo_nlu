Have you heard of Guided By Voices?
No, I haven't.
The frontman and master is Robert Pollard. He's one of the most prolific artists in the history of rock.
What do they sound like?
I don't know, kind of like The Who? There's so much variety. He's released 100 LPs under lots of different guises.
Wow, that's a ton. Where are they from?
Pollard is from Dayton, Ohio. Not really a rock hotbed!
No, it isn't. What do you like about them?
It's hard for me to put it into words, the chords he uses just resonate with me. It's like someone made music just for my consumption.
How long has Pollard been active?
He was a schoolteacher in the 1980s, running the band in his spare time.
When did they become famous?
Pollard was in his late 30s when they first got noticed in the early 90s. He's nearly sixty now.
That's old!
Yes, it is, but he's still doing high leg-kicks and slamming Miller Lites like he's 21 at their shows.
Miller Lite? Not exactly a highbrow beer.
No, and GBV isn't a highbrow band, but they're incredible.
When is their next release due out?
Their next album is called How Do You Spell Heaven? and it's out in August.
Thanks, I'll have to check it out!
