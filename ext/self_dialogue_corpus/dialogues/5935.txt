Which villain do you like more-Maleficent or Ja'Far?
Hmm that is a hard one.
I know because they both are so devious and ruthless.
Maleficent is evil incarnate but as a fairie as were Ja'Far is evil as a Genie or Jin.
I think that Maleficent is more protective of what she believes to be hers...
But Ja'Far just wants pure raw power.
I think Maleficent's powers are drawn from emotions of fear and jealousy.
And Ja'Far draws his dark magic from anger and vengence.
I like Maleficent more.
I think I like Ja'Far more. What does that say about us?
