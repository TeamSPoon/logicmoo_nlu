Uncle Billy can you change the station please.
You don't like K-Earth?
I used to as a kid, but oldies are just too old now.
I can see what you mean, but the Bee Gees are my favorite, I am gonna leave these guys on for this song.
I do love their greatest hits album, I forgot how many good songs they have.
So you do like oldies!
I like some old bands, Bee Gees just have a flawless lead vocalist in Barry Gibb.
Barry was the man back in the 70s when I was young!
I bet he was, when they did the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack they must have been on top of the world.
I remember when that came out, and Night Fever was the best song I'd had ever heard!
I think Stayin' Alive is a bit overplayed and their other tracks deserve more praise as well.
Well what is your favorite song of theirs?
It is a hard choice, but Night Fever or How Deep Is Your Love?
What a heartfelt song to pick, and a heartfelt answer to boot!
I might actually reconsider for the song Spirits!
Oh wow, Spirits Having Flown was such an under rated album!
I completely agree, the self titled track, you remember it?
Of course Brandon, I love that song!
The melody is so bittersweet, one of the best songs ever written.
It surely is, I am proud of you!
