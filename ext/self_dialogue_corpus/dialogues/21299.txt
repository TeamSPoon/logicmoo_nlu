Have you seen any good horror films lately?
Yeah I saw that one movie written by the Peele guy.
Jordan Peele? You saw 'Get Out'?
Yeah that one! It was awesome!
What was scary about it? And I don't want it to be too funny, was it?
It was a good blend of both. I was really scared at some parts but it is funny throughout.
That is awesome to here, I saw some recent horror movies on Netflix but they weren't that good.
I get you, I watch horror movies on those streaming sites and none of them do the job.
Don't spoil anything for me but does it get supernatural?
Nothing really supernatural, it is more of how the mind gets played with.
Does it end well?
I thought so, I was mostly scared so I was relieved it had ended.
Haha nice! Did you see it with anybody?
Yeah, I saw it with my cousin.
How old is your cousin, was he scared?
My cousin is older than me, he was fine.
Would you want to see the movie again?
Possibly, it is intense but if you wanted to we could go.
Awesome, I will call you this weekend!
Sounds good!
