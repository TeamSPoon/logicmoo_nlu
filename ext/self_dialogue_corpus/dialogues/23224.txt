Have you seen Kong: Skull Island?
I haven't. Was it any good?
I was surprised how much I liked it.
Who is in it.
John C. Reilly. John Goodman. Brie Larson. Tom Hiddleston.
Huh. Does it pass the Bechdel test?
Nope. not really.
Was it fun to watch at least?
It was fun. Samuel L. Jackson is in it too. He's always fun
I heard John C. Reilly hammed it up.
He did. It was good though.
How were the special effects.
They were excellent. all the animal fight scenes were cool
What happens to Kong in the end?
I'm not going to spoil it!
I'm never going to watch it, just tell me
I actually can't remember.
Sounds like it was a real good movie then.
Haha, I guess it wasn't as mesmerizing as I thought.
I'm sure Kong came out fine in the end.
