Are you going to see Wonder Woman?
I am not sure yet.
Why do you not know yet?
It looks really interesting but Batman vs Superman was not my favorite.
I think this movie will be totally different!
You think so? Why is that?
I just have a good feeling about it, it looks like a completely different direction.
I does look different, I really liked the trailer.
Yeah the trailer was really good.
It did not give too much away but got my attention.
I also really like the main cast for Wonder Woman too.
Yeah they did pick a good actress for Wonder Woman herself.
So do you think you will see it now?
Yeah I suppose you have convinced me to see it.
Great! I hope you love it as much as I will.
Don't be too hasty if you haven't seen it yet.
Critics have given it really good reviews so far.
What critics like and what the people like can be very different.
That is true, they differ a lot sometimes.
I always have to judge it myself.
