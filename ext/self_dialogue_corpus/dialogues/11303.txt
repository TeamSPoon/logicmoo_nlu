Wow my dad just sent me this link to these guys called the Beatles
Yeah I've heard of them, all the old folks love them
They really are awazing
I guess, I remember hearing that song Paperback Writer,,,it's my mom's favortie
But they really are amazing you should check them out.  They were huge in the 1960s, you know, last century.
What's the big deal?
They were some of the first rock musicians to write and record their own songs.  Before that songwriters rarely recorded...Elvis was just a singer, not a writer so the Beatles changed the game for everybody.
Now THAT I didn't know.  I just assumed they all wrote their own music
The Beatles were pioneers to what we listen to today
I'll definitely check them out.
