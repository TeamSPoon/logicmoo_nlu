Not, really the movie was not as good as the other Jason Bourne movies. They should not make anymore.
Good because Matt Damon needs to move on.

No he annoying me and I do not like his friend Ben Affleck. Ben should not be Batman.
I like his as Batman I think the Batman vs Superman was great, but Wonder stole the show in that Movie.
Yeah Wonder Woman was great, I like her fight scenes.
Me too her fight seen was cool, and she made the scene when she was happy to fight Doomsday.
I think Doomsday was a weak villian, they should have had a better villan.

Of course not, I'm sure he will be in the Justice League movie.

Where that movie looks like it's going to be good.
