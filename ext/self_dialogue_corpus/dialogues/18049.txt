I enjoy music from the 70's andc80's.  Do you like Queen?
I do.  Love Freddie Mercury.
I guess they were going to do a biopic about him that's stalled.
They should though, that's a shame. He seemed like a good guy.
I think so too. Boy could he sing!
I love his voice. I wish he'd had a longer life.
Could be rough in that world. What songs did you like?
Oh, Bohemian Rhapsody, Killer Queen, and We are the Champions.
Right on.  They had a lot of good hits.
And they're still popular today, they say.
Freddie was the heart of that band.
I can see that.
And he was on Rolling Stone list of the 100 greatest singers ever.
Cool. At what number?
Sixteen I believe.
Well I would rank him higher.
It would be something to see a Mercury vs. Plant faceoff.
Or even a mashup!
That would be like a slice of heaven.
Guess its too late and won't be possible.
