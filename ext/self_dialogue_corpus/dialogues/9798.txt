who do you think is the worst rapper of all time?
I think lil wayne is the worst of all time.
no way he so many good songs he came out when he was like 12 I think
just because he came out when he was 12 doesn't make him good
have you ever heard his carter 3 mixtape with the song kush
no I haven't
that song is one of his best songs I think
how does the chorus go
cause we smoke that kush and ball like swoosh.......you should check it out on youtube
I'll check it out and see it I like it.
