What do you think of Disney music?
I think it's okay, but isn't it just made for kids?
Sure, but a lot of it is written quite well, especially the more modern stuff, and many of it has won Grammys and Oscars!
Well, I hate songs like It's A Small World... they're just annoying and repetitive.
It's true that some of those songs don't stand the test of time, but more modern songs like the Elton John stuff from the Lion King soundtrack are pretty solid.
That's true, and they even made a live play with his music, too, didn't they?
They sure did... and they also get a lot of current pop stars to perform the single versions of the songs from new movies.
Oh, that's right, I remember Demi Lovato singing Let It Go, even though her version was not in the movie Frozen.
Yeah, it seems like everyone wants to get into the Disney recording business!
I guess Disney soundtracks are a good way to make a lot of money.
Sure, and a lot of these recording artists probably have kids of their own, so they want to do something their children can relate to.
Has Disney ever used a pop singer to record a song and also voice a character in the movie?
Sure, they got Mandy Moore to voice Rapunzel in Tangled, and she recorded a good portion of the songs on the soundtrack, too.
I remember seeing her perform one of those songs at the Oscars the year it came out!
Absolutely... it seems like the soundtrack to each movie is as important as the movie itself!
When did this shift in importance of Disney Music even take place?
Probably around the late 1980s when The Little Mermaid came out, but I think the one that changed the game was when Be Our Guest came out.
Oh, that's from Beauty And The Beast! Did they re-release the song for the new movie this year?
They sure did... it's sung by the cast of the new movie, so there's a modern spin to it!
I guess you're right about Disney music... I'll have to give it a listen now!
