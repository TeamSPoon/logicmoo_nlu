Do you like any of today's music artists?
Not really. I do like Drake and Kendrick Lamar though.
Yeah they are pretty creative with it. What's your favorite Drake song?
That would definitely have to be Hotline Bling. It's super catchy.
That's my favorite of his too. I loved Erykah Badu's version of it.
Erykah redid Hotline Bling? Is it a totally different sound.
No she left the first part of the music the same, changed the lyrics a little, but the last part is all Erykah.
I loved her first album, Baduizm
That's what the last part of her Hotline Bling sounds like.
That's great, I have to listen to it.
Do you like any other Erykah Badu songs?
Of course I do. Next Lifetime is one of my favorites.
Tyrone is a great one, and also Back in the Day.
Love of My Life was a nice little homage to hip hop.
It really was. I wish her and Andre 3000 had stayed together.
Me too I thought they were the perfect couple.
That song Miss Jackson that Outkast did, I think that was about her and her mom.
Yeah that's the common concensus. She was the only one he had kids with at the time.
Wow that's crazy. So do you like a lot of Outkast's music.
Yes their ATLiens is the best out of all of them if you ask me.
