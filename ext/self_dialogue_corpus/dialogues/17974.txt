Remember when you were little and your mom would sing you a lullaby?
My mom read me stories mostly.
She never sang to you?
Sometimes she would, she just read more often than singing.
I loved when my mom would sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" to me.
That sounds very soothing.
Indeed it was, put me right to sleep.
Do you ever find yourself falling asleep to music now?
Not typically, sometimes though if I'm exhausted.
If you listened to music when you were tired what would you listen to?
Maybe some classical music, something soothing.
That makes sense. I would have to agree.
My sister would sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" to me when I was a toddler.
Oh that's so sweet. I had a book with that song when I was little.
Did you do the hand motions also?
Yes, my grandmother taught me the motions to the song.
Sometimes when I hear certain songs it brings back memories from childhood.
It does me too! I enjoy it.
Isn't that funny how music works?
Yes, it can take you right back to a certain place in time.
