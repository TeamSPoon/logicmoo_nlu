Did you watch the Cubs-Cardinals series this weekend?
I caught two games.
What is up with the Cubs right now?
I know. They are really struggling.
First it was poor starting pitching this season.
Yeah, the first inning runs were a huge problem.
But now that pitching is getting better, the bats are cold.
It's really baffling. Almost every hitter is struggling.
You'd think a team that just won the World Series would still be performing well.
I wonder if that is part of it. Too much pressure on a very young team.
That is highly possible. But the veterans aren't doing so hot either.
I really hope it's a temporary slump.
Me too. What do you think of the bullpen so far?
The pen is the only reliable part right now.
I agree. The bullpen is the only reliable part.
Yeah, even when they have given up runs, it's not really they're fault that the offense isn't providing run support.
Hopefully the upcoming home games will help.
They are playing Cincinnati. The Reds are always good for the Cubs.
Yes, I think we'll see a few homeruns.
And that could be what they need to get out of the slump.
