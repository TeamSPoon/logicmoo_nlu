whos is the best male rapper of all time?
the best rapper now its i think  is kendrick lamar but rapper of all time, i dont think i can choose
You have a point there i mean we have eminem, 50 cents, Snoop dog,Tupac,Notorious Big, Jay Z and a lot more
i think its Tupac
why tupac and not Eminem?
Because Eminem can rap really fast and medium fast
But Tupac has a story behind his Raps
and Eminem also has a story
well everyone has a hidden story or a Non-hidden story
i guess all the rappers are good
