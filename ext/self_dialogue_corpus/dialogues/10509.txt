Hey do you like music or movies better?
I like movies more
Me too, they are easier to talk about
Yes they are
Do you have a favorite genre of movies?
Comedy is my favorite
I like comedy too
A couple of my favorite actors are robin Williams and Jim carry
I love their movies.
Me too, the mask is on of my favorites.
That's a good one.
Yea, I also love Mrs doubtfire
That one is funny
I watched it on TV the other day
I wish he was still making movies.
Me too
He was a classic
There will never be another actor like him
Everyone loved him I wonder why he was so depressed
Me too
