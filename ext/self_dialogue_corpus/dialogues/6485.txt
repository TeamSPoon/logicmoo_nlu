Have you ever seen Cinderella?
Yeah! I love that movie! I love the animation.
Yeah, Disney was ahead of the game for the time period.
I really loved when all of the birds helped her make the dress.
I did too. I loved the pumpkin that turned into a carraige.
Do you know who voiced the main character?
I think it was Ilene Woods.
I haven't heard the name before, but her voice is so familiar.
Yeah she has done a lot of Disney work.
She brought Cinderella to life, you can hear the emotion in her voice
