did you hear the new kanye album?
which one was it?
the life of pablo
the album was okay.
it was much better than yeezus at least.
that is true.
it didnt do much for you?
it just didnt give me the feeling of old kanye west
he is much different since he lost his mom
well, he did release fantasy though after she died
that is one if not his best album too.
see? thats my point
so you dont think its because of that loss?
well maybe a little bit but theres a lot going on in his life
he is a big superstar now.
he is the biggest rapper in the world
yeah, maybe bigger than jayz
jayz is a better businessman though
that is true.
yeah
