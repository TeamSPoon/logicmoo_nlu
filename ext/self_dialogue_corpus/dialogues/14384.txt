What do you think about the Warriors vs Spurs game?
I think it was pretty awesome!
Warriors just bowled them over.
Yeah they took a 3-0 lead.
Lee took a hit though.
Yeah, he wrecked his knee.
It's good to see that Coach Kerr is feeling better.
I think he must be from what I've heard.
Kerr is going to be traveling with the team to San Antonio.
I heard that he might be going with them. That is good to hear.
He has still been involved with the team throughout his illness though.
Yeah, it's not like he's been completely gone, he's been working with them by phone.
Bob Meyers confirmed his plans to travel with the team on the radio, so it must be true.
I heard that interview too.
I bet the players are going to be glad to get him back.
He is popular with the players, he's a good coach.
I can't wait to see them play in the next game.
Me too. I bet they will be pumped with the coach back.
The warriors have really been dominating. I hope they keep it up.
I am sure they will, they are a great team.
