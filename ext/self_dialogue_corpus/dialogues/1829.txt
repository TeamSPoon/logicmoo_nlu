Do you remember Super Bowl XIX?
No not really.
It was one of the greatest QB matchups of all time
Really? Who was playing?
The SF 49ers and the Miami Dolphins.
Oh wait, Joe Montana and Dan Marino?
You got it.
Wow, I had no idea they played against each other in a super bowl.
Yeah, it was quite the shoot out as well.
Was Marino a rookie that year?
No, it was his second year.
Oh wow, who ended up winning?
The 49ers by quite a bit.
Did Marino go on to any other Super Bowls
No, that was his only one.
Oh man, what a disappointment.
Yeah, could never get a strong supporting cast to support him.
That's too bad.
He's still one of the greats though.
Yes he is.
