I just won tickets for tim mcgraw this weekend
wow, how many?
I won 4, would you like to join me?
of course, I just love him
me too, whats your favorite song
Dont take the girl is my favorite
oh man, that one made me cry the first 10 times I heard it
I know, especially at the end when the man is on the floor praying after his wife dies
what other artists do you like?
I love Darious Rucker
How crazy is it that he was in Hootie and the blowfish
I know, thats a change for sure
His voice lends perfectly to country
I love the song "If I told you"
that is my favorite

8:00 on Thursday
I cant wait, do you want me to pick you up?
