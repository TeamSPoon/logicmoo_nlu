They were not aggressive enough on defense.
Do you think that the injury to Kris Letang has impacted the Penguins
Yes; they definitely do not have a strong defenseman that can currently play at his level.

Did you think that the announcers were unfairly harsh on the Penguins
Yes, I did.  I have seen them play much worse hockey.
What are your feelings about keeping Sydney Crosby as captain?
He can be a leader when he wants to.  His talent definitely merits that he be the captain.

They are certainly capable of it.
Have you noticed that the broadcast of the game seems very jerky?

What is your prediction for the remainder of this series?
Penguins in 6 games
