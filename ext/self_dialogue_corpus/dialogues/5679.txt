What was the last Disney movie you've seen.
Huh, well I saw that live action Beauty and the Beast movie the other day.
Oh yeah! With Emma Watson, how was it?
Well I've never seen the animated film, but I really enjoyed it. And it was so star studded.
Who's in it?
Well for one, Ian McKellen. Also Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, and Emma Thompson.
Woah, that's a lot of the great british actors, and obviously Emma Watson to boot! I gotta see it!
I really would, and also Josh Gad is always a plus in any movie.
You're so right, Frozen would have been unbearable without Count Olaf!
Hahahaha wrong series my friend! He was just Olaf the snowman.
