You see that twins game last night?
barrios is a beast.
I know.  11 Ks and only 1 walk
monster.  If he could be a reasonable starter, we could be good
yeah, we need like one more good starter and then we can make a run
I'm not sure about the offense though
still got Mauer
haha, he's washed up
no way man, he's only 33
yeah, but he has NO power
doubles still count and his OBS is great
I don't know, they need Buxton and Sano to come up and play
I like sano, he's the MAN
same, I love watching him rake
what are we going to do about buxton
what do you mean
I mean he's striking out like no tomorrow
that will take care of itself
you think so
well, only time will tell
