Was the Millennium Falcon not the coolest ship ever?
At the time I would have agree with you
So you think it is dated?
No I mean if Star Wars was created nowadays I think it would look so much cooler
Could you see Han Solo being a better pilot?
No I dont think his kind of ship would matter.
I think it would take the Death Star on in a more immediate fashion
I dont think that rings true.
I Would like to see it have more technology
I think for the time period it was just OK
