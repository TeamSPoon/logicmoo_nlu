What do you think of movies now a days?
I like the special effects they have but some of them just become absurd.
I know! theres a lot of movies that exagerate special effects.
Yeah, I kind of miss the old days I think movies had a better story line.
Yeah, movies now focus more on effects that on the actual plot.
Its kind of lame because the most important part is gone.
Do you have a favorite movie?
I like a few actually, one of my favorites is Pearl Harbor though.
I loved that movie, it was so cool and the story line was great.
Yeah, they dont make movies like that one anymore, what about you?
I like Gladiator a lot and then have a few favorites as well.
I liked that movie as well, I think its a great classic.
Yeah, I like the fighting scenes and how the characters get you into the plot.
What do you think about the new Marvel movies.
Actually I like them, I think that those are an exception to the rule.
I like them too, although some movies have way too much visual effects.
Yeah I know they do, but they also have a lot of comedy in them.
I like that funny touch those movies have.
Yeah, its a gret touch and keeps people interested.
Im exited about the new Spiderman movie, it looks great.
