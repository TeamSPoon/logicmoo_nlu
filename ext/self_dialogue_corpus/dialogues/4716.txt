Man the Houston Astros are on fire.
Did they win again?
Yep..they won last night.
How many is that.
They have won 9 of their last twelve games.
How are they doing it?
They are getting timely hitting.
What about pitching.
They have had good pitching, and good defense.
I haven't seen them play much.
They are really winning as a team.
That is great.
I can't believe how well they are playing right now.
Can they keep it going?
Well that is the magic question.
I guess we will see.
It is just really exciting to see them playing so well.
They were pretty good last year.
At the end of last year they were pretty good.
Yeah they didn't start very good last year.
