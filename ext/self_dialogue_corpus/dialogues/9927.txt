I think I can be a rapper. It doesn't take much talent.
Do you have a singing or spoken word background?
I don't think I need either. All rap is is talking quickly, and I always speak quickly.
Rap is a lot more difficult that just speaking quickly. It is a musical artform like anything else. Maybe it seems easier to you that it really is.
Don't get me wrong, I really like and admire artists like Eminem and Jay Z. I think people like that have great flow and charisma.
They also are great storytellers who are basically poets. Many rap songs address so much current news, culture etc
That is certainly true for Eminem at least.
Did you know there is even a course in rap linguistics at the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta. Or that many rappers had training in world-famous music & arts schools?
That's really admirable. Which rapper went to arts school?
Are you familiar with La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts, from the movie Fame? Nicki Minaj and Azaliea Banks and a few others went to school there.
