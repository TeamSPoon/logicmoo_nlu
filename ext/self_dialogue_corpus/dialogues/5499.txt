Have you noticed how it's... kind of hard to find a Disney movie without some kind of obvious racism in it?
I, um. Which movies are we talking about?
Like, almost all of them. Have you seen Dumbo lately?
Not in the last few hours, no.
There's that whole opening sequence with the black workers and the song they sing -- and then toward the end, those crows... Jesus.
Hmm. I don't really remember any of this. I'll have to take a look, later.
It's painful, seriously. And what about Lady and the Tramp, with the Siamese cats, and the Italians?
Oh, those cats creeped me out as a kid. Yeah, uh.
They're well-done, but boy is that stuff problematic.
I guess I see what you mean.
