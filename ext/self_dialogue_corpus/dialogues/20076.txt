Do you think the American Pie franchise jumped the shark?
Anytime you have a right to home dvd release, yes.
Yeah Eugene Levy whored himself out for all of the films.
Poor guy doesnt get many roles.
But none of the other main cast bothered to do any of those straight to release DVDs movies.
They thought they could start a franchise like National Lampoon.
I am sure there are people who are rabid fans of it that watched all of them.
It stinks because movies like that become caricatures of themselves.
Did you see the last one with the main cast?
I did and thought it wasnt that good.
Yeah it was too long in between and the jokes and situations did not seem plausible.
Jason Biggs still couldnt be that awkward with women.
And Stifler couldnt be that much of a hormone driven guy much more.
You never know there are those types.
But has any of them actually done anything since the initial release?
Sure, Sean William Scott did Role Models which was a great comedy.
Yeah, its up there I forgot about that.
I dont know who else did movies though.
I cant remember Jason Biggs wife but she was in TV
Yeah she was, How I met Your Mother.
