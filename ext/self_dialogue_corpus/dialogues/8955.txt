Do you ever listen to rock at all?
I love listening to Joan Jett.
Do you listen to Bad Reputation?
Yeah I was just about to say that is my favorite song.
She was so iconic. I miss artists like her.
Yeah and she was great in concert.
Oh you are so lucky you got to go see her.
Yeah it was something I will not forget.
I loved talking to you!
Same, let us do this again!
