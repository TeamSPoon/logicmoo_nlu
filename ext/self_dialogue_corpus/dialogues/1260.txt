I think I'd be a great NFL announcer.
You'd be horrible
Thanks!
Why do you think you'd be so great?
I'd be beyond literal in the play calling.
How so?
Imagine John Madden.
Eww. Enough.
Come on. John Madden but insanely literal.
Example?
Ask me a question you hear a lot.
"What do the Colts have to do to beat the Patriots today?"
I'd say "They have to score more points."
That's lame, a bit more?
"They have to stop New England on the offensive and score when in the red zone."
Haha, that's exactly what they're like.
Literal, sounds smart, but is insanely stupid.
Know what's crazy?
What?
They get paid a TON of money to state the obvious.
