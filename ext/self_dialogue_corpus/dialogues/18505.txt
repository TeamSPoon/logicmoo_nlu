Did you hear the new Chainsmokers song on Youtube?
Yes it was terrible.
What? I really liked it!
You have terrible taste in music then.
What did you not like about it? Its just like most of their other music.
The lyrics are terrible. They sound like they were written by a teenager.
Ok, that's fair but the Chainsmokers aren't know for their deep lyrics.
I know that but this song is so cliche it's painful.
You really don't like that song. Do you like any of their music?
Yeah I liked their first hit song, Selfie
What? That is probably their worst song.
I know it's your typical hit type song but I find it appealing.
Wow! That is by far my least favorite song of theirs.
To each his own but I like it.
That song sounds nothing like their hits. Do you like the rest of their songs?
I will admit the work after Selfie was different but I liked it.
Ok,now we are on the same page. Out of their newer stuff what was your favorite song?
Probably Don't Let Me Down.
I love that song! Definitely in my top three.
It's a great song. Everyone always gets hyped up when it's played at a party.
