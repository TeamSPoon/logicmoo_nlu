You know who would make really cool jedi knights?
Jay and Silent Bob?
Exactly, they would be the coolest dudes in the galaxy. Cooler than Han.
You got that idea from their movie.
Oh shucks, you're right. Forgot about that.
It is a good idea though.
Yeah, Silent Bob would look really cool all cloaked up with a light saber.
Sure, I mean the dude already wears a trenchcoat all the time.
Now Jay would have to be the jedi stricken between the light and the dark side of the force.
Most definitely, he'd play that fringe type of character, unpredictable and exciting yet torn with a good heart.
