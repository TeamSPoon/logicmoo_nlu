Do you like Inception.
No..
Why not.
It doesn't scan.
I cried watching it as a kid.
Why.
I wanted to live in the Inception world.
That world is ass.
I wanted to escape to dreams.
You love escaping.
It's good.
It was a fresh movie.
No one liked it.
Sure, but it was innovative.
It was a video game movie.
A video game movie without a video game.
Yeah.
It did definitely suck.
I don't care for most movies like that.
They're garbage.
