What's your favorite Beatle song?
I could be like most people and say Hey Jude or I wanna hold your hand, but I prefer some of their deeper stuff like A day in the Life or side 2 of Abbey Road (Golden Slumbers, et al).
The later songs are pretty good, but sometimes get too serious for me. I prefer the earlier hits.
I can understand, but I think the true value of the Beatles as "THE" Super Band is their later music.
Probably is, but I just like their "boy band" songs better, you know, I Saw her standing there and Eight Days a week.
I get you, but for me songs like Tomorrow Never Knows and She's Leaving Home are more inspiring.
You may be right. If I had to pick some of their later songs it would be ones like Penny Lane or Yellow Submarine.
Those are fun and I think help move listeners over into their more serious stuff. Don't get me wrong, I think the great thing about the Beatles is that they are both fun and deep!
I agree, that's why that are the super group of all time!
What's the saying, if you don't like the Beatles you don't like music! LOL!
