Have you seen any movies lately?
I saw The Mummy with Tom Cruise.
Was it good?
No. It was boring and mediocre.
Really? Tom Cruise is usually in great movies.
Yeah, I agree to some extent. He used to be in good movies. Maybe he has lost his passion for acting.
Was he not good in The Mummy?
He was lackluster. His attempt at comedy in the movie was awful. The script didn't help.
Can you explain?
Well, all the comedy in the movie was the characters screaming back and forth at each other.
I still don't get it. What do you mean by that?
The comedy was basically the actors repeating what was said to them and pointing out that the situation is absurd.
Well, it is a supernatural movie and the situation is absurd...
Exactly. The audience already knows the basic situation beforehand. There's no reason to constantly point it out.
What else didn't you like about it?
The clips of Ahmanet in Egypt were shown over and over again. It seemed like filler to me.
Isn't Universal making more movies after this one?
Yeah, I think it's called The Dark Universe or something. They introduced Dr. Jeckyll in this movie.
So, you're not going to see the other movies?
No way. The Mummy has turned me off. Really can't think of anything positive about it. I love The Mummy franchise with Brenden Fraser.
