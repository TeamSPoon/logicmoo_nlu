Anything to be excited about?
Everything to be excited about.
Tell me more.
For once you get to see a good superhero movie where a woman plays the lead role.
Like Cat Woman?
It is the exact opposite of that.
How so?
This one has a better plot and is directed better. It has great action scenes too.
Is it violence based?
Only necessary violence.
Who plays the leading role?
Gal Gadot. Do you know her?
Yes , in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
Oh, she was stunning in that one.
Can't agree more.
I can't wait to see how well she performs in this one.
Me too. Should I get you a ticket?
Absolutely. I'm clearing my weekend schedule.
