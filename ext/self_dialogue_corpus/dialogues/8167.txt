I loved Taylor Swift's 1989 album.
Me too! I think it's her best one yet.
Rumor has it she will be releasing a new album by the end of the year.
I sure hope so. I wonder if she wrote songs about Calvin Harris.
I'm sure she did. A lot of her songs are about her relationships.
That's what I love about her music.
Me too! Her songs are so relatable.
Yeah and since they're based on her experiences, you know they came from her heart.
I hope she goes on tour next year.
Me too! Let's go together.
