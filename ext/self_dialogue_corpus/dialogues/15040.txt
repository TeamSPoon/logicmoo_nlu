Have you seen any good comedy movies lately?
This year? No. I did see that new Ghostbusters movie, but I don't recommend it.
Oh yeah? Why not?
In my opinion they butchered the franchise. It's literally a gender bend of the original film but much worse.
If it's just a gender sawp how could they of made it worse?
Well for one it's overly charged with feminist undertones. Every singe guy in the film is portrayed as a total moron.
Well how is the comedy aspect of the film? Was there nothing funny about the movie at all?
It had one or two funny points but it really didn't save the movie at all.
It sounds like a movie I might watch when it airs on netflix or something.
I wouldn't waste your time honestly. If you liked the original you will hate this.
