Let's talk about Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Too many people complained about this movie.It wasn't as good as the first one but it was good.
I thought Ultron was a little disappointing.
He wasn't the best bad guy but the Vision was so cool.
The Vision was the best. He was enigmatic a first but he won the Avenger over.
He won Thor over quickly by picking up his hammer.
That was so funny, none of the Avengers could pick up the hammer but the Vision did.
WHAt was it, only he who is worthy can pick up the hammer Odin said.
And the Vision did it, handed it to Thor like it was nothing.
Yeah, I like that part.
