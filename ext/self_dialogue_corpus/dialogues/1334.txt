What do you think about the Eagles new draft picks?
They seem to have it going on.
Really, that's great!
They were superstars in college and going to help this season.
Rookies can make a team, but it's hard.
Yeah, new blood is good.
I hope to see them play at the park this year.
Sweet!
Are you going tailgating this season?
Absolutely.
How often do you go?
Every game that I go to we always tailgate.
Do a lot of people?
Yeah. It's usually a good crowd.
Do you get rowdy?
Nah, just enjoy ourselves enough to not get in trouble.
What do you eat?
We pack some good grilling things and drinks.
Awesome.
You wanna come with sometime?
