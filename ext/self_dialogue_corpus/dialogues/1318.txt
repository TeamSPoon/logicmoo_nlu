Want to go a game this year?
What kind of game?
You know exactly what I'm talking about, what game's would I go to besides an NFL game.
I guess you're right.
So do you?
Yeah man, what game are you thinking?
Well, the Jets and Dolphins are playing on September 24th.
In Miami?
Nah, Jets are home, so you'll be a little out of your element.
Haha, I'll be the only Dolphins fan there.
Nah, I'll bring Jess, she's a Dolphins fan too.
Alright awesome, we're going to kill the Jets.
Doubt it, we're looking pretty good this year.
You say that every year, what's different this time.
Enunwa is looking great this year.
And?
Well between him, Forte, and Mccowen, we've got a shot at being decent.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
I'll bet you $200 we win.
I'll take that bet.
