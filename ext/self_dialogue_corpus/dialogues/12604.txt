Can you see the Star Wars franchise ending
They have no movies in the pipeline passed the 9th edition
They could always be doing more just not in the planning phase
Yeah I think they may just retire and go out on top
That probably wont be the case.
They always do seem to bank on these movies.
I think they need all new characters
They did introduce them in the force awakens
Yeah but they are still holding onto the original cast
So you want C3PO out too? You are nuts!
