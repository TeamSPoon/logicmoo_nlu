Remember how concerts used to be
Yeah
They used to be so wild
Sometimes they were
Whaddya mean most of the time
I guess so
Well like now they are so boring by comparison
Is not just more of the crowd you are around
Possibly i guess
Nah for real it is
But explain that
The crowd is the one that carries you
Carries?
You know entertains and such
Makes sense i guess
Just find more interesting people
I guess i can work on that
Then you should be good to go
Yep
Well?
