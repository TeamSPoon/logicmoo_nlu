The playoffs are more competitive.
A stadium full of people must be exciting.
It would be great to go to.
It would also be fun for the athletes.
Have you ever been to an NFL stadium?
I've been to the Tennessee Titan's stadium, but not for a game.
The NFL has plenty of fans.
Yeah, the stadiums are really big.
Yeah, they are one of the first structures you notice in a city.
It is fun to predict who will win.
It's always hard to tell.
