Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?
Some of them - which is your favorite?
Tough to pick, but probably the first one.
Mine too. It's crazy how young they all look!
I know! You forget until you watch the recent ones where they're almost 10 years older.
They did a great job casting the Harry Potter movies - they really grow up with the characters.
It's so difficult to imagine anyone else playing any of those roles.
Which is an amazing achievement for child actors, really.
I read the books and visualized all 3 of the main characters looking exactly like that.
I always liked how true to the books the Harry Potter movies were.
