When does the new Cars movie come out?
I think it's really soon. It should be a good one.  All of the Cars movies have been good.
I liked the first one really well, but didn't like the second one as much.
I can see that.  It's just hard to beat the first one.  Getting introduced to LIghtning McQueen and Mater and all the other characters.
Yes, it's hard to beat those characters. Do you think they'll have many of the same characters in the new movie?
All that I've seen in the previews is Mater and LIghtning. I'd love to see Sarge or Doc or Sally.
Yeah!  I wonder is Lightning and Sally ever got married?
I wondered that too!  Mater is always so funny.
I think that the second movie focused more on Mater but it looks like this one is going back to Lightning.
That's what it looked like to me too. The first preview looked scary!
