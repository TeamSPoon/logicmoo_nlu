Hey, have you listened to Lorde's new album?
No, I don't really like her.
Are you kidding? Lorde is brilliant!
I thought Royals was sort of vapid, and a little too pop-y for my taste.
Well, her new album is about a break up, and it's anything but vapid.
I mean, a break-up pop album? Everybody does that.
Lorde's lyrics are pop genius, though.
I don't think that she could be better than Taylor Swift.
Just listen to Melodrama, it'll break your heart.
I'm telling you, I'm not a huge Lorde fan!
The lyrics to "Liability" are so personal, you'll really like it, I promise.
Beyonce decided to go personal with Lemonade and now everyone is trying it!
Look, I'm telling you, Lorde confronts some difficult things on this album.
Like what?
She talks about her mental illness, her obsessions, how love is hindered by fame.
That is a little more impressive than her critiquing pop music with "Royals."
Yeah, on this album she's using the medium of pop to express her own story and grief.
Well, maybe I'll have to give her a shot!
Though, "Green Light" is a really fun party song.
Well, I like a party song every once in a while!
