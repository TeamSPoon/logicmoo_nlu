So how do you think is the greatest player in NFL history?
Oh it is hard to say.
Yeah, with all the different positions.
You can go by stats, but what about performance in the clutch, etc?
Then you also have people who were on bad teams.
Barry Sanders was almost always on a bad team.
Yeah, he was basically their whole offense.
He had quarterbacks like Scott Mitchell and Rodney Peete.
I would say Jerry Rice is the greatest player in NFL history.
You can make that arguement.
His stats are so far above everyone else's for the wide receiver position.
Yeah and his work ethic was the stuff of legends.
He would run up and down a steep hill everyday in San Francisco.
He got his soft hands from catching bricks with his dad.
Yeah, I remember reading that.
I would say that Joe Montana is the greatest NFL player of all time.
He was certainty among the most clutch quarterbacks.
They didn't call him "Joe Cool" for nothing.
He went 4 and 0 in Super Bowls.
He also threw 11 touchdowns and no interceptions in Super Bowls.
