Do you think Timon and Pumba were a good influence on Simba?
They were only after pleasure
I think they helped Simba grow up. But they didn't know anything about being a lion
Simba was a boy when he ran away
By the end of the movie, they had had more influence on him than any of the lions
They made him feel better after losing his dad
They did a good job at representing what the animals would really be like. The lions were at the top of the food chain.
Yeah, but they aren't an actual king that the other animals care about
Simba would have a hard time adjusting to the savannah
He was seen as a leader after he had been gone for way too long
