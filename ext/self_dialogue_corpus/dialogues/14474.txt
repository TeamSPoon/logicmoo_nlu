The Milwaukee bucks are a team on the rise
Yeah they have a good coach in Jason Kidd and the Greek Freak is the real deal
This kid can do everything! pass, block, score et cetera
He may be the best player in the league one day
And that day might not be that far off
Yeah you are right. He just needs some help
Yeah, I do like Middleton and Monroe
Yeah they are good pieces. They just need to continue to build
They are going to be a fun team to watch in the upcoming years
I definitely will be keeping an eye on them
Plus they play in the weak Eastern Conference they should be able to gain on the other teams
All of the team not named the Cavaliers.
Yeah you are right about that. Maybe they can move up to the 3rd or 4th seed.
That would be a huge improvement from last year
It's great to see an organization going in the right direction
Yeah it is. They just have to make the right moves going forward
Just don't lose the Greek Freak and everything will be alright.
Exactly. He will keep butts in the seat in Milwaukee
Yeah he has got that city excited again about basketball
I'm excited just watching these guys play
