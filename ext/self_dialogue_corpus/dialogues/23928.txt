What's your favorite animated movie.
I love Spirited Away and all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies.
I do too! I think Princess Mononoke is my favorite.
Ah, yes, that is also a favorite of mine. All of his movies are my favorite!
The only one of his that I didnt like was Ponyo.
Really? Why?
It was pointlessly weird and I felt the plot was weaker than his other films.
I will agree it was weird, although I still liked it.
I think Nausicaa is one of his best.
Yes, that one also had a really strong message about environmental degradation.
I tend to like the ones that have messages like that -- like Princess Mononoke.
True, but I also like his more sweet and carefree movies, like My Neighbor Totoro.
Oh definitely. I love that one. I felt like Mei growing up, the crybaby little sister.
Haha, she is very cute. I love how she falls asleep on Totoro.
Have you seen Howl's Moving Castle?
Yes! That one was different, too. Good antiwar messages.
It was actually based on a book by a British author.
Oh, I didnt know that. Are his other films based on books?
Yes, Kiki's Delivery Service was based on a children's book.
Oh, that's interesting! I love Kiki and her cat Jiji in that movie.
