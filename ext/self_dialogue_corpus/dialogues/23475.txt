See any good movies lately?
Not really
Me either, I'm hoping to get Bye Bye man from redbox this weekend
That looks creepy
I know, that's what I'm hoping
They don't make scary movies like they used to
They really don't.
Annabelle was good though
I really enjoyed that one
I was afraid of dolls for a month.
I can see that, my kids wanted to watch it, I wouldn't let them.
I wouldn't let mine either.
It's definitely not a kids movie.
Not at all
But kids always want to watch that stuff.
Mine wanted to watch ted
Definitely not a kids movie.
Nope, but they thought so because it had a teddy bear.
That probably wasn't smart of the marketing people
Not at all
