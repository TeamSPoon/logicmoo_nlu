Whats up
Who's the greatest running back ever?
Gale Sayers
Wrong
Why not?
Didn't play a long career
So
Many players played a longer career with better stats
He got hurt.
But if you took the years he did play and compare them there's nobody really better
Jim Brown
He's up there
Emmit Smith
Nope
Walter Payton
Gale still has him beat
Barry sanders
He's the modern day Gale
Only if he played for a better team
His numbers would have been amazing
