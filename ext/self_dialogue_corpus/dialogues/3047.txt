So who's your favorite player of all time?
Mine is Walter Peyton.
#34 for the Chicago bears -- one of the greatest of all time.
And he played for one of the greatest teams of all time too.
The 1985 Super Bowl Winning Chicago Bears.
Yep, coached by Mike Ditka.
And Jim McMahon was quarterback. I remember him being sort of a bad boy. Always wearing a headband and sunglasses.
And so many lineman on that team too who went on to make the Hall of Fame.
I remember Richard Dent, Mike Singletary...
And don't forget "Refrigerator" Perry! he was such a character.
Do you also remember the Super Bowl Shuffle?
Yeah, that was everywhere at the time. I used to have it memorized.
In the modern day game, who's your favorite running back?
That's tough. So many great players. I'm a Colts fan though so I'd have to say Robert Turbin.
Good pick. He's not flashy like others, but gets the job done.
Agreed. Even though the Colts had a rough season, he did his part and got the TDs and yards when needed.
Let's hope they can get their stuff together for next season. They were pretty pitiful last year.
Yeah, seems like we've either been on or off since we let Manning go. Either do pretty decent or terrible.
It's tough to be a Colts fan.
Especially when Brady keeps winning Super Bowls!
