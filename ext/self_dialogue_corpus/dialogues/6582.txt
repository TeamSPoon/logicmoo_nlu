Have you seen the GIF going around with the guy from Pocahontas?
You mean the Kocoum running GIFs? Yeah they're pretty hilarious!
It's been so long since I've seen Pocahontas. Do you remember that scene?
Yeah, that's the scene where Kocoum was following Pocahontas and he finds her secretly meeting with John Smith.
Right! And he sees them kiss and loses it!
Then Thomas, who was following John Smith ends up shooting Kocoum.
That was so sad! I know he was just following orders but that was so disappointing.
He eventually makes up for it though by standing up to Ratcliffe.
I heard Christian Bale played Thomas.
I didn't know that! But I did know Mel Gibson played John Smith.
