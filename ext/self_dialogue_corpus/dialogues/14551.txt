Are you going to the game Friday night?
What game?
The Cardinals game!  They're playing the Hawks.
I don't know, I was thinking about it but it kinda depends if Jimmy goes.
They're supposed to win this time.
Who's supposed to win?
The cardinals.
Oh...Have they been having a good season?
Well, not really.  Since they lost Wilkins it's been kinda downhill.
Wait, they lost Wilkins?  How did that happen?
