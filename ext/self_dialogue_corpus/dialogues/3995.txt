Did you ever see Psycho?
Oh yes, that's a classic thriller movie
Yeah, the shower scene is unforgettable
Yeah, my mom said when she saw it, she couldn't shower for weeks afterwards
Man, that's intense
Wasn't there a scene about a dead mother in that movie?
Yes, turns out he would dress up like his mother and kill his victims
Creepy.
Yeah and then he kept his mom's dead body in the basement
Even more creepy.
