Hey Dude did you just hear the new Iggy Azalea track?
No I did not!
I'm listening to it now on my spotify want to listen with me?
Sure
It reached number 8 on the charts in the US
Hmm I dont like it
How do you think it compares to her other songs?
Actually the only song I liked of hers was work
Wow that is like 2013!
Yeah I thought she was really innovative then but now.. I don't like her lyrics
Wow ok I'm sorry to hear you didnt like the song like I did
Yeah sorry dude
Well, maybe we can just wait for her entire album to come out before making a huge judgement.
Ok.. but when is her full album set to come out?
In a few weeks
Ok get back to me at that time and I will listen with you again
Ok bro I will
Ok hope to see you soon
ok have a good weekend
you too bro
