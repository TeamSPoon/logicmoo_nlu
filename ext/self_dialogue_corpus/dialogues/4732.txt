The Subway series is coming soon
Yeah, I'm not as excited this year as usual though.
I know what you mean, I don't know what's wrong with the Yankees.
And the Mets can't seem to keep it together to the end of the season
Both teams need stronger pitching
Well Tanaka is ok.
And the Yankees can't seem to get a good third base defense.
I don't think they're making the playoffs
Well the mets have Sindergaard
That's true but they have a lot of guys with injuries
Are the Yankees on the road now?
Yeah they're playing the Red Sox away
What time is the next game
Tonight at 8 pm. Channel 11
I think deGrom is pitching tonight
Mets vs Angels, right?
They're at Citifield
Oh no, traffic. Sometimes I hate when they're playing home.
Well they're back on the road a bit before the subway series
We;ll have to catch that on TV, ticket prices are way too high!
