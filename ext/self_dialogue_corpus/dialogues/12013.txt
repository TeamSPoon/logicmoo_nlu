Did you like Boba Fett in the Star Wars movies?
I thought that Boba Fett was really cool!
His outfit was awesome!
It was! I like that he had a jet pack.
It sucks that he went into that one pit.
I know! I wonder if he is still alive.
He probably is.
I think that pit takes 1000 years or something to digest.
I hope someone came back and gave him a rope.
I wish that happened!
