Do you like Star Wars?
Of course, who does not like Star Wars?
I think it does not get enough credit for how funny it is?
Purposely or due to the fact it is sometimes silly?
The Jokes, it had great jokes in the first one.
How so?
Well, the way Luke interacts with his aunt and uncle.
The moody teen thing.
Yes, I think they play that humor well.
I like when Yoda makes jokes.
