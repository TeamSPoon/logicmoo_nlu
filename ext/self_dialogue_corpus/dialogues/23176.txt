I loved the Iron Man franchise.
Yeah I liked it, but wasn't crazy about the third movie.
What do you mean? The third movie was the best one.
You can not possibly think it was better than the first movie.
But it was. It showed growth in the character.
There was just too much stuff happening. Plus Tony was barely in the armor.
Well, Tony Stark is more than just his armor. He's one of the smartest minds on the planet.
I guess so, but it still wasn't my favorite.
One thing I don't like about his series is that it seems the universe is against him.
What are you talking about now?
He nearly died in Iron Man 1, 2, and the Avengers movie.
Well it was necessary for the first movie.
That's true. But what about all the others?
Well he doesn't nearly die in Iron Man 3.
Yeah, but he goes through PTSD after what happened during Avengers. The universe is against him.
I guess I can see how you can think that.
Plus they blamed him for all of Age of Ultron. Again, the universe is against him.
But it was totally his fault. Ultron tried to kill humanity.
That's because humans are dangerous to everything. Ultron was right.
Oh my god. I can't believe you just said that.
