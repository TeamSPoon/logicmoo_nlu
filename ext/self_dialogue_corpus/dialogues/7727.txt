I want to go to Hogwarts!
Well we passed eleven and it's fictional but we could watch the movies if you want.
Very true. But I still wish it was real.
Me too, I heard a joke about people who've read the books and watched the movies are Purebloods.
Oh that is funny, so people who only read the books are Half-bloods?
Hilarious! Let's call the people who only watch the movies muggles.
What should we call people who've never done either of them?
How about Deatheaters? They are people that just suck the happiness out of life!
That is way too funny. So what about dumb people who hate Harry Potter all together?
Let's call them The Dursleys!
