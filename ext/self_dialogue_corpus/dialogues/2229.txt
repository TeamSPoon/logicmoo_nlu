I've heard some news about roster changes for various NFL teams for the fall.
I haven't really been keeping up on things.
Why not?
I really only ever followed the Rams, and since they left St. Louis, I haven't paid much attention.
Oh that makes sense.
Who do you follow now?
I've become something of a cheesehead, among other teams.
The Packers?
Yep.
Why them?
Well, they're pretty close.
Geographically?
Yeah, I guess.
Aren't the Chiefs closer?
Yes, but I can't stand them.
I guess that makes sense. Who else do you follow?
I've always liked the Broncos.
They've been a pretty good team.
And the vikings.
Them too.
