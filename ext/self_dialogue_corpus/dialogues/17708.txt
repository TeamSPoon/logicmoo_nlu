What is your favorite church music?
My favorite song has to be, "Amazing Grace."
That seems to be a favorite song of many.
The words and music are incredible.
It sure can lift you up.
Yeah, when times are down it picks me up.
Why do they sing it at funeral so much?
I think because it is so touching.
I always cry when I hear that song.
Me too, especially at a funeral.
Music is interesting.
It can really touch at your emotions.
I like when the music makes me feel up.
Me too.
Sometimes, though, I need a good cry and it helps me then.
What songs make you cry?
Well, "Power in the Blood" makes me cry because I think of what the song means to me and others.
Is that religious music as well?
Yeah, it is.
Religious music often makes me emotional as well.
