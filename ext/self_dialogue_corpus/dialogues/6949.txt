Did you ever see Descendants?
Wasn't that the movie released directly on Disney channel?
That's the one.
Nope.  Thought it looked cheap.
I think you'll be surprised, it was quite good.
I prefer to stick with the classics.
Oh really?  What classics do you mean?
Like Tangled, stuff like that.
Dude, you don't even know what the classics were.  Go back to the 90's for much better stuff.
Snow White, hello?  I know the older classics too, buddy.
