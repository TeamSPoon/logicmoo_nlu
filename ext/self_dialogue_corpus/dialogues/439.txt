Do you watch a lot of football?
I do, but there aren't any major teams out here.
What football do you watch then?
I watch a lot of college football. This is a college town, after all.
Hmm, I really don't know if I can get into that.
Why not?
Well, I think the skill level is just much better in the NFL.
It definitely is.
Right. And the athletes get paid more money.
They do. So what team do you root for?
Well, I really like the Seahawks.
Why the Seahawks?
I'm from Seattle, so it's a hometown pride sort of thing.
They've also done really well the past few years.
They have. Makes it easy to be a fan!
But you'd still be a fan if they were losing, wouldn't you?
I suppose I'd have to be.
It's hard to stop being a fan when you are one.
Exactly. It's a part of your life.
Can't get away from it.
