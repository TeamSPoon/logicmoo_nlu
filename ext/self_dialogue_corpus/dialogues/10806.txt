Hey what do you think about the Fast and the Furious movies? Do you like them?
Yes I do! I LOVE them!
Do you have any particular ones you love? And Why?
I love the Tokyo drift one! It actually has a different setting. I won't say exotic, but seeing them drifting and whatnot on Tokyo streets is very interesting.
I personally do not like it. The plot is kind of weak.
Well okay, which one do you like the most then?
I love Furious 7! Paul Walker was partially still in it!
Why do you like it better than the others?
Call me bias, I think it is because it is the last movie Paul Walker was in prior to his accident.
I understand. He was a good actor.
