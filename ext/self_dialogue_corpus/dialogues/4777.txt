Did you see tonight's Met game?
I can't believe they almost blew it.
But they didn't. If they win tomorrow they'll be back in it.
They're still four games under 500.
Maybe, but the rest of the NL isn't doing much better.
It's only a matter of time before the Cubs start winning.
We're getting Lugo and Matz back soon.
But we don't have a bullpen.
If the starters pitch to expectations, we won't need one.
We still need a bullpen.
The offense has been good. If the starters can pitch seven innings and not give up five runs, we'll win games.
I still don't trust the offense.
Bruce is a good player, and they don't really need Granderson.
But why do they keep pretending Wright will contribute?
I don't think they do.
Then why is he still on the team.
I think he's earned the right to decide when he's done.
Not if it hurts the team?
It's not. They have Reyes.
Reyes isn't reliable.
