Don't you feel something special about the Star Wars films?
I can think of a lot of special things about that series.
I know, but there's something in particular that I've been thinking of lately.
What's that?
I feel like each film gives a better look at a certain character than the other. Don't you.
I can see that for some, but not all of them.
I feel like it's there for all of them.
I see it in Revenge of the Sith for Vader, and in A New Hope for Luke, but not much else.
I definitely feel like it's there for more.
Maybe it is, and I'm the one who doesn't see it.
