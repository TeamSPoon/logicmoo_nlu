I watched The Big Short last night. Have you seen it?
No I never watched that one. What's it about again?
It's about a few traders who bet against the housing market before the financial crisis in 2008.
Oh yeah, that came out a while ago right?
Yeah it was out in 2015.
Yeah I sort of remember now, who was in it though?
Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt were the main characters.
Nice, that's a star studded cast!
Yeah, everyone was really good in it too.
How is the movie?
I like it a lot especially since I'm into stocks and finance. I've actually seen it a few times.
Isn't it a documentary?
I believe it's listed as a documentary but it's not like other documentaries about the markets and economy.
Is it like Margin Call or The Wolf of Wall Street?
It's a mix of the two, more like Margin Call though.
Nice, I liked Margin Call. I'll have to check out this one now.
You'll love it. Another good stock market movie is Boiler Room, which is one of my favorites.
Yeah, I've seen that one with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel.
Yeah, not your typical Vin Diesel role.
Sure isn't, I'm so used to seeing him in action movies like all the The Fast and the Furious ones.
