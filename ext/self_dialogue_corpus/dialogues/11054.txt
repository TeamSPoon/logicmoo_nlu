How was your daughter's ice hockey game this morning?
It was good.  She played well but unfortunately they lost 5-7.
That's too bad.  Was she terribly disappointed?
A little bit, but she's a good sport.  She just loves to play!
What position does she play?
It varies.  It's a rotational system, so sometimes she plays offense and sometimes defense.  Today she mostly played defense.
That's nice.  I'm sure it's good for her to get experience with both.  Does she ever play goalie?
No, she plays both offense and defense but doesn't ever play goalie.  It requires extra equipment and extra practices.  She would like to do it, but so far haven't let her.
Yeah, that makes sense.  It's already a big commitment I'm sure!
Definitely.  She plays two to three times a week most weeks.  It's pretty intense for a six year old!
Wow, and she does a travel league, right?  How far and how often do you have to travel?
Yeah, she has a game every weekend for 8 weeks.  Four home games and four away games.  The furthest was about an hour and a half away, so definitely a commitment.
Wow, I guess!  I would love to come see her play sometime!
Yes, you should!  It's so cute.  She is the only girl on her team and is the smallest to it is so cute to watch her play.
Ok, I would love to see that.  I'll try to come to her next home game.  When is it?
Two weeks from today at 2pm.  She would love for you to come!
Ok, great.  I'll definitely be there.  I can't wait to see her play!
Great, she will love to see you.  That will be her last game too so it will be a good one to come to!
Great, see you then!
OK!
