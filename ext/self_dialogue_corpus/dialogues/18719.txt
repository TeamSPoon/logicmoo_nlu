Micheal Jackson, are you a fan?
Yea, I liked his music a lot
He had some really great classic tunes!
Whats was your favorite song by him?
I gotta go with Thriler.
For me, it would be Beat it.
What other songs were good by him?
Smooth Criminal was great!
Oh yea, I forgot about that one.
Janet Jackson is really good too.
I like her music a lot
She has some good songs from the 80's.
I think the 80's were the best time for music
Yea, the oldies are my favorite thing to listen to on the radio
It was just about the music back then
The beatles were great as well.
I liked the "yellow submarine".
And their records were incredible
It is hard to fathom that they werent famous for so long
Yea, who would have thought such a good band went unnoticed for so long.
