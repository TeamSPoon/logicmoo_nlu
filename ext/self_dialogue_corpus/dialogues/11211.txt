Have you heard about the  sexy take on athletic/leisure clothing?
That's news to me. What is it?
It's called The New Athleisure.
The New Athleisure? What is it skin tight leggings with a top attached to it?
Something like that but not quite.
Well. Then what is it?
They say it is  a sexy take on  athleisure, with skin-skimming knits that outline every curve.
Sounds interesting. Do they come in an assortment of colors?
I saw some that were color-block bodysuits.
Do you remember what color it was? I like body suits.
I think one was like purple, black and blue.
Purple, black and blue? That does not sound like it will look good on me.
They had some cute sporty separates.
Sounds interesting.
I remember one being a pink top and pink bottom.
I like pink. I have a pair of pink heels I just love to wear.
I'm not sure if the bottoms were shorts or a skirt.
Well, either or is fine with me.
I don't think I like this new take on athleisure. I don't think my frame could pull them off wearing them.
Don't sell yourself short. You can make a potato sack look good.
