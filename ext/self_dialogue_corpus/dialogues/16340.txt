Do you listen to U2?
Not so much any more, I used to.
Me too. I saw them in concert once a long time ago.
Was it good?
Yes, they were great. Acthung Baby tour.
What else happened?
People were dancing so hard the whole stadium shook.
Sounds great!
I hated the album they released on iTunes, though.
So did I!
It took a long time to delete it from my phone.
Yes, I would delete it and it would come back over and over.
And it was a boring album too.
So boring. So very boring.
I can still listen to their old stuff sometimes.
Sure. Sunday Bloody Sunday holds up.
So does Desire.
Yes.
Maybe they will still release new stuff that's good.
I hope so.
