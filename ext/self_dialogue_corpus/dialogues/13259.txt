Who is your favorite character from the Force Awakens?
I love Rey's character.
She seems like such a hero, so I get it.
Who is your favorite character?
I love Kylo Ren.
Really? I thought he seemed whiny.
I think that's intentional, like it's going to be part of the plot.
Oh, you mean like it's supposed to be showing some sort of internal struggle, or like an actor acting like he's acting?
Yeah, it's a bit complicated but I do think it's intentional.
I guess we'll have to wait and see until the next movies come out.
