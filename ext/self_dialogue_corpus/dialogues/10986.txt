Did you see yesterdays game?
Yea I wouldnt have missed it for anything
But where you at the garden
No , but my fiance was. She went with friends
The Madison Square Garden is such a great place. I hate that my team lost to those Canadian pricks
Well thats the name of the game
I still cant get over it. We should have won easily
Your team sucks and you know it
Well, defense is weak, But we have great shooters
Your only as good as your weakest point
Meaning?
If your defense sucks, your team sucks
But we were champions a couple of years ago
That was then
And it is now
Forget about it, without strong guards, your team wont go far
We'll see about that
Sure, we'll see your team lose
What makes you so sure of that
You'll see . I know about this stuff.
