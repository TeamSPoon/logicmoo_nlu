My Cowboys couldn't pull through last night.
I know, I saw it. It was a close game.
Yea, to lose by 1 measly point.
The whole game kept me on the edge of my seat.
Prescott will have to play better than that next time.
Yea, how many yards did he have?
Prescott had 227 yards.
What was his QB rating?
It was only about 60.2.
Yea, that may explain why they lost.
I think it came down to the Giants' defense.
Yep they kept the middle shut down all game.
It was really difficult for Elliott to get any rushing yards.
How many yards did Elliot have anyway?
He only had 51 yards on 20 carries.
Well, that's definitely not good.
Yep, and Dallas' top receiver only had 66 receiving yards.
That's crazy. What was the final score if you remember?
Giants beat my Cowboys 20 to 19. I'm sad now.
Well, I guess they will have better luck next time.
