It's that time of year again.
What time of year?
"Wizard of Oz" time of year!
That's right. I've gotta watch that!
Apparently, the TV networks think American viewers have an annual circadian rhythm.
A what?
An annual circadian Rhythm. You know, like a body clock that says, "It's time" to repeat something.
Oh, yeah. Like chili.
Nice try.  And soon it will be time again to watch, "A Christmas Story."
I love that movie. But it has been so long since I last saw it...
How long?
Oh, I don't know. Almost a year I guess.
A year?
A year.
You think a year is a long time for movie watching?
Absolutely!
Why?
It's just long enough for me to forget what I watched. Then, I want to watch it all over again for all the same reasons I wanted to watch it the first time.
I guess the networks are right. Annual circadian rhythms fit with the memory span of the average American.
I guess so. But, what's an annual circadian rhythm?
