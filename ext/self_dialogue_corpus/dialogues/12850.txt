Have you seen "Rouge One"?
I wanted to see it but I was so busy last December when it was released.
Oh, well it was a good movie.  You should see it.
I will.  I understand it is now available on pay per view.
I believe so.  Check with your cable provider.
I have heard that Darth Vader was a prominent character in the film.
Yes he was.
Makes since, based on the trailers.  Were there any other characters from "A New Hope"?
I don't want to give too much away.  Watch the movie for yourself.
I plan to.  Thanks.
