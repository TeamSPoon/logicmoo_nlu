What happened to Crosby the other night?
Which night?
I saw he left the game after a viscious hit from Niskanen
Yeah he did it was probably targeted
He doesnt look like a good that would do that type of thing
I dont know when you get into the game
Yeah sometimes it can make you see red
Yeah and I think he was pushed into doing it
Ovechkin has a problem with Crosby?
Hes always called the little brother to him.
Well maybe he should start winning cups
I dont think thatll ever happen
Then would you blow up the Capitals core?
I would, they arent doing much.
I think the salary cap is going to kill that team.
Why do you think that?
They cant sign Kuznetsov.
What about Orlov?
They lose one of them in the expansion draft.
That sucks, you do your homework only to lose it to circumstance
