Does the NBA want to change the draft lottery process?
Why do they need to?
I think its unfair the worst team doesnt get the best pick.
I think its to discourage tanking.
Well theres 2 counters to that.
And they are?
One is the Sixers. They have tanked for years
And have only gotten the first pick once
But are always getting top 3 picks.
Ok and whats next
Other leagues do not have to worry about tanking  without having a lottery.
Yeah but I think its easier to do in basketball.
I think the NBA is ripe for tanking to be honest.
So you agree with me?
I just think there is not enough talent in NCAA for the entire NBA to take every year.
Then maybe they should revisit eligibility.
I think we are getting closer to that happening.
Silver will not be able to pass much though.
The NCAA has no word on whether to do that.
They all collude together.
