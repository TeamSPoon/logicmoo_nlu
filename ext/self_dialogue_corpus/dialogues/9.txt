I think George Clooney was the best Batman.
You can't be serious.
I know he didn't get the run on others, but he was the best from the original movies.
Michael Keaton was better than him.  Even Val Kilmer was.
Nah.  They should have stuck with Clooney as he makes the perfect playboy.
The best Batman will always be Christian Bale.
Why?  Because he talks in a deep voice.
No.  It's because he actually looked like a Batman and the others looked like a guy playing Batman.
You seem to have given this a lot of thought.
I know my Batman!
