You know, the Beatles wrote some goofy songs over the years.
Like what? I'm not that familiar with their music.
You've heard "Yellow Submarine", right?
Oh yeah, of course!
"Bungalow Bill" was pretty silly, too.
Never heard that one.
It was on The White Album, which was later in their career. That album had several goofy songs, actually.
Can you name any others?
Rocky raccoon.
I haven't heard that one either, but it sounds pretty silly.
