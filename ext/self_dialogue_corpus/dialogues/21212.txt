I love the Harry Potter books but I'm not sure I want to watch the movies.
I would recommend them.
Have you seen them all?
Yes, and I loved them all?
Are they similar to the books or is there a lot of deviation?
They're very similar. The actors are great as well.
I do like Emma Watson.
She's awesome.
She's in the new Beauty and the Beast remake and is such a good actress.
I have all the HP movies on DVD if you want to borrow them.
Cool. Maybe we could watch them together.
That would be nice.
We could get snacks.
It's going to take a while. We could do this over several nights.
Yes, sounds good.
Obviosly you already understand what's going on in them since you read them all.
Right.
OK, I can't wait for this awesomeness.
Neither can I.
Let's start tomorrow night.
