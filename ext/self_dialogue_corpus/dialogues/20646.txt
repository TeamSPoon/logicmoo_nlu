I wish I saw Sully in the theatres.
I did. It was incredible on the big screen.
I'm sure. I saw it on my 58" Panasonic though.
Still good,but not the same.
I know it's not.
You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks.
That's definitely an understatement.
He's one,of the best.
He was great as usual in Sully.
Yes he was.
I can't imagine being on a plane that goes down like that one.
It's gotta be terrible.
I can't imagine.
Castaway was another of my Tom Hanks favorites.
That's another thing I can't imagine.
Being stranded alone on an island?
Yes,that's what I mean.
Getting back to Sully,I like movies based on real events.
Yes,when it's true it's seems to be better.
Yes,if it's done well.
