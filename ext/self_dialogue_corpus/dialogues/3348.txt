Have you seen the original Evil Dead?
Yes the very definition of horror.
It was awesome.  Those daemons singing we're gonna get you was creepy.
And that three, how it just violated that poor woman.
That's how low budget movies should be.
Yes, and Bruce Campell was awesome.
Bruce is always awesome.
The sequels were both good too
Yeah but for different reasons.
I know, Evil Dead 3 was hilarious.
