Do you want to watch Meet the Robinsons with me?
I heard that movie wasn't very good.
I enjoyed it. I'm about to watch it for the tenth time.
Doesn't  Adam West voice a character in that one?
Yeah, he's Uncle Art's voice actor. Tom Selleck is in it as well.
Tom Selleck? Now I've got to watch it.
It's a very underrated Disney film, if you ask me.
So, what's the plot? Time travel?
That's part of it. I don't want to spoil everything, though.
Alright, I'll check it out. I love computer animated movies, so this should be decent.
