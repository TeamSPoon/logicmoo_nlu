Hey did you watch the music awards this week?
No,  I forgot,  who preformed,  anyone good?
Yeah,  Katy Perry and Taylor swift were on.
That's cool,  I used to like Katy Perry. I kissed a girl was really catchy.
Yeah,  I like her more now,  she's a bit more theatrical,  kind of like lady gaga.
Lady gaga is weird but she has a great voice.  I love one million reasons.
Yeah that song is great,  what other songs of hers do you like?
I really like poker face,  it's super catchy.
That song always reminds me of LMFAO and I don't know why.
I don't either,  they are nothing like lady gaga.
