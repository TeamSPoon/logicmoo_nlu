Lady Gaga. Do you like her music?
Yeah! I love Born This Way.
Oh same! That song is so upbeat.
It also sends such a powerful message.
Most of Lady Gaga's songs send powerful messages. That's why I love her music so much.
I agree. She appeals to so many populations of people.

She has amazing vocals, that's for sure.
