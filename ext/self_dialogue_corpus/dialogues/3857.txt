Have you seen 47 meters down?
No, but I really want to.
I kind of do too. I really like Many Moore.
I don't care much about Mandy Moore, but I love a good shark thriller
Well, I became a fan of hers because of a tv show I watch called This is Us
Oh yea, I've seen that. It's good. But I prefer thrillers.
I definitely love a good thriller too. I hope the movie is good.
As long as the sharks are eating people, it will be good.
I doubt that Mandy Moore gets eaten.
You never know.
