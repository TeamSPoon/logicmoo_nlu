What do you think about the Dallas Cowboys?
I like them a lot.
They have had 32 play off appearances.
They used the Cotton Bowl from 1960 - 1971.
Then they used Texas Stadium from 1971 - 2008.
Jerry Jones net worth is $5.2 billion.
When they joined the NFL there was no team south of DC.
During the 1970's they won 105 regular season games.
Danny White was quarter back in 1980.
That was after Rodger Staubach.
The 1982 season was short--player strike.
In the 1990's they got Daryl Johnston.
They got Emmitt Smith also.
I liked Erik Williams.
Darren Woodson was good also.
Michael Irvin was one of the best.
I think Nate Newton was the best.
Remember Jay Novaceck?
Yes, and there was also Charles Haley.
Those were the days.
