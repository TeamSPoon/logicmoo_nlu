I'm ready for this season!
Who's your favorite team?
I'm a Giants man all the way!
Me too! I love the G-men!
I think they win the division this year.
Even over Dallas?
I think Dallas was a fluke last year.
I agree.
Plus Odell Beckham is on a mission.
He's the best receiver in football.
I think he's the best in Giant's history too.
Who are some of your favorite players from the past?
I like Phil Simms.
What about Harry Carson?
He was good, but you know who the man then was.
Oh yes, Lawrence Taylor was unreal.
That's because he was on cocaine.
Haha, I saw his kill Eric Hipple once.
That guy was never the same.
Few were after LT hit them.
