If you can choose a career in music industry, which genre do you think you'll get into?
wow, interesting question, I do rap occasionally in high school, maybe I could be a hip hop singer?
nice choice man, I like hip hop music, they're both chill and energetic
that's kinda like the way I would define them, so what's your favorite song?
Have you heard of Guana?
no, sounds like a funny name
yeah, it's from G-Eazy, be warmed, it's explicit, haha
really, I heard of G-Eazy but I haven't heard of a song from him named Guana, I gotta check it out
definitely, it's good for any occasion, except when your parents are here
oh, indeed.
