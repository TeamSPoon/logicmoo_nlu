What's your favorite Disney animated film?
I think mine would have to be 'The Lion King' because it's just so relatable all around.
I was going to say, it is one of Disney's best for sure.
Which one do you like the best?
I really can't pick just one, but 'Peter Pan' is my all time favorite!
Really? I wouldn't have thought!
Yea, I used to play Peter and my sister was Wendy.
Haha, I learn something new everyday.
Did you like 'Alice in Wonderland'?
To be honest, not really! I thought it was such a weird movie.
Yes! I'm glad I'm not crazy by thinking that.
I mean, all the characters has such weird elements to them you know?
So true. I also liked 'The Lady and the Tramp'!
That one is on my list! The spaghetti scene is so memorable.
Let's not forget about 'Pinocchio' and how fantastic it was.
'Pinocchio' was probably a movie I watched all the time.
Haha me too. My family loved the whole concept of telling the truth.
Yes, my parents definitely highlighted the moral of the story all the time.
Did it work? Haha.
I don't think so! Haha!
