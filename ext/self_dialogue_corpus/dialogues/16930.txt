how do you like linkin park
i liked hybrid theory
nah, meteora is their best album
what was on that album
somewhere i belong, numb, from the inside
dude, they had so many hits
the songs were a bit more deeper than the first album, i think
in the end was the best though
that was just their biggest song
it was my favorite.
yeah but from the inside was so much more powerful
in the end was their biggest song for a reason
i suppose so.
yeah, it was better
or it was just more poppy
it wasnt poppy.
it just spoke to the audience at the end.
people are depressed i guess
felt disappointment
thats what the songs about
