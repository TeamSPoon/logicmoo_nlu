Who was the creepiest Disney villain?
I'd say it was the Witch Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
"Mirror mirror on the wall... who's the creepiest of them all?"
YOU are! You are!
Hehe, she was definitely freaky.
And made a point of actually poisoning Snow White. That was nasty.
Very true. But she was saved by a handsome price, right?
Yeah, in the end. I would have made more sense if the dwarves saved her.
What were their names? Sleepy and Sneezy and Doc? I can't recall the rest.
Something like that. Weird they didn't play a bigger part in saving her.
