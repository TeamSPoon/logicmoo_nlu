do you know when the preseason games start?
Im not sure i can check for you
Thanks i am thinking of buyig tickets to one for my family.
August 3 at 7 pm Cowboys and Cardinales
Does it say where they are playing
I dont see it on this page.
I will need to get my information when i go to get tickets.
Who do you want to go see?
My husband is a Saints fan but the kids and i root for the Steelers.
He has got to hate that.
Yes especially snce the Steelers have 6 superbowl wins compared to the Saints 1.
Definatly makes him mad when you rub that one in.
Yes and when the Steelers make the playoff we start hanging terrible towels around the house and other Steelers items we have collected over the years.
I am so glad my husband doesnt support a different team.
Who do you two like.
We both like the Patriots.
Ugh dont say that in my house my husband hates them especially Tom Brady
Maybe ill bring some Patriots posters to your house.
He might have a heart attack.
He would probably stat yelling at me and take them off the walls.
