Have you ever seen Lonesome Dove?
No, I haven't, isn't Robert Duvall in that?
Yes! I think it's the best thing he's ever done, even better than The Godfather.
There's no way it's better than The Godfather. Marlon Brandon is amazing in that.
I think Marlon Brando was better in A Streetcar Named Desire.
If we're talking about Tennessee Williams plays turned into film, I'm going to always pick Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
Oh, me too! I really love Paul Newman in that!
It's one of my favorite Elizabeth Taylor films too!
My favorite Elizabeth Taylor movie is National Velvet.
Speaking of horse movies, did you ever watch Sea Biscuit?
Sea Biscuit? The one with Tobey McGuire? No, I never saw that one.
It was pretty good, even though I'm not a fan of Tobey McGuire's.
I thought he was okay in Spiderman.
I guess those movies were okay. I really enjoyed James Franco in them.
I really liked James Franco in Pineapple Express.
I really think James Franco should be in a Wes Anderson movie, that feels like it would be a good fit.
Oh I love Wes Anderson! The Royal Tenenbaums is one of my favorite movies.
Oh, that's a great one, but I really loved Moonrise Kingdom. Bill Murray was amazing in it.
There should definitely be more Bill Murray in the world.
Oh, I agree. It doesn't get any better than Groundhog Day!
