Michael Jackson. do you know him?
THE KING?
KING OF WHAT
KING OF POP MAN
OH I SEE
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER FROM THE GUY
THE MOONWALK MAN
HE USED TO KILL IT
HE INVENTED THE THING
I SURE DO MISS HIM
WHAT SONGS DO YOU LIKE FROM HIM?
BILLIE JEAN
MY MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO
DON'T GO AROUND BREAKING YOUNG GIRL'S HEARTS
THIS GUY WAS SO AUTHENTIC
ORIGINAL IN EVERY SONG
NOT LIKE TODAY'S ARTISTS
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY NEEDS MORE PEOPLE LIKE HIM
HE WAS SUCH A ROLE MODEL
I AGREE
