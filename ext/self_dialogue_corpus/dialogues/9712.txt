Have you heard any of Tech N9ne's new material?
No I haven't heard any of his material since K.O.D. Is it any good?
Oh man, his last record is really good! Definitely check it out!
Does it have any of his normal guest rappers in it?
Always! You know he can never not have Krizz Kaliko on his records!
Cool I really like Krizz's flow and style. Dude can sing too!
Yeah, they don't rap like the classics, but it's still really good.
Yeah man, Tech N9ne will be legend when he's done in the game.
Definitely! I'll let you borrow some of the new stuff next time I see you!
STRANGE MUSIC! Cool man!
