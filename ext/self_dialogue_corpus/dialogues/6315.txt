Hey did you end up seeing the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie??
No not yet but I heard that it did really well at the box office.
Me too. I heard because of the success of this one they're going to make a live action The Little Mermaid too!
That's awesome! That was one of my favorites growing up.
Yeah I'll be excited to see what they do with it.
Well I heard that the live action Beauty and the Beast was really well done and that Emma Watson was the perfect Belle.
I saw the photographs of her in the yellow ball gown. Remember the scene where Mrs. Potts is singing "Tale as Old as Time" and they're dressed up and dancing?
Of course I remember that! And I saw the photographs too. I agree Emma Watson was the perfect Belle.
I wonder who they'd cast for The Little Mermaid?
Hmm, I think that Bella Thorne or Karen Gillan could do it. They both have red hair and are young.
