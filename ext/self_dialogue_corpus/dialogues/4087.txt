Remember the first Mission: Impossible movie?
The one with Tom Cruise in it?
Well, he's in all of them, but yes.
That was kind of before they decided to ruin it by making it a franchise.
He switched faces and disguises quite a bit in that movie.
That's what you do when you're a secret agent.
I kind of liked the twist at the end where he gave up his old boss.
He had to to try and clear their names.
Just thinking about the movie makes me want to rappel now.
Keep me out of the way of any cliffs!
