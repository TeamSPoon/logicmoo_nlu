Who do you think was the best kicker in NFL History?
Definitely Adam Viniatieri. The guy was clutch.
I would have to agree with Adam Vinitatieri. Guy made two game winning kicks in the Super Bowl and kicked a 40 yarder in a snow storm in New England.
He never seemed to miss.
The guy is ancient now and is still good. He's pushing 45.
Forty-five. I would have figured he was pushing fifty. Ha ha.
Funny. He just might kick till he is fifty.
Other honorable mention kickers would be Morten Andersen and Gary Anderson.
Gary Anderson. The guy probably still can't get over that kick in Minnesota.
The guy was automatic all year and missed a 40 yarder inside the dome. So sad.
Yes, definitely a sad situation. Gary Anderson is a good guy and sometimes bad things happen to good guys.
Unfortunately.
Morten Andersen was a great kicker also. He was a left foot kicker.
That is pretty unusual in the NFL. That guy was pretty clutch also.
He played for a bad franchise his entire career. So, he didn't get too many high-pressured situations in the playoffs.
He certainly did not. The Saints were awful for most of his career.
What are some other kickers that come to mind for you? I can think of Matt Bryant and Jason Elam.
I can agree with those two. They have field goal distance records.
Elam kicked a 64 yarder a few years ago. Right?
No, that was Matt Prater. Denver always had good kickers, so it's easy to get confused.
