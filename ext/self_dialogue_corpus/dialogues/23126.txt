Hey, I'm taking my son to the movies this weekend for his birthday. I was wondering if you want to bring your kids along?
Sure, what movie are you going to see?
He has been dying to see Boss Baby, so I was thinking of that one.
Oh, is that the one where the baby is wearing a suit and can talk?
Yes! My son has been dying to see it.
That sounds great my girls have been asking to see it too. It looks so cute.
Yes, my son has been watching all the trailer's for it over and over.
Do you know what times it is playing?
No, I haven't checked yet.
That's okay, I know Storks is also playing. If we can't see Boss Baby maybe we can see that.
That's a great idea. I don't know about my son but I saw the previews for it and it looks nice.
It looked nice to me too.
I really liked how they are expanding on the idea of storks bringing a baby.
Yes! I thought that was sweet too.
Did you see the part with the boy hanging up lights on the house to help the baby come home.
Yes! That was so funny.
Oh, and that part in Boss Baby where the baby dresses like a puppy?
I think that's why my girls want to see it, they love puppies!
My son keeps making fun of the Arnold Schwarzenegger reference with the cookie.
Oh, yes I saw that. I got a kick out of it.
