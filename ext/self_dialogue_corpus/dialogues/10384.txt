I wondered if he's still alive.
Who Ayers? Or Fox? or Downey Jr?
Ayers! There's supposed to be a foundation dedicated to that gifted people with mental illness thing.
You know what people say about this movie?
Um.. I reckon they say a lot about the movie.
yes, But in particular, they say it's a typical White Savior narrative.
That is NOT a thing. A white savior narrative? That can't be a thing.
ON the contrary. it IS a thing. And people categorize this movie precisely in that.
So if a white person helps a black person and if it's portrayed as a medium, then it's a White Savior narrative.
Yep. And the movie fits that perfectly.
The movie does or the real life does? This actually happened, so to belittle it calling it a white savior narrative isn't really fair.
Fair, Not fair. I'm just telling you what people think.
Who wrote the cello for the soundtrack anyway?
Some Italian composer guy. Marianelli.
That's not some italian guy. He's the one who composed the soundtrack for the atonement.
Well, he did win the Oscars's for the best score. But he's still an Italian guy.
You said some italian guy, liek he's not that important.
I did say that, but that doesn't mean I don't think he's important. io just mean he's some italian guy which is what he is.
An italian vs some italian. There is a difference. Anyway, I love that track. Atonement. What's that movie about anyway?
Atonement? I guess... the process of atoning. That might have something to do with it. just a guess though. I haven't seen it.
