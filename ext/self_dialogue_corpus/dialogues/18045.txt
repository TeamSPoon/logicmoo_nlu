I like listening to older music, how about you?
Sometimes but what type of music are we talking about?
I was thinking about The Fray.
Oh okay. They have a great song called All at Once, have you heard of it?
Yes, I love the words to that song!
I like the line, "you could begin to wonder".
Me too. "Could you find a better".
You do know the song!
The Fray is one of my favorite bands. Do you have a top three list?
Yes, I would have to say Outkast is one of my top three.
I like Nelly Furtado a lot but I know she is not a band.
I like her too.
She has a really smooth and sultry voice.
Yes, she is nice to listen to when I want to relax and chill out.
Right, she is cool listening.
Yes and perfect for a road trip.
I think enjoying a wide range of music is the spice of life.
Right, I heard it makes us happier when we have soft music playing while
I am going for a drive tomorrow and am going to play The Fray.
Good deal. Time will fly!
