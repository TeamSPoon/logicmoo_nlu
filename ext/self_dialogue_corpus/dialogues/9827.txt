Do you listen to Childish Gambino?
Yeah I do. I love his music.
Me too. I have all of his albums.
What is your favorite song?
I really like Got This Money and The Last.
My favorite is I Be on That and Break.
I wonder if he's done rapping now.
It sure seems like it. He's been acting a lot lately.
He's a great actor, but I really hope he'll still put music out.
Me too. I can't imagine him wasting all of that musical talent.
