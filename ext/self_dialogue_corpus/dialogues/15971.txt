Hey what's up?
Nothing much. You say.
Well, I just bought new album from linkin park.
Oh, I am curious which album is that?
It's called one more light.
Oh, that's a strange name for a linkin park album.
Personally, Even I don't like the name just like you.
So when was it released? I haven't heard anything about it.
It was released on may 19, 2017.
Oh, that means it is very recent.
yes, it is very recent.
So how is it?
Hey man, I just bought it right now, haven't listened to it yet.
Oh, yes, that makes sense.
I bought this album because I heard some great reviews from some of my closest friends.
Oh, great. I hope they turn out to be correct.
I have strong feeling that this album is going to be awesome.
Okay, so can I borrow it after you are done listening to it?
Sure, I don't mind at all.
Thanks in advance.
