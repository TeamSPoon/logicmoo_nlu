JUst saw a great video with a Killers song playing in it.
What do the Killers sing?
Oh, you know them. Everyone does.
Well, what's the song?
Mr. Brightside.
Okay, yes, everyone does them.
It was an Irish funeral and everyone went to a pub afterwards.
So where do the killers come in?
An older man started singing the song.
At a funeral?
Yes, they celebrate a persons life. He was dancing on top of the bar.
Gotta see that.
The Killers are a great band. Known all over the world.
They did have a lot of good songs.
Somebody Told Me is still played on the radio.
Yeah, I hear it all the time.
I think they will be around for a while.
Me too.
They've actually been around since the early 2000's.
That long, I didn't know.
