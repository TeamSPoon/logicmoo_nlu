Ever After is my favorite romance movie.
What is it about?
It's like a twist on Cinderella, but it's still set in the old days.
So it's like a fairy tale?
Yes, but believe me. It is much better than it sounds.
Who's in it?
Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, who is kind of like Cinderella. Anjelica Huston plays the mean stepmother.
Really? I loved Anjelica in the Addams Family movies.
Me too. She was great as Morticia.
I like Addams Family Values more than the first movie.
I do as well.
It's so funny when Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to summer camp.
Pugsley was so cute in his striped outfit.
I know, and Christina Ricci did a great job as Wednesday.
I always mistake Monica Keena for Christina Ricci.
Really? I don't think they look anything alike.
Maybe not now, but when Monica starred in Snow White: A Tale of Terror she looked just like Christina.
That movie was so creepy.
I know, but Sigourney Weaver did a great job in her role.
I agree. She always blows me away.
