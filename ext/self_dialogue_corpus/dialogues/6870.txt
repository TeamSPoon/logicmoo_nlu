How many times have you seen Frozen?
My goodness, it's my daughter's favorite movie. I think I've seen it over 10 times!
My son loves singing "Let It Go"! I'm going crazy!
I know what you mean. The soundtrack is playing nonstop in my car. My daughter won't let me play anything else.
I'm trying to get him to watch some of the more classic Disney movies, like Snow White or Aladdin.
We've watched the live-action Cinderella, which my daughter really liked.
It just seems like every classic Disney movie has a really scary part that my son won't watch.
Yeah, either someone's parent dies like Bambi or there's a really scary monster like in Sleeping Beauty.
My favorite Disney movie is The Little Mermaid. Great songs and so colorful!
I agree, that's a great movie but Ursula is just too scary for my daughter so we haven't watched past the beginning of that movie.
