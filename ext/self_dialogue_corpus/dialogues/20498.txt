Have you seen The Wedding Planner?
You mean that Jennifer Lopez movie from 2001? Yes. Why?
I'm in the mood for a romantic comedy, something simple and sweet. Would you recommend The Wedding Planner?
Honestly, not really, unless you're a really big Jennifer Lopez fan.
I'm not a huge fan of Lopez, but I do like Matthew McConaughey. He's the male lead in the movie, right?
Yes, he plays the love interest to Jennifer Lopez. But, like I said, if you're not a Lopez fan, you might find the movie a bit grating.
She is a fairly annoying actress, I guess.
Well, I certainly think so. Judy Greer does have a small part in the movie though, so that's good - I love Judy Greer.
Oh me too! Maybe I will check it out after all.
Just be prepared, this is a seriously mindless romantic comedy. To call it formulaic would be an understatement.
I hear you. That might be just what I'm in the mood for, though. Sometimes I just want a movie that will let me turn my brain off.
The Wedding Planner definitely requires minimal brain power.
Haha - okay, you've made yourself clear. As long as there's at least a few scenes of McConaughey being cute, I think I'll be satisfied.
There is lots of McConaughey cuteness. Oh, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras is in it too - she's great as the other woman.
So what you're saying is this is basically an adorable romantic comedy, with Jennifer Lopez as the only drawback?
Jennifer Lopez and lazy writing, yes. If you're okay with those two drawbacks, you'll probably enjoy it.
Awesome. And do you think it's safe to watch with my teenagers around?
It's rated PG-13, so you should be fine.
Excellent. I'm excited! Simple-minded romantic comedy goodness, here I come!
Haha, enjoy. I had no idea you were so easy to please when it came to movies!
