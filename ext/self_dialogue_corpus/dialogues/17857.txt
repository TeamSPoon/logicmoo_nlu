Hey are you a classical music fan?
Like, Mozart or something like that?
Exactly,  he is surely one of the greats.
Well I am familiar with a few composers but wouldn't consider myself a classical music fan.
Oh okay, what sort of music do you enjoy.
Well I like a lot of rap and hip hop. I honestly admit I am a huge eminem fan.
Oh wow that is cool, I have herd some of his music but just have so much appreciation for the classical composers of human history
Who else is there besides mozart and beethoven.
Well those are just two well know composers but did you know that while watching tv or any content really you are exposed to classical music daily
Do you know of Keven Gates?
No, who is he?
He is surely not a classical music artist but a great bay area rapper who has made a name for himself in the past couple years.
What are the works he is know for?
Well I have surely herd his song Two Phones on the radio a couple times.
I think I have herd that song as well, wasn't it released in late 2015.
Have you herd about Keith Jarrett?
No I am unfamiliar, is he a composer?
Yes he is a composer pianist from Pennsylvania, US. He is know for his improvisations
When did he find his audience?
I think it was early two-thousands.
