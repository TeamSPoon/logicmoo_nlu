Is Tupac the best of all time in hiphop?
No, I liked Biggie better.
Why is Biggie better to you?
Well it depends on how you look at it.
What do you mean?
When it comes to lyrics Biggie is better, when it comes to overall track record Tupac is better.
Tupac was also a great person to me.
I agree, he did a lot for the community.
Their death was tragic to the entire nation.
It was, I wish it would have just stayed with rap and not turned violent.
