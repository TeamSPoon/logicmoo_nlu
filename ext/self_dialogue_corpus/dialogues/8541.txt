who is your favorite pop artist?
To be Honest I really like Justin Beiber as his songs are so catchy.
No judgement here, I realy like What Do You Mean.
I like that song and most of his recent work, though I am not really a fan of his early work.
Yeah, I am also not a fan of Baby era Beiber but he is talented.
Did you know he was discovered by usher?
I had heard that he used to make videos on Youtube and that is how usher discovered him.
And then not long after that My World 2.0 was released in 2010 (not a fan of this album).
I did not like that album, I was more into lady gaga and katy perry at that time.
They certainly dominated that year but I can see why young girls at the time fell in love with Beiber and the talent that Usher saw in him.
