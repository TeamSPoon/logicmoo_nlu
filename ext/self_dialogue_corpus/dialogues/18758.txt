Yes and many of their songs sound great on the piano.
What is your favorite coldplay song to play?
Fix You sounds amazing on the piano.

Do you play any instruments?
I like to play the Drums in my free time. Not as exciting as the piano.
Don't tell yourself that! The drums are just as important of an instrument.
Thanks you are right.
Yes drums keep the rhythm in many songs. Even songs that don't have drums often use a metronome to maintain good rhythm.
Wow so drums do play an important role.
They definitely do! How long have you played the drums?
Basically my entire life.
I have played the piano basically my entire life as well.
Maybe we should start a band for fun sometime and play together.
That is a wonderful idea!
