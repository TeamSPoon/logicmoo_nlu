Harrison Ford was awesome in Star Wars!
I know, I am so sad that he was killed in the newest one.
He must have made a ton of money from those movies, he could have stopped acting!
Did you know that in A New Hope he only made $10,000?
That is insane! Was he very famous at that point?
Not completely. But still, it wasn't very much money.
Well it definitely made him more famous so it was worth it!
He had so much chemistry with Carrie Fisher as princess Leia.
I always kind of thought that they didn't have any chemistry at all.  It was always fighting.
That was kind of the appeal though, they weren't perfect.
