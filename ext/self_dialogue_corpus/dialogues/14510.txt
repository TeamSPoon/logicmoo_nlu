Did you watch the Celtics-Cavs the other night?
No, I don't watch the NBA; I prefer collegiate.
Did you at least hear about it?
Yeah, I saw a lot of people from Cleveland posting about it on Facebook.
Holy crap, right?
Yeah, seriously, losing by nearly 50 in the playoffs. Horrid.
I've never heard of such an epic loss
I kind of want them to be punished for it, it was that bad.
How so?
Like, they should forfeit the entire series.
Come on, you know they'll come back to win at least one more.
No, I don't. You lose by 50, you're done, and should be out of the playoffs for years.
I don't follow.
Well, in European soccer leagues, if you don't perform at a certain level over time, you're demoted.
So, what would you suggest?
They shouldn't be allowed to play in the playoffs next year unless they win the series.
That's cruel.
It's also realistic. They're being paid tens of millions to get humiliated.
You're a bit harsh.
No...and they lost at home. By nearly 50. In the conference finals.
