Hey! Are you watching the NBA Playoffs?
Yeah, I am!
Who are you watching?
I have been watching the Spurs series and the Celtics series.
Oh yeah? Me too!
The Celtics and Wizards have had an awesome round so far.
Yeah, the Celtics are a bit of an underdog.
Yeah, I don't think people will think they have a chance against the Cavs if they make it to that round.
Yeah, that's true.
I am still rooting for them though!
I am rooting for them too! Especially for Isiah Thomas.
That guy has been so amazing even though he has gone through a lot of rough times.
It was so sad to hear about his little sister dying in that car crash.
Yeah she was so young.
It's amazing that he was able to get up and play after she died.
Yeah, he is becoming a sort of legend in the NBA right now.
I think he only can only go up from here.
It will be fun to see how high his star rises during the rest of the games and for the next season.
I hope the Celtics take it all all the way to the championship!
Me too! Go Boston!
