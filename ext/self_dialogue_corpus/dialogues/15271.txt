Hey, have you heard that new Katy Perry Song?
No, what's it called?
Swish Swish.
Is it good?
Yeah, it's her and Nikki Minaj, I like it.
I'll have to check it out, I haven't heard anything new from her lately.
It's good, it's supposedly about Taylor Swift.
Really, are they fighting?
Kind of, it's a clapback at Taylor's song.
Which one?
Bad blood.
Oh, I like that song, is Katy's as good as it?
I don't think it's as good as Taylor's song, but it's pretty good.
I'll have to listen to it, why are they even fighting?
I think it had something to do with stolen backup dancers.
Who steals backup dancers?
Well, I think Katy let her dancers go on tour with Taylor but had something in their contract where they could come back when Katy goes on tour.
And they never came back?
No, I think they did, but Taylor fired them when they asked.  Either way, you should out Katy's new song.
Alright, I will, thanks.
