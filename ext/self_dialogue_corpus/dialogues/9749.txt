Whatever happened to MC Ren?
I don't know dude. I haven't heard anything about him for years.
I guess he's like the lost 5th NWA Beatle. Gone and pretty much forgotten.
What about DJ Yella? Do you remember him?
Yeah and he's still around. He works in production and I believe does movies also.
Straight Outta Compton was an awesome album. Nothing like it had ever been created.
Who was your favorite member of NWA?
That's easy because it has to be Eazy. Cruisin' down the street in my 64.
Rap music was so much better back in the day. And look at what a lot of these guys have gone on to do with their careers.
You're right. Ice Cube is one of the biggest stars in the world and he came.........straight outta Compton.
