Is the NFL still your favorite thing to watch on television?
It sure is! I love football and the NFL is the best!
What team is do you normally cheer for?
I am a die hard Jacksonville Jaguars fan.
Do you think they will ever get back to the playoffs?
One day I feel that we will get there! We just need some things to go our way.
Has the franchise ever made it to the Superbowl before?
Not yet; but when we do I plan on being there live and in person for it!
I am sure you will be there to enjoy that with the team!
We used to be pretty good back when Mark Brunell was the quarterback.
Yea I thought they had some pretty good teams many years ago.
That seems like far to long ago at this point!
Who was the coach when the Jaguars were pretty good there for a while?
It was Tom Coughlin; he knew how to get things done.
Well maybe Doug Marrone can find some of that magic.
I sure hope so! It would be nice to follow a winning team again.
Does the team have any young talent that you are excited about?
We drafted Leonard Fournette out of LSU. I am really pumped about his potential.
I remember watching him play in the SEC. That guy is a beast!
I am hoping he is the next great NFL running back!
