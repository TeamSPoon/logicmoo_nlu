Let's do some rap trivia, yeah?
Alright. Go for it.
There was only one feature on The Notorious BIG's "Ready to Die". Who was it?
Wait, there was a feature? I always thought it was just him.
Well, there's one other artist. Give me your best guess.
Puff Daddy?
He produced the thing, but wasn't actually a featured artist.
I don't know, man. Who was it?
Method Man. He was on the song "The What."
From Wu-Tang? How did I not know this earlier?
