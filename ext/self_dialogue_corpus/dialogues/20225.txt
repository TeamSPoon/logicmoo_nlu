What's your favorite Tinkerbell movie?
You mean of the recent animated bunch.
Right, the ones actually made by Disney.
That's a tough one.  I kind of liked the one with her twin sister.
I believe you are talking about Secret of the Woods.
That sounds about right.
I kind of liked the one where she had to rescue her friends.
That's the Great Fairy Rescue
Right.  I liked the human story in it with the little girl and learning to co-exist with others.
It definitely had a more adult slant to it than some others.
I didn't quite get that from Secret of the Woods.
That movie was good about introducing a new fairy though.
I'm sure the toy marketers loved it.
Who doesn't love a machine that can make snow anywhere?
They have those in real life you know.
Yeah, but not one that can be built by a fairy in ten minutes!
You're kind of overreaching here a bit, don't you think?
Just saying, Tinkerbell is a creative kind of gal.
It's a cartoon, dude.  I live in real life here.
You're no fun.  You need a splash of pixie dust!
