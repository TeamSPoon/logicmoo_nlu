So I finally saw the Avengers Age of Ultron last night.
I haven't even see it yet. Did you like it?
No, I didn't like it. I LOVED it. Seriously, one of the best movies ever! You have to see it.
You sound so sure, ha ha. Well, I'll definitely watch it later then.
I haven't seen a good horror movie in a long time. Do you know any good ones?
Well, my mom just saw Crimson Peak.
How did she like it?
She said it was okay. Not too bad of a movie. Why don't you come over and we can watch it together?
Sure, okay. I'll go pick up some snacks!
Hey, I just saw this really good movie last night. It was so dramatic!
What was the name of it?
Everest. You should watch it sometime.
I think I just might.
So I just heard about this really weird movie. But it's good.
A good weird movie? You caught my interest. What is it?
It's called Ex Machina. It's about human-like robots!
hmm, you are right, that DOES sound weird. I'll watch it when I get the chance.
Hey did you wanna see Fifty Shades of Grey with me?
The  erotic romance movie based off the novel? Sure, let's go sometime tomorrow afternoon.
I'll order the tickets now!
