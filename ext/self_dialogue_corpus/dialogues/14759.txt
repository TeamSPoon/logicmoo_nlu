Have you seen Bridesmaids?
I have, so funny!
Maya Rudolph is a genius.
That scene where she is running across the street and then just squats down killed me.
Melissa McCarthy looks so different now.
I know. "Look away!!!!"
She totally stole that movie from Kristin Wiig. She was good in Tammy, too.
Yeah but Wiig got to film a bedroom scene with Jon Hamm
True, he's a stone cold fox.
He has great comedic chops.
