I have a guilty pleasure movie from the 90's.
What's it called?
Some film you may have heard of: Titanic.
Oh my goodness.  I haven't seen that for ages!
Well, it is three hours long so not an easy watch.
I remember when that came out.  Hard to believe it's been 20 years.
Remember the phenomenon it caused?  It made so much money.
Which was odd as they thought it could have been a disaster at the box office.
They spent a ton on making it.  It shows when you watch it.
James Cameron proved everyone wrong once again.
It was odd to see Leo and Kate Winslet so young.
Well, 20 years goes by quick.
I still remember how all the girls in my class always cried at the end.
When he sacrifices herself so she could be on the wooden plank?
Right.  It was irritating though, there was room for him.
Well, it may have tipped over, you never know.
She probably would have froze to death too.
That's why it's not a true story, but a love story.
Love stories can have sad endings though.
And it was a sad ending!  It was the Titanic for crying out loud!
