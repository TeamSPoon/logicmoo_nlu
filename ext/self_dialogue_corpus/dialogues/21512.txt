Have you seen the new movie Get Out?
No I haven't seen it yet. Is it good?
It was pretty good. There was lots of thrilling moments.
Ooh, I like a good thriller. A movie that keeps you guessing is always a must see.
It's hard to believe it was written and directed by that guy on Key and Peele, Jordan Peele.
Yeah, I didn't know he could direct, let alone write a whole movie. Move over Tyler Perry.
It was a movie that definitely made you think. Do people really act like this or think this way?
I saw the trailer and have been meaning to go see it. I will definitely find some time this weekend.
You should, I think you will like it.
There's not a lot of blood and gore in it is there?
No only maybe at the end. Oh, and there is an alternate ending if you wait for the credits to finish.
Oh I love those when they give you an alternate ending. Then you can decide which one you like better.
Well I didn't like the alternate ending very much. I prefer the ending of the movie where the good guy wins in the end.
Yeah me too. I like a movie that gives you an ending, not like those movies that keep you wondering.
I know, to me the alternate ending would be the one that would keep you wondering.
I am really excited to see it now. I can't wait for the weekend so I can go to the movies.
Good I'm glad I could help you make that decision. Don't forget the popcorn.
I won't forget the popcorn or the M&Ms.
I know you will enjoy it. Maybe you should take someone with you though. Since it is a thriller.
No I think I will see this one alone. It will be more thrilling that way.
