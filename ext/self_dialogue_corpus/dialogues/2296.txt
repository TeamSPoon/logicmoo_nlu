Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this year?
Gotta go with the Falcons!
Really?
Hey, they nearly won the Superbowl last year.
True, but a lot of the teams who make the Superbowl but lose end up having a bad year the next year.
Is that true?
Anecdotally, it feels true.
Hmm, I'd be interested in seeing the data on that.
Yeah, I'm looking here, and a surprisingly large number of Superbowl losers don't even make the playoffs the next year.
Yikes, guess maybe my Falcons pick is risky!
They seem like they'll be good next year, though.
I definitely believe that. Their offense is so versatile.
Matt Ryan makes all the right decisions.
For sure. And Julio Jones is a beast of a wide receiver.
The catch he made in the Superbowl was superhuman.
I can't believe a human is capable of doing some of the stuff he does.
Definitely one of the players worth watching a game for.
I do kind of worry about the defense, though.
They had a nice year last year.
True, but it's easy with that offense running the way it did.
