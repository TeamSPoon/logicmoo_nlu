Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian. I loved him in Just Go With It.
Me too. I was surprised by how funny Nicole Kidman was in that movie.
Jennifer Aniston was pretty funny, too.
She was great in Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey.
I wonder if Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler have ever worked on a movie together.
I don't know, but a classic Adam Sandler movie is Big Daddy.
Yeah that one is pretty funny, but I like Wedding Singer more than that one.
I forgot about that one. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler go great together.
I agree. What was that movie that came out a few years ago with both of them in it?
Oh, I know. You're thinking of Blended.
