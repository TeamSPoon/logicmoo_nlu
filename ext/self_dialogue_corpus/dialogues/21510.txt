Do you think that criminals should be able to act and direct?
Who, specifically?
Well, Mel Gibson is a horrible person. Sean Penn tortured Madonna. Alec Baldwin is an awful parent. Casey Affleck got best actor amid sex assault accusations.
Sure, why not?
Because they can get away with anything. What do you think happens to a poor person who is caught stealing?
Jail.
Not just that. Some states had a "three strikes" policy and there are poor people serving life sentences for stealing three items.
That's insane.
So, do you think Mel Gibson should be able to direct movies?
Well, they're oscar-worthy. He does a great job.
True, but that just feeds into the "special class" of movie stars.
My only thing is that they're an inspiration. They don't get treated as real people because they're not.
They are.
No, not really. They're icons and have an extra status.
So you're fine with it?
I saw and loved Hacksaw Ridge. I loved Manchester By The Sea. They shouldn't be stopped from doing their craft.
You don't care if they commit crimes?
No, of course I do. I just think that after they serve their time, they can get back to their jobs.
That sounds okay, but again shows them as special.
And, again, they are special.
