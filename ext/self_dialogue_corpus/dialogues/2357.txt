If you had to pick a DT to build around, who would it be?
Well, I wouldn't take a DT if I were building a team.
It's a hypothetical question.
I know, but DT is not a position I would do.  I would always start with a QB or pass rusher.
Alright, I get it, but since you can't answer the question, I'll go first.
Fine, smart guy, who are you taking?
Aaron Donald.
Great young player for sure.  Seems like he's a forgotten man in LA.
Only because his team is so bad.
Yeah, the Rams are eternally awful.
Donald just plays hard every turn.  I knew he was a star the moment he was drafted.
I was hoping for him to fall in the draft to my team, but it didn't happen.
Anyway, that's my pick.
You're forgetting one little guy I think though.
Who am I forgetting?
Some guy named JJ Watt.
Oh man, I did forget JJ.
If he hadn't been hurt last year, he'd be a slam dunk pick.
Yeah, will be interesting to see how he comes back from injury.
When healthy, best player in the league in my opinion.
