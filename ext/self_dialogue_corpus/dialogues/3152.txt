How excited are you for the season this year?
Oh man, I'm really hype, I got a new TV and set up my room very nice.
Oh that's pretty cool man.
Ya, I'm pretty excited. How about you?
I actually got a season's worth of tickets as a reward from my work.
Oh my god, that's amazing!
Ya I couldn't believe it when they told me
Ya I wouldn't believe it man.
Ya, if you're interested, I could take a few people with me to a few of the games.
Oh dude that would be amazing!
It's no problem man, I got them for free after all.
What games are they for
They're actually for some Patriots games.
Oh that's perfect, they're my favorite team!
I think they're a little overrated, especially lately, but it'll still be really fun.
To each their own, I'd still be excited either way.
Ya, I'm excited to just go to an NFL game.
I would be too.
I'm just hoping that the Patriots can keep up the record so the games are at least interesting.,
I'm sure they will, they've been one of the best teams for a while now, I'm sure their games will be great.
