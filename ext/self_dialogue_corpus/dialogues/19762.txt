Hey I know you are a guitar nerd and know a lot of different players.
Yeah this is true. Mostly I like rock and heavy metal but I like all kinds of music.
So are you familiar with Roy Clark?
You Roy Clark from Hee Haw?
Yes! Exactly! Have you ever heard him play? He's really good.
He is a very underrated guitar player. The man has some mad skills.
He is appreciated in the country music world for sure.
Have you heard him play Malegue√±a? It's not country that's for sure.
No I don't think so. Is it on acoustic or electric?
On acoustic. He is amazing to watch and listen to as well.
A far cry from playing on Hee Haw.
Well he did rip it up on the show with other musicians and not just sit/com music.
Did you ever see him playing on the Porter Wagoner Show?
Wow  Porter Wagoner now that man could wear some glitzy ,shiny, sequined clothes.
Seriously! This one video clip I watched had him introducing Roy. I thought holy cow stop moving or you are going to blind someone.
Ha Ha! Yes he was a radical in his own way.
It would be kind of fun to go to an old diner with a jukebox and have lunch and listen to old tunes like it really sounded. Not digitized.
I wonder if there are any places like that in existance?
Oh I am sure there are places with refurbished jukeboxes and maybe some of the old things were kept to decorate.
Got to go. Talk to you  later.
