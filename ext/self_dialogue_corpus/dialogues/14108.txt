I wonder how experimental She will be on her new album
Has she been experimental before
Of course she has
I mean she does look the part i guess
Well she acts it oo
I would like some experimental music more often
I know its cool
New stuff is always better
Yep you can only refine whats already good
Precisely my thoughts
