Hi, what movie are we watching tonight?
I thought I'd pick up Harry Potter.
Oh good, I love it. Which one?
I want to watch Deathly Hallows, is that okay?
Uh, remind me of which one that is again!
It's the one were Snape goes in the mansion and the Death Eaters and Voldemort is at the head of the table.
Is that were he tells Snape he has to kill Harry?
Yes! That one!
Oh, that one is sad. I cried when Hermoine does the spell to make her parents forget.
Oh my gosh yes, that is so emotional!
