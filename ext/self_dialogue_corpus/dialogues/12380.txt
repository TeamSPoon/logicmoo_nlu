Was R2D2 really an important character?
Thats a gray question in my opinion.
So what is your quick answer?
I dont think hes crucial to the story but it was a good side piece.
I think they could have done without the robot.
I liked it for the most part.
I just think its somewhat contrived now.
I think its science fiction so you have to take liberties.
Yeah but a robot without emotion seems silly
No thats not true, hes an integral part
