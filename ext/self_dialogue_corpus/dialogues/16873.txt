I need a music recommendation from you.
Go for it, I love recommending music!
OK. I've got a beach trip coming up, and I'm panning on doing lots of reading, so I'd like some good reading music.
Got it! I like having music on when I read too.
Cool! So what would you reccommend?
One of my favorite albums for reading is 'Copia' by Eluvium.
I've never heard of Eluvium.
It's just one guy who is sort of a composer.
So it's like classical music?
Kind of. It's very atmospheric and ambient, but not boring. No percussion or drums and it's not distracting.
Cool, I'll check him out. What else?
Another favorite is Helios.
Never heard of them either.
Their stuff is mostly really slow and chilled out. It's very peaceful.
Any more bands you'd suggest?
I've been listening to Com Truise a lot when I read.
I know Com Truise. Good stuff.
Yep. His stuff is good for working, reading, exercising... you name it.
He'll be on my beach playlist for sure.
Good choice; check those others out too!
