Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequels?
I definitely like the originals more but I really like Revenge of the Sith.
I do too, it is probably my third favorite movie.
What's your favorite? Mine is The Empire Strikes Back
My favorite is actually A New Hope, but Empire comes next.
Do you like the new movie at all, I thought it was alright but not great.
I liked it but thought it was only better than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.
I could agree with that, it was trying too hard to be the originals.
I think that's true, and it didn't have any real significant moments besides Hans ending.
Yeah, I do look forward to the next movies though.
