Have you heard the new Foo Fighters song?
Not yet. How is it?
Do you honestly think that it would be bad?
You're right. It is impossible for the Foo Fighters to release anything bad.
Its called Run. Listen to it now!
Let me bring it up on Spotify right now.
What do you think about it?
This song is totally amazing. Is it a single, or did they come out with a new album?
Well, its a single of their upcoming album. The new album will be out in September.
I'm excited to hear it! September seems way too far away.
I know right. I wish the album was coming out sooner.
I guess we will have to wait, but I'm sure it will be worth it.
Yes it will. Did you hear they are going to play a festival in California with Queens of the Stone Age?
Really? I might have to go to California on a vacation to see them.
I love Queens of the Stone Age as much as I love the Foo Fighters. I can't believe there is a chance to see them together.
Me neither. What other bands are playing.
I can't remember all of the bands, but I know Royal Blood will also be there.
Royal Blood is my favorite band. I saw them open up for Foo Fighters in New York City.
Was that the tour where Dave Grohl played with the broken leg.
Yes it was. It was pretty awesome seeing how much he cares about his fans that he didn't even cancel the tour.
