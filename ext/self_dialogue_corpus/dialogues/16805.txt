Are you a fan of the Coheed style of music?
I loved the band Rush so yeah I love them
I hate when they get the comparison to them
I think its the octave that their lead singer uses.
True he does have that high pitched voice but still.
They have alot of the progressive rock tones that Rush uses and used.
Right but the themes are so different.
Yeah they are a band that writes a story in their albums
I am not a fan of the albums not being in chronological order though.
This is a thing that pisses me off too.
Do you think we ever see a band like them again?
No because that style of music is tough to do for that long.
I havent heard from them lately.
They released a double album
Was it any good?
I think it is but the critics dont.
Their story needs to end soon.
You could say that but then the band doesnt exist.
I am sure they could figure something out.
Yeah but not as a band, theyd do side projects
