Let's talk about the Beatles!
Okay sounds good!
I love the Beatles so much. My favorite album is The White Album.
I love the song Glass Onion from that.
That song is alright. I like Dear Prudence the best.
I get bored with that song at times.
I like Golden Slumbers too.
I will have to give that song another go.
Definitely do that, it is great!
Will do!
