What's your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite is definitely Aladdin! I love that movie!
That's so old fashioned! I meant something new, like Frozen or Rapunzel.
I like some of the newer movies, but I think I prefer the old fashioned ones.
What's so great about that out-dated animation?
There's something so charming about it, the traditional animation over the digital animation, the characters, and most importantly, the story-telling.
The story telling? What's so different about animated story-telling versus digital story-telling?
It isn't the visuals. It's just that, I don't know, the plots were explained better, the characters were more developed. Things were explained to children more in the past, whereas now the movies also geared toward adults.
I guess you're right. Children don't know the difference between old school cartoons and CGI animations, but adults do.
My point exactly! The technology has evolved for adults, not children. Children will always enjoy a good cartoon no matter what the format. Adults, not so much.
