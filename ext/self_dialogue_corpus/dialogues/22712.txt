Do you like the movies today?
Yea, they are incredible.
I cannot believe that they can create such landscapes.
They are incredible.
I enjoy the city skylines as well.
No one can top that in the old days.
I think it's awesome the things the characters can do today in a movie.
Computer technology is incredible.
I like that stunt men don't have to get hurt as much for the scenes.
Yes, they can just use a computer to fix things.
Do you think the scenes are believable?
I guess it takes out some elements of believability but adds others.
I guess some stunt men and women were laid off.
I still hear of people getting hurt making scenes, but maybe it's less.
I would hope so.
I wonder if they have decreased accident rates in movies or if it hasn't changed.
I don't know, but they can do amazing things.
What do you think they will think of next?
The sky is the limit.
Our grandparents would have never imagined the things they do today in movies considering they had silent movies.
