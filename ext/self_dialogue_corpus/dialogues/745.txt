Hey you going to the game this weekend?
Of course.
Shall we bring the grill and make a day out of it?
I would to but I can't.
Why not?
Bringing the wife and kids, they're not for standing in the cold parking lot all morning.
They can stand around the grill!
Nope, I already asked her.
Fine, I'll see if anybody else wants to tailgate.  At least swing by a little early.
That I can do.  What time is kick off.
one o'clock!
Ok, you wearing your cheesehead this game.
only if you are!
Sounds like a plan.
Get any cheese heads for the kids.
I wish they want terrible towels.
No way?
Yes way!
My condolences.
Right!
