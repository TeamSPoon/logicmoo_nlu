Have you seen the Dan Brown films?
Dan Brown, sounds familiar.  Which ones are those?
DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons.
Oh, directed by Ron Howard. Yes, enjoyed those.
Did you see the latest one?
What was it called?
Inferno.  I just saw it.
No not that one. How was it?
Pretty good overall.
The previews looked good.
Some movies look best in previews.
You didn't really like it then?
No it had its good moments.
Seemed like it could be good.
I guess the prospect of running around the world with a scholar, could get stuffy and heady.
Oh thar's it.  Well remember Indiana Jones was a scholar.
Okay you got me on that one.
Those movies made a lot of money.
The books too.
I plan to see Inferno on dvd.
