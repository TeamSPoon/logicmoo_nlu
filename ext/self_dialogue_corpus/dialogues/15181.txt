Let's try something music-related.
Okay.
Open your iTunes to your general library.
Got it.
Now, scroll up and down a bunch of times with your eyes closed. Then, select a song and tell me what it is.
"Whistling in the Dark" by They Might Be Giants.
Who are they?
They're a satirical pop band from America, just two guys.
I don't recognize their name.
Have you heard "Istanbul (not Constantinople)?"
Yeah, I think so.
That's them!
Is there anything else I'd know?
They've only had five songs chart in the US, and "Istanbul" wasn't one of them, ironically.
Really? that's odd.
Have you heard "Birdhouse in Your Soul?"
No, I don't think so.
That was their big hit, it reached number 3.
Do they still tour?
Yes, they're crazy popular, but kind of a cult band.
