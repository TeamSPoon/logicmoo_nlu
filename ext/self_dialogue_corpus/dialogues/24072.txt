I'm a big action movie fan,how about you?
Love the action films.
They're a lot of fun to,watch.
Yes they are.
Any favorites for you?
I like the raiders of the lost ark series.
Harrison ford is good.
He's a great actor.
Lots,of action in those movies.
That's for sure.
How many were there?
I think four total.
The original,the last crusade and kingdom of the last skull was the last.
It was actually Indiana jones series and not raiders of the lost ark.
You're right on that
When did the last one come out?
I believe 2008
Wow,seemed like yesterday.
Time flies with movies
Does it ever.
