Have you bought sgt peppers 50th anniversary album yet?
No,I've heard and read a lot about it though.
It's unreal. New clips and it comes with a DVD.
Wow,no kidding?
Yes it does. I can't get enough of the Beatles.
Me too,they changed music.
That they did. That album was groundbreaking!
It was a classic and still is.
Wasn't a big hit at first though.
Yea,people weren't used to that music from the Beatles. It was out of the norm.
