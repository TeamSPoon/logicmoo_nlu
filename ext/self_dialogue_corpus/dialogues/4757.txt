I can't believe the Yankees left the picture in after back-to-back home runs!
Yeah, then he loaded the bases and there was a grand slam.
I have tickets to the Cubs on Saturday, want to go?
I'd love to.  What time is the game on Saturday?
I was watching the Yankees and the Astros this week.  Everyone was wearing pink.  What's up with that?
It's for breast cancer awareness.  They are showing their support.
Did you watch the Braves game last night?
I tried to but it got rained out in the fifth inning.
I couldn't stay up to watch the Reds game.  How many innings did it go?
It went 15 innings.  It's almost like a double-header.  I was up very late.
Who won the Astro and Yankees last few games?
They played three games and it was two-one, Astros.
Did you see the altercation between the Red Sox GM and the home umpire?
Yes, he was kicking dust on the ump' and deserved to get kicked out of the game.
I can't believe the Orioles?  Can they get ever possibly get any worse?
I don't know how they could get much worse.  You would think they would be tired of losing.
I was just getting settled into the A's game and some fool spilled his drink on me. I missed the play.
Sorry.  You just missed the guy getting thrown out on second.
Did you see that?  That was almost a triple play!
Yeah, it could have been if the throw from third was better.
