Hi, have you listened to any good music lately?
Yes, I just got a new Ipod so I have been enjoying downloading.
Where do you buy your music from?
I mostly download from Itunes because it is so easy to use.
Do you use your ipod in the car to listen to music?
All the time.  i am able to connect it via USB and listen to my entire collection.
That sounds great.  Better than buying cd's.
I think those are going to be a thing of the past soon.
Me too, but I have so many of them.  I don't know what to do with them all.
I actually took all my cds and put the music onto my ipod.
That's a great idea.  It would take up much less space.
It really does.
How do you organize your music once it is downloaded?
I like to make different lists and label them depending on my mood.
That sounds interesting.
I have pretty much any type of music on there that I would want to listen to.
I still enjoy even listening to the radio once and a while.
Me too, except for the comercials.
It was great catching up!
I will talk to you later!
