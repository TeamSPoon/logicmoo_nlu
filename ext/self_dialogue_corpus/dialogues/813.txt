Know what I think is hilarious?
Kids ruining dinners at fancy restaurants?
Besides that. Think NFL and big money.
I give up. This is going nowhere.
Guaranteed contracts and signing bonuses.
Why?
Well, let me be more specific: when a team gives a new player $50 million contract with a $10 million signing bonus, then to have them be a du.
New players? Do you mean rookies or free agents.
Rookies.
Why are you rooting against them?
I'm not, really. I'm rooting against the system.
How so?
I think it's absolutely ridiculous to give a player who's only succeeded against 18-22 year olds a massive contract to play against  seasoned veterans.
Yeah, bigger and stronger, right?
More-so wiser than anything.
Yeah, they've seen it all, right?
Yup. So, the system needs to change.
But you're now rooting for the team to fail, which hurts the city it's in.
That's true, but it's just sports. Cities get alone fine without them.
That's probably true. Hundreds of cities don't have sports and they're fine.
