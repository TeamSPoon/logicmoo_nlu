Do you like the animated version or movie version of The Jungle Book better?
To be honest I have never seen the movie version.
You haven't? Why not?
Because I loved the animated version as a kid. I did not want the movie version to disappoint me and take away from that.
Why would you think it would.
I just did not think the Shere Khan, Bagheera and especially Balou could be properly represented in a real life version.
I thought they did an ok job.
See you said ok. But in the animated version they were spectacular!
Do you think you will ever watch the movie version?
Probably not as I just cannot picture a real bear singing Bear Necessities.
