I went to the club the other night and guess what song came on?
I think I already know what you're going to say, but Back That Azz Up??
Haha yeah, honestly every time I go out I hear that song being played at least 5-6 times.
By far the greatest song Juvenile ever put out. It just flows, perfect for playing in a club. The girls go wild when they hear it.
Girls aren't the only ones that go wild when it's played, I get loose as soon as that iconic beat drops!
I'm listenig to it rite now! I wouldn't call it Juvenile's greatest song though.
Ok I'm game, what's Juvenile's greatest song then?
Slow Motion is the best Juvenile song in my opinion. It's just as iconic as Back That Azz Up but Juvenile collaborated with Souja Slim for Slow Motion.
I always forget Souja Slim was part of Slow Motion, I wish he was still alive, the music he made was top of the line.
Yeah, it's ashame he was killed but I guess that shows you how gangsta he really was.
