Hey are you going to see Alien Covenant this weekend
I am considering it but i am not sure since the last movie was weak
The last movie was not that bad though.
It was not horrible but it was such a letdown.
I mean i guess it could be considered a let down
It certainly was not great
Well yeah i can agree it was not great at least
Yeah and i am fearful the new one is just as bad
From what i hear in the reviews it is much better
Oh yeah? What have the reviews said?
They said that the movie was actually good and scary
That is a relief as the last one was not at all.
The only down side is some of the people from that movie seem to return.
Well shame they should have just forgot about them
I agree they were part of the reason it was not that good
Do they seem to be portrayed better?
They sound like they are a step up in acting
i am a bit more positive about that then
Lets give it a shot i will pay
Well then cannot say no if you are paying.
