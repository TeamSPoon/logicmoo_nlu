Did you see the new version of Pete's Dragon by Disney?
No but I heard it got good reviews.
Yeah it was great,even for fans of the first version.
Now I saw THAT one.  It was funny.
They made Elliott into a digital dragon, really cool. The actors were probably fans of the first.
Who was in it?
Robert Redford, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Wes Bentley.
Sounds like a good cast. What were the differences?
The cast, music, and story points. You should see it.
I'll keep an eye out for the dvd.
