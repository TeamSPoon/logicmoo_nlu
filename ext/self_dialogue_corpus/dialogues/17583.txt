What you doing?
Listening to music and watching videos.
Which ones?
I found this ultimate 80's and 90's r&b slow jam mix on youtube.
Oh yeah? Who's playing now?
Al Green.
Which song?
Let's Stay Together.
What else is on there?
I just watched Destiny's Child Say My Name.
Oh that's my jam.
There's over 700 songs on this playlist.
Word?
They got everybody on here. Mariah Carey, Whitney, Mike, Puffy, KC and JoJo.
Which one do they have of KC and JoJo?
All My Life.
That thing was hot. I wonder if they got any Jodeci on there.
I'm sure they do. I'm only up to song eleven.
That thing gone be playing all night long.
I know right. Better than a radio station playing music I don't want to hear.
