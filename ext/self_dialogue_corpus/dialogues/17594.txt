Hey do you know the song Let Her Go?
Yes its was sang by Passenger
When was the release date for the song?
Oh its been out since mid 2012.
Wow and i just heard it for the first time and fell in love with it.
Its really the only song Passenger has done that i like.
Really what other song have they made?
I have heard Circles, A Thousand Matches they have made several
So what type of band are they
They do contempory pop music
Who is the singer
His name is Michael David Rosenberg
And he just calls himself passenger for the bands sake
I believe so  He kept it for name sake pretty much after the band dissolved.
You should look up some of his work you may like his other music
i probably will do you know if the song Let her Go won any awards?
As far as i know it has recieved severalnomination but never won any of them
Thats disappointing since i like it
Maybe see if he is performing any where near us we could go check it out
ill look into it and let you know id love to see him perform.
