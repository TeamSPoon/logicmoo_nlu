So, I just heard that Childish Gambino said his next album will be his last.
No! He's retiring from rapping?
I don't think so, I think maybe he's just retiring the alter-ego Childish Gambino.
So do you think he'll just rap as Donald Glover now?
That's exactly what I think he's going to do.
I miss the old Childish Gambino rap style.
Same. I was such a fan of his old stuff that his newest album made me really sad.
I can appreciate his new album, but I find myself going back to his older stuff more often.
Well, hopefully if he does start releasing things under Donald Glover, he brings back the old sound.
I wonder what he's do if he stopped rapping?
He's got a pretty decent acting career going on, so he might just go back to that.
I wonder if that's because he's a connection to Hollywood.
I'm confused, what do you mean a connection?
Well, his dad. Danny Glover.
Danny Glover isn't Donald Glover's dad!
Are you sure? I swear someone told me that.
I don't doubt that someone told you that, but its not true.
Oh, that's a bummer. I actually thought it was kind of neat.
I guess that would be kinda cool, if it were true, but no, it isn't.
Oh well thanks for telling me! I'm glad I never said anything to anyone else about it.
