You know what is so cool about the Star Wars franchise?
A whole bunch of stuff makes it cool!
Yeah but it connects a bunch of generations.
What do you mean?
Well, some movies came out when my dad was a kid, and then when I was, and now when my kid grows up he will have some too.
That is pretty cool.  I still think the original ones are the best though.  Return of the Jedi is great!
The Force Awakens was pretty good too though. It felt like the originals.
It did have that same kind of quality.  Daisy Ridley was really good in it.
David Boyega was my favorite new character.
I love the idea of a stormtrooper switching sides.  And I can't wait to see what the backstory is with some of these characters.
