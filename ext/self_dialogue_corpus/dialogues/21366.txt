have you seen Everything Must Go with Will Ferrell?
Yes, it was ok, but it bored me. He is a much better comedy actor.
I think he done a good job.
I liked him a lot more, as far as a serious role in Stranger Than Fiction
That was a good movie, kinda weird. Reminded me of The Truman Show.
Really? How?
Both had their destiny plotted out for them.
I disagree. Truman yes but Ferrell, the narrator heard and wrote all his thoughts and actions.
No, if she had, she would have had to hve been there, but instead she wrote them and he heard her inner monologue as she wrote.
Still, it is a statement of predestination versus freewill.
How so? Truman had no free will, he was an experiment in reality TV.
True, but he had free will to move about his world.
Not really his world was scripted , or at least all those around him. His wife didn't even like him, how they expalined relations in real world would have been prostitution.
Maybe, but he was tipped off by returning cast, Ferrell's character could hear the writer simultaniuously, so wouldn't that have actually put him in charge?
there in lies the tick, is free will really free? As we are held responsible for our actions, or can we blame it on an unsen hand?
That's pretty deep there...
That doesn't make it any less valid a comparison.
Fair point, so in the end, neither had free will.
I guess not, but I still think Everything Must Go was ok
It was just that, ok, I would watch it on tv, not in a movie theater.
