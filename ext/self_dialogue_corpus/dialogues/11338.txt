What is your favorite Beatles album?
Oh, that's easy; it would have to be Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:  it was such a musical breakthrough. How about you?
I, myself, like their previous record the best: Revolver.  That's where they *really* started experimenting with things.
Really? I always think of Sergeant Pepper as the first *real* concept album.
It's true Revolver wasn't a 'concept' album, but that's where they started with all the tape experimentation; faster, slower, backward...
But it all came together on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: that's the one everyone looks to their breakthrough album.
It's still just a continuation of Revolver's experimentation. Listen, for example, to the reversed guitar on Tomorrow Never Knows.
Interesting! I've listened to Revolver, but I never thought of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as a continuation of it.
Or listen to weird musical processing they did on Yellow Submarine -- *that* was a brand-new technique at the time, too.
I'm going to listen to Revolver, then listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band afterwards.  This will be fun!
