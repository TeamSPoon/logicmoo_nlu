You know a lot about The Beatles, right?
I know a bit. I'm no expert.
What's their longest album?
The White Album for sure. It's a double album.
What do you make of it?
It has some of my favorite Beatles songs of all time, like Revolution, Glass Onion, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and more!
Oh, I recognize Revolution! That's a really good one.
Yeah, one of my favorites for sure. The White Album does have a lot of great songs, but also a bit of filler.
Oh yeah, like what?
There is a song called Revolution Number 9 which is super avant garde and long.
