Did you see the movie Why Him?
The one with James Franco?
Yeah it has James Franco and Bryan Cranston.
Yeah I saw it. It was really funny I was honestly surprised how funny it was.
I know me too. I wasn't even going to see it because it looked corny but my brother told me how good it was.
Yeah I really like seeing Bryan Cranston doing a variety of rolls. He was so serious in Breaking Bad but so funny in this.
I completely agree. Breaking Bad was amazing and he did such a great job, but I love seeing him doing funny roles as well.
Yeah I am a huge comedy lover so I tend to watch a lot of comedy movies.
Same here. Did you watch Get A Job? Bryan Cranston has a roll in that movie too.
Yes I love that movie. Anna Kendrick and Miles Teller were great together and Bryan Cranston played a believable father role.
Yeah it was nice to see a movie where people were dealing with life struggles that were so realateable.
Relateable and also so funny. I feel like it went unnoticed too when it came out.
I agree. It was almost like an indie movie but there was so much there. One of my favorite movies.
It was so funny how Bryan Cranston started going to the coffee shop and that barista started helping him with social media.
I know I loved her! And I loved how he was just going there everyday and then really started to like it.
I know, see that is why I love him. He is lovable and agreeable in almost everything he plays.
I know! Even in Breaking Bad I also loved him. Like you wanted to root for the bad guy.
I completely agree. Man now I really want to go re-watch Get A Job.
Well I actually have it on DVD so if you want to come over we can watch it together.
That sounds good. I'll see if I have any other comedies of Bryan Cranston films too.
