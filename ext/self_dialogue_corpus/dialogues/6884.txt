Did you see the Little Mermaid?
It was pretty crazy
I liked Flounder and Sebastian
They carried the movie
Ariel had lots of gadgets
She couldn't stay out of trouble
I'm glad she finally got feet
Having a big flipper for a tail would sure help in swimming
It would be expensive to keep out predators
You would need plenty of lights, which might attract all kinds of critters
