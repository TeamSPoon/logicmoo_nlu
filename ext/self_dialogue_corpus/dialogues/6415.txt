Have you seen Moana yet?
We did!  We saw it in the theater when it first came out.
Was it good? We haven't seen it yet!
Oh yes!  We love it.  We own it now.
Oh great!  I saw that it's out on Netflix.
Yes i definitely think it's worth seeing.
We will have to watch it. My kids loved Tangled.
That's another great one.
I enjoy the movies too.
Me too!  I would love to go to Disneyland.
