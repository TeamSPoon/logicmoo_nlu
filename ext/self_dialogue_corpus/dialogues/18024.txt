What kind of music do you listen to?
Mostly heavy metal.
You mean like Metallica?
No, I haven't really listened to Metallica in a long time.  They kind of lost me in the 90s.
I know what you mean, I didn't really follow them after Load.  But I really liked the black one.
That was the one that turned me off.  I got a little worried with And Justice for All, but the black album really turned me off.
What do you mean?  There were some great songs on that album.
If you like that sort of thing, then sure, it was ok.  But if you go back an listen to Master of Puppets you will hear a very different band.
Back in the 80s?  Is that what you like, the 80s metal?
I do like 80s metal, both speed metal like Metallica or Meghadeath, and hair metal like Motley Crue and Poison.
I remember those guys, it is all kind of classic rock now.
It is, but there are still metal bands putting out great new music, both older bands like Iron Maiden and newer bands like Hammerfall and Dragonforce.
You mean the guys from Guitar Hero?  That song was so hard.
Yeah, Dragonforce had a song on Guitar Hero, but they also have a bunch of albums out and tour all over the world.
But I never hear anything about these bands.
That is because they never really got popular in the United States.  But they are pretty popular everywhere else, especially Europe.
Are they European bands?
Yes, they are mostly from Europe, though there are some American bands that play that kind of music.
How do you stay connected to the metal scene in Europe.
The bands and their fans are really good with keeping great content on the internet, so fans like me can keep up.
