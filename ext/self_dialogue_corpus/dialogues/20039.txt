Who's your favorite composer?
What do you mean by composer? Do you mean songwriter?
No. A composer is someone who writes music, such as symphonies or cinematic film scores.
Oh. Well, I like John Williams, the composer of the Star Wars music.
That's a good example. What about classical music?
You mean classic rock, like The Beatles?
No, I mean fine art music like Beethoven and Tchaikovsky.
I don't know. I guess I wouldn't know the difference between one or the other.
It takes a while to develop a taste for classical music. Even though I was an orchestral musician, it took me several years to really appreciate a lot of different composers.
Yeah, I never got into it. It's basically what I think really old people listen to, like over 60.
That's not really true though. I bet there are some things you might like if you know the right stuff to listen to.
Yeah? like what?
Well, if you like the Star Wars music, you might want to try listenign to "The Planets" by Gustav Holst. All the sci-fi shows and movies pretty much borrow from that piece.
Is that so? So does it sound like a movie?
Yes, at times when listening to the piece it feels like you could be watching a space epic like Star Wars.
Why is it called "The Planets"?
The piece is comprised of several sections, called movements, that each musically describe the planets in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Mars.
How does music describe a planet?
Well, as you probably know, the planets were named after greek gods. For example, Mars was the god of war, so the Mars movement sounds like the kind of music in a movie about ancient battles.
That's cool. I'm curious enough to maybe try listening to it.
