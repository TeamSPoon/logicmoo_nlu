Remember Han Solo?
Yes. He was in those STAR WARS movies.
I think he was in 3 or more of them.
I think so also. He was like a bad cowboy.
Yes. It was like he was always on the run.
When he shot Greedo I beat he wanted to get off that planet quick.
Yeah, he owned all that money.
Then he met Ben Kenobi and Luke.
That was just more trouble.
But it all worked out when they got the plans to the base.
