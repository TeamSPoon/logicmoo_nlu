Who would you say is the best player in the NFL?
Can I pick a non-Quarterback?
Sure, if you think that's truly the best player.
Then I'm picking J.J. Watt.
He had a down year last year.
I know, he battled an injury. But I think he's the most dominant force in the game.
He's a game changer.
What about you? Who would you pick?
For me, it has to be a quarterback.
It's the most important position, but I don't think it necessarily means the best player plays there.
I see your argument, but I'm going with Aaron Rodgers.
Not Tom Brady?
Brady is great, but I think he benefits greatly from scheme and overall talent around him.
Hmm, I'm not sure I agree about the talent. The Patriots tend to mix and match a lot of teams' rejects on offense.
Gronkowski isn't anyone's reject!
Gronk was hurt a lot last year, and the Patriots still rolled.
Look, I'm not saying Brady isn't an elite QB, just that I'd take Rodgers over him.
I'd take either Brady OR Rodgers over J.J. Watt, but I think Watt is the superior player.
Huh? How does that make sense?
He plays a less important position.
