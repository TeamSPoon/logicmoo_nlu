Is there anything about the Star Wars films that stands out to you the most?
If I had to choose one thing, I'd say the setting.
All of the different planets and things like that?
Exactly. The fact that the setting varies so much helps the series stay fresh.
Honest.y, I'd never thought of it like that.
Did you just value the aesthetics of it?
Pretty much. I just saw that the worlds looked pretty, and that's it.
I feel like seeing it the way that I just described helps keep interest in the films.
That makes sense. I might have to start thinking like that.
You might just find yourself enjoying movies a lot more.
