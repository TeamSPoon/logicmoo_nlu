Do you think rock music is getting old.
I do, I hear so many songs played over and over again.
Do you think the radios should play less played rock songs?
I do. Some songs people never hear from a band.
Do you think this would make rock music more popular again.
I do. I think it would not be so repetitive.
Would you drive a campaign with radio stations to play less popular songs?
I would love to start a campaign to promote this.
What stations would you start with, locally or nationally?
I think I would start locally, and work from there.
