Hey bro, did you check out the new Mors Principium Est album?
Mors Principium Est did another album? Isn't that like 500 by now?
Maybe seven or eight. But seriously, they have not lost their edge even after all this time.
Oh, I believe it, MPE is dreamy, just like Insomnium.
Haha, right? While We Sleep by Insomnium made me cry man tears, I'm not even joking.
Man tears?
Not exaggerating. The song is so poetic and depressing and as soon as they hit the bridge it's all water works from there.
Well on a less depressing note, I'm seeing Amon Amarth in concert next week.
Are you serious? You didn't tell me about it?
Dude I told you about it for the last month. You were all stoked about going to Paganfest or Chicago Open Air or something.
No I want to go to Wacken Open Air, in Schleswig-Holstein.
I think I've heard of that, supposedly its the biggest metal festival in the world.
You bet, Devin Townsend was there a few years ago with The Devin Townsend Project.
Devin Townsend, you mean from Strapping Young Lad?
That's the one. I would pay large sums of money and give up large sums of vital organs to go see him perform.
Oh man me too, Wacken sounds awesome.
Yea, I'm thinking we should go, I think Amon Amarth is part of the lineup. Along with Kreator, Heaven Shall Burn, and Saltatio Mortis.
That sounds awesome!
Get your passport ready because our heads are gonna explode from awesome guitar riffs!
Right on!
