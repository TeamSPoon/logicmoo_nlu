How many Halloween movies are there?
Many, I just saw on t.v. the one about 20 years later.
Was it as good as the first one I saw in college?
No, none of the followup ones were ever as good as the first.
I bet lots of people got murdered, though.
Yes they did and Jamie Leigh Curtis looked just as good now as she did then.
Did she get killed this time?
I won't tell you because I don't want to spoit it for you.
Well, do you think there will be more Halloween movies?
Of course.
