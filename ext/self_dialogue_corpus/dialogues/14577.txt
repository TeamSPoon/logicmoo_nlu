Are you going to the basketball game at school tonight?
Maybe. Who are we playing?
Larsonville. They always beat us.
Maybe they won't this time. We're good this year.
That's true. We beat Ashton and they always beat us too.
Max Howard is great.
He really is. I can't believe that touchdown he scored last week.
Wasn't that the tie breaker?
Yes. We won because of him.
I was elated and I normally don't care much about the game.
I don't either. I usually just go to see friends.
I think that's most of us.
Want to ride together then?
Sure. Can you pick me up a little early so we can get a seat?
Yes. I don't want to have to sit all the way at the top of the stands again.
Neither do I. I hate that.
So do I. It's hard to get anywhere if you want food or something.
I'll buy you a pretzel if you want one at the game.
I love those. This game is going to be so great.
If we win everyone's going to be so excited.
