Did you see the new Baywatch movie?
No way.
Not your kind of movie?
I hate all remakes in the first place and sequels too.
I agree the originals are always best.
I think they run out of ideas when they start remaking bad movies and TV shows.
So what do you watch then?
Old stuff, classics.
Like what
John Candy, Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, Robin Williams
Good comedies are your thing then
Absolutely. I just rewatched Bewster's Millions and it's hilarous
You like slapstick, dialogue heavy or romantic comedies.
All of the above.
Do you know any good romcoms?
Yeah I will never get tired of When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle
I haven't seen either of them
You must. Nora Ephron write them, You've Got Mail is cute too. Really smart movie for its time
I have seen that one. Loved the New York setting
You'll really enjoy Sleepless in Seattle then
