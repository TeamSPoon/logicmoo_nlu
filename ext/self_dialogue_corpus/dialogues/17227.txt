Have you heard of Linkin Park?
Yea! I love them! Do you like them?
Yea I do. Did you know they are going to be in Seattle in October?
What? No I didn't! Are you going to go?
Yea, I have an extra ticket, too. Do you want to go with me?
Heck yes I do. I love their new song... what's it called again?
Do you mean Heavy?
Yea! That is the one. It's so good!
Yea, it's really good. My favorite one is Battle Symphony. This new album is really quite good.
That's good to hear, their last two were sort of let downs.
Yea, it's been a few years since I've been really impressed.
I don't know if they will ever live up to Meteora.
I don't know, I really liked the remix album they did with Jay-Z..
Oh yea! That was really good too. I wonder if they play any of those songs at their concerts?
I don't know, but I would love to hear that stuff at the concert.
Do you know who is opening for them?
No I don't, but I'm pretty sure Snoop Dogg is going to be there as well.
No kidding?! What an interesting match.
It makes a little sense, maybe they will do some remixes with him?
That would be amazing!
