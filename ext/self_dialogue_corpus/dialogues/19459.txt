I'm going to make you a mixtape for your birthday.
Thanks! That's really thoughtful of you.
I'm going to put all the greatest birthday themed music on it.
Hmm, what is the greatest birthday music? I can't think of any, off the top of my head.
OK, you got me! There really isn't any, so you'll get other kinds of songs.
Haha, yeah, there really isn't that much great music made on the theme of 'birthdays'.
Which makes sense. Having a happy birthday isn't exactly great artistic grounds like Love or Loss or things like that.
No, it's definitely a little more trivial.
What is the greatest song or album made about the most trivial topic, in your opinion.
Ohhh, good question. Let me think a sec.
How about "Yellow Submarine" by the Beatles?
Is that even a great song, though?
A lot of people like it, I think.
Yeah, if we're going by that standard, then that Beatles song where he sings 'I am the Egg Man' is pretty goofy too.
I guess in some ways, maybe that's the hardest thing to do in music.
What?
Make a brilliant song out of the most trivial or absurd topic or subject matter.
It seems like it would be easier to just make a song that deals with something important or meaningful.
Exactly, which is why doing the opposite is so hard.
It also seems like kind of a waste of time. But whatever floats your boat!
