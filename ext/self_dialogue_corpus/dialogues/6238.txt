Did you ever see The Little Mermaid
No, never saw that one
Really? It was a good one back in the day.
I've heard that it was the one that relaunched all the Disney Animated movies
Yes, it had all the good elements and characters like the classic Disney movies
What are some of the examples?
Sebastian the singing crab, Flounder the side kick fish.
Hmm, not sure if that's my cup of tea
I think you'd like the songs. One is called Kiss the Girl.
Okay, maybe I'll check that one out.
