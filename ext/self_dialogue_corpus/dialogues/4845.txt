Hi.
Hey.
What's up?
Not much, you?
Same.
You into baseball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Same here.
Who do you think is the best player in baseball now?
That is a good question.  Hmm.
Take your time.
I think maybe Mike Trout?
What about Bryce Harper?
Yeah he's okay, but I think Trout is better.
He was MVP last year.
Yeah exactly.
I think Harper has more power.
Yeah, but not as good defensively.
Good point.
Yeah.
