Would you like to see the current passing rules revised?
Yes I think the catch rule should be modified.
In what sense?
It should be based on common sense from the ref
I think you are on to something
Other sports incorporate that kind of rule.
Yeah its too hard to decipher what a catch is.
In addition I would like to see pass interference changed
How so?
I think it should be loosened a bit.
Yeah it would help with aggressive cornerbacks
Its becoming laughable.
Its tougher to have a good defense anymore.
Yeah and thats the way the NFL wants it to be honest
You dont want the 5 yard rule revised, right?
I would extend it to 10 yards.
That would decrease scoring.
Put more emphasis on the running game as well.
Yeah the NFL wants alot of touchdowns
With little to no celebrating
