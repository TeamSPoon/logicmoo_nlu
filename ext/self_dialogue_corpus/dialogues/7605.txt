There's a Harry Potter Marathon on today! Squee!
Oh my God, I love HP marathon days. What number are they on now?
Right now, number 3. Prisoner of Azkaban.
Oh yeah! My favorite is up next!
Why is Goblet of Fire your favorite?
It's so exciting, and sad all at the same time.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites as well. I love it when they get to the Triwizard Tournament scenes.
And the part in the graveyard when Cedric Diggory dies. Ugh, makes me cry every time.
Looks like an HP and pajama type of day. Wanna come over and join me on the couch?
Um, yeah! I'll bring my pjs and some snacks!
