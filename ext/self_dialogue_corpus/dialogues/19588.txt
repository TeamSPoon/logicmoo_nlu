Have you heard of King Diamond?
That's a really strange name. Who are they?
They're an interesting metal band that does horror music.
What do you mean by horror music?
They write about a lot of scary themes in each album.
Like a story?
Yeah, each album is actually a story and there are characters and plots in each one.
Wow, that's really different. Are they any good?
They're one of my favorite bands. The guitar work is really good.
What's the guitar work like?
There are a lot of different rhythms and grooves for each riff and everything is very melodic.
That's nice, most metal isn't like that.
Yeah. Also King, who is the singer, sings in falsetto so that's also very different.
Oh, that's very strange.
Yes, a lot of people don't really like it, but you get used to it after a while.
What are some of the albums about?
Oh you have albums about haunted houses and zombies, which would be Conspiracy.
That's pretty neat.
That one is probably the best, but there are lots of other ones.
I'll have to give them a listen.
