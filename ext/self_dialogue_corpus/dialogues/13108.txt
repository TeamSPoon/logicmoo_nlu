Who was Obi Wan Kenobi's Master?
Qui-Gon Jinn.
I liked him! How did he die?
Me too, he's one of my favorites. He was killed by Darth Maul.
Darth Maul is wicked cool.
Yeah, he is, when he killed Qui Gon...Obi Wan became Anakin's Master.
That was in the Phantom Menace, right?
Yeah. One of my favorites, though I liked Rogue One better.
Rogue One was awesome. Jyn was great.
Too bad she died. I like to think she and Luke would have been Rey's parents.
