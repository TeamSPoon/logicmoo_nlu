So it looks like Raymond James Stadium is not going to raise ticket sales.
Well, since the Bucs cant get to the playoffs i can see why. Sales have to be down.
I remember a few years back they tried to raise ticket sales and black out games.
I do too and the Bucs were playing worse then they are now!
I think they will have to make it to the playoffs to see some kind of jump in attendance.
Plus it so costly to buy anything there.
True. Also they are screening anyone that comes in like you are at the airport, no sneaking in anything!
Yup. If you want a coke be prepared to pay 5$ for a 24 oz cup.
And it will be packed full of ice too.
Same with beer. Way too overpriced.
Hopefully this will be the year the Bucs get to the playoffs and beyond.
Yes, i don't think the prices will feel so bad if the team is having a winning season.
I wonder if New England has that problem at Foxborough.
I don't know, i havent been there in years
Me either.
I know when i am at the Trop, the food and drinks are good and not that expensive.
I guess that why i like just watching NFL games at home, cheaper and better view.
I know! Speaking of which, you gonna have a Bucs party this year?
You know it!
Right on! I cant wait!
