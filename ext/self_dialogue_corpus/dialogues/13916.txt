I have loved lady Gaga ever since she first came out
Me too. She has such a great voice.
She's so talented, not just in singing, but in dancing and playing the piano.
I agree. Do you have a favorite song?
Yes, I like Alejandro. What about you?
I like Judas, and Bad Romance
Those are really good.
I think her music videos are some of the best out there
I agree. They are always epic, and they tell a story
Yeah, she's definitely one of the few true talented artists out there today.
