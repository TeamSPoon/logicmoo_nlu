Less than one month from opening kick-off. You pumped?
Dude, I'm totally pumped. What do we have? Chiefs Patriots? That's going to be good.
Agreed. Sounds weird, but I feel like football season helps signal the arrival of fall. Changing seasons. All that.
True. True. Even though it can still be hot as all get out.
New England early September. That should be nice.
Easy living. Who do you think'll win?
Win? Man. Definitely the Patriots. I'm more interested in the spread and the over-under.
You wager?
Funny thing is, no, not really. But I do like to know the lines. Seems like the over-under regularly comes down to the final few plays of the game.
I know, right? Bookies are smart.
Very smart.
Speaking of gambling, you think Oakland will be okay in Vegas?
Raiders' move? Oh yeah. No problems. You can bet anywhere. Any time.
I'm with you on that. It'll be cool to see Mayweather's tickets, though. 500k here. Another 200 there.
Right? No. The Raiders will be good. What a great location to see a game. Afterwards, you hit the strip. Shows. Food. That is all good.
It'll definitely be the hot ticket in the NFL for a minute.
True. The England play seems pretty cool, too.
Yup. I just wish they didn't send scrubs most of the time. I almost feel guilty to the British people.
Hysterical. But yeah. There's that.
Still, pretty cool. Though the games start way too early.
