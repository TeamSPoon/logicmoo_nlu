Hi, have you heard about any news regarding the upcoming Star Wars movie?
I watched a recent TV teaser trailer on YouTube. It looks amazing.
I watched the teaser trailer too. It is great to see that Luke Skywalker is coming back as a main character.
Yeah, he is one of my favourite characters in the Star Wars franchise. But my favourite is always Darth Vader.
It is sad that Darth Vader will not return.
It is a pity indeed. But we can see him in other Star Wars movies, like the recent Rogue One movie.
You are right. I was so excited to see him in Rogue One. I almost cried in the theater.
Me too. It has been so long to see Darth Vader on the big screen.
Do you know whether there are any other Star Wars movies featuring him?
I have not heard any yet, but I am sure the movie studio will not forget him.
