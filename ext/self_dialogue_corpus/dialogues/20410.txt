I just saw the new Transformers movie.....
Oh really? I saw it last night myself!
What did you think?
I absolutely loved it! I thought it was the best movie of the year!
You must not have seen any other movies this year.
What makes you say that? I thought it was great!
Where do I start.....for one, the plot was just a mess and all over the place!
Well, true......but you don't go to these kinds of movie for the plot, you go for the action!
Well, lets talk about the action then.....it was just a mess, action needs to have a point, but there was NO POINT!
There was a point, I'm almost positive anyways......
We were never given a reason to care because it was all too confusing.
Ok, you made your point, what else didn't you like?
The forced comedy wasn't funny, at all.
But Anthony Hopkins was funny!
I haven't cringed so much since I watched the last Saw movie because of the horrible dialogue
Yeah, you definately have a point, was there anything you liked about the movie??
No, too long, too confusing, 14 year old girl running around with more cleavage than Megan Fox displayed......
Well, I still thought it was epic
Really, even though you agreed to all of my point?
Yeah, and remind me to never see a movie with you, you think too much
