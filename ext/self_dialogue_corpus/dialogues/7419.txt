I was watching a PBS documentary about Disney last night.
Oh yeah? Did you like it?
Yes. It showed clips of the different movies and saw clips of Dumbo.
Oh, I loved Dumbo!
He was so darned cute with those big eyes.
And he never spoke a word of dialogue in the whole movie.
True. Proof that emotions can be conveyed just through body language and eyes ... even when animated.
Dumbo is a little unusual as far as a Disney movie goes.
How so?
Most have a father raising a motherless child, but in Dumbo his mother was raising a fatherless child.
