Do you like Bruno Mars?
I used to really dislike that "Grenade" song. He has a good voice, though.
Have you heard anything he's released recently?
No, I didn't really like his older stuff so I have pretty much ignored it.
You have to listen to it.
Why? Is it good?
I don't know if you'd like it or not, but it's just funny how different it is from his old songs.
Different in what way?
It's seriously like a flashback to funkadelic music of the past.
What a weird decision on his part. That's cool though.
It kind of sounds like Parliament.
Well I'm definitely interested in checking it out now.
If you do, listen to the song "24K Magic".
That just sounds like a funkadelic song title.
Watch the video along with it. The whole thing is like a blast from the past.
It's actually cool he's changing it up a bit.
Yeah, music needs fresh ideas like that.
I honestly think he needed it too. He was a bit one-dimensional before.
Combine a really unique style with a really talented voice and it's going to be great.
I have to agree. A lot of artists have the voice, but don't stand out enough.
