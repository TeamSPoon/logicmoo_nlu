I never realized the Beatles were from Liverpool.
I knew they were English, but never knew what area.
Yeah they played in Liverpool and Hamburg in the early 1960's.
I think they got real popular around 1963.
I guess that's when Beatlemania started
Wonder when they came to the US?
I believe that was somewhere around 1964.
I guess that was the "British Invasion"
It's such a shame Lennon was killed.
Yeah they had some really great music ahead of them!
