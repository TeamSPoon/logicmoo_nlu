What was the first Disney movie you saw in the theater?
The Little Mermaid. I loved it!
Oh! My favorite character is Sebastian!
Yeah, he's great. I love the song "Kiss the Girl."
Me too! But, "Under the Sea" is my favorite.
Great song! My favorite character is Ursula.
You really like villains don't you?
Yep! Especially women villains.
Maybe it was seeing the movie that set you on that path.
Maybe!
