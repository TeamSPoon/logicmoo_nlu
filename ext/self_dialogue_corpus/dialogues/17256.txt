Hello.
Hi.
Do you like a lot of music?
Yeah sure.
Any kinds in particular?
I really enjoy going to see live shows and live music.
Oh okay cool.  Yeah I enjoy that as well.
It is great.
What do you like about live music?
I like the energy of it.  It is hard to duplicate that.
Yeah I know what you mean.  It is a great vibe.
Exactly.
Any bands in particular that you like seeing live?
They're not big named bands, just some local acts that I see regularly.
Oh that's cool.
Our local music scene is pretty good.
I wish it was like that where I lived.
Oh is it not good where you live?
No, nothing at all like that.
That stinks.
