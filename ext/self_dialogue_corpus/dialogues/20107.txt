So Kristy and I went to go see that one new movie last weekend.
Which one?
I can't think of the name of it; ya know, the one with Chris Pratt?
Oh yeah! Guardians of the Galaxy 2? How was it?
It was surprisingly decent, I didn't actually see the first one, though.
What do you mean you didn't see the first one? Why would you watch it?
Well, Kristy really wanted to see it and I figured it'd be a nice night out.  I'll probably watch the first one though.
Yeah, she's really into those comic book movies, isn't she?
Mhm, she is. She practically started drooling when the trailer for that "Logan" movie came out.
Of course, I thought that movie was pretty awesome myself.
We still haven't seen it. I think she's upset with me about it.
Well yeah, no kidding! That movie was great!
Dude I'm really not a fan of movies, but Doctor Strange? That movie was insane!
Man, that looked really good.
It was, we saw it when it released in 3D? I thought my head would explode!
I didn't watch it cuz it has that one actor... uh... Kidneystone Pumpkinpatch?
Been a Duck Cucumberbatch?
Yeah, the guy that played in Sherlock.
Well he actually did a good job. You need to watch it.
Sounds good, man.
