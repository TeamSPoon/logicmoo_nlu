Who are the greatest athletes to ever play in the NFL?
That's a tough question!
I know. But, some guys really stand out.
Like who?
Jim Thorpe was a pioneer for the league. And, many people consider him the greatest athlete ever.
True, but I think modern athletes would out perform him easily.
Who do you have in mind, then?
Bo Jackson is often mentioned.
I agree. Athletes that played multiple professional sports are truly special.
Do you know any others?
Athletes that played professionally in multiple sports?
Yes. I can think of only Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders.
Danny Ainge played baseball and basketball professionaly.
Wow, I didn't know that. Any others?
George Halas played pro baseball and pro football.
True, he was also one of the founders of the NFL.
That's impressive!
Paddy Driscoll had a similar career. He is also considered the best drop kicker in the history of the NFL.
Are drop kicks still allowed in the NFL?
Yes, Doug Flutie scored on one in 2006.
