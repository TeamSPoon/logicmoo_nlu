Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?
I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but I do like some of her songs.
What songs do you like?
Poker Face and Paparazzi.
Yea, those ones are really catchy.
Yea I don't listen to her enough to know of any of her less popular songs.
Yea same. All the songs I know from her are ones I've heard on the radio.
I will say though, after watching her halftime performance at the Super Bowl this year, I gained so much for respect for her.
Yea, like her singing was on point. I was surprised how good she sounded live.
Exactly. Sometimes you hear an artist on the radio and then you hear them live and it's such a disappointment.
