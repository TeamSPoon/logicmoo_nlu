So what do you think of classical music.
It's okay. I played a lot of it in band class.
Yeah we did in orchestra class too.
Really what were some of your favorite songs to play?
My favorite was "Ave Maria". What about you?
Mine was "Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring."
Really, why that one?
It was great. It was really complex to play on the clarinet because it went over the bridge.
Yes. I remember we had to move quickly with the bow when playing.
Yes and it has such a smooth sound to it.
Looks like we were both Bach fans.
Oh for sure. He was a great composer. One of the greatest we have had.
At least as far as classical for sure. He of course composed all his songs.
Not like today's artists. Some of them do but usually they have a group to revise them now.
Yeah. I really like the classic sounds of music like this.
Me too. Have you heard the electric violins playing some of these?
No. I did not know they had electric violins.
You should check out Lindsey Stirling. She is one of the best.
Really I will have to listen to her. What is a good song to listen to?
Check out "Stars Align." Not classical in nature but great for electric violin.
