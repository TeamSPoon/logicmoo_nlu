Have you watched the original series ?
Which  would  you  suggest ?
I really liked  return of the  jedi
Is that the  first one ?
No its more of the middle of  the  series  but it  fills in  alot of  holes
Thats one  with the original cast though  right
yes  and it does  show  yoda  as  just a  tad younger
Does it have  alot  of  droids in it  too
No it  focuses  on  more  R2  and  his part
So this was  all  beore  rouge one ?
