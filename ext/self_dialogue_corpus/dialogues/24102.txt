Have you sen the new Wonder Women movie?
Yes, I thought it was good.
It was definitely the best DC movie so far.
It gives me hope for the Justice League movie
I know what you mean.  I love the Justice League and scared they would screw it up.
But now I feel a little better about it.
Batman V Superman stunk.
It got worse each time I saw it.
What did you think of Suicide Squad?
Now that I actually thought was decent also.
I liked the different characters in it.
I thought Will Smith did a good job as always.
I thought Margo Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn.  I also liked that version on the joker.
It reminded me of the cartoon version.
I thought they nailed it, but read reviews that thought otherwise
You can never please everyone
I think Ben Afffick Is doing good as batman.
I think he is also
Deadpool was great, don't forget about that.
Ryan Renyolds killed IT IN Deadpool.  I can't wait for the next one.
