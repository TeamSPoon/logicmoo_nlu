Do you remember Empire Strikes Back
Oh yeah, the best one of the trilogy
Yeah, I liked how real it seemed
Yes, definitely went deep
Yoda, Darth Vader, snow base, cloud city. It had it all
Yes and don't forget Lando
Oh yeah, one of the greatest characters ever
Yeah, I liked Billy Dee Williams in that role
He was a traitor though
But then he came back in the end
