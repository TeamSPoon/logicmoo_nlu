You know I used to work in a video store right?
Yes I remember you saying you loved the job.
Yes it was great. The customers were fun and all the movies I had access to was so vast.
That would be a wonderful to get anything to watch and it's free.
One of my favorite things was each employee was asked to pick out two of their favorite movies and put the whole collection on display.
Do you remember what you chose?
Let's see  I am pretty sure one was Face/Off with John Travolta and Nicholas Cage.
Insane premise  to that movie but well done.
I don't recall anymore at the moment. We would change them out every once in a while.
Movies are fun to share with others. It lets people see another side of who you are in an indirect way.
This true. It was so easy a lot of times with my regular customers to know what  to give as a suggestion to watch.
It's too bad that video stores are pretty much all gone now.
Yeah it's kind of like how drive -in -movie theaters out side.
Those were so much fun and a great way to experience a movie.
My mom took me to see my first Elvis movie at the drive in.
Which one was it ? Do you remember?
I have seen all his movies but I am thinking it was one where he plays his cousin opposite of himself.
Kissin Cousins was the name of that one
Well call me surprised are you a closet Presley movie fan?
I am and proud of it!
