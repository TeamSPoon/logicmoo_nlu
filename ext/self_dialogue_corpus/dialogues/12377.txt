Which one of the Star Wars Movies is your favorite?
I really loved the new "Rogue One" movie.
I really liked that one, too. It seemed closer in tone to the original movies.
There weren't a lot of politics and superfluous stories like in episodes I-III.
Those weren't bad, but they just weren't like the originals. I know that most people prefer "Empire," but I'll always be a big fan of "Return of the Jedi."
Really, what do you like most about it?
I love the final battle scene outside of Endor and I think that the final confrontation between Luke and Vader is really dramatic and meaningful.
I see you're point. I'm an "Empire" guy myself, but "ROTJ" did have some great moments.
What do you like most about "Empire"?
I like how it puts the heroes' backs to the wall. It places them in really difficult situations and shows their vulnerabilities.
