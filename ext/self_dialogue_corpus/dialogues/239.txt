Have you seen any movies about super heroes lately?
Yes.  I recently saw the new movie Logan.
What did you think about the movie Logan?
I thought it was refreshing to see the character of Wolverine depicted without a strong supporting cast of X-Men.  I think Wolverine's personality is quite unique among heroes and deserves solo endeavors.
Did you like the new female character that was Logan's biological offspring?
I liked her somewhat, because she shares some of the same personality traits as Wolverine.
You keep mentioning Wolverine's personality.  Could you elaborate on that?
Well, Wolverine is a very wild, almost uncontrollable person.  But, he usually has moments where he can control himself and make strong positive contributions to himself, his team, and the world in general.
I see.  So you like that he could be perceived as a type of "wild card."
Sure.  Unpredictable actions in movies can make for a wide variety of interesting scenes and interactions.
