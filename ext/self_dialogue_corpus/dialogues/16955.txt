Do you like Dr. Dre much?
I haven't listen to him to be honest.
Not even a little bit?
Not that I can think of.
He's older stuff is pretty good.
Yeah I heard his new album isn't too great.
Yeah I wasn't a fan.
What songs do you like?
Anything off of The Chronic is good to listen to.
Okay cool I'll check that out.
Even his album The Next Episode is pretty good.
Is that the one with Forgot about Dre?
Yup that's the one.
Okay I've heard of that song.
Yeah that one is really good.
Doesn't it have Eminem on there as well?
Yup he oes a verse and the chorus.
I bet they sound good together.
They do! Have a listen to the album.
Alright I definitely will!
