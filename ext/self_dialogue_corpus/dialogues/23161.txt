Did you ever see Django Unchained?
Yes. Loved it!
Yeah I thought it was pretty good as well.
Great acting and loved the revenge story line.
Yeah, Quentin Tarantino flick. Always have a revenge them.
I'll admit, some of the scenes were a little brutal.
Oh yeah, there was that scene where the two black guys wrestle each other to the death.
Yeah, and then when they have Django strung up upside down.
Oh, that was a tough one to watch.
Fortunately Django comes out on top at the end.
Yeah, I was sorry to see his German friend die though.
Oh, Christoph Waltz's character
Yeah, that's the one. I would've liked to see him survive.
Well not all the good guys can win.
At least he took care of Leo's character.
Yeah, he was pretty ruthless.
I think Waltz won an Academy Award for his role in Django.
I think you're right.
Such a good actor.
Yes, I agree
