Did you know they are remaking Dumbo?
No, I did not know that.
Yes it is going to be a real life version.
That's cool, I loved Dumbo. Do you know who is in it?
I know eva green, and danny devito.
They are both enjoyable to watch should be interesting.
yes, I just hope they don't ruin it.
Well the animated disney version will always exist. they can't change that masterpiece.
Good way to look at it the disney original is always rewatchable.
That it is. I love the baby mine song, wonder if they will include any of the original music in the remake.
