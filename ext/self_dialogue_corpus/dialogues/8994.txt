Have you ever heard of the Strokes?
I absolutely have! They are one of my favorite rock bands.
Are they coming out with a new album anytime soon?
I hope so! They had an EP that came out last year and I heard they are recording a new album right now.
Reptilia was such a good song. I hope they have another track like that on their next release.
I hope so too. I am sure that Albert Hammond Jr. has been working hard on new songs.
Is he the frontman of the band?
He certainly is. He is the singer. He also produces music for other bands.
That's really cool. I bet that he is an excellent producer because of all that he knows about songwriting.
You're probably right. I am sure the bands that he works with are lucky to have him.
