Doesn't that guy over there kind of remind you of that guy from Mulan?
General Li Shang? Yea, I can see it a little.
I just picture him singing "How could I make a man out of you!"
I love that song! And the whole montage where Mulan got her act together... Amazing!
Yes! I feel like she was the first Disney heroine I could really relate to.
Except impersonating a soldier and having to present yourself in front of a matchmaker!
True, but that would have definitely been me if I was in her shoes. I'm such a clutz!
She was in trouble from the start though. The matchmaker was not a pleasant woman.
Well like Grandma said, "Who spit in her bean curd?"
My sentiments exactly!
