Did you ever have to watch a movie for school that you ended up liking?
Yeah, last semester we had to watch Apollo 13.
You never saw that before a few months ago?
Nope. I've never been too big into movies.
So you really liked it?
Yeah, it was great. I loved Tom Hanks in it.
I saw it but forget most of the plot.
It's just about the Apollo 13 space mission and how they all almost died.
Yeah, I know. But the specifics are lost on me.
I'd say like 40% of the movie took place in the shuttle.
Yeah, with them trying to figure out what to do.
Yeah. Come to think of it, it was a bit boring because of that.
I wished it was more suspensful.
It still had some suspense, but not as much as I thought it was going to have.
Looking at the effects in the movie shows how far tech has come.
They were really bad.
They were, which made it enjoyable to me.
How so?
Just thinking about how people back then thought those were amazing effects made it cooler for me to watch.
Oh, I get it.
