What do you think about the penalties the refs call?
I think the refs do the best they can but they inevitably get some wrong
I would have to agree with you on that
Sometimes the referees determine the entire outcome of the game
Yeah that is the worst thing in my opinion
I think they call penalties a little too much
I agree, they should lay off the whistle a little bit
They are trying to make the game safer though
I feel like it really isn't working all the well though
Yeah, a lot of big name players still get hurt from illegal plays every year
I feel bad for those players
Luckily though, some get to rest with their millions of dollars
It still doesn't make it fair though because they are losing money
Yeah that is true, I wonder if they recieve workman's compensation
They probably get free medical care from their team
They certainly do
I hate it when coaches lie about player injuries so that they can play
It's selfish and irresponsible
I hope the league moves toward a more technology based method of detecting penatlies
And I hope those changes reduce the amount of injuries in the league.
