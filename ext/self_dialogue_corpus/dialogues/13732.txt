Lady Gaga's video TELEPHONE is cool.
I like the big black hat she wears.
I think that is when she got bailed out of prison.
And she wears that CRIME SCENE tape when she is in her cell.
I like when she is in the prison yard.
She has those cigarette glasses.
She was rich in prison.
Her yellow hair telephone was the best.
But everyone got poisoned.
She was bad that day.
