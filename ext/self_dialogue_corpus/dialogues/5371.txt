Ever catch Disney's Into the Woods?
Sure. It was really good.
With actresses I hadn't known could sing!
Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep, and Chris Pine!
It was a lot like the Broadway musical.
I really liked the story.
All the music was good too.
Some of the plot twists were really unexpected.
Chris Pine was a little goofy in his role.
Definitely not his usual role. Anna Kendrick was precious.
