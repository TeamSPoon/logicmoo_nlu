I just saw the best movie!
What did you watch?
King Arthur:  Legend of the Sword
What did you like about it?
It's hard to describe.  It just seemed to have dry humor mixed with lots of action.
Who is in that movie?
Jude Law plays the bad guy.  It also has Charlie Hunnam, I think his name is.  Eric Bana is also in it, but his brother kills him early in the movie.
Poor Eric Bana.  He should stop playing the part of the brother.  He died in Troy too.
That's funny, I didn't even think about that.
Wasn't Charlie Hunnan originally supposed to be in 50 Shades of Grey?
I think I heard that.
I love Jude Law as an actor.  He was great in Sherlock Holmes.
Yeah, he's great.  King Arthur is also a Guy Ritchie movie?
Who is Guy Ritchie?
He was the director of the Sherlock Holmes movies.
That makes a lot of sense.
You should definitely go see the King Arthur movie.  It's been out for a while now, so the theater shouldn't be too crowded.
I will check it out.
It's a great story.
I like the legend.
