What do you think of Lorde's new album?
Melodrama? I like it.
Did you see it beat out 2 Chainz?
I did. I can't beleive it.
I don't like that 20 minute song
Yeah that was a weird move.
I like sober though
yeah that is a good track
I still don't my royals but i know some people hated it.
I always liked it too.
