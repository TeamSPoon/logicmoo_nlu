Who gave the best performance in The Usual suspects?
For me hands down Kevin Spacey.
He was good. But I preferred Stephen Baldwin.
McManus was a good character but SPacey's acting blows his out of the water.
Benicio Del Toro was also brilliant in this film.
I feel like he is always great.
True, I can't think of a role I thought he did poorly in.
Agreed. He looks so much like brad pitt to me too.
I never made that connection or comparison before, but I think you are correct.
They could be brothers from a different mother. so similar when you look at them side by side.
