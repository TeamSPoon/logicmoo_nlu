Did you have a favorite football team growing up?
Yeah, the Minnesota Vikings. I liked to their quarterback, Fran Tarkenton.
Was there a particular game that you remember more than any other?
Yeah, the Heidi bowl. Something I'll never forget.
Never heard of it, what was the Heidi bowl?
A game on TV between the Raiders and the Jets.
Why did they call it the Heidi bowl?
65 seconds left, and NBC switched from the game to the movie Heidi.
Did they think the game was over?
Yeah, but Oakland scored twice in the last nine seconds, giving them a 43 to 32 lead.
Is that how the game ended?
Yeah, the viewers were outraged when they found out that they had missed such a spectacular ending.
I'll bet that never happened again!
Nope. The network executives learned to never again leave a live football game in progress.
What type of game was it? Was it exciting?
By the last minute, the lead had changed eight times.
But, why did it run out of time?
Because of such intensity, there was an unusual amount of penalties and timeouts.
Did it ever happen again?
Shortly after, a clause was inserted into the TV contracts that all games would be broadcast completely.
