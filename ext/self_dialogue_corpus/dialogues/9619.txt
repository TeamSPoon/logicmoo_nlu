What was the name of the girl in TLC that did the rapping?
Left Eye?
Yeah, her.  Didn't she die?
Yeah, like ten or fifteen years ago.
That's what I thought.  What had happened?
She got into a car accident in South America or somewhere.
That's a shame.  She was really talented.
Yeah, she kind of opened the door for a lot of female rappers.
Yeah, she was probably a role model to a lot of stars now.
I'm sure she was.
