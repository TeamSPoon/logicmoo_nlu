Do you like Robert Diniro?
I love him.
So many great movies.
He's been in a ton.
Taxi Driver was crazy.
It was wild. I think that was 1976.
It was 1976. Fantastic role.
Raging Bull was phenomenal also.
Was it ever. I forgot about that one.
What about Goodfellas? Another classic movie.
Hard to believe how many he's had.
It is hard to believe.
Not to mention of course,The Godfather II.
Wow,no kidding.
Amazing career he's had.
I love his comedies too.

That's just a few.
