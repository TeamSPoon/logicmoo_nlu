What's the best action movie you have seen in the 10 years.
That would have to be Crank. That movie was constant action.
I would have to agree with you. It was non-stop from the beginning to the end.
There were quite a bit of memorable scenes in that movie.
Jason Stathum has got to be one of the best action movie stars today.
He has been in a lot of good ones. I wouldn't expect to see him in a romantic comedy anytime soon.
Are there any other action movies that stick out to you.
Definitely, I really like the Die Hard movies.
Some people consider the original Die Hard to be a Christmas movie. That is funny.
I don't know about it being a Christmas movie, but it is one of the all-time best action movies.
