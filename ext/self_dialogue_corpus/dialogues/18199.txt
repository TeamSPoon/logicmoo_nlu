What is your favorite Cartoon theme song?
I have too many to name.
Well, pick one. Mine is the original Pokemon theme song.
Okay, mine would have to be The Weekenders.
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that show.
Listen to the theme song and you'll remember how great it is.
I do remember. So many memories.
Cartoon theme songs are the best.
Theme songs for hour long shows and sitcoms are important, but not as important as cartoon ones.
I agree. I'm not sure why, though.
It probably has something to do with the way kids get addicted to them or something.
I doubt that. But cartoon songs are always more memorable than regular shows for some reason.
Yeah, I can remember all the jingles and lyrics of at least 50 cartoons.
Same here. Not so much with regular shows.
Now I just want to listen to old theme songs.
Same here. I want to feel the nostalgia.
I'll listen to The Weekenders again, you listen to Pokemon
I don't need to, its still fresh in my head.
Yeah, everyone remembers those Lyrics.
Of course.
