What movie did you see this weekend?
Wonder Woman, it was great.
You hadn't seen it yet? It's so good.
No I didn't! It was awesome.
Yeah, it's so good. Did you know Gal Gadot was pregnant while filming some of it?
What? That's crazy, how did she do that?
I have no idea. I think they used a green screen to edit out the baby bump or something.
Wow, the technology they have for films these days is insane.
I know! The special effects in the film are super good all around.
You're right, and Themyscira looks so amazing, I wish it were real.
I know, me too. It's awesome that Wonder Woman is literally part goddess.
Yeah! It's great they kept her whole backstory like in the comics.
For sure, it's super cool that she's not just a random person like some superheroes.
Yeah I agree, she really has it all.
None of the other superheroes are nearly as cool.
Yeah, have they already said they're making a second movie?
I think they're writing it now!
Great, I can't wait to see it already.
Me neither, if the first is anything to go by.
Wonder Woman is the best.
