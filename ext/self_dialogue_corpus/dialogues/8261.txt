Do you like Maroon 5?
Absolutely.  They are one of my favorite bands.
Every album has such great songs.  'Songs about Jane' was one of my favorite albums.
I think one thing that I wish they didn't do was collaborate with so many hip-hop artists.
I like those collaborations.  'Don't Wanna Know' featuring Kendrick was so good.
That one I didn't mind, but 'Cold' featuring Future was weak in my opinion.
I have mixed feelings about that one.
I think overall, Maroon 5's sound is already good as is, and the majority of rappers they featured have not added value to the song.
Who do you think is the biggest culprit of this?
I severely disliked Wiz Khalifa's feature in 'Stereo Hearts' because not only was the rapping underwhelming, but the language and tempo just didn't fit.
