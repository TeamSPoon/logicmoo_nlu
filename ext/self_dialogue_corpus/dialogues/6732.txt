It seems to me like DIsney is out of good ideas for movies.
Why do you say that?
Because of all the remakes they're coming out with.
Oh, I see. I wondered about that too.
Do you like any of them?
Beauty and the Beast was OK if you ignore the music.
I haven't seen it yet. What's wrong with the music?
Lots and lots of auto tune.
Is Emma Watson a good singer?
No. If she were why would they auto tune her?
