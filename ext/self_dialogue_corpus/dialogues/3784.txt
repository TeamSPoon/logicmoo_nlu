What was the first thriller movie you ever saw?
Does Beetlejuice count?
I guess. I mean really thriller thriller though.
Hm. Probably Nightmare on Elm Street.
Me too. Or Friday the thirteenth.
Yeah. Lot's of 80's slashers. Halloween was the scariest.
Oh that mask and the slow pace and the music!
I really like all the new clever horror movies though.
YEah cabin in the woods is fantastic
For sure. I love that film.
