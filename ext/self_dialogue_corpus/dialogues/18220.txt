I wonder what ever happened to Ja Rule.
I don't know.
Do you like any of his music?
He has a few songs that I like.
I like the song that he did with Ashanti.
Which one? You know they did a couple of songs together.
I like that one Always on Time.
That thing was fire. When did that song come out?
I think that was around 2000.
Yeah, that's when he was hot and so was that dude with the band-aid on his face.
You talking about Nelly?
Yeah, that's him. What was his hit that all the women liked?
He had that song Hot In Here.
That song used to come on and all the women would lose their minds.
Their minds and their clothes...I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off.
I know right.
He had the whole summer on smash.
You know that's right. He ain't really made no fire since then.
He had a few joints but nothing that really sticks out.
Yeah, thank God for the internet, we can hear his banger on demand.
