What is your favorite Disney movie?
I'd have to say Pocahontas.
Really, out of all the movies? Why?
I just really like the story and her sidekick raccoon.
My favorite part of that movie is the talking willow tree.
Yeah! She was so wise.
I wonder if they will ever remake that movie.
I'm not sure, maybe they will do a live version.
I can't see a remake being as good as the original.
Honestly, neither can I.
