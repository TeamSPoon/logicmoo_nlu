I remember Linda Blair in the Exorcist movie.
Yeah, it was kind of like "Jaws" at church wasn't it?
What? No it more like Lon Chaney when he played the original Werewolf.
Oh you are talking about special effects. Did you see Tarintino's from Dusk Til Dawn with George Clooney?
Masterful effects that put you in mind of Rod Sterling's "Twilight Zone" didn't it?
Twilight Zone epidsodes played tricks on your mind like the epidsode "To Serve Man."
I saw that. Dick York, Burgress Meredith and Elizabeth Montgomery all starred in that epidsode.
I don't think all three of them was in it but Twilight Zone was a career launching pad for many stars.
Can you name any stars that appeared in Twilight Zone" Episodes?
Adam West, Jack Klugman, Tony Randall and William Shatner from the "Star Trek" enterprise.
