Things just don't feel right in my life unless its football season, how about you?
Uh yeah I live in Texas we eat breathe and sleep football here
Oh wow Texas huh?  So are you a Cowboys fan?
No actually I like the Cowboys but my family comes from Ohio, and I have grown up a Browns fan
Haha, oh sorry to hear that, Lol
Yeah I know its been rough, but they are rebuilding
They haven't had a good team since the Bernie Kosar Years in the mid 80's
Thats true but they have had a lot of draft picks recently and we feel optimistic that things will change under head coach Hugh Jackson.
Do you go to a lot of games?
I've been to about 10 NFL games in my whole life, including Browns staudium, soldier field and NRG Stadium
Nice, I've been to five games, all in Kansas City where we live.
Do you own a lot of Kansas city Chiefs memorabilia like jerseys and clothes?
Yes I do.   Do you think the NFL is more popular than ever?
I really do, I feel like NFL gets better TV ratings than any other sport and the super bowl is like a national holiday
Do you think ticket prices are too expensive?
Its pretty expensive to attend a game especially when you factor in other costs like parking and food, and uh, .... beer!
DId you hear that Las Vegas is getting a team
Yes I think its very cool that the Oakland Raiders are moving there, how exciting NFL football In Vegas!
It was nice chatting man, I will look for you on TV when I see the Chiefs playing at HOme :)
For sure you to, and GO BROWNS BABY!!!
