Celtics will get the first pick in the draft.
Oh really? Any word on who the might select?
Either Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball from what I've heard.
Cool. Who got 2nd dibs?
The Lakers.
I bet the Knicks pick 3rd right?
Nope. They're 8th.
What? I thought they'd be in the top five atleast.
The Celtics only had a 25% chance of being first.
I didn't expect them to have first pick with those odds.
The Nets will make two first-round selections at picks 22 and 27.
Good for them I guess.
Guess which team rounded out the bottom.
The Bulls?
No, they're 24th in line.
What about Orlando?
25th. You're getting closer.
I give up? Who is it?
The Jazz.
That's surprising.
