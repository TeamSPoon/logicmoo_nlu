Lion king or Aladdin? Which is better to you?
Aladdin loved robin williams genie. you?
I have to go with Lion  King.
Why is that?
Well a lot of disney films are based on fairy tales, Lion King was an original story.
I did not know that, pretty cool.
Also the elton john song, can you feel the love tonight is so good.
That was a good song, won an oscar I think.
I know it was nominated not sure if it won.
Either way that was a powerful  and popular song.
