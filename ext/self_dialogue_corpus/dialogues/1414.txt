Who do you think are the top four favorites for the Superbowl?
If I had to pick four I would say #1, obviously the Patriots.
Obvious, but tell me why.
Same amazing squad year, and added Cooks, Gronk back to full health.
I can't disagree with that one, they were dominant last year, and only got better.
Barring Injury, lock for the one seed, and lock for the AFC championship game.
Who is #2?
For #2 I would have to go with the Cowboys, but I am not as strong as this one.
Whys that?
Between the #2 and #6 teams, it iust a lot more close, but I'd go with the Cowboys.
Yea the cowboys were great this year, still have an amazing line, and Prescott and Zeke should only be better.
#3 would be the Falcons, offensively dominant team. Julio, Ryan, great backfield.
I might disagree you with you there and say the PAckers.
The Packers are my #4 team.
Ok I'll take that.
#5 is the Seahawks, the D is still strong, and the offense is improved.
Yea, It seems we both agree that the top half of the NFL is NFC dominant right now.
Absolutely. #6 would even be the Giants after the Marshall pick up, that is really going to provide an open field for both himself, and Odell.
Manning is likely to put up superb fantasy numbers.
I would def. agree with that.
