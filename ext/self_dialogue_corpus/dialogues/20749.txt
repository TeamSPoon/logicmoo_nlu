Recently I saw a private screening of a new film In Search of Fellini.
Oh really, how did that happen?
My colleagues invited me to the film.
What was it about?
A girl who is socially awkward who gets enthralled with a movie make Fellini.
Oh yeah.  What happens?
Well, she travels to Italy
What kind of adventures does she have there and what actress?
Maria Bella and boys, art and movies.
Socially awkward, huh?
Yes, she is 20 and never had a job.
That's rough
Yes and she can barely talk to people.
This sounds depressing?
Yes, in parts it is.  But it's actually an incredible film.
Is that right?
The girl finds out a lot about the meaning of life through this incredible journey.
Does she ever come home?
Well actually she never left.  It was all in her mind.
Mind is blown!
