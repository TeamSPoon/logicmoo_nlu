Do you like Ariana Grande?
She's okay but she does have an amazing voice.
In my opinion, she's the vocalist of our generation.
I may have to agree with you on that, she has a really good voice.
I genuinely think that she's also a good person that cares about her fans.
She seems like the type. Do you have any favorite songs?
One of my personal favorites the way in which she collaborated with Mac Miller.
I like that song too! my favorite would have to be Dangerous woman.
That song makes me feel good about myself.
I know exactly what you mean!
I think her latest album was really good.
She's a great performer too.
You seem like you like her more than I thought.
Ya, im a fan of her.
We should totally go and see her in concert one day I would love that.
That would be so much fun I wish.
Do you have any other song recommendations?
I would suggest honeymoon avenue. I don't know why but its been a favorite for a really long time.
I'll make sure to give it a listen.
Let me know how you like it.
