So what are you doing this summer?
I'm going to see Poison at DTE music theater.
Wow, sounds fun!  So you're really into that 80's rock then?
Yeah, big time.  Those bands always put on a great show.
What did you think about the '90s alternative grunge rock?
It was okay, it didn't grab me like the '80s hair bands did though.
It was a shift away from that pop-metal or melodic hard rock, I will have to admit.
Yes it was; it was sort of depressing by comparison.
Yeah, some people have said that.
I don't mean any disrespect though, those band undoubtedly had skills and whatnot.
