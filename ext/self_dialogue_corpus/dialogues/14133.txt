remember when lady gaga wrote a song called paper gangsta?
oh my god. not even gangster?
nope!
oh my god wait, i remember now. it's one of her older songs, right?
yup!
she's so embarassing
she really is. she literally says stinkin' lincoln. what does that even mean?
such a terrible rhyme!
i can't believe she's that kind of white person.
honestly? i can.
