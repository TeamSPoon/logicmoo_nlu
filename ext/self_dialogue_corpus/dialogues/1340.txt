Besides the Patriots, who do you think wins the AFC?
I think the Broncos have a great chance.
I'm worried about their quarterback.
With their defense, as long as their QB doesn't make mistakes they will be good.
Who do you think wins the QB job in Denver?
I think Lynch will win it. He's got more talent.
I also like Jamal Charles.
Wasn't he hurt most of last year?
Yeah, but he can come back in a as a spot starter and be solid.  He adds a speed dimension to that offense.
Agree, but the Chiefs are still in their division. They are going to be tough.
Agree and love their defense, but you can't win with Alex Smith.
Alex Smith is decent, but he's not a game changer.
What about the Ravens?
Forgot about them, they have a decent defense and love Flacco.
Flacco is an underrated QB.
Agree, for a guy who's won a Super Bowl and played in big time games - he doesn't get the respect he deserves
Of course, none of this matters because the Patriots will win it all this year.
I'm seriously thinking they will go undefeated.
If they do, they will be know as the greatest franchise in NFL history!
Agreed!
