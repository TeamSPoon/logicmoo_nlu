So let me ask you, which conference do you think is stronger: AFC or NFC?
NFC. It has so many strong teams. Packers, Cowboys, Giants, Seahawks, Cardinals....
What? ! I think it's the AFC. It has the Patriots and the Broncos!
Yea, and those are two great teams compared to many great teams in the NFC.
AFC has won the last three Super Bowls.
Yeah, but in the last four Super Bowls, AFC has only sent two different teams.
I guess that is a fair point.
And if you look at the last 10 Super Bowls, NFC has sent 8 different teams, AFC only 5 different teams.
Both conferences are even on Super Bowl wins for those last 10 Super Bowls, though: 5 each.
Yeah. The top AFC teams - Patriots and Broncos - are super strong teams.
What do you think makes them able to stay so strong over multiple years?
At least in the case of the Patriots, they are a very steady team. Same coach, same QB, year in and year out.
Bill Belichick is a very smart coach, yeah. He knows how to manage a team.
He's probably the greatest head coach in NFL history, to be honest.
Which is really saying something when the NFL has had coaches like Lombardi, Landry, Walsh, Shula and Noll.
So you add Belichick together with Tom Brady...
Who is without question the greatest quarterback of all time.
Agreed. You add them together and you have a strong leadership for the team that other players can believe in.
They definitely seem to have a winning attitude around them.
They believe they can win, they work hard towards doing so, and it pays off for them. Absolutely.
