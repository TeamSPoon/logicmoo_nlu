Do you think it's hard coaching in the NFL?
Of course. And for so many reasons too.
What kind of reasons?
You're not coaching children, you're coaching grown men who sometimes act like children.
Haha, that doesn't sound too hard.
You have to defend all the plays you call to reporters who twist your words around.
That doesn't sound very fun.
You have to take the blame sometimes for players just not performing how they should.
Why would they do that?
Because a coach is a leader.
I thought the quarterback was the leader?
They're both leaders. The coach is just a more off screen leader.
It sounds complicated.
I think so too.
I don't think I would want to be an NFL coach.
I don't think I would want to either. It's a lot of work.
What happens if you can't do all the things expected of you?
You get fired and they start over with a new coach and try again.
That sounds a little harsh.
NFL coaching can be very harsh.
