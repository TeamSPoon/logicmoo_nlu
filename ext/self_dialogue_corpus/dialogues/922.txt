How exited are you for the nfl season to start.
I cant wait
I hope the Stelers do well this year.
I agree i love teasing my husband about how great they are compared to the Saints.
I do that i remind everyone how Big Ben is a awsome quarter back while Drew Brees is a baby.
My husband gets so mad about it every year.
Mine wagers a bet with me that the Saints will go further then the Steelers.
Well hes been losong a lot then.
He was so disappointed last year when the Steelers went to the playoffs.
I hoped you rubbed it in that the Saints didnt even make it to the play offs
I did he had to pay up and take me ot to dinner and a movie.
i need to start that with my hubby.
Hey i heard that Ben Rothensberger had lost several fingers in a fourth of July fireworks accident.
I read that online but it was a false story.
Oh i had been so worried he has had so many problems in the past.
I know but that story was a fake there was no official statement and it was later stated that it was a false story.
I think we should see if we can make a game this year
It would be nice to go back to Pittsburgh i could show you where i lived before i come down here.
We could make a weekend of it.
Il  will see if they have the schdule and ticket prices up yet.
