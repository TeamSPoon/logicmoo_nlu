Will the Lions ever win with Matt Stafford?
I think its crazy but no.
Do you think hes just an average quarterback?
I dont but he hasnt shown hes a leader
You dont think its just a franchise thing?
Part of me thinks it is because they have had no luck
They had chances to win early on but Jim Schwartz did not know how to coach
I think thats evident in his time as DC in Philly
Yeah and so I think they wasted his prime years
Hes not awful he did throw for 5000 yards in one season
I would rather have Matt Ryan
What about Jameis Winston?
I think hes the next big quarterback in the NFL
Yeah I tend to echo that same sentiment.
Do you think he can be an MVP?
Yes and maybe even this year.
He has a lot of weapons now.
The addition of Desean Jackson is going to help him immensely.
Just have to hope Doug Martin can stay healthy
I doubt they are counting on that
