Did you see Doctor Strange?
No it looked horrible.
Yeah it was not all that great.
Will he be in the Infinity War movie?
I cant see them doing that, the movie wasnt like that.
So they struck out on this one?
Yeah because the movie was so strange.
Im glad I skipped it.
It was almost as weird as Thor.
Thats another character that doesnt need a film.
