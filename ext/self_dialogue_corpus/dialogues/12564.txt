Hey, I heard this week that Hayden Christensen and his wife decided not to tell their child that he was Darth Vader.
Really, that's strange.  I would tell everyone that I was Vader.
Me too!  But apparently, they don't want their child to connect him to one of the most villainous characters of all time.
I guess I can agree with that.  But I would still want to say the occasional, "I am your father," in Vader's voice to my kid.
I agree.  That would be cool.
Hayden Christensen always seemed to reject his connection to Star Wars, so I'm not super surprised.
People didn't like the way he portrayed Anakin in Episode's 2 & 3, but I thought he was good.
I think he was good too. But his chemistry with Nataie Portman was non-existent.
That's true.  There was no chemistry, and it kind of took away from the films.
Natalie Portman had more chemistry with Ewan Macgregor.
