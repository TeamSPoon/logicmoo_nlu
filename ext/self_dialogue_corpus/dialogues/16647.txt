Do you like to listen to music pretty regularly?
Yeah, I listed to music all the time. Sometimes I watch the music videos that go with the songs.
Hey yeah, me too. I like going on Youtube and listening to songs while watching music videos...if there is one for the song that is.
What kinds of music are you in to?
I mainly like rock, rap/hip hop, and pop, but I listen to a lot of different bands. How about you?
I'm mostly the same, but I really like punk rock.
What punk bands do you like?
Mostly bands that have been around for a while like Green Day, Blink 182, and Sum41.
Oh cool, yeah I like those bands too. Do you like going to concerts?
Yeah, but I don't get a chance too very often. How about you, what was your most recent concert?
I went to go see the Rolling Stones. It was pretty awesome.
Oh cool. Were they good?
Yeah, definitely. They're old, but they can still play and they sound really good in concert.
Cool, the last concert I went to was actually a music festival. I went to Bonnaroo.
Oh yeah, I've heard of that. I've never been but I've had multiple friends go in the past.
Yeah, it's crazy fun with a ton of good music. It's hot because it's in the middle of summer and outside, but the experience is awesome.
What bands/artists did you see there? Which were your favorite?
I think my two favorite shows by far were Pearl Jam and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. They were both awesome sets for different reasons.
I'm familiar with both of those groups. I think I would've like to have seen them.
Yeah, you should go. They have the festival every summer in Tennessee.
