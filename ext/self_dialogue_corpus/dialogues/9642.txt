Man what happened to Three Six Mafia?
They are still around, just individually.
Juicy J is one crazy fool.
Yes, he's had many hits such as his classic "Suck a.."
Ok, I get the point.  He's vulgar, but people love it.
He has made more money than the others who were part of the loose collective know as Hypnotize Minds.
Did you happen to like Project Pat?
Oh yeah, when Pat comes on, everyone loses it.
I agree.  It's like people know every word when they are fans.
Yes, I have met Project Pat fans from all over.
