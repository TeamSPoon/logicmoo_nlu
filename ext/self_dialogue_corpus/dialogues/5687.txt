Did you see the movie Freaky Friday?
Which one?
With Lindsay Lohan
Oh yeah I saw it, it was good.
Did you know that Lohan didnt want that role?
No I dont think thats true
Well Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job.
She is a good actress to be honest.
She seemed a bit out of place for that.
It was a funny cute family film
