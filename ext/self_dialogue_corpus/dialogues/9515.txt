Did you see that Faith Evans is touring again?
Wow. I can't believe she's still preforming.
I know, I always liked her. It was so sad when Biggie died.
You could tell that she was truly heart broken.
Her new album is all duets that her and Biggie did.
Oh wow, that's so cool. What is it called?
The album is called Legacy. She sings about what their life was and what it could have been.
I really need to listen to that, that sounds really cool.
You can also watch videos of her on YouTube explaining each track and what happened.
I'm going to look that up right now. Thanks for telling me!
