What are some fairy tales that Disney missed?
Little red riding hood, Jack and the Beanstalk-
Wait, they are actually animating that one.
Really, now?
Yes, it's going to be called Gigantic.
When is it coming out?
2018, I believe.
Wow, can't wait. 2D or 3D?
3D animation I think, don't know much about the plot though.
I guess we will have to wait to find out.
