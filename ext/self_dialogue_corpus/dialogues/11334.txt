Do you like covers of the Beattles songs?
Usually I don't.  Where you thinking of something in particular?
Have you heard Amy Winehouse's covers?
I heard a couple. She did a good job but it's still not the same.
Are there any covers you like?
I think the only one I really like was Judy Collin's version of In My Life.
I ilke that one too.  I also really like Motown sings the Beattles.
Oh, I don't like that one at all.
But, I don't like Bette Midler's versions.
I agree.
