Did you see the new Bridget Jones movie?
The one about her baby?
Bridget Jones' Baby, yes.
No, are all the other actors in it?
The sort of replaced Hugh Grant.
Good, his character was always so mean to her.
Did you think Colin Firth did a good rendition of Darcy?
I actually loved when he played the real Darcy.
In what movie?
In Pride and Prejudice.
I did not even know he played the real one before.
Yes, that is why he was sort of perfect for the roll in Bridget Jones.
Did you like the other ones?
I loved the first Bridget Jones movie.
They were some of the funnest rom-coms I have ever seen.
Yes, I wish they would make more movies like that.
I always thought the film, "The Holiday" was similar.
Is that the one where they switch homes and countries?
With Cameron Diaz and Jack Black.
That movie was so cute and romatic.
