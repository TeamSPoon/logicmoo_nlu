Did you hear that The Lumineers finally came out with a new album?
They did? It feels like their first came out forever ago.
It was a long gap. The new one's called "Cleopatra."
Cleopatra? Have you listened to it yet?
I have.
And? Any good?
I like it, but, I don't know, I think I liked their first album better.
That's too bad. Why don't you like the new one as much.
It's not bad or anything, I think it's just that I really loved the first album.
So what's the problem?
Well, my expectations were probably too high going in.
I get that. That happened to me with the last Decemberists album.
Right, sometimes looking forward to something for too long ruins it.
It's really too bad.
That said, I still think you should buy a copy.
Really?
Yeah, I may have been disappointed, but I still think it was a good album.
Hmm. Well, maybe I'll listen to it on Spotify or something first.
That sounds like a good plan.
That's what I'll do then.
