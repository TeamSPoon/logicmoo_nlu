What movies should every one watch before they die?
There are some dramas I think every one needs to see.
Like which ones would you say?
Well, there is the movie Citizen Kane.
Is that the one that ends with the word "Rosebud"?
Yeah, it shows his whole life.
That one was like a reverse it is a Wonderful Life.
Speaking of, that is another one every one should watch.
I seen it, I liked the trope it has.
Yes, the whole how better the world is due to their life.
And the plucky angel.
I love a plucky sidekick movie.
Are there any others you would say?
One should watch Princess Bride as well, it is perfection.
I seen that several times. It reminds me of the Never Ending Story.
That is a real classic fantasy.
I think everyone should see the older film Seven Samuria.
That one really changed the way Western people see Japanese films.
I like that and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
That was an action packed work of art.
