If you had to pick, Nsync or Backstreet Boys?
I am totally an Nsync fan!
Boo...I'm BSB for sure! Nick was so handsome.
So was Justin Timberlake! His curls and his vocals were the best!
Okay, I guess you're right. I did really like 'Bye Bye Bye.'
Oh my, see! You are a secret fan! That song is the best.
Okay, I guess I am!
I loved 'It's Gonna be Me' and 'Gone.'
Those songs were such a hit back then!
Definitely made me cry!
Ok my turn, what's your favorite BSB song?
If I had to pick it has to be 'Larger Than Life.'
That song was awesome! I think mine would be 'Everybody.'
Everyone knows that song! All the Millenials for sure.
Haha, so true. I also liked 'Quit Playing Games.' It was so upbeat.
I concur, that song was stuck in my head for awhile back then.
It's so catchy!
Sometimes, I still secretly listen to them...
I knew it! It's ok, I do too.
Haha we're so awesome.
