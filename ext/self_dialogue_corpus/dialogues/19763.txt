So I went to see the Flaming Lips the other night.
Awesome. Did they play a lot of stuff from the new album?
Maybe three or four songs. When they played "There Should Be Unicorns," Wayne came out into the crowd riding a giant mechanical unicorn while singing.
I'm not surprised. He always does weird stuff live.
Absolutely. He got in the bubble too, and covered Bowie's "Space Oddity."
How was that?
They definitely did Bowie justice. I cried.
Do you remember that time we saw them and they turned off all the lights and had the crowd point laser pointers at a giant mirror?
Of course! That was when they were on tour after At War with the Mystics came out.
I've never been a huge fan of that album, honestly.
Yeah, I mean, it's not as good as Yoshimi or The Soft Bulletin, but it has some good songs. I love "The W.A.N.D."
I like that one too. The "Yeah Yeah Yeah Song" is pretty fun to sing along with too.
What do you think of the last two or three albums?
I don't really know what to think. They're good, but they don't really keep my attention.
I know what you mean. They're mostly instrumental and not as catchy. I think they're meant to be played live.
I guess I can see that. They've definitely changed a lot since they first got famous in the 90s.
For sure. I think I was in eighth grade when "She Don't Use Jelly" came out.
Yeah, I was in high school. I remember thinking I'd never heard anything like that before.
Do you remember the video?
You mean the one where the girl's in the bathtub with a bunch of fried eggs? How could I forget?
