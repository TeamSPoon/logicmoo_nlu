Yes the butterflies was dope the video look like it was paying tribute to the movie Misery
Yeah that lady at the end with the axe looked just like her
yeah but besides from that song I really dont know much about her But i looked online it looked liked she has a strong fan base already
Yeah she been having a underdog type following since she put out her first Mixtape
Is she independent
No I thik she signed to Kendrick Lamars label
Oh I didnt know that ,where is she from
I think New Jersey
She reminds of a young Erica BaDU
I hear alot of people compare them but i think they do with that with alot of black artists that kinda have a kinda earthy look but there songs are diffrent
