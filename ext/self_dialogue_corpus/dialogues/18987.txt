Have you heard of deadmau5?
Yeah I think so.
He makes electronic music and wears the mouse head.
Oh yeah I think I have heard a few songs by him
His most popular track, "ghostsn'stuff" has been on the radio before.
Right I think thats the one that I have heard.  Why do they call him deadmau5?
I think it is because his computer broke, so he took it apart and there was a dead mouse in there.
Interesting how names come about.
Right?  Have you ever seen him perform live?
No I havent.
He always wears a hat that looks like his face is a mouse.
Sounds like he is taking it too far.
It has actually made him iconic in the industry.
Would he have been iconic without the hat?
I think he would still be famous, but I dont think he would appeal to as many people?
Why not?
His music style is progressive house, it is not the most popular in the electronic genre.
So its more of a hardcore thing?
Right, you have to have a taste for it, and a lot of people dont.
Lets see if I have the right ear for it.
