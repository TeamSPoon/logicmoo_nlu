Are you familiar with the song "Hey Jude"?
Yeah, it's a Beatles song, right?
Right. I was just reading the other day that John Lennon wrote that song for his oldest son, Julian.
Really? I didn't know that!
Yeah, he seemed to enjoy writing songs about his family.
That's really cool. Can you name any others?
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is about a picture that Julian drew for him at school.
Wow, Julian inspired some great music, didn't he?
He sure did.
Maybe I should try listening to those songs again now that I know what they're about.
