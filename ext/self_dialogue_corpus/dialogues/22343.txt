Hey, have you seen that new movie Everything Everything?
No.
Why not? It looks like it will be a good romantic movie.
I have no interest in seeing that movie. I'd rather die first.
Come on now, Sheena.
I am serious. Why is that they are always pushing this white and black relationships down our throats?
I see where you are coming from?
You telling me that black girl couldn't have found happiness with someone of her own color or race.
Well, Everything, Everything is not for everyone, but it will satisfy a certain subset of teenage girls who are compelled by watching fragile girls come-of-age with the help of a pretty boy.
Black boys can't play the lead of a pretty boy? Why must they keep doing this?
Doing what?
Trying to keep us stupid and wanting to be with their kind. Like there is something wrong with us being with our own kind.
I didn't think about it that way.
Of course you didn't.
"Everything, Everything" is a flawed film in many ways, but there is one that's a deal breaker.
What's that?
It doesn't make you cry.
Her mother should be crying for what her daughter is doing in that movie.
It's a sweet romance movie, nonetheless.
In your closed eyes.
