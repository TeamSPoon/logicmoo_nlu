Hey Billy how about the Bears
The Bears are awful this year
yeah they are lol
I would rather watch the Cleveland Browns
Seriously man they are crappy every day
I know, they have a revolving door of players
especially quarterbacks
yeah pretty much 3 per year
Remember the most recent one
Who Manziel?
yeah that clown
Johnny Football ended up being a bust
for sure the guy was like 5 foot tall what did they expect
He cannot even see over top of my mom
Ha Ha right and what does he weight 5 pounds soaking weight
like a drowned rat
Oh well maybe they will find a decent quarterback eventually
they probably need to find a good coach first
yeah it def starts from the top
they could learn from the Patriots
