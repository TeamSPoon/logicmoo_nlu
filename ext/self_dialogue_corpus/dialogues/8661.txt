What do you think of today's rock music?
Not much of anything new I like.
Me either. Give the old rock bands,stones,The Who,Led Zeppelin etc.
The Who and stones still touring and rocking big time.
They are both ageless.
Would love some new,stuff from these bands but I don't see it happening.
Creative days are mostly passed.
Once in awhile a new,song.
Yea,but few and far between.
You are so right
