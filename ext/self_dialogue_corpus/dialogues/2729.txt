Let's talk about top ranked players this 2017 NFL Season!
How about we start with quarterback of the Falcons, Matt Ryan?
Matt Ryan had a great season, one of the best of his career.
He was a threat, passing for 4,944 yards and 38 touchdowns! Those numbers being with just seven interceptions.
Yeah, the Falcons exploded with those types of numbers and enjoyed the fruits from which were produced.
But all did not end too well there. Having made it to the grand stage just for the defense to collapse.
That is all too true, though he is ranked number 10 in the top 100 of players coming into 2017 season.
We will just have to wait and see if he can build upon this past season and continue strong.
Let's turn our focus to Le'Veon Bell, the Steelers running back.
The word patience fits the man to a t.
That it does, he really showed much patience last season.
Lets not forget Bell rushed for 1,268 yards and he peaked with back-to-back 150 plus yard games in the playoffs.
Yeah, one must watch for his sudden bursts out of the backfield. Very explosive and a sight to watch.
One of his most memorable performances was in a snowstorm! Getting the ball 38 times and had 236 yards rushing with 3 touchdowns on the ground.
I remember that game! Was a great game to witness.
I would put that in one of my all time favorites of his games.
Bell is without a doubt, a top 10 player to watch!
I agree, with you on that one.
There are so many greats out there to be on the radar this season.
Yeah, and we only named off two of them! So much great talent in this league.
