So I finally got to hear that new DJ Kali song
What song you talking about I'm the one?
Yeah it was playing on the radio the other day I had turned it up and let my bass bounce
Yeah that's the only reason I like that song it's because of the bass drop Vine
I know the lyrics is so whack I don't know how anybody can like the lyrics
If it was me I would take that beat switch the lyrics
Why so you know how to rap you going to put your own lyrics in there
Bet you My Own lyrics with sound better than one is on there now
Alright you I bet you $100
Want you going to say dang yo that hot
I guess we'll see how long it to you remix the song
And I should take maybe a day or two I'll send it to you
So are you really going to throw your own lyrics in there or take someone else
Probably do a combination of both
Sounds like a plan you should sell some of your music
I would sell it but nobody wants to buy I'm a nobody
You just got to get out there start paying your music on YouTube
Yeah that's a good idea I'll set some up now
Hey what's your YouTube account
