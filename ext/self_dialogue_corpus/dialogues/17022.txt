Man Kerry King is just so generic
Who
He is a guitarist
Oh is he
Yeah he is
What band does he play for
He is the lead in slayer
Oh Yeah slayer is boring
He is pretty much the main reason for that
Such a shame
Their first few were good though
I only liked one of them
Which one did you like
Second one i think
Hell Awaits?
Yeah that one
I love that one
Reign in blood is overrated
Yeah it is
For sure
