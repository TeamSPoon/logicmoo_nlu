I think the most important aspect of modern music is the beat.
There is plenty of evidence that people agree with you.
What do you think?
I would say melody. Others would definitely go with the words.
Too bad a lot of music can't live up to your melody or words. You can't go wrong with the brat, especially for dancing.
Well, you see?  You didn't mention that to begin with.
What, did you think of drums beating with people jumping around a fire?
Actually, I did. Caveman "music".
Ha! Of course I meant modern day pop music with guitars and electronics.
Some of the most beautiful and pieces are a Capella.
No supporting instrument at all?
I guess I should say with supporting instrument, piano or guitar.
I can't think of any such music.
It is no usually the type of music that hits the pop charts.
Give me an example.
Sure. Search YouTube for Amy Winehouse demos.
Amy Winehouse with just voice?
I believe there are a couple where it is a Capella, not even a guitar.
I'll check it out later.
I like the pure sound her voice, unembellished.
