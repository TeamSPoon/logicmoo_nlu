Hey what do you think of the Rolling Stones?
They are one great band.
I love them too, a lot of great songs.
I saw them play in the 1970's in New York City.
How was it?
Oh my god, it was great. They played Jumpin Jack Flash, Lets SPend the night Together, Can't get no satisfaction and a lot more.
Mick Jagger is a great performer.
That is true.
He has some great dance moves.
He still does today and he is 70, maybe older.
I know , he must really keep himself in shape because he is still dancing.
Keith Richards is a great guitar player.
I know! They have had about 23 albums.
I love Exile on Main Street. One of my favorites.
Yea, that is a good one.
They have sure had a lot of number one hits.
They sure have. Get yer Ya's Ya's out was another favorite.
Oh I remember that.
They are one classic band.
I wonder if they will play again in the near future, I hope so.
