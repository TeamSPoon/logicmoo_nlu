Hey, you been following baseball this year?
Yeah, I have a bit. I think the weirdest story was Madison Bumgarner on the Giants getting injured in a dirtbike accident.
Agreed, he's being paid millions of dollars to stay healthy and perform physically. Kind of an idiotic move.
Yeah, totally irresponsible, but they can't really punish him because they need him to be happy with the organization.
You think the Cubs will repeat this year?
Haha, nobody has been able to ask that question for 100 years.
Good point. I think they have as good a shot as anyone.
Yeah, the playoffs are always a toss-up, but if they get there they will be in good shape with their pitching.
I think they probably have the best rotation in the league.
Did you see that 18 inning game the other night between them and the Yankees?
No, it ended way after my bedtime. The Yankees are surprisingly good this year.
I think I actually like some of their players now that A-Rod is gone. I don't have to root against them.
They're still the Yankees.
Haha, true. Their fans can be a bit much.
You been to any games yet?
Not yet, I'll definitely see a few once the weather warms up.
Totally, I love day games in the summer. Nothing better than a sunny afternoon and baseball.
Yeah, it's one of those things that's as enjoyable as when I was a little kid.
It really never gets old. There's some magic to the ballpark.
Let me know when you plan to go, I'd love to get some sun and see some ball.
