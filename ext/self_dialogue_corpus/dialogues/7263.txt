Who are your favorite characters in the movie Frozen?
One of my favorites is Sven.
Why is the reindeer one of your favorites?
Because he's funny, he has funny facial expressions and is sassy.
So do you have any other favorites?
Yeah I also like Kristoff. He's like a real Prince Charming, without being a prince.
So he saves the girl?
Not really. He realizes he cares for Anna, but thinks she loves another man.
So who saves Anna?
Well, Anna sees Hans try to kill Elsa, so she jumps in front of him before he can kill her and her heart freezes and she turns to ice, and that act of true love is what saves her. Then she unfreezes.
