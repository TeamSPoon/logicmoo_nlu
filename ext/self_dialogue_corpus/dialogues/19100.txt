I don't understand why Norah Jones has the last name of "Jones".
What do you mean?
Well, her father was Ravi Shankar, the great Sitar player.
Oh, right, he taught George Harrison how to play.
Yes, you can hear George playing the Sitar on "Norwegian Wood".
I think the Sitar uses an entirely different way of using notes, not like Western music.
Kind of like Arabic music, some kind of half-notes or something.
You'd think Lennon's son, and Ringo's and Paul's would get together and make a New Beatles.
Lennon's son, Julian, did some songs I remember, and he sounded just like his father.
That's right. And I think Ringo has a son, Zak or something, who's into music.
And Bob Dylan's got a son who's successful, but I don't know his stuff at all.
I remember George Harrison played on Julian's 1991 album, "Help Yourself" but didn't get any credit on the album jacket.
Yes, and I think Julian always said he had a better relationship with Paul McCartney than with his own father.
That's sad. Right. Didn't Julian inspire a couple of Beatles songs?
Strangely, "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds", from a drawing he did of the moon and stars and the sun.
No, I think it was a drawing of a girl. Oh, and "Hey Jude" of course.
And that weird "Good Night" song at the end of the White Album, that sounds like Dean Martin or something.
I think Ringo is singing it. He's the only Beatle on it.
They've got that 50th anniversary "Sgt. Pepper" boxed set out now. Amazing. Fifty years?
If you've got the money to buy it.
