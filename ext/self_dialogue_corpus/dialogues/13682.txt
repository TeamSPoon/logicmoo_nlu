Are you into Lady Gaga at all?
Yes occasionally I find her alright.
I like her old stuff but not her new stuff.
Yeah her old stuff was good because it was club music mostly.
The current stuff is more boring.
I understand that.
What about the Fame Monster album?
That one was semi okay but not my favorite.
Hopefully her next album is more upbeat.
That would be awesome.
