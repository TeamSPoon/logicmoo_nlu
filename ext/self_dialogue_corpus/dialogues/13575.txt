So, what did you think of Rogue One?
Weeel... I liked parts of it.  It had a lot of great action scenes and it was really neat to visit the Star Wars universe from the perspective of non-Force powered characters.
Yeah, I'm with you on that.  I thought Felicity Jones did a great job playing Jyn.  And I liked Donnie Yen's character.
He was the blind guy, right?
Yeah, that was him.  Dude is nearly fifty years old and still kicking butt in Hollywood movies!
Yeah, he was pretty cool.
One the less positive side though, I thought the CGI scenes with Tarkin and Princess Leia weren't quite there as far as completely realistic.  It fell squarely in the Uncanny Valley section of things.
Yeah, especially with Tarkin.  They had the guy look waaay more cadaverous than I remember him being in the first film.
Yeah, I know, I heard one critic even saying something like, "Was that CGI, or did they find some way to revive the actor's corpse?"
Oh, that's terrible!
