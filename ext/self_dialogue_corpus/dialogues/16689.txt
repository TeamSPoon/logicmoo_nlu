Who is better, the cure or the smiths?
Oh come on.
Really think about it.
I am going time have to say the cure.
That's right. That's how I feel.
Why the cure?
They just sound much better.
I know what you mean.
The smiths have a great sounds, but they don't speak to me the cure does.
I know, it's the sound track of my sad heart.
Who would you rather hang out with.
The cure.
I feel the same.
Morrissey just feels like a buzz kill.
That's funny,I know what you mean.
I met Morrissey once.
Really, where?
At bath house.
I don't believe you.
Just kidding
