What was that teen movie that came out earlier?
That's a horrible description for me to help you.
Never mind, I remember the name: Before I Fall.
Eh, thought it was disposable.  They just belabored the point.
In terms of continually reliving the same day.
Yeah.  I knew she would die no matter what.
Right, just had to set some other things on the right page before she did.
Completely predictable.  These movies take themselves too seriously.
Plus the performances were really wooden.
Definitely one to watch once and never return to.
