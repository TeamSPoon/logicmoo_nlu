Have you heard of Panda Girls?
No, who are they?
They're a great Jpop group.
What's Jpop?
It's Japanese rock music. It's really cool.
Do they sing in Japanese or English?
Mostly in Japanese, but with some English in it.
That sounds different.
It's really neat. I think you'd like it.
Have I heard anything of theirs?
Yes, they had a song on the soundtrack of Panda Karate Kids.
Oh, I loved that movie! Did they do the song in the big fight scene?
Yeah, that was them!
Awesome, that song was great. Is it available in America?
Sure is. It's on streaming sites.
What about an album?
That too. You can get it lots of places.
Sounds like fun. I'll have to give them a try.
Excellent. Want to borrow my CD?
Great, thank you!
