Have you ever listened to Liv Kristine?
No. Who is that?
She's the woman that sang in Cradle of Filth's song Nymphetamine.
Really? I never knew that.
Yeah, you can see her in the music video.
Are any of her solo songs any good?
Yep. I really like most of the songs from her album Deus Ex Machina.
It is metal like Cradle of Filth?
The genre is rock, but it doesn't sound like anything you hear on the radio. It's very good.
I'll have to listen to it sometime.
Is metal your favorite genre of music?
Yes. I like all genres, but metal is my favorite.
Are there any metal bands you would recommend?
I really like Black Label Society. Their song Suicide Messiah is great.
Oh my gosh. I love that song.
Have you heard any of their other songs?
Yeah. I really like Spread Your Wings and Say What You Will.
Me too. The singer's voice of Black Label Society kind of reminds me of the singer's voice in the band Disturbed.
They both have really unique voices.
I know. They are both deep, as well.
