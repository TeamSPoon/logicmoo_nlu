Honey, I Blew up the Kids! was a funny movie
I know that baby was so big!
He wanted his mom so bad but he was too big to hold
I think at that point that Dad should have just stopped with all his inventions
seriously, if I was the mom I would have said to get out
I know! He could just invent other things
I would make a lot of things bigger, like my house for starters
so would I , those kids should have stayed away from his stuff though
yes, it was partially their fault
that is true, but at the same time that dad was just a bad inventor I think
