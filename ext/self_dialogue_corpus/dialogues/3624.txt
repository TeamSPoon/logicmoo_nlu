Seen any good zombie movies lately?
Yes! I just saw a Korean film called Train to Busan that was insane.
Really? What sets it apart from other zombie movies?
It all takes place on this bullet train so its confined and claustrophobic. And the zombies are fast so when people try to move between trains all hell breaks lose.
Was it gory?
Extremely gory but in a unique over the top way. They had some set pieces like I've never seen but it also has a heart so you care about the people who are in jeopardy.
Caring about characters in horror movies is so rare. They're usually so disposable.
The director, Yeon Sang-ho, obviously spent time getting the characters right so there is more at stake.
Korea has done some really great horror films like I Saw the Devil and Tale of Two Sisters. They bring something new to the horror table.
I totally agree! Kim Jee-woon's I Saw the Devil is probably one of the best horror films in the crime genre out there.
