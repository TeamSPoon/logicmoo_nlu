Have you seen Chamber of Secrets?
Yes I have, it was pretty good.
I agree, big improvement over the first, and a lot more mature.
Yeah, I liked the fight scene at the end.  And how it seems that Vodly is destined to come back.
I know what you mean.  And that book, how innocent people can just be controlled by Voldy.
And the part about parcil mouths.  It was cool how only a select few can speak to snakes.
That was one of Voldemort's best showings at the end.  Seems he got much closer to victory the second time around.
Yes, to see him young, and get a glimpse of his planning abilities.
I also liked the Griffendore sword.
Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Gave a warm feeling to the end as well.
