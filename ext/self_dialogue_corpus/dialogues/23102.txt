What movie are you looking forward to?
The new Spiderman!
Oh, I heard about that. What does it come out?
I think it premieres on the 7th.
Nice! It's coming up soon then!  Did you like the older Spidermans?
No, not really.
What makes you excited about the new one then?
I really like how he was portrayed in the movie with the Avengers.
I saw that.  It was cute.  He has a different personality.
Yeah, he seems younger too. Kind of innocent.
Yeah, I'm sure something will happen to make him throw up.
I wonder if it will follow the comic books with his uncle or if it will be a bit multiverse.
Oh, like something else happening and his uncle living?
Yeah!
I don't know if that will be. The trailers only showed his aunt.
I remember that!  It was funny how Iron Man is flirting with her.
I think Iron Man's interaction with Spiderman will sure make it different.
That's what might make him grow up!
Could be. Iron Man is pretty out there.
He is, but I think he'll make it very interesting. I'm so looking forward to it.  You should see it too!
