the goofy movie was funny
I liked how his son and him had one last road trip
I know but Goofy really is silly
he is I can imagine a kid being embarassed of a dad that acts like that
seriously though, he was embarrassing at some points
he means well though he loved his son
he did  that is true and in the end he knew it
I wish I could go on a road trip like that
I have been on one and it was fun, not with my parents though
no I would rather go with friends
