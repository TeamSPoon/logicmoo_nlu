When I lived in Detroit I used to be able to see a band any night of the week. I miss it.
Did you see anybody good?
Oh yeah. I saw a lot of great bands. Not all of them famous or anything. Just good, local music. There was a really thriving music scene during the time I lived there. There is still is, I would imagine.
Did anybody get famous?
Well, the White Stripes certainly became very well-known.
Did you see them?
Many times, yes. They used to play music on my street.
Oh really?
Yeah. We would have a block party. We would build a stage and have music, beer and dancing all day. White Stripes played. Also other Jack White side projects, also.
Did you like their music?
Oh forsure. Many people did. Although, when they became famous many people became bitter.
How so?
Well, people who had helped Jack felt that they owned a piece of his success. They felt they were owed something.
What did they feel they were owed?
I don't know. Many of these guys were musicians who had helped produce or record his first album. They wanted more recognition, fame, and money.
Do you think they were jealous?
Somewhat. Many of these guys were in absolutely fantastic bands that never received the kind of attention the White Stripes did. Maybe they felt they deserved it more. It was a strange time.
Is Jack White a nice guy?
He was always nice to me. Kind of quiet, but sweet. He is really talented guy.
I wish I could have seen them play back then.
