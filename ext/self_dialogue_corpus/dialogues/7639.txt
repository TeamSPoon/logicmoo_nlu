Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies
Yes I have and I love them. Have you.
Yes and I loved the fact that the kids had such good chemistry.
That's really important, that can make or break a  movie. Have you ever had a marathon?
Yes me and my kids have Harry Potter marathons all the time.
You know what adds to the fun? Making butterbeer and popcorn to watch with it.
You can actually make butterbeer? The same as it's described in the movie?
Yes there's a recipe on line. It contains butterscotch, really good.
That sounds good, I know my kids would love that.
Mine flip out over it. We can't watch Harry Potter anymore unless there's butterbeer.
