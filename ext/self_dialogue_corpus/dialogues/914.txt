I was looking at Fantasy Football strategy for this year and it's hard to tell who are the top running backs in the NFL this year.
I haven't looked at anything. I would guess that Ezekiel Elliott is the top running back.
He's projected to be. Hard to not have big numbers behind that big offensive line and with the talent he has.
Wonder if he will go for 25 or more touchdowns.
Possibly. That's one and a half a game. Pretty tough to do, but a game with three here and there, and possible.
I'm trying to think of more running backs. Wow, who else is still out there that produces. LeVeon Bell is the only other one that comes to mind.
LeVeon Bell is definitely a big numbers producer. Especially if he's healthy.
He's had a hard time staying healthy. The Steelers run him to death.
They certainly do. He may not last another 3 or 4 years.
Probably not. I can't think of any other running backs.
There is Jay Ajayi from Miami and David Johnson from Arizona.
I would be a little wary of picking those two because they seem like one year wonders, especially on a team like Miami or Arizona.
True. Arizona running backs are usually fantasy busts.
Yes, they are. Remember that running back they had a few years ago that everyone thought was the real deal and he flopped.
Andre Ellington, right?
Yes, him. He was high on everyone's draft board.
He wouldn't be the first running back to be a waste of a pick.
Certainly not. Who else is high on that list?
Jordan Howard is top ten.
The guy from the Bears?
