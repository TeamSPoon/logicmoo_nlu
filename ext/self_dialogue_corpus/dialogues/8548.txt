I want to know who your favorite female pop star is!
My favorite is Madonna.
Awesome choice.
She has so many good songs that it's hard to pick favorites.
Do you have a favorite though? Mine is Like A Prayer.
I liked the gospel singers in the music video for it.
Me too. It was a nice touch.
Her live performances are so good!
She is a great performer.
I hope to see her live one day.
