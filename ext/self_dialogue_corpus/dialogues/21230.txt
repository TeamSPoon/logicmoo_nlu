Have you ever watched Forest Gump?
No. I have not.
Are you for real? It's my all time favorite movie.
What do you like about it so much?
I just really like seeing Forest's progression throughout the film. He does so many incredible things with his life.
Like what?
Well, he fights in Vietnam, wins a major ping pong contest, and creates a shrimp business.
I don't think I would like that movie. My favorite movie is The Parent Trap.
No way! I love that movie too!
My favorite part is when the twins go on vacation with the stepmother.
Me too! And then they play all those nasty tricks on her.
I was rolling on the floor laughing when she had the lizard in her mouth.
You know what's another really good movie?
No, what?
High School Musical. I know it's more of a children's film but I just really love it.
Me too! Even though it's actually kind of a terrible film I can't stop watching it because I grew up with it.
Agreed! Every time I watch it, it takes me right back to elementary school.
Same here! I still know just about all the words to every song!
"Bop to the Top" was always my favorite song.
I always preferred "Breaking Free."
