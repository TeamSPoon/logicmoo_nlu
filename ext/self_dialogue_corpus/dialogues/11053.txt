Did you see last nights game between the Predators and the Ducks?
Yes, I did. What did you think?
I thought at first the Nashville would win because they scored twice in a short period of time.
I did too. I was wondering if their goalie would get flustered.
I saw that the Ducks upped their checking.
Yes, that seemed to get the crowd going.
Yes, the crowd got into it then.
I think that spurned the other Duck players to play better.
Yes, I was amazed that they were able to answer back those 2 goals.
When Nashville scored that 3rd goal I wondered what would happen.
I did too. I couldn't believe when they got that third goal.
The skating was phenomenal.
The passing was super crisp.
Both teams were really skating their best.
I though they were evenly matched for the most part.
I did also.
I thought that the 4th goal by the Ducks was great.
I did too.
I think that sealed the deal and may have disheartened the Predators
Maybe, but now they are tied 1-1.
