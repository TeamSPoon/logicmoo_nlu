What movie older than 30 years should I definitely see if I haven't seen it?
Hmm. Have you seen Jaws?
Yeah, but I didn't think it was that great. I guess sharks don't really scare me.
OK, how about The Shining?
Now that was a great movie! Extremely creepy. Loved Jack Nicholson's performance.
At least I named one that you liked. Alright, have you seen the Godfather Trilogy?
No, I haven't, though I've heard a lot about them.
Oh man! Those movies are epic! Well, the first two are.
Not the third one?
No, the third one is really bad. Just pretend that it doesn't exist.
What's so great about the Godfather movies.
Where to begin? First of all, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Rober DeNiro.
Those are some darn good actors, I'll give you that.
I'd say the main thing is that it's such a cool world they create, of the Mafia back in the early to mid 20th century.
I've enjoyed some Mob movies I've seen in the past. Casino, Donnie Brasco.
These have a different feel to them. It's almost like Feudal Europe or something, with the Godfather as the King.
Who is the main actor?
Al Pacino is Michael Corleone in both movies. He's probably the main guy, but Brando plays his father as an old man, and DeNiro plays his father as a young man.
I will definitely check them out.
Just remember - the third one doesn't exist!
