I just saw the new Disney movie Star Wars: The last Jedi.
DId you enjoy it?
Yes, it was just as good as Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Wow, I'll have to go and see it myself then.
My favorite part about it is seing Luke Skywalker at the end.
Luke comes back into this series?
He does but since it's not until the very end you don't know what his role will be in the story.
Now that IS an interesting turn of story.
I can hardly wait until the next episode is released.
I'd better hurry and see this one on the big screen in theaters then.
