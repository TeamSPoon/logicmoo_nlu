Why do you think humans like music so much?
What do you mean?
Isn't it weird how the whole world likes music? It's like it's in our blood.
Well when you think about it, it has been in our blood for hundreds of thousands of years.
Like when we were tribal?
Totally. We made instruments thousands of years ago, and tens of thousands of years ago, sang songs together.
That's true. And now literally everyone in the world can sing.
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary point of view.
Do you think certain people are more musical than others?
Maybe. I think it's a mixture of genetics and also exposure as a kid.
So if I'm terrible at singing, is it because of my genes or because I didn't practice?
I'd say not practicing definitely didn't help. Not sure if you could have become very good though?
This is an interesting topic. I should write a paper on this.
Yeah researching the history of music would be pretty cool.
Thinking about different cultures and different instruments is a very curious subject. What differences between people are caused by different musical interests
That's a good question.
Thanks for answering my question and talking about this. Do you mind if I bounce more ideas off of you?
Sure.
Yeah I was just thinking about percussion and music and how they are related.
That's also an interesting question
