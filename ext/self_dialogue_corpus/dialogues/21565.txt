Do you remember the movie Dirty Dancing?
Yeah, with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.
That's right. It was one of my favorite movies.
It was a good movie. The love scenes were pretty tame compared to today's movies.
That's probably true. They seemed to have a lot of chemistry though.
They did but I read somewhere they didn't like each other very much.
Well, if they didn't like each other they sure were good actors, they had me fooled.
Yeah those dance scenes were pretty steamy. I think everyone wanted to be Jennifer Grey.
I know I did. I had the old VHS tape of it and I must have watched it a hundred times.
Wow, that's a lot. I don't think I have watched anything a hundred times.
Even today when a song comes on from the movie, I can picture what was happening.
Hunh, its like you don't have to watch the movie anymore. You can just picture it in your mind.
I can but its still nice to see it once in a while when it comes on TV.
The original hasn't been on for awhile but I did see they made a remake of it that was on a few weeks ago. Did you watch it?
I watched a little of it, it was pretty boring. There was no chemistry between the two main characters and they changed some of the movie.
I didn't watch it but I heard it was a flop. I think they changed it too much.
Anyway I got a 30th Anniversary set for my birthday. There's a script in there, the DVD, a movie poster, a little purse, and a room key. There is all kinds of things that came with it.
Wow, that sounds like you should host a movie night for some of your friends. It might be nice to watch it again.
That does sound like fun. Maybe I will do that.
I know I would love to see Patrick Swayze in action again. He never goes out of style.
