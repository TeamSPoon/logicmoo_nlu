What's your theory has to who Rey is?
Perosnally, I think she's the daughter of two Jedi that broken the rules.
Yeah, the whole " No attachments thing".
Yeah, so they were expelled from the Order, so they missed being caught in the Purge.
So, why did they have Rey and then leave her on Jakku?
Because, even after the fall of the Empire, they were in danger.
From who?
Snoke and the early First Order, I think he was hunting for Rey because of her strength, so her parent left her in the most out of the way place they could find and disappeared.
Oh, so that's how Kylo Ren seemed to know something about her?
Yes, Snoke told him about her, so that he'd recognize her if he ever ran into her.
