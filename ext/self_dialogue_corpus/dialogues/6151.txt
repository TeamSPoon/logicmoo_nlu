I remember when I was about ten I went to see The Incredible Journey in the movie theater with my parents.
I remember that. The one with the dogs and the cat?
Yes, they got separated from their owners, I think they were moving .
Yes and I think they were lost in the Canadian Wilderness.
They were. They had a lot of obstacles to overcome to get home.
I remember the cat getting lost or something.
Yes the cat did but in the end the cat found his or maybe it was a her way home.
I remember they all did make it home.
I think it is really similar to Milo and Otis.
Yes it is, that is probably the newer version.
