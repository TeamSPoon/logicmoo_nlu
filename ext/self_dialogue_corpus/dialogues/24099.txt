So what's your favorite musical?
"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." It has this amazing dance sequence in the middle that's pretty mind-blowing.
Really? I don't think I've ever seen it. Who's in it?
Howard Keel and Jane Powell, but my favorite is Russ Tamblyn.
Wasn't he in 'West Side Story?' "
Yeah he was, though he dies in that one. His daughter's an actress now. Amber Tamblyn.
Has she been in anything I would have seen?
I'm not sure.  I think she was in "Django Unchained."
Oh really? Who did she play?
Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter, is the official name of the character.
Oh okay, yeah I know who that is. That was an awesome movie.
I never saw it, though I wanted to.
You really should. It's one of Tarantino's better ones.
That's good to hear. He's had some great hits and some terrible misses.
That's true. What's your favorite Tarantino film?
I'm not sure. I really like 'Reservoir Dogs,' but I think he's a better writer than anything else.
Doesn't he write all his own movies?
Most, but not all I don't think. Some of his best writing was 'True Romance.'
That movie was awesome, but I don't ever remember it being in the theaters.
It was, but only for about a week. It was a box office dud but is a cult classic now.
