What is your favorite vehicle in star wars.
The X wing.
That one is cool. What do you like about it?
It seems like it might actually fly.
It looks a little inefficient.
It seems like the wings would rip off when it goes fast.
It is the wrong shape.
It has too many wings.
It looks easier to fly than the tie fighter
I wonder why only the Rebels use it
