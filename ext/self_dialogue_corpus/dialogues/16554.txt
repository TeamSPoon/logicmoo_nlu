I was just thinking of that song "Firework" by Katy Perry.
I love that song.
It's very motivational and empowering, don't you think?
Totally. I get pumped whenever I hear it.
I heard that it just written just with algorithms, though.
What? That's crazy.
That's what I heard.
I don't trust that at all. It can't be right. That song has such powerful, motivating lyrics.
It does. I play it when I need an ego boost.
The video is amazing, too.
I don't think I've ever seen the video.
I won't give it away, but there are fireworks in it.
Well, that makes sense!
Her song "Roar" is another good one.
I don't like that one as much, but I think it's the same sort of message.
Yeah, empowerment and self-esteem.
Have you seen that video?
I think so. Is that the one on a jungly island or something?
It's probably just a fake set or the zoo or something, but yes.
Yeah. It was pretty cool. That's a good ego-boosting song, too.
