Did you like R&B in the 90s?
Of course, there were so many good songs in that genre.
Did you like TLC?
That was the girl group right?
Yes, three women.
Yes, I listened to some of their stuff.
I also liked the boy bands that came out in the 90s.
Who could forget hose boy bands!
Some of them were really good, wonder where they are today.
I am unsure, but I still listen to music form the 90s.
Me too, I get excited when I hear some older songs come on the radio.
I will blast some older songs!
