Sometimes I think there should be an American king of rock and roll.
Really?  Have someone in mind?
Yes...Bruce Springsteen.
That's an interesting idea. He is called The Boss!
I guess they say he's one of world's best-selling artists of all time.
Obviously, he's just so great.
But I like his first two albums mostly.
Me too. Purists maybe.
Although he's won 20 Grammy Awards.
So many! I didn't know it was that much.
His music excels in presenting aspects of American life.
Like working class struggles.
Its funny then that his music is popular globally.
Some things are just universal.
Like the struggles?
Yes! And he puts an accessible face on those challengea.
He does seem like a nice guy.
Approachable. It translates into his music.
To be fair, there is an artistry to hus music.
No one can dispute this.
