Do you think Rey will become a great fighter!
Of course, I think she will do lots of good for the galaxy
Will she ever be as good as Luke was?
That's tough to say, Luke was indeed a great fighter
I feel like both of them have overcome great obstacles
Like losing family members and whatnot?
Yeah, Luke almost killed his dad.
True, that made him very powerful but also made him love his dad too
I wonder if Rey will have any really tough decisions to make in the new movie
I think she'll become one of the best Jedi of all time!
