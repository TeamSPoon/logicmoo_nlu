What did you think about Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin?
I really did not like it, although it could be due to the script itself.
I agree.  While he may not have been the best actor, the writing did not help.
While we're on the subject, who do you think was the best actor?
I actually think the best actor may have been Ian McDiarmid.
Who did he play?
He was the one who portrayed Emperor Palpatine in the prequel series.
Any scenes come to mind in particular?
I think Ian McDiarmid's scene in 'Revenge of the Sith' inside the theater, when he manipulates Anakin was so well acted.
That was a good scene.  A very haunting performance indeed.
