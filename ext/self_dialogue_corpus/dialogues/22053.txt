I am in the mood to watch a good movie, any suggestions?
I love movies. What genre are you in the mood to watch?
My favorite type of movies are action because they can keep my attention the most.
Perhaps my all time favorite actor is Sylvester Stallone.
I love him. Has he done anything new lately?
Not sure, but I can watch his old movies over and over.
You and me both. I just recently watched Grudge Match.
Is that the one with Stallone and Robert De Niro?
Sure is. They play retired boxers who once had a feud going with one another during the prime of their careers.
Oh yeah, I remember seeing the preview for this one. Is it any good?
I really enjoyed it. I thought it was extremely humorous.
Sounds good, I'll have to check that one out for sure.
Have you seen all of his Rocky movies?
Yes, I have watched every one of those including the latest one, Creed.
I have to say though, those are my second favorite franchise of his.
Really? What is your favorite franchise of his?
For me, the Rambo collection is my all time favorite.
I'll be honest, it is hard to argue against that one.
Those type of movies are ones I can watch over and over.
I agree, I only wish they would make another one!
