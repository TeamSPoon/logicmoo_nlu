So what's your favorite type of music?
I really like pop music from the 70's.
Oh really?  Who are some of your favorite bands?
I like Three Dog Night, Bread, The Carpenters, and Captain and Tenille.
I like a lot of the music from those bands too.  Do you have some favorite songs?
Oh yes, one of my absolute favorite songs from Three Dog Night is "Mama Told Me Not To Come".  I think that's a great song.
I like that song too!  I love to sing along with that one.  What are some more of your favorites?
I really like "These Eyes" by the Guess Who.  One by Bread that I really like is "If".
Those are both great songs.  So, do you have a lot of 70's CDs?
Oh yeah.  I've got quite a collection of CDs.  Some are from the actual artists, and some are the Time Magazine collections that they put out occasionally.
Oh, I bet those have a lot of variety.  Lots of different artists on those CDs, right?
Yep.  And one of the collections I bought has about 10 CDs, I think.  So lots and lots of music.
So do you listen to CDs in the car?  Or do you listen to the radio?
A little bit of both.  I have Sirius/XM in all of my vehicles, so I have a great variety of music to listen to.
What are your favorite stations?
I really like 70's on 7, Classic Rewind, Class Vinyl, and I absolutely love their newest station, The Beatles Channel.
Oh! Are you a Beatles fan?
Absolutely!  I have loved the Beatles since I was about 3 years old.
Three?  Really?
Yep, my sister, who is 10 years old than me, was a Beatles fan, and since I spent a lot of time with her when I was young, I became a Beatles fan at a very young age.
