Do you like Folksy sounding music at all?
Yeah, it kinda depends on the vibe of the band though.
You should check out this group called honeyhoney
I think I've heard of them.
You might have, they have been on Joe Rogan's podcast a couple times.
Yeah that's definitely them, they played a couple songs on the podcast right?
Right, it was after their newest album "3" was released.
So those were songs off of that album?
Yeah, and also some of my favorites.
I liked those tracks, maybe I'll check out the album.
You totally should, give every song a chance.
No skip tracks, got it.
If you like that, they have an older album called "Billy Jack" that's great as well.
Okay, have I heard anything from that album?
If you watched that podcast, you'll recognize the song "Glad I've Done What I Did".
Oh that's the song I liked so much when I first heard it!
I'm sure you did, it's so catchy.
I forgot what it was called but it's been stuck in my head.
There are a lot of songs on that album that will get stuck in your head.
At least it's good music!
