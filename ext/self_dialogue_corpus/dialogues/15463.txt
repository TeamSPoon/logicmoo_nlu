Have you heard of the The Heavy?
I have, but I'm not very familiar.
Despite what the name implies, they're more of an alternative or indie-rock group.
That's definitely my scene, are there any of their songs I might know?
"How You Like Me Now" got a lot of plays.
I remember that song--they're got a pretty cool sound. Have they had anything come out recently?
They have!  Their most recent album came out last year.
What is it called?
It's "Hurt & the Merciless".  It's a funkier, more blues inspired album.
So kind of in the same area as the Black Keys?
I think that's a fair way to describe the album.
What about their older stuff, do you recommend I listen to that as well?
Definitely.  "The House that Dirt Built" has a cool Indie/Garage Rock feel.
What's your favorite song from that album? I think I'll download it and give it a try.
"Short Change Hero" is not only my favorite song from that album, but it's probably my favorite song from The Heavy.
Why is that?
It's got some cool atmospheric touches--and the use of the timpani makes me think of those old Spaghetti westerns.
I think I know that one actually, was it in a video game or something?
It was the theme song to the game "Borderlands 2".
I do remember that.  I am going to have to think about getting that album.
