Did you ever see The Silence of the Lambs?
Yup, I did, loved it.
Me too! It's one of my favorite horror movies.
No, it's not.
Excuse me?
It's not a horror movie.
It's scary!
That doesn't mean it's horror.
So what genre do you think it is?
It's a crime thriller.
Wikipedia says it's a horror-thriller film.
I don't agree. There's no elements of horror other than some creepy people and some words. It's crime.
Do you know he never said "Hello, Clarice"?
Yes, pretty much everyone knows that.
I didn't!
Did you not know that Darth Vader DOESN'T say "Luke, I am your father?"
What? He doesn't?
You get a lot of things wrong, sorry.
But at least we agree?
Yes, it's a very good movie. The genre is just wrong.
