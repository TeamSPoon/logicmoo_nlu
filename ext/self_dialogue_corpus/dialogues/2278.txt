So, you got your Seahawks going to the big game again this year?
Man, after what happened in 2015, I was pretty let down.
They've had a good run lately though! I think Russell Wilson's still got it in him.
Yeah. I also feel a bit bad about CTE and the brain injuries.
What do you mean?
I mean, the evidence strongly suggests that playing football in the modern way leads to chronic and irreparable brain damage. Is that ethical to watch?
I mean, I don't hear many of the players complaining about the risks. They make good money.
I don't know if you can pay someone enough money to make it acceptable to give them a brain injury. It makes it more of a blood sport than I want to watch.
I'd trade jobs with any of the players in a heartbeat, brain injury or no brain injury.
Well, they're adults. They can do what they want.
But it still bothers you?
I guess I just don't want to contribute by watching, you know?
Well, you're going to be missing out on some good stuff if you skip SuperBowl LI.
Superbowl LI? I thought they'd given up on roman numerals.
Nah, I bet they just thought L looked strange all by itself. They'll probably go back.
Whatever. Guess we'll find out.
Hey, if it bothers you we don't have to talk about it.
Thanks, I appreciate you saying that.
I take it you're out for fantasy this year too?
Yeah man, I think that's for the best.
