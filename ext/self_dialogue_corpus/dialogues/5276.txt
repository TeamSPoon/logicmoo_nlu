Hey! What's your favorite Disney movie?
That's hard to say, but I love their animated movies with inspirational characters like Merida and Tiana.
Yeah! I love Tiana, she's my favorite Disney leading lady.
I love her dedication to fulfilling her dreams, it really makes me want to pursue mine.
I'd love to open a restaurant someday. Her food looks delicious.
Me too, her beignets always look delicious.
Mmmm, I begin craving them every time I watch that movie.
Oh, and her dad's gumbo, too!
Yum-my! Let's go make some beignets.
Sure, sounds great!
