In the Star Wars movies, why does everyone accept the clones, from the second episode.
Well, it is complicated, but they do since they needed them.
But, why were they made.
A rogue Jedi thought that soldiers would be needed, so he commissioned them to be created.
Is that not sort of against the Jedi code?
Yes, but they still used them.
How did they all turn so bad and turn into the bad people in the white suits.
Those are not all clones, the Empire takes kids as well, and in Finn, and turns them into storm troopers.
So, the Jedi did what they did.
In a way yes, though the did not know they were commissioned, the clones.
