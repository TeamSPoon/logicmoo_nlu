Do you like Adam Sandler movies?
I do, but I haven't seen them all.
"Billy Madison" and "Grown Ups" one and two are the best in my opinion.
I never saw "Billy Madison". Who else is in that?
Bridgette Wilson, Norm MacDonald, Josh Mostel.
What is it about?
Billy is a dumb adult who has to go back to school to prove himself and inherit his Dad's hotel business.
Sounds good. I will have to watch it sometime.
What Adam Sandler movies do you like?
I saw "Big Daddy" and really laughed a lot.
It was good. Not my favorite, but good.
Really? I thought it was awesome!
I thought it was sad at parts. When I watch a comedy, I don't like sadness to be a part of it.
I see what you're saying.
Have you seen "Knocked Up"? With Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen?
Yes, that one is funny. They used Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd's characters to make a sequel.
Oh, yeah. That "This is 40" movie? I haven't seen it.
It was pretty good. Really funny.
I like Paul Rudd, always have.
Same here. Even in the Halloween movie and "Clueless"
