Hi, what are you listening to?
I am listening to P!nk old songs. Haha, I love her so much!
Which particular song are you listening to?
I am listening to "Who Knew"
Oh, that is one of her favorite songs. Why do you like her so much?
Well, I love her music because of two things. The first thing is the genre itself; I like her pop-rock-punk style.
That is good. That's the reason why I love her songs too.
The second is because some of her songs are not the usual "love" songs. She touches so many other subjects
Yes, like child abuse and death of friends.
Exactly. I think that is what "Who Knew" is all about; the death of her friend?
Yeah, you are correct. Do you know the whole story?
Well, not really. Tell me.
Well, it was a friend of her who introduced her to drugs when she was underage.
Wow really? That's heavy.
Yeah and unfortunately he passed away due to overdose.
Wow, that is sad. I did not know that.
And it seems that from her lyrics, she really loves this friend of hers.
Yes, I remember the last part of the lyrics about how she miss him/her and she will cherishes him/her.
And don't forget the reff.
That is right. Oh wow, from now on I will listen that song differently.
