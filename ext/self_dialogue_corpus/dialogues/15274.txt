So, what do you think of the new pretenders album?
pretenders?  Who are they? I think my parents liked them....
Really?  You've never heard 'middle of the road' or brass in pocket?  Back on the chain gang?
Oh, okay, now I know who you're talking about.  I haven't heard anything off the new album.  Is it on the radio?
I don't think so.  I was on their website and I saw they have a new album. There's a track called 'Holy Commotion'
What do you think of it?  Is it anything like their old songs?
It seems more produced than straight instruments. Almost like synthesized drums
Oh okay.  I don't like it when bands change styles
Me either, but Chrissy Hynde's voice is undeniable.  She still carries the same emotion in her vocals
Sounds cool.  Maybe I'll check it out. Can I see it on youtube?
Yes. when I clicked on the link on the website, it took me there.  The video is set in a recording booth
I'll check it out.  Now those old songs are coming back to me.  They sang 'Don't get me wrong'
Yes. I love that one.  When I was on youtube, I started with the new video and ended up watching all the old ones
I do that too.  I'll start with one thing and end up in a completely different place
The video for 'back on the chain gang' was from when MTV used to be a music video channel
Oh yeah,  back when Men at Work and Duran Duran were popular.  Brings back memories....
Oh yeah!  who can it be now?  and I come from a land down under!
Her name is Rio and she dances in the sand!
Now I'm starting to feel old...  Check out the video and tell me what you think!
Sure thing.  Talk to you later....
