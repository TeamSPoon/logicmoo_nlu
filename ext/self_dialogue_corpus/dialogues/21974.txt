What is your favorite 80's film?
I would go with Flashdance.
Jenifer beals was pretty sexy in that one.
I loved her character of Alex.
The contrast of her work as steel worker / stripper was pretty great.
Yes, It really shows how women can be both hard and soft or sexy in this case.
Well I think her softness comes through in the desire to be a ballerina.
True, and also the relationship with the grandma and friend.
Yes nice mix of showing strength and vulnerability through the film.
How good is the restaurant lobster scene.
I love it. She totally shows the ex wife what's what.
Puts her in her place for sure. Also the bra scene.
That is now such an iconic move.
So much in this film is now so iconic, from outfits to dance moves.
Her dance moves/ scenes have been copied in so many music videos now.
Like what?
It's Raining Men, by the spice girl Geri- solo performance.
I forgot about that, it is essentially the movie.
Yep and also Jennifer Lopez's I'm Glad. Such an obvious rip off she was sued over it.
It was pretty much exact. She should have compensated whoever properly.
