When's the last time you listened to The Beatles?
I don't know, last week?
Huh. There goes my theory, I guess...
What's your theory?
That anyone in 2017 who listens to The Beatles is actually just faking it. Because honestly, there's so much new, good music.
Wow...harsh.
I'm just saying. Why listen to The Beatles when you can listen to Lorde?
Um...you kind of can't compare The Beatles to Lorde.
Just did, though. So what are you gonna do about it?
I'm going to blast Ticket To Ride, that's what I'm gonna do!
