Which character do you think changed the most throughout the series?
Nevil for sure.
Yeah, he started out a pudgy wimp and turned out to be great.
Yes, that goes to show you always believe in people.
You know who else changed a lot?  Snape.
Well yes and no.
What do you mean no?
He always was Snape.  To us he changed, but to himself he always was a good guy in disguise.
One thing always stayed the same though.  That was Dumpledore.
Yeah, even in death he was the same old Dumpledore, kind of kind and mystical.
