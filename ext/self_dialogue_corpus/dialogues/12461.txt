Did you hear about how a Star Wars character caused a school lock down last month?
No, did some creep go to the school dressed like somebody from Star Wars?
It was a student dressed as a Star Wars Storm Trooper. A passerby saw him going into the school and called police, saying somebody was wearing a mask and body armor.
Why was the student dressed up like a storm trooper? It's not Halloween.
Apparently the school was celebrating Star Wars Day, May 4th, called :May The 4th Be With You.
Did the student get in trouble?
No, they said it was a "lapse of judgement."
Well I'm glad he didn't get punished.
The police said the bystander still did the right thing in calling in.
Better safe than sorry as they say.
