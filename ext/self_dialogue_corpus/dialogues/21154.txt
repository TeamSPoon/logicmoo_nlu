Let's talk Star Wars!
Oh, my. This could get violent. We'll probably unfriend each other after this.
I already unfriended you. Check your Facebook. Anyway, thoughts on the prequels?
Oh, boy. So, I don't hate them.
But, do you love them? Do you like them?
I think they're overly hated because of snobs that are part of the Star Wars superfandom. Ask someone who isn't a meganerd and they'll like them.
True, they all had positive reviews..they just don't stand the test of time.
So you like the original trilogy a lot, right?
Clearly.
Well, defend it.
Ready and waiting.
If Luke was a fully-trained Jedi why couldn't he use the force on the Rancor? You can lift a plane, but not a monster?
Oh, um... he was just throw into something unexpected and it was his first test as a jedi.
Sure... then how was it that a bunch of clones of a BOUNTY HUNTER who easily killed Jedi were helpless in battle?
They weren't, it's hard to fire in closed quarters.
If Leia always knew that Luke was her brother, as she admitted in VI, why did she kiss him anyway?
That was just bad writing after-the-fact. Maybe she finds Luke hot?
WAIT A MINUTE.
What?
What if Rey in Episodes VII-IX is left on a desert planet by herself because of shame? What if she is Luke and Leia's offspring? My god...
