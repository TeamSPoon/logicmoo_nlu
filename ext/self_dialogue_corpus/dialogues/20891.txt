What is your favorite movie?
Mine is Dirty Dancing.
That's an awesome movie.  Did you see the remake?
Yes but I didn't like the ending.
I have a fan fiction of how Baby and Johnny end up.
How does it go?
The old lady at the end of who starts dancing is the sister of a Broadway producer.  She uses her influence to get Johnny a job.
Then what happens?
Johnny goes on to win a Tony for best choreography, while Baby is off at college.
That sounds good so far.
But then Johnny gets drafted.
Baby must be heartbroken.
She is, so they elope before Johnny ships off to Viet Nam.
That is so sad.
Baby is pregnant and then Johnny becomes a prisoner of war.
Oh no!  Poor Baby must be distraught.
Ten years later, Johnny is released and goes home to Baby and their daughter.
How did Johnny survive the prison,
He imagined dances that he would do with Baby.  That gave him the strength to survive.
I love your happy ever after ending.
