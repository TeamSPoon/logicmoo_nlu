Who is your favorite comedy actor or actress?
I really love any move with Will Ferrell.
Me too! He's hilarious! Have you seen Stranger Than Fiction?
I have seen that. I was surprised at how well he did with a drama comedy!
I know what you mean. It wasn't as "goody funny" as a lot of the other movies he's been in.
I agree. But this was actually my favorite movie he's been in.
Mine too! I think it was because he is still so funny even when he's being partially serious.
He cracks me up no matter what move it is that he's starring in.
I know, if I hear that something has Will Ferrell in it, I'll watch it just for that reason.
I feel the same way. I wouldn't have watched Anchorman, for example, if it didn't have him in it.
