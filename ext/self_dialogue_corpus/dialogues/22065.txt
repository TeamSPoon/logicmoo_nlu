Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Yeah, I did! Wasn't it great?
I loved it! I thought it was so exciting and it made me want to watch it again right after.
I completely agree. I love how funny the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are.
They are funny, especially thanks to Chris Pratt.
Yeah, he's great! One of my favorite actors.
What other movies was he in?
He was in Jurassic World and Passengers.
Oh, that's right!  I never saw those movies, but I remember hearing about them.
They're both really good; you should check them out.
I might do that.  I'm afraid I won't like Jurassic World as much as the originals, though/
I can understand that, but really I love both.
What's the difference between the storylines?
It does not differ very much.  Jurassic World is another amusement park with dinosaurs in it and then things go horribly wrong.
Oh, it sounds very similar.  Are you sure I will like it?
I think so! The visuals are amazing to watch.
I'll have to check it out then, along with other Chris Pratt movies.
I support you completely.  Let me know if you need suggestions.
I definitely will, thanks!
Any time!  I'm glad to pass on movie suggestions.
