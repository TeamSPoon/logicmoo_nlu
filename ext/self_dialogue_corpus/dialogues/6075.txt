What is your favorite disney character of all time?
I think it would be Ariel.
Why?
Because she had courage, she was like an astronaut. She went to another world basically. for love.
I never thought of it like that, but I guess you are right.
I never understood though why she couldn't just right a note.
Maybe she didn't know how to read or write?
But she signed the contract for Ursula.
True I forgot about that.
We may never know.
