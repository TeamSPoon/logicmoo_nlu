I was thinking about movies and the Academy Awards.
Kind of a weird thing to think about - they're not for another 7 months or so!
Yeah, it just popped into my head. But I was mulling over a question.
What question?
What is the best movie not to win the best picture Oscar?
Hmmm, good question. There must be some classic movies that were snubbed.
The one that came to mind immediately was Pulp Fiction.
Pulp fiction didn't win best picture?! I assumed it must have.
Nope. It lost out to Forrest Gump, I think.
Forrest Gump was a fun movie, but it's no Pulp Fiction!
For sure. That one stands out as pretty egregious.
How about Goodfellas? One of the best mafia movies of all time!
Goodfellas is another solid choice. A great, great movie.
Or how about the Shawshank Redemption?
Shawshank Redempton is an interesting one.
How so?
It wasn't all that financially successful, and critically it wasn't seen as a super great movie at the time.
That's weird, becuase it's one of the most beloved movies today.
Yep. Just goes to show how opinions can change over the years.
It's one of my all-time favorite movies, in fact.
