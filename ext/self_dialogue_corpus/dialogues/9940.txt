What was your favorite era of hip hop?
I would definitely have to say the 80's. Between NWA and old school Nas, they definitely won me over.
I can totally see that. I think I'm going to have to go with the early 90's, though.
Really? I never thought of the 90's as a staple in hip hop.
Oh, I have for sure. I was won over by TLC and Wu-Tang.
Wu-Tang definitely is a class act. But weren't they popular in the 80's as well?
A lot of people assume that, but they mainly got their break around '93.
That was a good year for hip hop. That was just a couple of years after Outkast was founded.
Outkast has always been one of my favorite hip hop groups since, "Mrs. Jackson."
That definitely is one of the greatest hits of all time!
