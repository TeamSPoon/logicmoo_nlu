Have you heard any songs from sara bareilles?
I think so. what are her big songs again?
I'd say love song was her really big hit originally.
Oh yes, that is it. The video is good too.
Agreed. She did the music for the musical Waitress.
I did not know that. Have not seen it.
It is really good. She actually just made her broadway debut palying a baker in it.
It would be neat to see her in it.
Totally, she is such a talented person.
What song is best in it?
She Used To Be Mine. It is incredibly powerful.
Does not surprise me, even love song had such an impact.
Very true, this song is heavier and the lyrics are so on point,
Sara seems to have a knack with lyrics that send a message.
She does indeed. I also admire Gaga fro some of her lyrics.
Really she seems more pop to me. Which is not that deep usually.
Somewhat true certain songs are more just surface fun, just dance for example.
Exactly , bubblegum pop music.
But you have to also look at other songs , like million reasons.
That one is pretty powerful. I guess you have to go song by song.
