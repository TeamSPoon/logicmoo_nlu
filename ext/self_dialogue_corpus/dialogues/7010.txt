Did you see the new, live action Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did! I loved it!
Same! I think they did an awesome job following the cartoon.
Yeah, and Emma Watson was a great choice for Bell.
I agree. I found it interesting that they made Le Fou openly gay in this movie.
It's great to see Disney being so progressive and showing gay characters!
Yes, though I know a lot of people are very upset by it.
Oh well, they don't have to watch it then. But they will miss out on some great songs and dances!
Right?! The choreography is so well done!
And the costumes worked so well!
