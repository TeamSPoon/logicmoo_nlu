Do you have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?
At this point I'd say that my favorite is Furious 7. How about you?
My definite favorite is 2 Fast 2 Furious. That movie's a classic if you ask me.
Really? I didn't think it was that good.
At first, neither did I. I've just come to appreciate it for the story details it offers.
What story details?
Since it doesn't have Dom or Letty in it, it gives us a better look at characters like Brian, Roman, and Tej.
I guess that makes sense.
Overall, though, I definitely still have a soft spot for that movie.
I can definitely respect that.
