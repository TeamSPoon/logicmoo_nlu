What is your favorite Disney movie?
I really like Mulan.
Me too! I love the story of Mulan.
Same, I think it's amazing how she is a Disney princess that is a warrior.
I like the message that women can do whatever they set their minds to, as well.
Yes, she definetely challenges gender roles in the movie and I think that's amazing.
Did you ever see the sequel to Mulan?
Yeah, I thought Mulan 2 was cute too but nowehere near the original!
Agreed, she's a great role model for children though.
Yes, what a great princess.
