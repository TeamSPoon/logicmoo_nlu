In your opinion, what is one thing you would change about the Star Wars series?
I would remove all the love scenes. The scenes with Annakin trying to flirt are so cringy and terrible. It was cool when Han Solo did it, but Annakin was terrible.
Haha, That's hilarious. I was thinking about making better visuals for the empire strikes back, but you made a really good point.
Yeah, its ridiculous how stupid the love scenes are with annakin, its no surprise that actor is not in any other movies.
I agree. So what would you say the best battle scene is?
Either the fight on planet hoth or the fight in the big arena with jedi and droids.
Wow those are two really good choices. I'd have to pick the one between jedi and droids because there was better graphic editing.
Yeah, once they developed more movies they started having way better visuals than in the past.
There's something nostalgic feeling about watching the old fight scenes though.
Definitely, I love all the old movies as much as the new ones.
