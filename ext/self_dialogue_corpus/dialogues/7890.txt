Hey, you read the books, right?
Yeah, why?
Did Harry break the Elder Wand in the books?
No, he just re-buried it with Dumbledore where anyone could get at it. One of the few film changes I actually liked, though they could've handled it better.
How so?
Well in the book, Harry repaired his wand first, remember when Hermione broke it in Hallows Part 1?
But what about the wand he was using during the final battle?
It was Draco's, and the movie implies he never gave it back.
Well there was a nineteen-year time skip, anything could've happened.
I guess, I just like the more definitive way the book spelled it out.
