Hey, have you seen that movie Nine Lives?
No, but I did see the trailers.  How was it?
Well the critics reviews weren't so hot, but we really enjoyed it!
What's it about?
It's about this businessman who's a real jerk, and he gets trapped inside his cat's body.  It kinda brings his ego down a bit.
That sounds interesting.  Who's in it?
Kevin Spacey is the businessman and Jennifer Garner is his wife.
Oh, I love Kevin Spacey!  He's a great actor.
Yeah, and he's really funny in this movie.  The cat is hilarious, too.
I love cat movies.
Yeah, it doesn't disappoint.  Plus it kinda has some good morals about family and what's really important in life.
Sounds like it.  I wonder why it got such bad reviews?
I have no idea.  Maybe just because the idea seems corny.
I don't know.  The critics can be so harsh sometimes.
Yeah, they really can.  I think family comedies get a bad rap too sometimes.
Yeah, they are underrated.  I love movies the whole family can watch.
Well this is definitely a good one, and it's appropriate for the whole family.
Is it funny?
Yeah it's hilarious.  We were laughing out loud throughout the movie.
Good, maybe we will rent it tonight.
