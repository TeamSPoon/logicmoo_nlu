I am not a huge rap fan but I do love Outkast.I used to listen to them alot.
Outkast? What did  they sing that I would know?
You don't remember Andre 3000 and Big Boi? He was in the movie Idlewild
Umm not those names but if you tell me a song I probably will.
Hey Ya, Ms Jackson are two that were on the radio. Do you remember those?
Yes I know who you are talking about now! yes they were pretty good.
I liked their album ATLiens. Also I remember going and buying the double album Speakerboxxx/Love Below the day it came out.
Wow you really did like them. I have never know you to be that quick to buy music.
I know but these guys were fun. It was a special time in my life.
I know what you mean. The music you identify with during certain times of your life have a huge impact on you.
