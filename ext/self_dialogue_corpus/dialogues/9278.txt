Who's your favorite rapper?
Probably Eminem.
Personally I think Eminem is overrated.
Really, why's that?
He's not any better than any other rapper out there.
Why do you think he's been so successful then?
I think him being a decent white rapper is a novelty, and that's why people buy into it.
I disagree, Eminem has received lots of awards and has been lauded by the rap community.
That's true, but awards and praise don't mean much.
We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
