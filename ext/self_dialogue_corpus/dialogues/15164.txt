Have you heard of the new song by Julia Michaels?
Which one is that?? And I don't think I know who she is.
It's called "Issues" and she performed it at the BBMAs.
Oh that's her? I love that song!
Yes, she's a new artist but has been around for awhile as a song writer.
Really? Who has she written songs for?
She has written songs for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, and Britney Spears!
What! That's insane!
Yes, she apparently wrote Justin's "Sorry."
I love that song. What did she write for Selena?
Julia wrote "Good For You" for Selena.
Another hit! I wouldn't have thought.
She is incredibly talented. I applaud her work.
I agree.  I'm glad she has a new song now for herself.
You're right, now she's in the spotlight.
She did fantastic at the BBMas. I can't wait for new songs!
Me too, I will definitely be on the lookout for her.
I wonder when she'll release her next hit!
There should be one coming up this summer I hope.
I'll be keeping my radio on!
