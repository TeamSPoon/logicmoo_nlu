Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No, and I don't plan to.
Why is that?
Because, it is unrealistic.
Yeah I agree?
Some stuff out of comic books should not be made into a movie.
There has been a lot of hype over this movie.
I know, mostly that is all it is though.
What new movie are you planning on watching?
I plan on seeing the Alien movie.
I like science fiction as well.
Yes, and I would like some follow up from the previous movie I watched?
Which is?
Prometheus.
I have not seen it?
It is supposed to be a prequel to Covenant.
Was it interesting?
Yes.
Maybe I'll watch it.
You should.
