Are you a Jonas Brothers fan?
I loved their old music.
Have you heard any of there new stuff?
Like DNCE?
I love their song Cake By the Ocean.
It is such a hip song.
I loved the music video for that song.
Have you heard any of Nick Jonas' new songs?
Yeah, his song Jealous is really good.
I am so glad they are still making music.
