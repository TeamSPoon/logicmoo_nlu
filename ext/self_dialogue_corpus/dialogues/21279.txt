Have you seen the latest Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Yes I took my nephew to see it last weekend?
How as it?
It wasn't as great as the first one, but it was a good movie.
My nephew loves the raccoon. I am excited to see Vin Diesel in it.
It is a totally different movie for Vin Diesel. He does a great job.
What other actors are in it?
Michael Rooker is in it from The Walking Dead.
I didn't know that. I love Chris Pratt he is the reason I sit through it.
There is a lot of funny scenes in the movie with him.
Did they leave the ending open for a part three?
Yes they did.
Is there a lot of action in it?
Yes there is but the dialogue is a little bland in parts.
I heard the movie was pretty long, is it?
It is about two hours and twenty minutes long.
What other animals are in it?
There is a bear.
I am going to take my nephew to see it on Saturday, do you think it will be crowded?
It probably will be it is a really popular series for the kids. Have fun.
