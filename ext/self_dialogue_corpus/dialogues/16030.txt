Which popular singer do you respect the most?
Over what time frame?
All-time?
Including the future?
... of course not.
Can I use traveling singers of France in the middle ages?
Okay fine, someone I'd know.
Freddie Mercury.
Who?
The lead singer of queen before he died in the early 90's.
Ooooh, the Bohemian Rhapsody guy.
That's not all he's done.
I know, I'm kidding. Why him?
His vocal range was insane. He didn't ever come close to needing autotune.
Could he write his own music?
Yes - Bohemian rhapsody, which you love, was his magnum opus?
What's that mean?
It means your best creation during your career. Your standout.
Got it. I was thinking Justin Bieber, sorry.
You're a fool.
