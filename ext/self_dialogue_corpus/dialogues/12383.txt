Do you like star wars?
I like the old ones.
Who is your favorite character?
That's tough. Probably Han Solo.
Why Han solo?
Well, he was played by Harrison Ford, and he's one of my favorite actors.
Isn't that the same guy that starred in Indiana Jones?
Yea that's another one of the many movies he was in.
Yea I guess that guy is pretty cool.
He sure is.
