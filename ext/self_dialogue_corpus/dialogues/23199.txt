What's your favorite movie?
Definitely Home.
The one with the aliens?
That's the one!
That's a kids movie.
I beg to differ. It's a family movie. And the values are crossgenerational.
Okay. Tell me what's so great about it.
Well Oh, the main alien, has to overcome obstacles like not fitting in, moving to a new place, making friends, and feeling lonely.
Okay. What else have you got for me?
Tip? The main human?
Yeah, I remember her.
She has to overcome xenophobia, trust issues, and she's also recently moved countries.
Okay, but I still don't see why it's so great.
It also has witty dialogue, compelling and heartwarming moments and the importance of family.
Okay?
And, there are multiple female leads, the boov acknowledge over 5 genders, the main character is not American and dark skinned.
That's actually pretty cutting edge for a children's movie.
And, it involves a broken family.
I guess you're right, it's pretty good.
Definitely my favorite.
