Do you like any of the Stephen King horror movies?
Yeah they're good. I like Thinner, IT, Christine and Pet Cemetary 2.
Pet Cemetary 2 was crazy scary. Have you seen the first one?
Surprisngly, no. How is it?
It's really good. Have you seen Cujo?
I wasn't crazy about it. The Saint Bernard didn't scare me.
Really? The dog was terrifying to me.
IT is my favorite Stephen King film. The sewer scenes were so scary.
I hate when he sucked the bully into the tube with the dead lights. So creepy.
Yes, he was all limp and bug eyed.
