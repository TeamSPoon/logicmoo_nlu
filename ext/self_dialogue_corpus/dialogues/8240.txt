Do you ever listen to pop music?
Sometimes when I want to dance.
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I think everyone's favorite is Britney Spears.
I know she is one of my favorites.
I used to listen to the pop boy bands when they were popular as well.
I think everyone listened to boy bands.  They aren't around so much anymore.
Pop music changes so frequently that it is no surprise they aren't around.
It really does change constantly.
The artists come and go all the time.
