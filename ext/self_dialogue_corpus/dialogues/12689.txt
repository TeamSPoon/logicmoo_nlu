My favorite scene in all of Star Wars is the Trench Run from Episode IV. What is yours?
My favorite is the Battle of Hoth.
Which part of the Battle of Hoth, because that's a pretty long battle?
Oh, it's definitely the AT-AT walkers showing up and laying waste to the Rebel Alliance defenses.
Not the Snow Speeders bringing down the AT-AT with tow cables?
No, watching the AT-AT just walking across the snow on the giant movie screen was amazing.
I feel the AT-AT portion of the battle was too contrived. The Empire had ships and air superiority, they didn't need the AT-AT.
Not true at all. It makes perfect sense for the Empire to employ walkers. The Rebels had a planetary shield protecting the base.
I refuse to believe that dinky shield generator could have held up against the combined firepower of those Star Destroyers.
It was initially only 2 Star Destroyers and don't forget the Rebels also had that massive Ion Cannon!
