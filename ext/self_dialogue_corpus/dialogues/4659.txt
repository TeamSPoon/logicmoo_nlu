Did you see CC Sabathia's last start? He was lights out.
I had to work late and missed the first half.  The second half was great.
Did Matt Harvey start last night?  I heard they won but didn't see who got the W.
Yeah, he went 5 innings.  He got lit up.  They went to the bullpen early.
Did you see the shot David Wright took last night?  I bet they are still looking for that ball!
That was a heck of a blast.  I think car windows in the parking lot got shattered.
Brett Gardener stole 2 bases again last night.  That boy can run!
I didn't see the game.  Sounds like I missed a good one.
Did you see the Derek Jeter retirement ceremony the other night?  I was crying.
The Yankees did a beautiful job, like always.  It was a very moving ceremony.
I love that Joe Girardi is still coaching the Yanks.  They really take care of their own.
That team always seems like a family to me.  It must be great to play for them.
Boy, I really love Aaron Judge!  Every time he comes up to bat, I hold my breath waiting to see if he hits a homer.
I really like him.  He is so aggressive at bat.  They found another good one.
Matt Holliday is a great player.  He makes up some much spade in the outfield.
He is so fast.  He gets to all those balls that I don't think he will.  He is really impressive.
Gary Sanchez caught a heck of a game last night.  I thought the ball was going to go right past him.
He made that tag at home too.  That guy should have been safe, but Sanchez put the glove in the right place.
Is Ben Heller pitching this weekend?  I want to go to a game and would really like to see him throw.
I am not sure, but would happy to look it up for you.  If you need someone to go with you, let me know.  I am free this weekend and would love to see the Yanks.
