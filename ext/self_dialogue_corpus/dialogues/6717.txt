What's your favorite Disney movie?
I love Cinderella.
Me too.  I'm a big fan of any of the princess movies.
I love Sleeping Beauty too.
That's a good one.  I really love Snow White.  Such a great movie!
What other Disney movies do you like?
I like Frozen.  The songs in that movie are pretty good.
I agree.  I don't think there is a single little girl out there that doesn't wish she was Elsa!
I remember always wishing I was Ariel from Little Mermaid when I was growing up.
I always wanted to be Jasmine from Aladdin.
