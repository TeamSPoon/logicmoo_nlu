Have you ever seen the original Star Wars movies?
Yes, my favorite is Empire Strikes Back!
I love that one!  Okay, so who's your favorite character?  Mine was Luke when I was younger but now is Han.
My favorite is actually Obi Wan Kenobi!  I think he is so intense.  I wish he had lived longer.
Oh me too! I hated when he died.  You know, the new movies are just not as good as those old ones.
I totally agree.  I think that that one with Jar Jar Binks was really weird.
Yeah, I do too. It was hard for me to see young Anakin and Luke and Leia's mom getting together.
I know what you mean.  They just didn't match.  It seemed like she was a better fit for Obi Wan.
I thought so too!  They would have made a great couple!
The movie could have went in a whole new direction. Who knows, It may have even been better!
