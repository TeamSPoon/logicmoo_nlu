Hi Todd, how are you?
I'm great. And you?
Feeling awesome trying to find some new music for my music library.
Oh hiws that going?
Not great I cant choose wheather to buy a song by Red hot chilli peppers or The Police.
Very hard there both good.
Yes , but I'm leaning towardw The Police.
Why is that just curious.
Well I think The Polive was a great band Every little thing was a great song.
Yeah Sting was awesome in that band.
I wish they could make a return sing more hits.
That would really be a good showing to see.
There great live I saw them in 1990 they brought back memories
The red hot chilli peppers had some good songs as well.
Yeah give it away was great I would listen to that song everyday in college.
I recently saw them on the half time show for super bowl.
Can you say a bit old?
Yeah but they are older now
Well guess I'm going with The Police.
Okay enjoy.
