What do you think about artists like Future
I think artists like him are distorying the community
How when all his done is rap and make music
Its the message that he raps about I havent heard him talk about anything positive just killing and drugging
Its not his fault he was raised in an enviorment like that You rap about what you know about
Who said he lived like that most of these rappers are lying Tyga grew up in a rich neighborhood he knows nothing about a struggle
You got to admit His songs be everywhere tho even kids be singing in
yes that the problem even kids be singing if they singing about killing and drugs
How is that furures fault tho parents should control what the kids listen too
When are the artists gonna take some responsiblity and actually rap about something positive
