Is your shuffle working? I think I've heard the same guy for the last 3 songs.
Oh, you're hearing 3 different bands, but it's the same guy's voice on all three. Reese Roper.
He gets around!
Yeah, well he started the ska band Five Iron Frenzy, and a side project he worked on was the "astro rock" band Brave Saint Saturn, and later created Roper.
What exactly is astro rock?
Well that's what he called it anyway, it's basically rock but the themes and sounds are based around space and the kinds of sounds associated with that.
How do you associate a genre of music with outer space?
For example you'll hear him talk about the loneliness of being away from home, reference the equipment and their functions or lack thereof, and the sounds are very robotic sounding and create an atmosphere of loneliness.
Sounds kind of depressing.
Some of their songs I can't listen to because they're so sad, like "resistor", "space robot 5" and "estrella".
Space Robot 5 sounds very "astro rock"
I think that song is a good example of the overall demeanor of their stuff.
What are some happier songs of theirs I can listen to?
Maybe "Rocketown", "Independence Day" and "Shadow of Def". They all are upbeat or should at least make you smile.
So do they write their own songs?
"Rocketown" was a cover, but the lead singer Reese Roper wrote most of their songs.
I wonder what that guy went through that he'd know the loneliness of outer space.
Hey, he's amazing at being able to provoke all kinds of feeling through his writing. Some of their most moving songs are "Under Bridges", "Heart Still Beats" and "Two Twenty-Nine"
I'll be sure to give those a listen.
I don't think you'll regret it.
