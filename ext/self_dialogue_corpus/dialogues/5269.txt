Do you think Disney will every make another Fantasia?
Oh, I hope so. I really liked the first two.
What was your favorite part?
Oh mine must be a tie between Mickey casting a spell on the broom and the flamingo with a yo-yo.
Those were funny ones.
What was your favorite part?
Definitely Rhapsody in Blue from Fantasia 2000.
That's such a good part! My family watches them every year around christmas.
That's such a great tradition, I'm going to start doing it.
