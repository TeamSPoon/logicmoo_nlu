Hey! I just got back from seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.
How was it? I saw it had an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
I thought it was pretty good!
I haven't seen it yet. I was afraid they'd take the Baby Groot thing too far.
Nah, they handled it pretty well. Nowhere near Minions level of annoying or overdone.
Good to hear. I've been getting burned out on Marvel movies.
Yeah, I didn't like the last Avengers movie much.
Age of Ultron? I hated that movie.
The first one was so good. The second one I think a lot of the characters felt 'off'.
I really wish they'd consider taking more of a break between films.
There's at least 8 more Marvel films planned by 2019. Including two more Avengers films.
Everything seems like it's becoming a "cinematic universe" thing now.
Mostly just Marvel and Star Wars, but they're releasing so many films between them that it does feel overdone.
The only one I am really looking forward to is the rumored Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars film.
If they got Ewan McGregor back to play Obi-Wan, I would watch that film in a heartbeat!
Did you know it's rumored he's going to play as Christopher Robin in a live-action Pooh movie?
No kidding?
Yeah, movie called Christopher Robin. No release date or much known yet.
I really liked watching him in Blackhawk Down.
He was in Moulin Rouge as well. More movies need Ewan McGregor!
