What Beatles album did you last listen to?
That's a very specific question. Who said I listen to The Beatles?
Oh, sorry. I just assumed because you're an old white person...
You got me there! Okay, it was Let It Be
every album is just a hit, I can't even insult that choice
their later music was kind of a flop, but I enjoyed the album
What's your favorite song on it?
Two Of Us
Good choice
thanks, I thought so
