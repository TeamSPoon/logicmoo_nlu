I really thought I couldn't like any other Star Wars droids as much as R2-D2 and C-3PO but I was wrong!
Haha, which new droid are you talking about?
BB-8 of course! I loved him in "The Force Awakens" and he's one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to "The Last Jedi."
Yeah, they did a really good job with him. The dynamics of his relationship with Poe was endearing to say the least.
I know right! I was in tears when BB-8 saw Poe again for the first time after he thought he was dead.
Yeah, haha, he pushed Finn out of the way and there was no stopping him from reaching Poe!
That was so cool, one of my favorite scenes in that movie.
It's amazing how much personality and depth they gave his characters, especially when he doesn't even speak.
Yeah, reminds me of R2-D2, just speaks in random beeps, but still so lovable.
Wish I had a robot like that in real life!
