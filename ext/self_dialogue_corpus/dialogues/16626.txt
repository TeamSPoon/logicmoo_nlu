What types of music do you like?
I enjoy a little bit of everything.
Are you a fan of Madonna?
I like her music but I'm not a fan of her as a person.
Her older stuff was great, but I enjoy her newer stuff as well.
Do you like Citizen Cope?
I know a little about him. He's pretty good.
He's one of my favorite music artists. Super talented. Have you heard "Lifeline"?
I haven't.
It's one of my favorite songs. I want to see him perform live someday.
I like Pearl Jam, Everlast, Bush, are you into them?
Pearl Jam I love.
They are awesome. What's your favorite song by Pearl Jam?
I would have to say "Jeremy". It's really popular, one of my favorites too.
Yeah that's a great song. Are you a fan of Maroon 5?
I do like Maroon 5, but not every song they do. Sometimes Adam's voice gets too high and irritating.
Yeah I can see how you might feel that way.
Do you have any of their albums?
I do. I have the Overexposed album and the V album.
Nice. I don't have any but maybe I'll look into getting one.
