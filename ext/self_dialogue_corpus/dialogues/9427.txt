Do you like Lil Wayne?
I hate his new music but when Wayne was apart of the Hot Boyz his music was amazing!
Hot Boyz? I've never heard of that group before, who were they?
Are you kidding me? Cash Money Records dude! The group was and is the hottest hip hop group of all time.
Who else was in the group beside Lil Wayne?
The group was only New Orleans rappers specifically Juvenile, Turk, B.G., and Lil Wayne! I can't believe you've never heard of them before.
I've heard of Juvenile before but not B.G. and Turk.
Yeah well Juvenile is really the only former group member who still makes decent music. B.G. is serving like 20 year prison sentence for having illegal firearms and Turk was in prison for a long time but was released not too long ago.
That sucks. Do you think they'll ever have a reunion?
Lil Wayne tried to have one a few years ago at some show in New Orleans but only Juvenile, Turk, and Wayne perfromed. B.G. was already locked away in prison so I guess it was a semi reunion.
