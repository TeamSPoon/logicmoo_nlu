Do you think the Eagles will be any good this year?
I don't know- I think a lot of it will depend on how their QB does.
I thought Carson Wentz looked promising last season
I hope so- the Eagles need some stability in their roster- especially at QB.
Yea its been a revolving door since NcNabb and maybe Vick. Its like every year there is a new guy.
But a QB still needs a good group of players around him- not sure if we have a strong offense
Sproles is getting old isn't he and Marshall is just good. What about wide-outs?
We used to be so good with DeShawn Jackson....remember?
Yea but they got Torrey Smith from the Ravens didn't they? And Alshon Jeffrey?
Thats true- both are good- but I worry Torrey Smith is too old as well.
I am excited to see what another year with Pederson will be like since he spent last year undoing a lot of problems
True, I think Chip Kelly really screwed up the Eagles in so many ways- it may take another year to get it back to form.
Maybe. I loved Andy Reid but it was time for him to go- too many post seasons ending too soon
I liked him too, but I was ok with the decision for something new- but Chip Kelly was not a good fit.
I think Pederson could be good- but Laurie and Roseman needs to get him a good staff to work with
True- the pre seaon is starting soon so we should see
Still I am most excited about Carson Wentz- especially after a full season under his belt
And a more veteran team to work with this year
I hope he works out- it would be great to have a franchise quarterback to build a team around
Agreed- let the Carson Wentz era begin!
