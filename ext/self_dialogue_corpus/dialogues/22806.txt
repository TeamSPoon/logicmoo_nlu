Hey Walberto, have you seen anything good on Netflix recently?
Hi, Janoris, I watched Zodiac the other night.
Zodiac?  Is that about astrology?
No, good guess but no, it's about a serial killer.
Oh, the Zodiac killer from the 60s?
60s and 70s.  But yeah.
Were there any actors I would recognize?
Yeah, it had Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo in it.
Oh, it had two Avengers.  Ha, that's funny.
Oh, I hadn't realized that, but yeah there were two!
Was the movie good?
Yes, it was very good, it was quite suspensful.
Oh, nice, I love suspense.
Me too, my wife, Esmerelda, even liked it.
Oh, so it would be a good date movie with my girlfriend?
I'm not sure about that, does she like movies with suspense?
Sometimes, as long as they aren't too bloody.
Then she will probably be ok with this one, while there is some blood it isn't over the top.
Awesome, I will have to watch it soon!
Good choice!
