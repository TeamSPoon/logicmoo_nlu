You remember that thriller about a guy being chased by a crazed trucker?
You mean the original one with Dennis Weaver in it?
Yeah, what was the name of it? I want to recommend it to a friend.
It's called Duel.
Of course. How could I forget that?
That movie's a classic. I must have seen it a hundred times.
Me too. I like how they kept the truck driver's identity a secret the entire movie.
I think he was in the diner though. He had to be, just not one of the guys at the bar.
That guy had a bad case of road rage, didn't he?
Spielberg defined the meaning of road rage in that flick.
