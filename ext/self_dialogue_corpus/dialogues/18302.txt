Have you heard the new Kendrick Lamar album?
No, I've heard good things about it, though.
I think it's great. It's not his overall best, but it's still really good.
I've heard all of his other stuff, I just haven't had time to hear the new album.
It's a good mix of catchy songs that still have meaning and pertain to the theme of the album.
That's what I like about Kendrick. He keeps getting better at appealing to the masses but still sticking to his roots.
I agree. This album is no different, either.
Are there any features on it?
Yeah there's a few. I think Rihanna is the best one, though.
A Kendrick and Rihanna track sounds like it would be amazing.
It is!. It's one of my favorite songs right now and it will probably be all over the radio.
I should probably listen, then, before I get tired of hearing it everywhere.
Maybe, but for me, even Kendrick Lamar songs that get popular still appeal to me after hearing them over and over again.
No matter how good an artist is, I'm capable of getting tired of some of their songs.
I suppose, but then you can just go back to listening to some of their older stuff.
That's true. The album Section.80 by Kendrick is still one of my favorites of all time.
I love that album too. That was before he got popular.
Well see, maybe that's why I like that album so much. It was before those songs got overplayed.
No, I think it's just a great album.
Perhaps. Then again, every album he makes ends up being close to perfection.
