Have you heard of the song 'Coco Jambo' by Mr. President?
It sounds vaguely familiar. Is it an old song?
It's from 1996, so yeah it's kind of old.
What's the song like?
It's Eurodance. Kind of up tempo and with a neat pan flute sound playing over it.
I really don't like Eurodance very much though.
You should at least give it a try.
Would I know any of their other songs?
Probably not. It was their only hit in America.
Did they have any hits overseas?
I'm not sure, but I think they were more populer in europe.
So this song is a dance beat right? Does it have vocals?
It has lyrics, although I think of it more as just a dance song.
I guess it wouldn't hurt to try.
Awesome, I think you'll like it.
You seem really enthusiastic about it.
I am. I've loved this song since forever.
Well, since 1996 at least.
True enough.
Let's give it a listen.
