Do you consider the avengers an action movie?
What else could you call it?
Some may say a thriller!
I dont think thats accurate.
I think Captain America played the best role.
Well Iron Man usually steals the scenes.
He has the best line thats why
How would you rate it in terms of other action movies?
Well it was mainly more focused around the plot rather than special effects.
So I guess the fighting was not that great!
