I was thinking the other day about Beatles music and a discussion between my husband and my son from a previous marriage.
What in particular sticks out about the conversation?
Well it was probably 12 years ago and my husband was trying to help my son become a better guitar player.. He suggested that he learn some Beatles tunes..
Yeah i can see why he would suggest them.
Well surprisingly my son said he didn't like the Beatles. Well we were both quite surprised by his reply.
Did he say why he didn't like them? Or who he did like?
I really don't recall his answer. However it was probably because he likes heavy metal and that was too light for him I suppose.
The Beatles were and are one of my favorite go to bands.
Yeah i can't imagine someone not liking The Beatles. Well some songs I could take or leave.
Give me an example of a song you don't like. Any album of your choosing.
