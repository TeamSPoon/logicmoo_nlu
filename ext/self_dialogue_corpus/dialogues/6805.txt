What's your favorite Disney movie?
The Little Mermaid.
Really?
Yes, I had a friend who was obsessed with it when we were in the third grade, and it rubbed off on me.
I like Aladdin myself. I thought it had the catchiest songs.
All the animated movies from that time period were great. They don't call it the Disney Renaissance for nothing.
That's true.
What did you think of the Rescuers Down Under?
That was a pretty good one, but unfortunately forgotten a bit since it came between Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
I agree with that.
