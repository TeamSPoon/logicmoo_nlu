What do you think about the upcoming Han Solo film.
I am excited about it, but it is hard to imagine anyone but Harrison Ford playing Han.
Yeah, Alden Ehrenreich has big shoes to fill for sure. I will probably go see it though.
Me too. Did I just here that they fired the directors?
Yes, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were fired because the producers felt the plot was getting too comical and they didn't want to change it.
Wow, who is going to finish it?
They brought in Ron Howard to do re-shoots and oversee the editing.
He is pretty good, I think he can do it. Didn't he work with George Lucas.
Yes, he was in American Graffiti and he also Directed Willow for George Lucas.
Oh, yeah, I forgot about Willow. It was really good!
