There's a lot of underrated rappers out there.
Totally. My vote for the most underrated rapper goes to Nas.
Wait. Since when is Nas underrated?
Well think about it. To a lot of people, the best rappers ever are Tupac, Biggie, and Eminem, right?
Right. So what?
Nas' "Illmatic" was one of the best albums of it's time, and no one seems to remember it.
That is true. That album is, in my opinion, the epitome of East coast rap.
It really is. He has the perfect voice for it.
And his flow is pretty much untouchable.
He just moves with the beat like nobody else. He's still untouched.
