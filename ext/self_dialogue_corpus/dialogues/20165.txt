Did you ever watch the Dark Knight?
Was that a newer Batman movie?
Yes! It has quite a few great actors in it.
Is that the one that Heath Ledger played the Joker?
Yes, that is the movie he was making when he passed away.
I have read that Heath played the part way too well, and it scared cast members.
I have read that also, but his part in the movie made the movie great in my opinion.
When did it come out?
I believe it was late 2000's.
I need to watch it, I think I have seen bits and pieces of it.
What parts have you seen?
I think I saw the part where the Joker is walking away from the hospital as it blows up.
That was a great scene!
Is the whole movie like that?
It is very action packed, well worth watching it more than once.
I am usually not a fan of superhero movies.
Neither am I, but trust me, you must watch this one!
I will take you word for it then!
Let me know what you think about it!
I will, I am going to rent it tonight.
