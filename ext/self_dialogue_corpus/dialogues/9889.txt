Do you think Lil Uzi Vert should be considered a rapper?
I'm not too sure. His beats are dope, but the bars are lackluster
Ok, true. But it's 2017, not 96 Reasonable Doubt era...
I agree... however quality is key.
And do you think his music isn't high quality?
Take someone new like Joey Badass and compare him to Uzi. It's high quality versus low-end rap.
But Uzi provides that vibe that you need sometimes...
Ehh... quality and a vibe is better than just a vibe.
Ok, I see what you mean.
...but regardless, if you like him, you like him. I can't judge!
