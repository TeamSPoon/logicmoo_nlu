What are you listening to these days?
I'm really digging Arcade Fire now.
Hmmm, I don't think I've heard of them.
They're great. From Montreal.
Oh up in Canada.
Yeah, they've got some great albums. I really like Reflektor.
What kind of genre?
Indie/folk rock, but definitely some uniqueness to them as well.
What are some of their songs?
Wake Up, Keep the Car Running, Ready to Start are some good ones.
Hmmm, they don't sound familiar.
Yeah, they're not that well known on the top 40 lists.
yeah, I need to stop listening to those top 40 stations.
Ha! Yes, you do. Most of those songs are horrible.
Well, not all of them. I like Timberlake.
Oh man, you need to stop right there.
Hey, I take offense to that.
Whatever man. Do me a favor and check out Arcade Fire as soon as you can.
Okay, I'll give them a try.
you won't regret it.
