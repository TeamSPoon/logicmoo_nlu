Have you ever seen Salem's Lot?
No I haven't. What's it about?
It's an old vampire movie.  It's actually the scariest movie made in my opinion.
Really?  Why?
The first time I ever saw it i was a child and I guess it made a big impact on me.
I can understand that.
There is a scene where this kid is in his room at night and he is woken up to a vampire kid scratching on his window trying to get it.  It was really creepy.
That does sound scary and I am not even a child!
I'm telling, you, you should definitely watch this movie.
Well,since it is scary I will wait and watch it with a group of people during the day!
