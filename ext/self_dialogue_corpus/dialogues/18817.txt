What happened to the band fifth harmony?
what do you mean?
They do not have five members they have four.
oh really why?
one of the members left?
which one left?
Camilla left the band.
I wonder why?
She said she wanted to go on her own.
that is a bummber she was a good addition
I think they are leaving their name the same,
Do you know why?
That wouldnt be qa good choice they have alot of fans
I agree, that would be a bad move on their patrt.
I agree. I feel that would let their fans down.
But there are four members now not five.
I agree but they are all united in that way with their name.
I see what you are saying.
I think they will still do good without Camilla.
I do too because they just released a new song.
