Did you ever see The Nice Guys?
I don't think so, when did it come out?
Last year, oh man, it was a really great movie!
Now I'm excited! What's it about?
It's about two guys that become private detectives and try to find out who killed an adult film actress.
Oh, so it's a thriller?
Haha, no, not really, it's more of a mystery comedy.
Sounds like a fun time, maybe I'll check it out.
You should, especially if you like Shane Black movies, he directed it.
I don't know much about directors. What else did he do?
Iron Man 3 was the big one, and he also worked with Robert Downey Jr. in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.
I loved Iron Man 3! Now I really want to see this. Does it have Robert Downey Jr. in it too?
No, but it does have Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.
Weird, I just watched another Ryan Gosling movie last night! He's also a good actor, I will definitely give this a shot.
Good to know, it's not for everyone, but if you like zany comedy it's really funny. It also has some action and the mystery holds together well.
I've been looking for some good stuff to watch, thanks for the suggestion. Is it on Netflix?
No problem. I don't think it is on Netflix, actually. But I have a copy on Blu ray if you want to borrow it.
That would be great! Hey, why don't you come over and we can watch it together.
Awesome! I would love to rewatch it, I'll grab it and head over now.
Sounds good, see you soon!
