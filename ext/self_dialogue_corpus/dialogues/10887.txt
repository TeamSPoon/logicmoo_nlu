So did you see fate of furious?
Oh yes! What a great movie!
Indeed! it was absolutely awesome!
The thing with fast and furious series that it gets better with each movie.
I absolutely agree.
I mean what a movie!
I just loved the stunts. It just blew my mind!
So do you think there will be another fast and furious movie?
It's hard to say, because the title of last movie seems it's the end of series.
I wish they continue with the series.
