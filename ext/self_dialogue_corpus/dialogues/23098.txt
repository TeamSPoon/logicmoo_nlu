What is your favorite romantic comedy?
I haven't seen a good one in a long time.
It doesn't have to be recent.
Probably Steel Magnolias.
That is a good one.
I like My Best Friends Wedding too.
Also Runaway bride is good.
1990's Julia Roberts really did a good job with the rom coms
For sure so did Sandra Bullock
Hope Floats is the best
I love Harry Connick Jr.
He's always good in a Rom Com too
Did you see Cloudburst?
No what's that?
It's an Indie rom com on Netflix.
Who's in it?
Olympia Dukakis I can't remember who else
Is is funny
It's so funny and heartbreaking
I'll watch it.
