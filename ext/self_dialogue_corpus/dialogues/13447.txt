What did you think the Phantom Menace movie?
I thought it was really bad and really good at the same time?
How was it bad?
Jar Jar Binks is a joke of a character and the special effects seemed like they were really trying too hard to make everything use CGI.
That's a fair point, what did you like about them?
Darth Maul was awesome, and the new double sided lightsaber was really cool as well.
Yea I liked that too.
I hated that they killed Maul off though.
Yea he was one of the more interesting characters.
I hope in the future they bring back that race of characters.  I'd like to know more about them.
