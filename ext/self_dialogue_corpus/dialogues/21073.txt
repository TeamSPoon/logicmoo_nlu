Curious did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I did. Did you and did you like it?
I started watching a version online. I did not like it much and stopped it part way in.
What did  you not like about it?
I did not like the new song belle sings at the start. I thought if everything else is almost exactly the same as the animated why change it?
It was fairly close to the animated version. I liked it for the visual beauty and costumes.
It was neat to see it brought to life. Maybe I will have to give it another try. Emma is not a great singer though.
I agree with you on that, she is not the strongest vocalist. But I love her from the harry potter movies.
Harry Potter films are great . In a fun childish escape way.
What serious or scary films do you like?
I recently saw green room. It is a horror film. It was awesome!
I heard about that film, but yet to watch it. It has Anton Yelchin right?
Yes. It was kind of weird to watch him in a movie now that he passed away. He was a very likeable actor.
Totally likeable. He was so cute when he was little too!
So I assume you saw his early films like Along came a spider?
Yes, you guessed correctly. He was also really entertaining in the star trek films.
Ya I liked those movies a lot. Well made and fun action.
I wonder how many more they will make?
Probably as many movie sequels as they can come up with.
I suppose that is typical, if movie is coming in for them, why stop?
