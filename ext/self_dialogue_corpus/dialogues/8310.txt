what do you think about Avril Lavigne?
I think she's my favorite pop singer, even today
I can't agree more, I was obsessed with her just by listning to her Girlfriend
same, I don't know what's the magic in it, but that song perfectly satisfies every teenagers in middle school
exactly, that's when I got to know Avril Lavgine, in fact she's just couple years older than me
so what other songs do you listen to from her?
she has tons of good songs, like Complicated, Sk8ter Boi, I'm with you etc,.
now that you mentioned those songs, I want to listen to them again
why not, add them to your songs lists, so you won't forget again
definitely
