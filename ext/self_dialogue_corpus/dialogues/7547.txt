I saw all the Harry Potter movies, but I haven't read the book.
Really? You definitely need to read the books.
I don't know, sometimes I'm disappointed with books versus movies. I might just stick with the movies.
The books are so good, you have to read them.
The books won't ruin the movies for me, and the movies won't ruin the books?
No, not at all. I mean you will know most of what happens, but you will still like it.
But don't I know it all, already? Reading the books after the movies seems like overkill.
The books have a lot of scenes that are not in the movies. And you will find out a lot more about some of the characters.
Well, maybe I will read the books, then.
You totally should. the movies are still great, though.
