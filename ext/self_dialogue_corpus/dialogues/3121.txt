Are you ready to watch some football.
I always am I wonder who will take the win.
I think the Falcons will go far.
They did good last year.
I think the Cowboys will do good also.
They have some good young players.
I believe that team will go far and be good.
I do too.
I think that it is good they had their quarterback because of tony romo and him not being able to play.
Did he retire?
He was released.
Wow the cowboys released him?
Yeah they released him in April of 2017.
I wonder if he will retire.
After he was released he announced his retirement.
Wow I wonder what he will do.
He has a job now as a sports broadcaster.
That is good he is still involved in sports.
I agree he will be missed but the Cowboys will still do good.
Yeah they have amazing new players they will go far.
