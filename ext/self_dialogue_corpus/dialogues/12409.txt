What's the best Star Wars movie?
It's the original Star Wars, from 1977.
The series never improved since then?
The series did fine, of course - but the original is a classic!
They're all classics, to be honest.
A New Hope is the most classic, though.
It does have many great sequences, like the Death Star trench run.
And it introduced us to all the great characters.
Still, though, The Empire Strikes Back told us so much more about them.
But it only built on what A New Hope started.
