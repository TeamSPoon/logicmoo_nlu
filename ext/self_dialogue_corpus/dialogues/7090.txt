I was looking through my attic over the weekend and found some old VHS videos.
What did you find?
My old Pinocchio video.
I remember that. Parts of it kind of scared me.
Yeah, it's surprising how many kids movies have scary elements in them.
The whole Monstro thing freaked me out.
You mean when the whale swallowed him?
Yes. That and when they were turned into donkeys.
What was up with that?
Trying to teach us about following rules, but what a scare tactic!
