How did you like the wedding last night?
It was a lot of fun, but the music could have been better!
Yeah I totally agree.
It just seemed like a lot of the same old wedding music.
Yeah when the DJ played Old Time Rock and Roll I wanted to die!
Totally.
And then he played We Are Family!?
Ugh, I know!
What did you think of the DJ?
Well, he didn't play YMCA... so I'd say he wasn't terrible!
Oh that's true!
I think if I were to get married I'd give the DJ a specific list of songs to play.
And songs to not play!
You're right, that's probably more important!
I'd want to play songs people know, but also songs people enjoy.
Agreed.
I really hate the traditional wedding music.
Yeah, I think people know to expect the same old stuff at a wedding!
Well when one of us gets married, we'll show them all the good stuff.
Sounds like a plan!
