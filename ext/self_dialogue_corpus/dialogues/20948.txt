Did you like the movie ET?
Yeah I liked it as a kid and liked it when I saw it recently.
It is a really touching movie and the special effects are impressive for when it was made.
Exactly I was going to say that.
While I was happy ET finally gets to go home. I wish he could have stayed with Elliot and his family.
I know you could tell ET liked their home and being around the family.
But at the same time the other humans looked at him as an outcast.
That is the sad part. They treated him like dirt and basically almost killed him.
I was sad at that part and worried they were going to kill ET.
What a great ending when you think about it. The ending was happy but sad at the same time.
You are happy that ET gets to go home but then realize both Elliot and ET are losing a special friend.
This is a movie I wish had a sequel.
An ET sequel would have been amazing!
I agree with you 100 percent! There are so many story lines they could have explored.
Not every sequel works out though.
I see your point. So maybe we are lucky ET was a great movie and nothing ruined it.
That is what I was thinking. A lot of great things were somewhat ruined by poor sequels.
Yeah and if they tried to make an ET sequel now I'm not sure if it would have the same feel as the original.
If it did I would love to see it!
Yeah don't get me wrong if an ET sequel came out I would go and see it as soon as I could.
