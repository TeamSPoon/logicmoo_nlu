When someone asks you what kind of music do you like what is your usual response? Do you say one or two catgories?
Well I guess it depends on who I am talking to at the moment.Also who I have been listening to lately will obviously influence me.
Okay I can see how that would be. So I am going to ask you right now what is your favorite.
I suppose World Music. But then I love Pharrell.
Pharrell caught my ear back when he did "Frontin'" that boy has got some smooth moves and voice of liquid gold.
He is so cute and seems like such a sweet guy. I definitely like his style.
He has only gotten more awesome with age. His songs, his spirituality, and his view on life.
He is one of my favorite judges on The Voice. He is so kind and helpful to the people that come on there.
I wonder if he has ever done World Music? I so could see him doing that.
Yes that would be awesome to see where he could take something like that
"Happy" is a song I will never get tired of no matter how many times I hear it. I loved it the first time I heard it in 2003 I think.
Oh yeah and the 24 hr video he put out was brilliant marketing ploy. It was so much fun to watch!
Yes I loved how he did that in all different locations and all the people he used in his video. They all looked like they were happy.
There aren't too many videos that make you feel good or give you a good vibe in your soul.
I agree with you on that.
Michael Jackson obviously tops that list with several of his videos.
Christopher Walken dancing to Fat Boy Slim. Yeah makes me laugh every time.
That man is so weird....in a good way!
There are lot of people who don't know he is a dancer.
I haven't listened to  and watch the music video in a while. I think  should go do that right now!
