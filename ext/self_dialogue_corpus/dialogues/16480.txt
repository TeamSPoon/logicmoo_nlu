Has anyone who won the Voice been really successful?
I don't know.  I don't watch it.
I used to watch that and American Idol.
Some faous singers did come from AI.
Not tons, though, and it seemed like the runner up usually did better than the winner.
I noticed that too other than a few years.
Carrie Underwood is obviously huge.
And Kelly Clarkson.
I bet those two are the most successfull to ever be on AI.
I'm sure. Do you like them?
I don't really. They over sing.
I like some of Carrie's older songs but the stuff she does now is too pop.
I agree.
And Kelly Clarkson's non power voice is kind of weird, sort of like she's losing her voice.
I know what you mean but it's hard to put my finger on exactly what to say about it.
I like Jordan Sparks from AI.
She's good. Her song Battle Field is good.
I have that album.
We should listen to it.
OK. I will put it on.
