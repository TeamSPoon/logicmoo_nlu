Did you see the Star Wars movie, The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, that's one of the few I did see.
Harrison Ford was so young in that movie.
Well sure, it is from 1980.
Carrie Fisher too.
Sad, she passed away. Those movies will keep her memory alive.
Yes they will. That's listed as one of the best 500 movies of all times.
Is it really.
Yes, I read an article about some of the classic movies.
I bet there were a lot from the eighties.
