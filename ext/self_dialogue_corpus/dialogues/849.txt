Here we go Steelers!  Here we go.
LOL.  They got mowed down by New England.
Yeah they did.  Too many turnovers.
Also too many field goals versus touchdowns.
Yep.  The key is staying healthy.
That is the key for every team.
Rothlesburger was hurt last year.
He seems to get hurt almost every year.
Yeah he does.  He almost retired.
I saw that.  Steelers have no chance if he isn't their QB.
Yeah.  Landry Jones is their backup.
I saw they drafted a QB in the draft this year.
I saw that too.  I forget who.
Some guy out of Tennessee I think.
Bell has to stay healthy.
He might be the best running back in the game.
And Brown might be the 2nd best receiver in the game next to Odell Beckem.
True. They have an explosive offense.
They have to keep Pouncy healthy as he seems to get hurt a lot too.
Yeah, QB's get all the attention, but in my opinion the offensive line is the most important roster position.
