Did you know the Emperor from the original movies is the same as the ones from the prequels.
Well of course he's the same character!
And the same actor.
No way!
Yup.
Well, isn't that funny.
The young Emperor is actually the older emperor.
Too hillarious! I thought they picked a good guy for the prequels.
They picked the ONLY guy!
I'll have to remember that.
