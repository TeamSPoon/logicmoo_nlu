Have you heard of "Willy Dynomite"?
No, what are they?
They are a band, a big one.
Where did you see them?
I saw them at a festival on Sunday, Ravenswood on Tap.
How big a band were they?
They had ten people in the band, they had a little trouble fitting everyone on the stage.
Sort of like Tetris, huh?
Yeah, but aside from that, their sound was really rich...and varied.
What do you mean?
Well, the band is fronted by two musicians, Josh and Stella,
Is it a cover band?
No, they write all their own music.
What kind of music is it?
It is a lot of things.  They have funk, swing, blues, reggae, a little feeling of rock and roll.
Did you like them?
Yes, I did.  Funny thing was that they were really popular with all the toddlers at the festival.  There must have been about 15 kids dancing around in front of the stage.
Cute!  Where are they from?
They are from Chicago, I think they are playing at Navy Pier next month.
Oh good, then I'll get a chance to check them out.
