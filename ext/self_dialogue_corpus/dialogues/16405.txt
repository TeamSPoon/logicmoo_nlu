Yngwie Malmsteen is so cool!
Who is that again?  It's the guitar player right?
Yep, the Swedish virtuoso who invented neoclassical-metal fusion.
Oh yeah, now I remember...One of my friends played two songs for me and it was really mind-blowing!
Yeah, I'm really into his stuff.  Yesterday I was listening to a song called "Amadeus Quattro Valvole".
Wow, what does that mean, it's in another language?
There are no lyrics in the song, it's an instrumental.  The name of the song is in Italian and it means "Amadeus Four Valve".
That guy is something else.  I heard he's had a lot of singers in his band.
Yes, that's true.  And most of them are amazing!  He has usually been able to get really great, talented singers.
But the don't stay too long?
Nope.  Sadly they usually get in fights with him and he fires them.
Wow, that's ridiculous!  I remember my friend said Mark Boals was his best singer.
He was!  He joined the band after the second album was recorded because the first singer had already been fired.
Wow, that's crazy!
Yep.  He starred in the music video for the single, but the audio featured the first singer!
That's something else.  How long did he last?
He lasted through the tour for the second album and the recording for the third album, then he was fired.
Oh my Gosh!  How did that happen?
He said, "The sad reason is I got in a fight with Yngwie and I was fired."
Well, never a dull moment I guess!
