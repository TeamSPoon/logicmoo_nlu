Who played the best Spiderman?
Tobey Maguire and its not even close.
I beg to differ
How so?
I think Garfield was able to show more emotion.
So Maguire didnt show emotion.
He played a stoic Spidey.
Yeah and Garfield played one that was generic.
No it was emotional and played well.
I think you just hate on Tobey
