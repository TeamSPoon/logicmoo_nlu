Have you seen the original Avengers?
Of course it was awesome, why do you ask?
I was just thinking of re-watching it because I liked it so much.
Could I watch it with you?
Of course, who is your favorite hero in the movie?
I would have to say Captain America.
I like him too though he's not my favorite.
Who is your favorite.
I like the Hulk because he's having an internal battle constantly.
I liked him too.
