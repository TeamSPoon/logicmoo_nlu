I really liked that movie Deadpool.
Me too. Ryan Reynolds played the main character so well!
Yes, I was constantly laughing because of him.
I thought for sure it was going to end sad, but they made it into a pretty good ending too.
Did you ever see him in The Proposal?
You mean with Sandra Bullock? Yes, too funny!
Those two were a great team in The Proposal.
I liked the grandma in that movie, Betty White. She was so cute and funny.
She acts so innocent but she is not innocent at all!
Definitely one of my alltime favorite moves.
