Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
I used to growing up because my parents love them. Do you?
Yeah. Sometimes. Right now I'm listening to Come Together.
That song is awesome!
What did your parents listen to mostly?
They liked the songs In My Life and Yesterday.
I think I've heard of those.
Yesterday is my favorite.
Do you still listen to them now?
Sometimes I listen to the Help! album.
