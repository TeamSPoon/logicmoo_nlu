What's a good movie to make me laugh?
Have you seen "Clerks?" One of Kevin Smith's best movies, in my opinion.
I've actually never seen it. I loved Dogma though.
Dogma was great. George Carlin was so funny in that.
What other movies has Kevin Smith done?
He's done a lot, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
Didn't he do a movie with Jennifer Lopez?
Yes, it was Jersey Girl. Its not funny at all, so don't bother.
I guess I'll start with Clerks and go on from there.
Try to watch them in order. You can watch Kevin Smith grow as a director.
