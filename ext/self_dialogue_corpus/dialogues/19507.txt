What was your favorite song of  2015?
Lean On by major lazer
Dj snake and MO were a huge part of that track too!
Very true.Sorry was not trying to un credit them.
I did not think you were,just thought I would point that out.
Interesting that this was originally offered to nikki minaj and rihanna.
Wow, i had no clue on that. Leon on was crazy popular.
My favorite of 2015.
I think it was the 5th best selling worldwide that year too!
I wonder if they regret passing up on it?
Probably but they have so many hits themselves.
Mo dancing in the video cracks me up.
i know! does she actually think that looks sexy or is she being ironic?
I am not sure, she may just be an awful dancer.
Her posture is like an ape.
It does look hunched and very weird.
Well she is danish who knows maybe cool style there.
Good point maybe that is a cool trend, we have no clue about.
Still am not going to start dancing like that.
Agreed, but I would love to have her vocals.
