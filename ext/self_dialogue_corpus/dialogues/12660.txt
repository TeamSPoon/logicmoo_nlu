I didn't realize that Disney had readapted Winnie the Pooh in 2011!
How did you miss it?
I was out of the country that year. I guess it wasn't released or promoted very much in the country I was in.
Hmm. That's surprising to me.
Was it any good?
I liked it okay. Winnie the Pooh is always such a heartwarming story.
It brings me right back to my childhood. I think I'm going to rent it tonight.
You should. And you know what you should have as a snack while you watch it?
What?
A big pot of honey!
