You know, I miss the Beatles.
Who doesn't? I guess people who don't know what good music is wouldn't.
I just miss how most of their songs were uplifting and had such meaning.
They had a couple of strange ones too.
Well, of course they did. But what ones are you thinking of?
Take your pick, I Am The Walrus, Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever.
I still think that those songs had meaning, it just used interesting language.
I am not saying they didn't, they are just not as obvious as some of their other songs like Let It Be or Blackbird.
I still think they are one of the best bands of all time.
Only a fool would debate you on that.
