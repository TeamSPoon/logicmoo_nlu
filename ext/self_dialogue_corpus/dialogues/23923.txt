Which is more important to you, director or style?
Well since most of the directors I like have or had distinct styles, I'd have to say both.
How about between actors and story.
How about youv'e got to learn how to ask better questions.
Okay, ask me one.
The best "Joker" in the movies.
Christian Bale.
You see how easy it is?
Okay. Best reboot.
I'd have to say "True Grit". Jeff Bridges is a great actor.
Other than that one, I can't think of any right now.
What is your favorite genre then?
I love sci-fi, fantasy best.
I'll go with action, although people figure me more of a brainy or art house type.
Action, you?
Think of it. The best comedies, sci-fi, fantasy and mysteries are basically action with an added sub theme
How would you rate horror?
There are some real good ones out there. Its hard to scare people these days, but I saw one recently that scared ME.
Which one was that?
I don't remember right now. When I do, I'll tell you.
