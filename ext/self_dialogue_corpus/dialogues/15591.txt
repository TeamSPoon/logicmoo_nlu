Hey so what music have you been listening to lately?
A lot of different stuff really.  There is a lot of good country music out now.
I know!  I love the newest Dierks Bentley songs.
Yeah, all his are great.  I'm still jamming that Somewhere On a Beach song.
Yeah that one is good but the radios have kinda played it out.
Maybe, but I still like it.
I like that Jason Aldean Any ol Barstool song.
Yeah, that is a good one.  I first heard it the other day.
Pretty much all of Jason Aldean's songs are great.
Yeah, they really are.  I love his music.
My sister saw him live.
Oh, I bet that was great.  I still love the Big Green Tractor song.
Yeah, me too.  Wasn't that one of his first?
I don't know, but it was one of the first I heard.
They aren't playing out the Any ol Barstool song on the radio fortunately.
No, but I find myself flipping around wishing they would sometimes!
That's funny, so do I!  I'm going to have to buy the album
What album is it on?
I don't know.  It must be his newest.
Yeah, it's gotta be.
