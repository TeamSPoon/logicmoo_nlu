I feel like there's a lot to like about the Star Wars franchise.
One of the thing's I've always liked is the merchandise.
Like all of the toy light sabers and things like that?
Yeah. It's a great way to expose kids to it.
I remember that stuff being especially popular around that time of Episode 3.
Revenge of the Sith, right? I get some of the prequels mixed up.
Yeah, that's it. I really didn't think it was as bad as others seem to.
I agree. It's just that the prequels tried to be a little too kid friendly.
I get that, but I still don't mind it.
I can respect that.
