Have you ever seen the Hunchback of Notre Dame by Disney?
Yes it is pretty good although it is a very loose translation of the actual story.
I think Quasimoto was a great character.
I liked Quasimoto but the gargoyles were my favorite.
Why the gargoyles?
Because as with all Disney sidekicks they usually have the funniest quips and quotes.
I liked visual aspect too.
The animators did a fantastic job on the whole project.
The colors were so vibrant.
I thought the church's details were so realistic.
