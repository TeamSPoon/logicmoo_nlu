Whatever happened to Alanis Morissette?
You know what, I don't know.
I was just curious because I haven't heard any new music from her recently.
Yeah, she kind of disappeared over the past 15 years.
I remember her last song from 2006, where she remade that Seal song.
Crazy? Right?
Yes, it was Crazy.
That does seem like a long time ago.
She came on the scene and rocked it out and then mellowed out.
Yes, I wonder if the mellowing out phase started to decline her career.
Her music was still good after she mellowed out, so I'm not sure.
She was into all that spiritual stuff. I wonder if that's why she also disappeared.
Yes, many of her songs when she mellowed out were about her trips to Asia.
The Thank You song was about India and her trip there.
Funny, how she just kind of disappeared.
Yes. I'm going to go look her up when I get home.
Same here. Maybe she is still making music.
Possibly. Sometimes popular artists continue to churn out albums but we never hear any of the songs because they aren't mainstream anymore.
I bet she has made music since 2006, but we never heard any of her songs.
Possibly. It will be interesting to see what ever happened to her.
