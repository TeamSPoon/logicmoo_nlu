Do you like The patriots?
They're my favorite team.
Why?
Tom Brady and the patriots are just the best team for the past ten years.
That's interesting.
How many superbowls did Brady win?
I can't remember exactly but three or more.
I think it was a little more.
That's an incredible amount.
Do you think they can win more.
I think so but what do you think.
I think Brady will win two more.
Do you think anyone can stop them?
The broncos.
Why?
Peyton Manning has a lot to prove.
Do you think he can still bring it?
I do.
He is intense isn't he.
Yes he is.
