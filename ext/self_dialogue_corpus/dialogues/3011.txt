I really think the seahawks could make it if they only got some better defense and coaching.
I can see why the better coaching could help, but their still good.
Tom Brady definitely has at least another 2-3 playing years in him.
What would say if Gronk didn't come back?
I love Gronk, but I think with the leading running backs and tightend support, it won't be a huge loss.
The Seahawks hopefully will make the right draft picks this year.
I know the Patriots are going to keep Chris Hogan, he's amazing.
What are your thoughts on Edelmann?
Julian Edelmann is another great example of Patriots power.
Who do you think is going to make it at least into the playoffs?
I'd say it will end up being, Pats, Steelers, Buccaneers and the Colts this year.
So basically the Pats versus who in the Superbowl?
I am hoping it will be the Pats versus the Colts.
Yea I'm not a big Colts fan either.
I've never been a fan, so I'd love to see the Pats beat them.
Who else other than the Pats, do you like?
If the Pats aren't going to get in, I'd love to see the Buccaneers win it.
Big possibility for them to make it.
Well this has been a nice talk, best of luck to your Seahawks.
Yes thank you and the same to your Pats.
