Do you listen to rap?
Yeah. I really like '90s stuff, though. You?
Oh, yeah. Definitely. I love Busta Rhymes.
Oh, for sure.
Who do you like?
I like a lot of the females from back in the day, like Lil Kim and Missy.
That's cool. Missy is so classic.
Yeah, "The Rain" and "Hot Boyz" are some of my favorites.
Of course, you can't forget about Timbaland and Magoo.
You know that's right!
