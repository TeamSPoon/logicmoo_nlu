Did you know Disney films have been around for almost 100 years now?
Wow, has it really been that long?
It's been 95 years this year since Walt Disney made a short film called Alice's Wonderland in 1923.
I wonder if he had any idea what would happen in the future.
I'm sure there's no way he could have known. He may have been thinking maybe he would make a dozen or two pictures and be successful, but probably couldn't comprehend how far it would go.
Now there's not only the movies and cartoons, but Disneyland and Disney World, two of the biggest vacation attractions in the country.
Walt Disney made over 600 films himself, and then the franchise continued.
Think how many people he has entertained over the years.
I can't wait to see in a few years what kind of celebration they have for the 100 year anniversary.
Maybe they'll create a special Disney movie just for that.
