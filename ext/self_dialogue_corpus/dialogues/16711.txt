What is your favorite musical instrument?
Well, I played a bunch, as you know.
Right, pretty much everything, showoff.
I don't know if I have a favorite, but I definitely have a few.
So, what are they?
Tuba, obviously. Then the horn, the mellophone, cello, and English horn.
The ... French horn?
Yes. But technically speaking it's not actually French; it's just a mistranslation
So why do we call it that?
Because us Americans are stupid. Look at the scores from around the world: they just call it "horn."
So why those?
They have deep, full textures, and are typically lower instruments.
So why the cello and not the bass?
Well, the bass just sounds "muddy" to me. Especially if they are doing fast runs.
What do you mean?
Well, the notes kind of blend together given the thickness of the strings, which delay sound a bit. Everything kind of runs together.
So why do you like tuba? It's the brass bass.
We only do one note at a time, and have a much more clear tone. Plus, you know...
What?
It sounds like farting.
