Have you heard the new Foo Fighters single?
No! I didn't know they had a new song. What's it called?
The song is called "Run" and the video is really great.
How so?
Dave Grohl directed it, and he's really very funny.
Wasn't Dave Grohl in Nirvana as well?
That's correct, he was the drummer.
Were you a big Nirvana fan?
Yes, they really changed rock music.
I agree.
