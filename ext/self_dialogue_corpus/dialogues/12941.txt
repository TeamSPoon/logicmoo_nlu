Do you know if Princess Leia is going to be in anymore Star Wars movies?
She has a part in eight, but not nine.
I wonder why not nine. They could put her in digitally.
I read where the president of LucusFilms doesn't want to do that.
It's weird. First we lose Han Solo and now Princess Leia.
I know.
I wonder if any other main characters wil not be in nine.
I hope Luke still is.
I do, too. He was one of my favorite characters.
I think lots of people still like him a lot.
