They have this really good bass guitarist.
Cool.  What's his name?
I think John Rocket or something like that.
Sounds like a great band name and band in general!
They really are supreme in music quality and lyrics.
What kind of lyrics?
The lyrics are real deep and some are dark.
I like that kind of lyrical music type.
I find them to be rather unique even though they are from the UK.
Why do you say?
Most bands from the UK put similar styles of music out.
Yeah, I know.  A lot of popular alternative, indie pop is from the UK but also in the US.
Definitely true.  I definitely like US bands.
Me too.  I find them to be even deeper and darker than UK bands.
I played in an alternative band when I was a kid.  I was drummer.
Really!?  I can play bass.
Wow cool.  Maybe we should start our own band!
That would be awesome.  We can both think of a topic and start collaborating on lyrics.
That sounds like a great idea!
I love to write lyrics and play bass!
