What did you do this weekend?
I just stayed home, being a couch potato and watching movies.
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
Everyone's favorite- "It's A Wonderful Life."
Aww, everybody does love that movie. It's timeless.
I like old movies. Jimmy Stewart was such a charismatic actor.
It's no wonder he was a true "movie star" and starred in so many films.
I liked "It's A Wonderful Life" because it showed people having hardships. So many times, families in movies have perfect homes and lives and jobs, but that's not the way the real world is.
I know what you mean. It makes you feel bad if you don't have those things.
I liked how their house had problems and they had to work so hard to fix it.
That was funny the way that knob on the staircase kept coming off in his hand.
I also liked how he had a hard time at work. It's very realistic, because it's rare to work at a job and not have problems with people.
I've had bosses and coworkers who made my life miserable.
The kids in that movie were adorable though. But kids are usually, if they're raised right.
I know what you mean. The "Home Alone" movies, that Kevin is a brat with some of the things he does like stealing his dad's credit card and running up big hotel bills with room service.
He is really bad sometimes. I like the kids in "It's A Wonderful Life." That little girl Zuzu was so cute.
It had such a wonderful happy ending when everyone came to help and was putting money in the basket.
I actually cry every time I watch that ending.
It's Jimmy Stewart's face. It makes me cry too.
When he reads the signed book from Clarence, I get a big lump in my throat. Watching that movie is one of the best parts of Christmas.
