Hi
Hey.
How's it going?
Not bad, yourself?
Not too bad.  You like baseball?
Yeah I like baseball okay.
Do you have a team near you?
Like an MLB team?
Yeah mlb, minors, whatever.
There's not really an mlb team near me.
Minors?
I think there is a farm team near us.
Have you ever gone to a game?
Never been to a game before.
Oh that's a shame they're fun.
Yeah that's what I hear.
Good to take the family to.
Yeah I should do that.
Good talking to you.
