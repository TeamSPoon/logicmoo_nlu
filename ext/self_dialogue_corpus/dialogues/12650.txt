I've always been really curious about Stormtrooper armor.
What do you mean?
Well, it seems like it's really useless.
Because they can still get shot?
I mean, yeah. What exactly does it protect against?
Maybe physical weapons? Or it's like environmental protection?
Like a robot suit?
Exactly. That sort of thing. I bet we can look this up.
It looks like only some of the guns could pierce stormtrooper armor.
Oh, that makes sense then.
