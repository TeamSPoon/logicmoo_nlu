I've been listening to a lot of Goo Goo Dolls lately.
Oh Goo Goo Dolls are so good!
I know, I can't stop listening! What is your favorite Goo Goo Dolls song?
Probably Slide, a favorite of a lot of people!
Slide is awesome. I also like Let Love In and Broadway.
Have you ever heard Black Balloon?
I don't think so. Is it by the Goo Goo Dolls?
Yep, it is on their Greatest Hits album from 2007.
I'll have to give it a listen. Every song they sing is so good.
Better Days is also a good song on that album.
Oh I think I've heard that one. Is about New Years?
Yes! It's kind of bitter-sweet but still optimistic.
Did you know they came out with a new album this year?
No way! Is it any good?
It definitely isn't as good as their older stuff, but it isn't terrible.
I will definitely check out their new album. What is it called?
It's called "You Should Be Happy." It's an EP.
Oh actually I have heard "Use Me" from that album.
Is "Use Me" any good?
Yeah it is okay. It doesn't really have their distinctive sound though.
