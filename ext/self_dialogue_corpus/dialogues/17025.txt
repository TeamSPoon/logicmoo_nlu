I'm really starting to appreciate Kander and Ebb.
What's that?
Who. They're a songwriting duo that does musical theatre.
Oh yeah? Have they done anything I'd know?
Have you seen Chicago? The musical, not the city.
I did. That was the movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones in it, right?
Yeah. There have been a few versions but that's the most recent.
I saw that when it came out. Really dark.
It is, and the music was never my favorite.
I really liked the music.
It's not really my style I guess, but I've been listening to more of their songs lately.
And you're changing your mind?
Somewhat. I still don't like the music in Chicago but a lot of their other shows have good songs in them.
Ok, what makes them different?
There's this song "Yes" from a musical about elderly people stealing coats. The song is just incredibly cheerful!
Yeah, I don't remember Chicago being cheerful.
This song totally is. A lot of their music is, all about living life and loving the city and stuff like that.
Oh yeah? Then why is the dark and gloomy show the one I know songs from?
Maybe people like being gloomy?
Maybe! I'm glad it's not all like that though.
