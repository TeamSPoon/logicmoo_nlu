I have my granddaughter loving the Beatles music.
Oh that's great to hear.
Yes,it means a lot to me.
That's really cool. My younger son likes them too.
We sing along to them a lot
We do too.
In fact my granddaughter has seen paul McCartney live twice with me.
Are you kidding me.
Nope. It was fantastic. A dream come true for me.
I'm sure she'll always remember!
