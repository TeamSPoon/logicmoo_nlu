Who is your favorite artist that you think doesn't get enough respect?
I would say Jamiroquai.
Is that the singer who used to where all of those funny hats?
That is Jay Kay who is the lead singer in Jamoriquai.  Jamoriquai is just the bands name.
Why do you think they are underrated?
They have made some absolutely beautiful albums, but they don't really get much of a mention.
How would you describe there sound?
It depends on what period of their career you are talking about.  The early period, with albums like "Return of The Space Cowboy", almost had a Stevie Wonder feel to it.
What about the later period of the career?
Well, they first came on the scene they started to experiment with more electronic sounds.  The album "Sykronized" mixed funk with more electronic beats.
That is not too different from what we hear on the radio today.
Exactly!  They were ahead of their time.
What is your favorite song by them?
I have so many, but I would have to go with "Space Cowboy".  That was my introduction to them.
Are they still around now?
Yes.  They just released an album a few months ago called "Automation".
How was it?
It was a return to form for them.  It was more like "Synkronized" than "The Return of The Space Cowboy".
How did the fans receive it?
The old fans longed for the album to be more like the early days.  Overall, the fans thought it was a decent album.
