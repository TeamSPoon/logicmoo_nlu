If you could be a superhero who would you like to be.
I think I would like to be Superman. I could just fly everywhere I wanted to go and avoid traffic.
Yeah, that would be a great power to have but I would like the super hearing. I would ease drop on everyone.
I am not sure you would want to hear all the things that I say about you when your are not around.
Oh, your so funny. I would take my laser vision and burn a hole in your desk. You would be too afraid to say anything bad about me.
That would be right, but if i had super vision I could see you coming. Who would you want to be.
Wonder Woman, I would use her truth lasso on our boss and ask if we are ever going to get a raise or promotion.
I am not sure it would work on him, he lies so much he thinks he is telling the truth.
Yeah, that's true, but I could also use my invisible plane to fly to work.
Well, make sure you don't run into a flying man with a "S' across his chest.
