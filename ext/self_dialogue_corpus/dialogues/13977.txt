Lady Gaga has one of the most underrated voices in pop music.
Underrated?? She's always winning so many awards!
Yes, but I think she wins them because of her performances, videos, and presentation. Not specifically for her voice.
Well she excels and performing. Please explain, because I don't understand where you;re coming from
Take for example Madonna. Madonna is a legend, but her voice itself isn't all that great
And you're saying Lady Gaga is similar?
No, I'm saying Lady Gaga is far better. Her voice is a lot more amazing that the average pop star
Oh I see. Yes I saw her singing a capella once in a viral video in a mall.
I saw that too! She sounded incredible!
She is one of my favorite artistes out today.
