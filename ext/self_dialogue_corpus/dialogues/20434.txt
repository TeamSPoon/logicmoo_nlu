Please tell me you have seen the movie called Homeward Bound:The Incredible Journey.
I might have, is it old?
Yeah, it is from the 90s.
What is it about?
It is the movie with the two dogs and the cat that are looking for their way home!
Oh wait, I have seen that movie!
It really is a great story, the owners leave the animals with someone for a while and the animals escape and try to find their way home.
Yes I remember well, the dogs and the cat go through so much to find their owners!
I cry every time I see the end of that movie.
Me too, especially when Shadow, the last dog, comes walking out.
That is the part that gets me too, the poor dogs owner thought he was dead.
They went through some much, especially when the kitty gets sucked into the river, that was awful!
And the sweet man that saves her and cleans her up!
I really like when they are fishing, and they get the cat to get the fish for them. I laugh every time I see that part.
Or how about when the cougar is hunting them, and the dogs use a catapult to get rid of the cat.
That part was really funny. It is such a feel good story.
It will always be a classic, I could watch it over and over.
I like how it focuses mainly on the animals, and rarely the humans.
Me too, that is what makes the story so great.
I would have to agree!
