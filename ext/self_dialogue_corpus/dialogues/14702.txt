Is the Heat still going?
They're doing stupidly well this year.
They haven't lost yet?
Not once.
There's something crazy about that.
It's not like they've got a perfect team.
They've got an absurd line up.
Yeah, but they're not the best.
They're fairly good though.
The NBA in general has weird team set ups.
Yeah.
People just get distributed weird.
That keeps everything going though.
I mean, I guess.
It keeps the teams more dynamic than the NFL.
Yeah, definitely.
Less money and more contracts.
It's more diversified.
Yeah.
It's more complex.
