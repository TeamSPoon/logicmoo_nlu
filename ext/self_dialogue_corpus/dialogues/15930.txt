so what do you think about kanye west?
kanye west? what about him?
I mean he is so full of himself.
I guest most of artists are that way.
No that is not true. This guy is way too much about himself.
I agree that he seems to have some sort of god complex.
Yes, Exactly. He thinks that he is god of music.
We saw that god complex when he tried to interrupt taylor swift.
Oh yes! I still cannot believe that anyone can do that actually in reality.
Only a god can do that. And that is what he considers himself to be.
He is probably delusional about himself, because most of his songs are just mediocre stuff.
I totally agree, It is not that he is super talented or something.
But come on, everyone knows that kanye is known to do things normal people wouldn't do.
I totally agree, Reminds me when our previous president called him something he would never call anyone.
Oh yes I totally remember that. But I think kanye deserves to be called that.
He recently met with our now president trump.
well, two celebrities meeting with each other, what can you say.
Yes, I can imagine those two talking with each other about who is bigger god.
Yes, it is rare to see two people with god complex getting along with each other.
Well, you can't say they get along with each other just because they met for one time.
