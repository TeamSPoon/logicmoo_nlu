You want to go see a movie?
Sure. What do you want to see?
I dunno. Something comedic?
Nah. I'm not in the mood to laugh.
A dramatic movie maybe?
Like what?
That new movie starring Jack Nicholson?
Not really a Jack Nicholson fan.
How could you not like Jack Nicholson? He's the best!
You're entitled to your opinion.
The Shining, A Few Good Men, As Good As It Gets...One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?
Am I supposed to suddenly be impressed since you've listed those four movies?
It's Jack freaking Nicholson!
So? He's okay.
Jack Nicholson is a supreme actor and his movies...they're amazing.
I'll repeat--you're entitled to your opinion.
Forget it. You want to go see a movie starring someone else?
Who?
There's that movie with George Clooney in the lead.
Not really a George Clooney fan.
