Do you ever listen to music that's not from the United States or not in English?
Not really, I guess I don't hear that much of it on top 40 radio.
Well, kind of depends which radio stations you listen to, but you're right that there's not a ton on radio.
Should I be listening to musics from other places or in other languages?
Totally. I'm super hooked on tons of music in Spanish.
How did you get into it?
Well, partially it was because I lived in the southwest and Los Angeles for a while and there was so much good stuff going on. But I also got really addicted to this podcast.
What podcast?
Alt.Latino. I'm in love with so much stuff on that podcast.
Can you give me some suggestions?
Sure. I love this band called La Santa Cecilia. They're from LA.
What do they sound like?
They have this amazing smokey-voiced female lead singer, and then an accordion, some drums and guitar.
Sounds kind of like a rock band.
It's like a rock band meets LA Chicano music. It's awesome.
How would I find their music?
It's on iTunes like anything else, man!
Okay. I'll check it. Any particular album I should have a look at?
Well, they're all good. But some of their stuff is also awesomely political, like songs about immigration and migrant workers.
Wow. Intrigued. Definitely going to go download!
