Do you like Amy Grant?
Why, yes I do! I love her album Heart in Motion!
Released on Myrrh Records?
Yes, the very one! What's your favorite song from that album?
I love "Baby Baby"; it's grant at her best. What's your favorite song from the album?
I prefer the subtlety of "Ask Me."
What year did that come out?
I think it was 1991.
That was Grant in her prime.
I couldn't agree more.
What has she done since then?
I have no idea.
You'd think someone with so much talent could do better.
It's hard to come off something as good as Heart In Motion. I mean, how can you get better?
I don't know.
Exactly. Heart In Motion was perfection.
I listen to that album once a month.
That's the same with me. Maybe once a week sometimes.
It's really great. Can she ever match it?
I think her prime is gone.
