Do you recommend The Prestige or The Illusionist for a thriller?
The Prestige.
So they're both about magic.
Right.
Why do you prefer this one?
It has a surprise twist you most likely won't see coming.
Oooh, nice. Like an M. Night twist?
Yeah, it's pretty devastating and shows a ton of commitment.
Nice! Sounds good.
Yeah, The Illusionist isn't bad either, but not really a thriller.
