You fan of Old School?
Yes, that was a great movie. Probably one of the greatest comedies of our time
Yeah, it was pretty good. I liked Will Ferrell's character.
Yes, he definitely stole the show.
I liked Luke Wilson's work in it as well
He was kind of bland in my opinion
I liked how he played a straight face for so much of it.
Yeah, but Vince Vaughn was better in his role
I agree, he was pretty good as well.
Oh and don't forget Snoop Dog!
