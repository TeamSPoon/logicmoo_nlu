Only a few more weeks until we get some football back.
Yeah, it's only pre-season, but I'll take it.
Who is your team?
The Raiders.
You guys had a decent run last year.
Yeah, the regular season was really good, but the playoffs were a bit of a let down.
Yeah, what happened there?
Well first our starting QB got hurt right at the end of the season.
I forgot about that.
And then our backup QB was OK but our left tackle got hurt and we couldn't protect him.
That's brutal. I thought you guys had a real shot last year.
Well, we're going to be strong again this year.
Except that the Raiders have a really tough schedule this year.
Especially the last few weeks of the season.
Well, you'll still have a better season than my team.
Oh yeah, who's that?
The Los Angels Rams.
Yeah, they were pretty brutal last year.
I know, there's been so many changes in the off-season because there's so many things to fix.
Well, at least you've upgraded the head coach and defensive coordinator quite a bit. That should help.
