Are you ready for the NFL to start.
yes. I am walways ready.
I like it just some of the rules.
They change them every year,
What do you think about the coaches?
I think they are good.
SOme could be tougher.
yeah I think some coaches lack discipline.
If they had more of it the teams would be tougher
I agree.
Chuck Pagano has promised to be tougher on his team this year.
I think the Colts would do so much better if he was.
He is a good coach.
I agree he just lacks on giving discipline.
I cannot wait to see him get tougher.
it will help the team in a whole if he does.
I think it will make them better if he does.
I agree.
He needs to be tough on the whole team.
That would be amazing.
