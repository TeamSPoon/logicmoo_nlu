What is your favorite music genre?
I will listen to pretty much anything except for probably heavy metal.
You even like classical?
Sometimes. If I'm in the right mood for it, I'll listen to it.
Wow, I was not expecting that answer!
Well, I played a lot of instruments so I have an appreciation for what goes in to composing and playing classical music.
That's understandable. I don't really care for it, but then again, I really only like pop music.
That's sad! You need to expland your horizons.
Pop isn't that bad.
Some of it is okay. Who is your favorite?
Of all the pop singers out right now, I'd have to say Lady Gaga.
I like her too. There are just so many younger pop artists now that I really don't care for.
Who?
I guess Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, and Ariana Grande are a few that come to mind.
I love all of them. I just can't help it!
Well, to each his own I guess. I will say though that I thought what Ariana Grade did for Manchester was amazing.
Yes, she really showed a lot of maturity. What are your thoughts on Miley?
I didn't really care for her as a country artist and I don't really care for her as a pop artist either. I just don't think she has the best voice.
I just think it is interesting to see how much her music as evolved.
That's true. She's really managed to cover several genres since she started.
