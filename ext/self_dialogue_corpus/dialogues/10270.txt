Did you like any of Patrick Swayzes action films?
Like Ghost?
No, that is a romance. I mean like Point Break.
With Keanu Reeves?
That one.
I think it was a cool like surfer action one.
I liked that the bad guys were all sporty.
They were not that bad of bad guys too.
The people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them.
I think that was just good acting on their parts.
