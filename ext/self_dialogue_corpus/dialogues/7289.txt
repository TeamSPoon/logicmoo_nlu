Okay so there have been 3 cars movies out so far.
Yes, I know.
Which do you think is your favorite.
I'd certainly have to say Cars 1.
Well I like Cars 2.
Well Cars 1 is just where everything started, you know?
Yeah I can see that. It's where all those funny characters came around.
Yeah, characters like Mater, Lightning, and Doc Hudson.
I think Mater is my favorite character. He's hilarious.
Yeah you're totally right. Larry the Cable Guy did a great job with that one.
