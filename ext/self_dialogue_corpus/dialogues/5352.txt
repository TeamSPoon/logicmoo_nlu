Did you know that James and The Giant Peach is a Disney movie?
Really? I never even knew that.
Yeah I always thought Tim Burton had directed it but nope Henry Selick did.
It does remind me of his artwork though.
I liked the book a lot and Disney did a great adaptation of it for sure.
My favorite character is the centipede.
He is funny. Richard Dreyfuss was a great choice for him.
Susan Sarandon was a good choice for Miss Spider as well.
I liked though at the end that James got a good family.
It was an odd ending but a happy one for sure.
