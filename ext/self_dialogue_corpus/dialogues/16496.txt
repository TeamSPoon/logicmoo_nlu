Hey, are you a fan of Taylor Swift?
Yes I am, but I don't know too much about her.
Well, what is your favorite album she made?
Well, I like the Red album, but I don't know too many more.
You should let me make a few suggestions.
Sure, go right ahead.
Are you familiar with Speak Now or Fearless?
No, I haven't heard of those.
Oh, those are earlier records and will probably suit you if you like Red.
So, what popular songs are on those two albums.
Speak Now and Back to December are my favorites.
Ok, I'll be sure to listen soon. Have you heard the 1989 album?
Yes, it's not my favorite.
Why not? I thought you liked Taylor Swift too?
I do, but these are newer and more mainstream.
What do you mean by more mainstream.
Well, it seems like the record labels are dictating what kind of songs should be showcased.
Oh ok, yes, I heard that happens a lot to established artists.
Yes, I hear that too.
Well, I have to go to lunch now, but thanks for your suggestions.
