Let's watch Hellboy.
Let's do it.
Who is your favorite character in the movie.
I like Hellboy obviously.
I like him too, why do you like him though?
Well he's got this rough and tough attitude he likes cats and he has a rockfist that is actually a key.
Yeah they do a good job at presenting him as this big bad dude when in fact he's just a little teddy bear.
Well I wouldn't go that far but yeah he has a soft side.
I mean he has cats and lots of them the dude is a sweetheart.
I guess.
