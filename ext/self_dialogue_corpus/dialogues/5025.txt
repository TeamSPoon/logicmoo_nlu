What are the Braves doing?
They are a tough team to judge.
I thought they were rebuilding but some of their signings dont say so.
Yeah guys like Dickey and Colon dont signal that.
Exactly. And Kemp.
He was a good player once.
Yeah a while ago.
They just need bodies.
Then they signed Ryan Howard.
Freeman bats left so I dont get that one either.
Every time I think they are building for the future they sign an old guy.
They need a reason to go to the park
No one wants to see RA Dickey pitch anymore.
Well that could be true but rotations need veteran leaders
So what? Lose alot get a better pick those kids will learn
Maybe the idea is to trade them for a better arm
They could do that but I dont think he  gets you a good return
Sure he does if he has a good year
Hasnt pitched well in 9 years
Thats not true I think he was a Cy Young candidate a few years ago
