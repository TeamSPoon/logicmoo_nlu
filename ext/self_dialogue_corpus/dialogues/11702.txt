The more I learn about the beatles I think I like george harrison.
Oh ya why is that?
Well I have realized he was deeply spiritual. Had converted to hinduism.
That is cool.
He also is the one who wrote a lot of my favorite songs.
Which ones specifically?
While My Guitar Gently Weeps and my sweet lord are probably top two for me.
Those are good ones. Did he also write something?
Yes he did. that is really romantic song and I love it as well.
I find each member so talented and creative. Hard to say which one was my favorite.
