Any good movies playing this weekend?
hmm...doesn't look like it.. Oh wait, there's the new Terminator Genisys movie.
I heard it wasn't a bad movie, I'll go see it if you come with me.
Yeah, we can go right now if you want to.
Have you seen The Hateful Eight yet? It's so funny!
No, but I heard great things about it. I guess I have to see it now.
Yes, you have to! Let me know when you go to watch it. I wouldn't mind watching it again!
Probably tonight, if you're not busy.
Oh my gosh, The Hunger Games Mocking Jay is finally out!
No way! The first movie was so good. We HAVE to go see it right away!
Right? This one will probably be BETTER. Wanna go see it? Sometime tomorrow?
You don't have to ask me twice! Yes!
My dad wants to take me to the movies but we can't decide what to watch.
How about Tomorrowland? That's something I think your dad would like.
I don't know, that movie is a little boring. You sure he would like it?
Well, probably. Doesn't hurt to try.
Yeah, true. Okay, I guess I'll take him tomorrow.
Have you seen Trainwreck yet?
No, I haven't. Have you?
I thought we could go later to watch it together. That's why I asked if you saw it yet.
