What's your favorite scary movie?
I don't have one.
How can you not have one?
Well... they don't really scare me. At all.
Okay so what was the last horror genre movie you watched?
It's been a LONG time so probably... Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. You?
Wow, that is old. Do I have to pick just one?
Nah. What's your top three?
Probably Rob Zombie's "House of 1000 Corpses", Rob Zombie's "Halloween", and "Get Out".
That's a lot of Rob Zombie.
Is it? One can never have too much Rob Zombie in my opinion.
I do enjoy his music.
He's just as good as a horror director.
I can see that. Do you like B-movies?
Almost as much as I love horror.
Oh? What's your favorite B-movie then?
That one is easy. It's always been "Army of Darkness".
Oh I frikkin love that movie. With Bruce Willis right?
It's Bruce Campbell.
Oh yeah! I loved him in "Burn Notice" and "Bubba Ho-Tep".
