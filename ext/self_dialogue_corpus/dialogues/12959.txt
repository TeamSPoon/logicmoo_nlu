Okay, what was one of the biggest shocks in Stars Wars?
What do you mean by biggest shock?
I mean, the most shocking or unexpected revealation in the movies.
Well, the whole "Luke, I am your Father" was a doozy when you first learned it.
Yes, it was definitley not something you'd see coming.
Them there's the whole Luke and Leia are brother and sister thing.
Oh, don't remind me, makes the whole kiss on Hoth a bit akward.
Yeah, goes from " You lucky so and so" to " I hear banjos, run!"
Other than that, I can't think of any more real shocking revealtions.
Neither can I, since with the prequels we all knew where we were going in the end.
