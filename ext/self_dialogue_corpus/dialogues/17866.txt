Man that thing was crazy.
What you talking about?
I just downloaded You Can Spend The Night by Guy.
That was that thing. Wasn't that on the New Jack City Soundtrack?
No. I think Fantasy was.
I forgot all about Fantasy.
Guy was the truth.
No, the late eighties were the truth. All that good classic r and b.
I know right. Heavy D, Teddy Riley, Aaron Hall, all that new jack swing.
Teddy Riley was killing the game. Super producer indeed.
I think he inspired Puffy to get into the music game.
I know. Teddy and them were doing parties down at Howard Homecoming and Puffy was a buck, soaking it all up.
I wonder if those two ever hooked up to make a track together.
I wouldn't be surprised. Teddy had his hands in everything back then.
I think he produced some stuff for Janet Jackson too.
Janet had everybody on her team. Teddy Riley, then Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
I think she is supposed to be going on tour later this year.
Janet better sit her behind down.
You trippin'. If she come to Philly I'll be buying tickets.
Get me one. I love Janet Jackson like a fat kid love cake.
