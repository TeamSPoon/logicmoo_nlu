Stand by Me is a good movie , isn't it?
I never saw it!
Really It was a story about four boys in the fifties looking for a boy that got killed by a train.
Sounds Good!
It is a classic, can't believe you never saw it.
Who was in it?
Will Wheaton, River Phoenix , COrey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell were the boys in the movie
Oh Okay.
And it was based on a Stephen King story called THE BODY.
I am going to have to watch it.
You definitely should.
I will tonight.
It has some great scenes, like the blueberry pie scene and the train track scene.
I can'tbeliee that I never heard of it.
Me either. My kids watched it about three thousand times when they were young.
I will have to get it.
Yea and let me know what you think about it.
I will!
Ok see you later.
Bye.
