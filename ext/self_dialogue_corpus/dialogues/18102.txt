I really like classical music, though it's not very popular.
Not very popular? I like it too, who is your favorite composer?
Definitely Mozart. I love his music , it's great for studying, or listening to while you are working or whatever
Yeah, I like Mozart too. What's your favorite piece ?
The Turk March. It always lifts my spirits, and reminds me of when I used to do ballet. What's yours
My favorite piece by Mozart or any composer?
Well, we were talking about Mozart - but whatever others you like too.
I really like the Molto Allegra, it is so upbeat. I can loop the track for hours...
Well generally about an hour of listening to one track is enough for me then I listen to another.
Who do you like besides Mozart?
I like the Fur Elise by Beethoven and also his Fifth Symphony
You like the Fifth Symphony by Beethoven too? I love that.
Yeah. Don't you like when the contemporary artists jazz it up a bit and change the beat and tempo
Love it. Its sort of like a hip hop meets jazz meets classical flavor
So when was the last time you went to listen to a good pianist
I don't know, it's been ages. They never have anything good at the Philharmonic.
Well you should try the Civic theather or the Embassy theater. They have good local artists playing alot of the classical stuff.
Oh yeah? You will have to go with me to one of their concerts
Love to. Hey how about next weekend? There's gonna be a group of composers at the Embassy Theatre
Really. I would love to ...... But I have to work!
