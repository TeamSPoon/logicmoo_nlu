How cool were the pod racers in The Phantom Menace?
They were definitely pretty cool, but really dangerous looking.
I think all of the vehicles in Star Wars look pretty dangerous.
Yeah but I wouldn't mind having an AT AT to drive around.
I loved them in the Hoth scenes, even though they fell apart.
That was one of my favorite scenes out of all of the Star Wars movies!
I loved the Ewoks in that movie too! They were so cute and cuddly.
Did you know that they rank as one of the most hated characters in the franchise?
No way!  They were super cute and helpful.
They were a little bit corny.  But they werent bad.
