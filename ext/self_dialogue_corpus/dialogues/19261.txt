Do you remember the band called Ratt?
Yes. They sang Round and Round.
Yeah, back in the 80's.
They were a hair metal band.
Most of them were back then.
I saw them once in concert.
Were they any good?
They were okay.
So you wouldn't have gone again?
No. Good songs but show was just okay.
What was the lead singers name?
I think it was Stephen Pearcy or something like that.
I wonder what happened to them.
Don't know.
I haven't heard about them in a while.
I heard years ago about reunions.
So I assume they're done.
Probably.
Well they were good while it lasted.
No more hair bands.
