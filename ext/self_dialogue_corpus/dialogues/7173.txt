What's your favorite Disney movie, bro?
I have to go with The Lion King?
Nice, why that one?
It holds up greatly.
Explain how, I'm curious.
It has memorable and lovable characters, important themes, and an overall great storyline.
Awesome explantion.
Thanks now can I explain why I love my second favorite; Beauty and the Beast?
Sure, go for it!
It's totally because I had a childhood crush on Belle.
