Do you think the Bills have a shot this year?
Not a chance. Tyrod Taylor hasn't done much of anything.
He went to the Pro Bowl and doesn't throw any interceptions.
But he also doesn't throw for many yards. Sammy Watkins is going to waste on that team.
With Watkins healthy this year, he should get at least 1,200 yards.
If he stays healthy. That's a huge if.
And what about LeSean McCoy? Shady should have another fantastic year.
Pinning your hopes on an aging running back is never a good idea.
Well look at the defense. They added Micah Hyde and should be a lot better.
They also lost Stephon Gilmore at cornerback. That's a huge loss.
Well the new coaching staff is all about discipline and that will make a big difference.
Rex Ryan was garbage last year, I'll give you that, but Sean McDermott is no miracle worker.
And the new front office will start bringing in the right people and turn the team around.
They've been saying that since 2000. Nothing there will ever change.
Don't be such a pessimist. This is the year the 17-year playoff drought ends.
They've also been saying THAT forever.
When Tyrod is leading the Bills on a game-winning drive in the playoffs, you'll feel pretty stupid.
When Tyrod is doing that, who will you be playing against in your Madden video game?
Very funny. I'm telling you, the Bills will be in the playoffs.
In an AFC East that has the Patriots and Dolphins? I doubt it.
