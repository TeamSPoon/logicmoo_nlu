Mulan was such a great movie.
It's been years since I've seen it
I loved it as a kid. It just felt different somehow.
It does feel a little different from most Disney movies.
The songs were also really great.
I don't really remember them that much.
Maybe it's personal. I had to do a parody of one for an assignment in high school.
Like, with your own lyrics?
Yeah. I think I got an A.
Of course you did!
