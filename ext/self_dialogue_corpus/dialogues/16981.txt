Have you heard anything new by The Get Up Kids?
No do they still make music?
Yeah they tour alot
I thought they were all doing their solo gigs
They keep touring their landmark album, Four Minute Mile
Oh ok, do they get a big turnout?
Not really, I think its more or less a few hundred people.
They used to rule emo.
Yeah I know, its amazing what happened.
I love their pure sound
Their lyrics were top notch for me.
I think that was another plus for me.
Whens the last they made an album?
I believe 2004.
I would go see them on tour again
Yeah so would I
Do you think its in the realm of possiblity?
No I think they are done
They all got old I guess?
They just have their own projects now
