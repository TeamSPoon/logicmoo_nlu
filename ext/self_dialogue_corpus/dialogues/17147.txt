Do you remember that old song by Franz Ferdinand?
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. It has a bizarre music video, doesn't it?
Yes, that's the one. I can't remember the name of it.
Hm. I think it was Take Me Out.
You're right! That's it!
I haven't heard that song in a long time.
Me either, and it's the only song I know by that band.
Same here. I remember when it was popular, MTV would play the music video all the time.
I know. I can remember watching it with my sister.
Do you remember when the Black Eyed Peas were really popular?
Yes, I can remember my sister and cousin listening to My Humps repeatedly.
They had some other big hits, too.
Yeah, I like their song I Gotta Feeling.
That song always puts me in a good mood.
Me too. What did you think of their song Boom Boom Pow?
I like that one better than I Gotta Feeling.
Me too. I like the beat.
When's the last time they released an album?
I don't know, but it's been a while.
Yeah, I wish they would release some new stuff.
