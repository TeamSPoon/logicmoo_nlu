I still can't get over that World Series from last year.
Cubs win! Cubs win!
Honestly, I was rooting for Cleveland.
Not me, after they already won the NBA finals there was no way I would root for that town.
It was more because I grew up a White Sox fan.
A southsider, eh?
No, I actually went to school on the north shore.
Whereabouts?
Evanston.
That's a lot different than the south side!
Yeah, but I grew up watching Ken Harrelson broadcast the Sox games on WGN.
Wimpy and Hawk! Who was your favorite player?
I always liked Frank Thomas.
The Big Hurt!
But there were a lot of good players from that era. Robin Ventura was another.
Do you remember Black Jack MacDowell?
Of course! He was probably my favorite pitcher.
Did you see the Sox when they won the world series, then?
Actually, I was out of the country at the time and I missed it.
Bummer!
