Did you see The Dark Knight trilogy?
Ya I did. I saw two of them in the theater.
Which one was your favorite?
I think I liked the third one the best.
Ya mine too. I really liked how intense it was.
That was my thought. I saw it twice in the theater.
I only saw it once but I just rewatched them all.
The first one seems a little slow compared to the others.
I think Christian Bale did a great job playing Batman.
I agree he really looked the part.
