How do you think Age of Ultron will go?
I REALLY hope he obliterates the Avengers.
How badly?
Well, they need to kill someone off.
Who should go?
I want Thor to die because as humans we cannot relate to him.
True, I never really cared about his character. He's also the weakest actor.
I hope he kills a good amount, actually. Marvel does a bad job with villains.
Yeah, I agree.
I'll be really mad if he loses as bad as Ronan the Accuser did.
