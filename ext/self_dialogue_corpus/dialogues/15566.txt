So what is your favorite Del album?
Just solo work or collaborations also?
All of it, whatever he has been in.
That is quite the question, there are so many good ones.
How about top 3?
That makes it slightly easier but I need second.
Take your time, it is hard.
I would have to say Deltron3030 will be in there.
Of course, many people have that at number one.
I do really like his older work too, like Both Sides of the Brain.
That one actually was not one of my favorites.
I just really enjoyed hearing his beginnings.
I can understand that, it was a little too rough for me.
The last one would be Future Development
I am not sure I know which one that is.
It was not as popular as the others.
What songs were on it?
Stress the World, Faulty, and Corner Story were all on it.
That album may have slipped through my hands.
You have to check it out!
