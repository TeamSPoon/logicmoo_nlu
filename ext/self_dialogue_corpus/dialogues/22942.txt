Do you like Tyler Perry?
No I don't like him. I love him.
Me too. His movies are so funny.
Which of his movies was your favorite?
My favorite was "A Madea Christmas."
Was it released in 2009?
No, it was released in 2013.
I seem to have forgotten what happened in the movie. Can you help me remember?
Yes of course.
I know that Tyler Perry was in it, but what was her role.
She acted as Madea, as usual, and she was Eileen's (Anna Maria Horsford) aunt.
Lacey (Tika Sumpter), was Eileen's daughter right.
Yes she was. She secretly got married to Connor (Chad Michael Murray).
Yes I rememnber now. That was the reason why she didn't go to her mom for the cristmas right.
Yes that's corret. And so the mom, with the help of Madea and Oliver (James Roch Lemon II), went down to the farm to see Lacey.
Who was Oliver?
He was Lacey's ex-boyfriend from high school.
But didn't Oliver help Lacey's school?
Yes his company donated $100,000 to the city.
Wow, I will watch it again. It was a great movie
