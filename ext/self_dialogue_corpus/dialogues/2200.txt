Do you watch NFL football on the holidays?
I watch every Thanksgiving.
Do you look forward to the Cowboys or the Lions playing more?
I look forward to the Cowboys game more but I watch both.
They added a third game in 2006.
I know the third game teams are random each year.
I love eating turkey and watching football.
During half time of the NFL games my family and I play football outside
Bet you don't get paid like the NFL players.
Nope! We have a good time though imagining we are scoring touchdowns.
I love how the teams wear throwback jerseys during Thanksgiving games.
That is pretty nostalgic.
Do you ever think they will replace the Lions or Cowboys with different Thanksgiving teams?
I doubt it. The tradition is too strong at this point.
They have tried and failed in the past.
I think it helps now that they offer a third Thanksgiving Day game.
Good point. The other teams are less likely to complain.
Those poor guys have to play instead of eating turkey.
They get paid millions. I am sure they don't mind being a little late to Thanksgiving dinner.
I bet they work up an appetite playing football.
