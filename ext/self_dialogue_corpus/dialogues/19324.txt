Hey guess who I'm listening to right now.
I dunno who?
I'm listening to me some Fergie right now.
Oh yeah? She is oh so sexy.
Yeah, she is a legend.
She made so many good songs I like her "MILF" song and her "Glamorous" song.
Yeah, I'm listening to "Glamorous" right now.
Do you think she is better when she make songs with Black Eyed Peas or without them?
I like it better when she is alone making songs, because it's just her, I like her a lot so, prefer all the attention her.
Yeah, me to I agree, I like her "Fergalicious" song, it's just her as the main singer in it and it's saw awesome.
I like Black eyed Peas too.
Me too I remember all their songs was being played all the time.
I know someone who has all of their albums, she lives close to me, she has the whole collection.
I like "Big Girls don't cry" song, I play that song all the time on my stereo.
I'm just thought about it, she kinda looks like Mila Jovovich!
Oh my god, she does doesn't she?
Wow, that's freakey, I have idea how that happened.
Separated from birth maybe?
That's funny, who knows could be. They sure do bear a striking resemblance.
They could be related, lots of folks are related to each other and don't even know it.
