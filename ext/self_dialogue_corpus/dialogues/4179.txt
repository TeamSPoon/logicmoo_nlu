Can you believe it has been 25 years?
Twenty five years for what?
Since Silence of the Lambs was first released, of course.
Wow.  I cannot believe it has been that long.  Anthony Hopkins was so good in that movie.  Didn't he win an Oscar?
Yes.  For Best Actor.   No wins for Hannibal or Red Dragon though.
Well they were not nearly as good.
Do you think he regrets doing them?
He might regret playing the same character but I doubt he regrets the money.
No kidding.  Did you know the author of the screenplay never even watched the film?  And then he wrote both sequels.
No, I did not know that but I am thinking that maybe he should have watched.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant.
