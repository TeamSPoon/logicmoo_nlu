Have you ever seen the original Psycho?
One of the most thrilling and mind bending movies ever!
Yes, the way Anthony Perkins played Norman Bates was great.
Yeah he had this odd normalness to him that was scary.
Almost too normal though.  There was always something off about him.
Of course, the best part was the show stabbing though.
Yeah, so many movies have made a joke of it.  But that snappy camera work, and suspense is unparalleled to this day.
It was.  Today is often all special effects and no true suspense anymore.
I know what you mean.  It's like they don't work hard anymore.
We need another Hitchcock type director in Hollywood.
