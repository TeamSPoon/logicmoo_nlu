What is your favorite live action Disney movie?
That would have too be Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
I've never seen that one, but it sound like a animated film.
No, it's an fusion of animation and life action.
Okay, tell me about it.
Its set in a world where cartoon characters live side by side with real, live people.
Okay, so I take it the character Roger Rabbit is framed?
Yes, for murder and Eddy Valiant(Bob Hoskins) end up having to help him prove his innocence and save his life.
So cartoon characters can die in this world?
Yes, but only by being immersed or sprayed with a mixture of acidtone, turpentine, and benezene called The Dip.
