Do you like the Beatles?
Of course, they're one of the greatest bands in the world!
What's your favorite album?
I love Sgt. Pepper, because it's so iconic and the entire album just flows... they were so creative at that time.
I agree, it really changed the landscape of music.
Do you have a favorite album, besides Sgt. Pepper?
Well, Abbey Road is really top notch... that's another album where they just came together (like the song title!) and made a masterpiece.
Yeah, it's almost like they knew that it would be their last time together, and they wanted to go out with a bang.
I also like Revolver... that's really an underrated album, and really brought psychedelic music out of its shell.
You don't hear too many people put that on their Beatles lists, but you're right... it is an influential album.
