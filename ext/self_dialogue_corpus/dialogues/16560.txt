You were in band, orchestra, jazz, and all that in high school, right?
Yup, concert band, marching band, jazz band, pep band, orchestra, choir,
Okay, Mr. Showoff, I get it. Did you have a favorite moment that led you to pursuing it in college?
Well, I had learned trumpet but was getting bored after 8 years. So I took on tuba.
Tuba is not normally how things begin.
Ha, well, I learned it by myself. And got really good at it.
How good is that?
Within a year or so of learning it, I made lead in county band, second in district band, and fourth in the region band.
So you were one of the top tubists in the state?
Yeah, after just a year or so of learning, without lessons.
I wish I had kept going.
What did you play?
I was an oboist!
I love the oboe! Did you ever try out the English Horn?
I wanted to, but it never came up in our band or orchestra. We didn't have a horn.
You know the English Horn is neither English nor a horn, right?
You know the tuba is neither a two nor a buh, right?
That made no sense.
Well, neither did your joke.
It wasn't a joke. It's just one of the many instruments given improper names.
