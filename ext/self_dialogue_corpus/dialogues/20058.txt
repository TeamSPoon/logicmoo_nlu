Have you seen the James Bond Movie Spectre?
No, is it good?
YES! It's very good. I like Daniel Craig.
I like him, too. You think he's the best Bond?
I still think Sean Connery is the best Bond for the time. But, Daniel Craig is really good.
Yeah, I agree. I wish he'd do more movies.
Me, too. But, man, he was born to play James Bond. lol
Have you seen his movie Dream House?
I did. I really liked it but it flopped.
I was thinking about watching it but didn't know if it was any good.
It's definitely different. His wife is in it, too.
I didn't know he was married. I'll get it next time around.
Yes, he's married to Rachel Weisz. I also liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
Oh, I loved that movie!!
Me, too. I love David Fincher movies. I think he's my favorite director.
I like a bunch of his movies. Gone Girl and Benjamin Button are two off the top of my head.
What about Se7en and Fight Club. I love those two movies.
That's because Brad Pitt is in them.
Well, it doesn't hurt. I heard that David Fincher may be directing the sequel to WWZ.
That would be awesome. I loved WWZ.
