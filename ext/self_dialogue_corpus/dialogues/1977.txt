Hi.
Hey.
You a fan of the nfl?
yep sure am.  You?
Yeah same here.
Who's your team?
I like the Bills.  you?
I like the Rams.
Did you like them before they moved to LA?
Not really.
Oh that's interesting.
I saw they were moving back to LA and wanted to give them a shot.
Rough first season out there.
Yeah I knew there were going to be some growing pains.
It's a shame they fired the head coach.
Yeah I like Jeff Fischer a lot.  Was too bad.
Who is the new coach?
I can't remember.
Well good luck this season.
You too.
