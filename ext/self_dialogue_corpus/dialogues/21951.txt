Will Smith in movies, good or bad?
Used to be good, but bad recently
Did you ever see Independence Day?
Oh man, unfortunately.
That was a big movie back in the day. I believe 1996.
Yes, you are correct. Bill Pullman was the president in that one.
Oh that's right. He flew a plane towards the end.
Yes, was pretty unbelievable
And Will Smith punched out the alien in that one scene.
Yes, that was very campy.
Didn't he pull out a cigar after that one as well?
Yes, made me cringe in that one.
Didn't the aliens blow up a lot of famous buildings in that one
Yes, the White House, the capitol and some big buildings in LA
Mid 90s were full of all kinds of action
Yeah, I heard they made a sequel recently.
Yes, I heard it was horrible.
So don't go see it?
I wouldn't if I were you. Save your money
Yeah that's probably a good idea.
