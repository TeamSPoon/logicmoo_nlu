Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album Joanne?
No I haven't, is it good?
Yeah, its good and very different then her previous stuff.
I am still listening to Art Pop, I really like that one.
I love applause off that album, I think its one of her best songs.
Me too, but her best stuf is still off The Fame and The Fame Monster..
I can't believe how many hits she had between them.  Bad Romance killed it.
The video for Bad Romance was fantastic.
I know, with those crazy razor glasses and the weird white costumes.
It totally fit her look and the song though.
