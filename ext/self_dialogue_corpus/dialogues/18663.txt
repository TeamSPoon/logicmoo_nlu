What is your favorite band?
I really don't have a favorite band, do you?
Thats funny because I do not have a all time favorite either.
How about a favorite artist?
Yes! I have favorite artists for sure. My all time favorite is Johnny Cash.
Oh yeah? I'm not super familiar with Johnny Cash.
Have you heard the song, "Ring of Fire"?
Oh yeah, I know that song!
That is probably his most popular and across the board popular song.
Right on! Have you ever seen him live?
Yes, actually I was lucky enough to see him when he was alive.
That must have been exciting?
Yes, I was only about eight years old but I do remember him singing that song!
Oh cool!
Do you have a favorite singer?
Yes, I think one of my favorites would be John Lennon from the Beatles.
Oh, that is a great pick. I love the song called Imagine.
That is an epic song! I also love the song Love me do.
That's old school for sure !
I think we both love older music genres !
