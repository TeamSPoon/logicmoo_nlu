I just watched a special on Michael Jackson.
I never really cared for him.
Are you serious?
Yeah, that really wasn't my kind of music.
How could you not like his music though?  It's so catchy!
There are a few songs that everyone knows, but it's nothing that I love.
So you don't sing along when "Billie Jean" comes on?
I didn't say that.  I just really don't care for him.
What I'm saying is the guy had so many good songs!  Everyone has a few favorites.
Just because I have a few songs by him that I know doesn't make him a better artist.
Do you know how many current artists were influenced by Michael Jackson?
I'm sure a few.
Not a few.  A lot.
Really?
Yes, really.  Not just musically either; as performers.
Yeah, I guess he was a really good performer.
So you wouldn't have wanted to see him live in concert?
Like I said, I just don't like the music.  So no.
You are crazy.  He is the King of Pop.
To each his own.
