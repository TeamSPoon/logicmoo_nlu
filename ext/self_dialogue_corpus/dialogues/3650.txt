Did you ever end up seeing that movie, "Split"?
No, I think it might really freak me out. Is that the movie about the guy with split personalities?
Yeah, and he kidnaps these girls and his various personalities torment them.
But wasn't one personality trying to save them?
Yes, and they were definitely fooled at first. But his other personalities always take over before they can be rescued by that particular one.
That is so scary. Do you think it's realistic?
Oh, no. Not at all. I think the disorder is very real, but it is sort of a far reach.
That makes me feel better about seeing it. Who plays the main character?
James McAvoy is the lead character. He is absolutely brilliant in it.
Wow, he is an awesome actor. I'm definitely going to check it out now.
