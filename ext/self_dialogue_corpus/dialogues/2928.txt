I am ready for football.
I am ready to watch the Raiders.
Didn't they move this year
They moved to Las Vegas
I wonder if that will affect the players.
I think it may in a way but the new ones it wont.
They did good last year in the playoffs.
I am a big fan.
I like the raiders.
I do to they are one of my favorites.
I hope them being in a gambling city does not affect them.
Me too that would be devastating.
It is good if they needed to though.
I agree.
Other teams have moved before.
I think the rams may have.
I am not sure.
Roger Goodell approves them.
So that must mean it was for a reason.
Yes I agree
