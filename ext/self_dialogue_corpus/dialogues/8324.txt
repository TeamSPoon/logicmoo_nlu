Whose pop music song are you listening to?
Katy Perry's Firework.
I love her! I also like Taylor swift now that she is pop.
I do too and I like that her music isn't just confied to pop.
Me too! Did you also hear the new song by Bruno mars?
No what is it called?
24 carat magic, it has a great beat.
That is actually one of his recent songs but the new release is Versace on the Floor.
Oh I haven't heard that! When did it come out?
June 12,2017 is the release date but I had his album so I was already listening to it.
