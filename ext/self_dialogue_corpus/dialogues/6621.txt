Hey, I just read an article in a magazine about a Disney movie that's coming out.
Cool, what's it called.
It's called Gigantic, and you will never guess what it is about.
I think it will be about something really big.
Yeah, it is the Disney story version of Jack and the Beanstalk.
Wow, what a cool idea. When is it coming out?
Well as usual that is a bit fuzzy, the article said next year, but I Googled it and Google says 2020. So who knows.
I hate when they do that. Get us excited and then delay, delay, delay.
Well I looked it up on Wikipedia and it seems it was scheduled for 2018, but they have already pushed it back to 2020.
So we have a gigantic wait for Gigantic then!
