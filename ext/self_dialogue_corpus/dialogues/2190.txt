Are you ready for this year's NFL season to start?
Yes! Although, I'm sure that my team is already out of contention
Which team?
I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan.
Last year was definitely not their year.
I know. We're a long way from their 1985 championship.
Well, they had a lot of injuries last year. Maybe they'll turn it around this year.
Yeah, maybe. Who are you rooting for?
I'm a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys
Prescott did great last year, but too bad we didn't get to see much of Tony Romo. I've always liked him.
Well, he's retired now, so it's onwards towards a Superbowl ring
I have to admit, the Cowboys here phenomenal last year.
It isn't often that a team sends two rookies to the Pro Bowl
We'll, they sure deserved it. Especially Ezekiel Elliott for breaking Tony Dorsett's rushing record
How they didn't make the Superbowl last year, I'll never know
The lost to the Green Bay Packers, a wild card team. How did that even happen?
The Cowboys lost by a field goal. That was a sad day.
And then the Falcons stomped the Packers. Poetic justice.
Yeah. Well, it's going to be our year this year. Just you wait and see.
Good luck to you. Me, I'm still rooting for my Chicago Bears.
