Have you seen the movie Flubber with Robin Williams?
Yeah I seen that long time ago though.
I just watched it again recently and it was just as funny as when it first came out.
Oh I bet, even though it seems so different since Robin passed away though.
What was your favorite parts of the movie?
I love the basketball game scene, if only we could actually have our very own Flubber that would be so cool.
Do you think it is actually possible for that kind of thing to actually happen though?
I'm sure it could happen if they have the right equipment and funding.
What did you think about the ending with the wedding?
I thought that was cute and then flying off in the car was just awesome.
