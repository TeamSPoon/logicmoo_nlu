How do you think Kylo Ren and Rey are related?
Well I think it's obvious that they have some sort of connection. Maybe they're brother and sister.
If they were, do you think that might soften Kylo's outlook a bit?
Not really... I mean look what he did to his own father!
You've got a good point there. I kind of feel like that symbolized the last of the good that was him leaving and him turning totally to the dark side.
I'm still wondering who this Snoke character actually is.
I heard a quote from the director that said he isn't any sort of sith or character we've seen before.
Is that so? Well that's a bit disappointing. I kind of liked the fan theory that said he might be Grand Moff Tarkin.
But didn't Moff get blown up with the death star?
I mean you never know man. In this universe, characters always some back.
