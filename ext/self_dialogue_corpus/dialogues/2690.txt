The Seahawks may just not have it anymore.
You think? They still have some great players.
I agree, but they are getting older too.
Yea, they are, but they are still talented.
Yea, but eventually age usually catches up to you.
Yea, it might start to catch up to them, but Russell Wilson is still young.
You're right. He is very young, but he could ware down as well with the way that he plays.
Yea, he plays hard and he is fearless. Thats for sure.
How many other quarterbacks can you think of like him?
I don't know. Theres a couple. Marcus Mariota comes to mind first.
Yea, he could be one of them. Rodgers may be another one, but he doesn't run as much.
Yea, those are two good choices. Griffin was, but I do not know what to even consider him anymore.
There are always a few speedy quarterbacks, but the pocket passers tend to succeed more.
Yea, it does seem like that. They are able to stay healthier and be more productive.
Yea, health definitely helps.
Yea, it has for Brady. That is for sure.
Yea, it has helped them win multiple superbowls.
I agree! Health goes a long way.
Yea, it definitely has for the Patriots.
Yea, we will see how they fare this year.
