Can you give me a good Van Damme  movie to watch tonight?
Sure, how about Timecop?
That sounds good. Is it full of action?
Yes it is.
How bout another great action movie?
How about They Live?
Who directed that one?
John Carpenter
I thought he was a horror guy
He is, for the most part, but They Live is a great action film.
