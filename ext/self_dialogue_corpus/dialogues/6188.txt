Do you remember the candelabra from the beauty and the beast?
I think it was Lumiere?
Oh yeah, he was my favorite when I was a kid.
I liked Mrs. Potts with her little tea cup kid.
Right, wasn't his name chip?
Yeah, I probably can guess, but what was your favorite song?
Obviously it was be our guest.
True, I can't help but singing that when I stay at a hotel.
Me either, I'd freak if my furniture came to life and started singing though.
I'd have a "ball" ...get it?
