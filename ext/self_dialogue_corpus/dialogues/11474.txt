Musically speaking, who do you think the most talented Beatle was?
Wow, that's a hard choice. Every member of the Beatles was incredibly gifted.
True, though I've always had a soft spot for John Lennon. His songwriting skills were unparalleled.
That's true, but didn't he write most of them with Paul McCartney?
Yes, he did while he was with the Beatles. His solo stuff is just as good though, and Paul obviously wasn't around for that.
I see your point. "Imagine" really is an amazing song.
I think my second favorite in terms of musical talent is George Harrison.
Really? Most people seem to go for John or Paul.
Well, George wrote and sang "Here Comes the Sun", "Something", and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Those are three of the Beatles greatest songs.
He did all three of those? Wow, he really doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, does he?
