Heard any good new music lately?
Not too much actually.
Yeah me neither, I wish some of the newer bands got their names out there more.
Me too, the music industry just isn't the same as it used to be anymore.
True. At least there are tons of bands now though.
Yeah, that's true.
You always see like fifty local band names you've never heard of at concerts.
Have you heard any good ones though?
Not really, though my sister knows some good indie bands.
Indie? What's that?
It's a genre of music I guess.
What's it like?
A lot of newer bands you see are indie, it's kind of like pop music.
Oh, very interesting.
Sometimes, it depends how good they are.
You really don't hear much about indie bands, most of what you hear on the radio is by popular names.
Yeah that's the way it is, pop music and pop artists have taken the spotlight.
I don't like a lot of their music anyways.
Me neither, but some of it is good.
They should have more radio stations dedicated to new music.
