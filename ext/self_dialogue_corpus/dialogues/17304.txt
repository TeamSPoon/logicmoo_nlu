You know who's music I really like?
Who?
Neil Diamond. I know it's not cool to admit, but I just love his songs.
Well, he's a little old and grimy but Cinnamon Girl is pretty good!
Cinnamon Girl? You're thinking of Neil Young, I said Neil Diamond.
What's the difference?
Only everything! Neil Young plays classic rock and Neil Diamond plays classic pop.
Are you sure? I mean, Horse With No Name was good too, I liked that song.
No, that's still Neil Young. Neil Diamond sang Sweet Caroline.
I've never heard that song.
How could you never have heard Sweet Caroline? What about America or Cherry,Cherry?
What about Heart of Gold?
That's still Neil Young! Sweet Caroline, bum ba dum, good times never seemed so good.
You aren't making any sense.
Neil Diamond is a musical icon. He might not be as popular today, but I can't believe you don't know who he is.
Wasn't he a part of Crosby, Stills, & Nash?
No! That was Neil Young too, Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young.
I think you're confused.
I'm not, but it's ok. Who do you like?
I really like that guy in the sparkly shirts who sings Cracklin' Rosie.
