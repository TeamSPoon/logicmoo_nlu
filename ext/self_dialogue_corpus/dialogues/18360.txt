Did you see Lady Gaga's Superbowl performance this past year?
Yeah! Did you?
I did! What did you think of it?
I thought the music and the theatrics were pretty good. What about you?
I really liked the way that she riled up the crowd with her stage presence.
Yeah, Lady Gaga has the ability to do that. Are you a fan of her music in general?
I am! She has some really good songs.
I know, right? I like her a lot too.
What are your favorite songs?
Well, I really liked the collaboration that she did with "Telephone".
That's a good one! My favorite is "Born This Way".
That song really spoke to me!
Some of her older stuff is catchy too. I liked "Pokerface" and "Just Dance" as well.
Those are really good ones! Do you remember "Paparazzi"?
That was great! I loved the music video to that!
She's so original! I love the way that she turned pop music on its head.
Have you ever seen her live in person?
Unfortunately I haven't yet! I'd love to though.
She's playing nearby next month. Do you want to get tickets?
I'd love that! It's a plan!
