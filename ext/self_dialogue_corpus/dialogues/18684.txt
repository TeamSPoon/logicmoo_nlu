Remember that Wilson Phillips song from Harold and Kumar?
Wasn't it Hold On?
I think so.  Didn't it play in Bridesmaids too?
Come to think of it, yeah.
Okay.  Which movie was it better in?
Well, I liked Bridesmaids a whole lot better, but the song was so much better in Harold and Kumar.
Seriously?  Why?
Because it was totally unexpected in Harold and Kumar and it didn't make sense there at all.
Yeah, it didn't make sense there.  I don't get why you liked it better in it.
Pretty much nothing in that movie made sense.  That actually was one of the parts I liked.
Didn't Wilson Phillips have a couple other songs that were popular?
Yeah, a few others.  The only one I remembered was Release Me.
Oh, okay.  Now I remember.
Yeah, they kind of all sounded the same.
Yeah, they had that typical 90s sound.
Yes, exactly.
Were you a big fan of theirs?
Not really.  I liked those songs, but I wasn't surprised they faded out.
I kind of was, I mean being who their dad was.
Oh, yeah, they were related to the Beach Boys.
