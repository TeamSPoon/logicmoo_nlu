Do you like Prince?
Yes but I lost interest when he started getting political.
I think he was best during the 80s.
Yes during his purple rain days he was the king.
I think Michael would disagree.
Ha! Yes I'm sure but I think they had different types of fans.
Yes I know they had a rivalry.
They did but I don't think either of them needed to worry.
Why do you say that?
Well, they both had very different styles and I feel like their fans were from different worlds.
That's true.  I think that if they weren't listening to prince they probably wouldn't listen to michael anyway.
Yeah almost 2 different genres
Prince was very sexual in his performing.
I think it's possible that the crotch grabbing might have been michaels way of competing.
Maybe.  There was so much talent between the 2 of them.
Imagine what they could have done as a team?
I don't think the music world could handle that much awesomeness.
No I don't either.
Then again since they had such different styles.
It might have been a disaster.
