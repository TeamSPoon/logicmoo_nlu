Hey are you ready for another round of "The Worst MOvie Ever"?
No I haven't gotten over the last one you told me about!
Too bad ... I'm going to tell you anyway !
Great.....I can't wait..... Just kidding! Go ahead.
"Ankle Biters" is THE worst movie of all time...it has to be.
Ok don't keep me in suspense what is it about?
It's about vampires..not only is it about vampires but hey are dwarf vampires.
What??? On no and????
They can be out in the day time!!!!
Oh no freaking way!
Wait it gets better....They are dwarves so they can bite you on the ankles and not have to on the neck like regular vampires.
Holy cow this does sound pretty bad! Is that all you got?
Nope there's more.The acting...
What about it?
Well it's filmed in rural Alabama and I am pretty sure the roles played in the movie were the locals just being themselves!
Super low budget......wonderful
think the main characters may have had one or to acting lessons but I wouldn't bet on it.
Am I going to have any brain cells left after watching this movie.
I don't know if you will be able to make it though the movie. I don't know how some got talked to pressing on to DVD!
Wow that was pretty bad. I think I might be a little scared now!
