Have you ever seen The Next Three Days?
No, who is in it?
Russell Crowe stars as the lead, its a great thriller
Whats it about?
His wife gets arrested and he breaks her out
That sounds pretty cool
Yea, I really enjoyed it
The suspense in breakout movies are something I love
I would highly recommend it
I will definitely check it out!
