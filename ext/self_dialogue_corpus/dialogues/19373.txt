So have you ever listened to Led Zeppelin?
Of course I have!  They've been around forever.
I know, they were one of my original inspirations for music.  I learned to play guitar because of them.
They have great music.  Everyone's heard Stairway to Heaven.
Yeah, that's a great song.  I really love Kashmir.
Yeah, that one is beautiful.  It goes on and on forever but it's a great song.
I love the crescendo and how the beat builds throughout the song.
I know.  I wonder what happened to them?
Well, you know they were from London, right?
Well yeah.
At first they weren't even that popular.  They were called the New Yardbirds, but then they changed their name.
I didn't know that about them.
Yeah, and in 2007 they had a tribute concert in London.  I think they've been doing tribute concerts for awhile.
They must be pretty old now.
Well yeah, but it's neat that the surviving members are still getting together and making music.
Yeah, that's definitely neat.  It shows true passion for music.
Definitely so!  I'd say they were definitely as big a hit in the 1970's as any band could be.
They were certainly influential in music.
I don't think they'll ever go out of style.
No, probably not.
