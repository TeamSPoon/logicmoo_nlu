Do you like to play music or just to listen?
I'm no good at playing any instrument.
I wish I were but really I'm not either.
I want to learn guitar.
That's always been my dream too. We should take lessons together.
I'd love that.
I have some DVD lessons we could start with.
OK. Want to start today?
Sure. Do you want to play acoustic or electric guitar?
I don't really have an opinion about that. I'd have to try both to see which I preferred.
I prefer electric. It's easier to play and you can just not plug it in if you want a gentler sound.
That makes sense.
Youtube is a great source for guitar info. People show you chords and stuff.
I do watch videos on there sometimes and I try to play along with them.
Any luck there?
I have learned a bit that way.
Feel free to email me the links to good videos.
I will do that.
My goal is to accompany myself while I sing.
Me too. I've always wanted to do that.
