What kind of rock music do you like?
There are different kinds?
Oh yeah, for sure. It's a really various genre, you know? There's indie rock, classic rock, punk rock, annoying radio rock like Nickelback...
Guess you learn something new every day.
Yeah, you do. So. Answer my question!
I guess I'm into punk.
Good answer, we can stay friends.
I didn't even know that was on the line.
Oh, it is. You're lucky I'm letting punk slide. I'm a huge Metalhead.
Metalocalypse is pretty cool, can't lie.
