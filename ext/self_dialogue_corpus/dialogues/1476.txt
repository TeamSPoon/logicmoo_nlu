So how do you think the Dolphins will do next year?
I think they're not ready to overtake the Pats yet, but are getting closer.
Yeah, they seem to be stuck in that middle gear.
What they need is a better quarterback.
Tannerhill is good.  But he's just not an elite guy.
I know, ever since Dan left they haven't been lucky at that position.
It's tough, because he is too good to let go, and not good enough to keep.
That's the worst kind of QB if you ask me.
Yeah, makes it hard.  You can't do anything.
Maybe he'll turn it around next year.
Maybe, they did make the playoffs.
Yeah, they have been in and out over recent years.
Too bad they still have to get throttled by the Pats every year.
It makes it hard when you have to go through legends non-stop.
Well that's how Miami had if forever when Marino was up there.
Yeah, for the longest time the Pats were a joke.
Yep, people forget that.  They were in a division with Marino and Jim Kelley.
That must have been hard.   Getting pounded by hall of famers 4 times a year.
Yeah, now they do the pounding.
I agree.  They rule the AFC.
