Did you see that recent Disney movie
Moana? Yeah it was so good!
I was laughing so much in the theater
Yeah it's very funny, who was your favorite character
I loved the character played by the rock
oh, he was great in this movie. I loved his song
Your Welcome was the best!
I even bought the soundtrack
I loved the animation
Yeah the colors just popped out!
