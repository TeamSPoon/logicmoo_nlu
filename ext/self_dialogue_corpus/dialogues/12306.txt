Did you know Carrie Fisher was only 21 when she played in the first Star Wars?
No!, I did not know she was so young.
I like princess Leia, she was a very tough lady in Star Wars?
Yeah, she was not afraid of anything.
Harrison Ford is great in the Star Wars movies too.
The best part of the "Star Wars movies is the great special effects.
