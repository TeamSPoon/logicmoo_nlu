Who is the most annoying person in Star Wars?
I'm thinking of someone but I don't know if he's really a person
Are you thinking of Jar Jar Binks?
Yeah, that's exactly who I'm thinking of!
What don't you like about him?
He is the weirdest person ever, I hate his voice
I think it is kind of funny, he is just comic relief
I just don't find him funny
At least admit he is unique and a good fihgter in the first movies
Okay, I don't really hate him but I think his character was very silly
