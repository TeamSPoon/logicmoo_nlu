Is Drew Brees finally going to have a bad year?
No I don't think that he will ever have a bad statistical season.
The Saints aren't that good of a team anymore.
Well no, but Brees still puts up gaudy numbers from the quarterback position.
Do you think that he will ever reach the Super Bowl again?
No, not with this team.
So you see him going to another franchise for the last couple years of his career?
Maybe, but he's already late-thirties in age.
What about Sean Payton and his prospects for another Super Bowl?
He'll probably get back there again.
I think Coach Payton is a genius when it comes to offense.
Yes, he was really effective when his offense was fresh and new.
So you think defenses have caught onto his offensive scheme?
Yes, but I won't rule him out if he adapts his playbook a little bit.
I guess Payton still has a long time to go in his career.
That's the great thing about being a coach, because you can continue into your seventies if you want.
Yeah, as a player you only have about fifteen playing years to accomplish everything.
Do you think that Brees will go into coaching when his playing days are over?
He could, because he seems to get the cerebral part of the game.
Yes, quarterbacks usually make the best coaches because of their understanding of playbooks.
