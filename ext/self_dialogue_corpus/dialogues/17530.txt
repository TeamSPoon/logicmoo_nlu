Justin Bieber is the worst artist of all time.
Well, that's a strong opinion.
Not opinion, fact mind you.
So you obviously aren't a fan.
He has no musical talent, can't dance, can't do anything.
But he's obviously popular.
Only because stupid teens think he's a pretty boy.
Well, there's something else people must see in him.
No, people just don't recognize good music when they see it.
Alright, so you're obviously not a fan.  What music do you like?
It's pretty obvious that Bob Dylan is the only artist that matters.
Goodness, you're so old fashioned.
Bob Dylan is the best artist of all time.
I respectfully disagree.
He's written all the great songs.
Yet nobody could name even one or two of them.
Oh please, this is a horrible argument you're making.
You're not convincing yourself.
You could use a much better palette of music to choose from.
I could say the same as you!
