How did you like Oz the Great and Powerful?
Overall I liked it okay.
Sounds like you have reservations.
Well it definitely had its ups and downs.
Such as?
The plot wasn't so great.
Ha ha, okay what else?
The actors tried, and the scenes and costumes were great, but something didn't gel.  And James Franco was miscast.
So you liked it on a surface level?
That's right, for entertainment only.
