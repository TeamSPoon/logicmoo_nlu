Do you remember the 2006 Academy Awards?
Not particularly. Why do you ask?
That was the year that Crash won best picture.
Oh yeah, it beat out Brokeback Mountain
Yes, that's the one. Audible gasps from the crowd.
What were some of the other movies nominated back then?
I remember Walk the Line was one
Oh the Johnny Cash one?
Yes, that's it.
I really liked that one. Did Joaquin Phoenix win for that one?
He was nominated, but didn't win. Phillip Seymour Hoffman won that year.
I thought someone won for Walk The Line.
Yes, it was Reese Witherspoon
Oh right. She played Johnny Cash's wife.
Yes, June Carter Cash.
I never saw Brokeback Mountain.
Nor did I. I did see Crash and I liked it.
Yeah me too. Addressed a lot of issues that are still prevalent today.
Yes that is true.
I'll have to check it out again.
