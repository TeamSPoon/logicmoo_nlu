Have you seen Inglorious Bastards?
Yes I think that is a brillian movie.
It is probably my favorite Tarantino Movie.
I love also the Kill Bill series.
Those are amazing too.
Uma Thurman is a great actress.
Inglorious Bastards has such a lively spirit to it.
I agree I love how they handled the Nazis.
Yes especially when they talk about collecting nazi scalps.
The movie has a good mixture of humour and violence.
I agree and I think throughout it is very exciting.
One interesting thing is Tarantino wanted to handle the Star Wars franchise.
Really, I do not think that would have been good.
I know Tarantino is great for a specific genre.
Yes I could not imagine the new Star Wars movie in a Tarantino style.
Yes but it would be interesting to see if it was available.
So back to Inglorious Bastards I think Brad Pitt plays the role well.
Yes I completely see him as that character.
Have you seen any other Tarantino movies?
Yes of course Pulp Fiction.
