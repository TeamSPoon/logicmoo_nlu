Eagles, Broncos, Chiefs, Seahawks, Raiders, Cardinals.
What about them? Why are you just rattling off teams.
These are the teams that the Giants have to actually work at beating this year.
You're right and we play Philly twice this year.
Eagles will win both games, but I think all the others are going to be close.
What do you think is going to be the deciding factor?
Offensive line. They need to show up to the game.
You're right. They did nothing to improve the situation this summer either.
We spent a lot of time concentrating on defense and I'm not sure it was the right move.
Well the league is filled with offense heavy teams this year, so maybe it was the right thing to do.
But the league is also heavy with big defenses.
Ok. So what do we need to get around Seattle. They're the real threat.
Prayer and maybe some wizardry. They are going to eat our O-line alive
I hope Eli worked on his agility drills this summer because he's going to be doing a lot of running that game.
I doubt we will see any more movement from Eli, he's not getting any younger.
Maybe his age will impart some wisdom that will help them will a win against them.
They passed on a lot of O-line talent in the draft, maybe he should have imparted some of that wisdom on Jerry Reese.
He's made a lot of questionable decisions lately.
Yeah but he's been one of the best at assembling talent since he almost got fired.
Questionably the best.
