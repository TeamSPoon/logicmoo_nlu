So did you see the new Beauty and the Best movie with Emma Watson?
Not yet, but I loved the old animated on.
Yeah me too.
I'm a little bit unsure if I want to see the new one.
Yeah so am I. But I hear the acting and CG is wonderful.
I heard that as well. But live action remake seems a bit iffy to me.
True, but you never know you just might like it.
Yeah, maybe I can give it a chance.
Let's go see it together.
Sounds good to me.
