How did you like Frozen?
I liked the sisters. I thought their relationship was believable.
Elsa was kind of mean to her sister.
Sisters are like that. She was trying to protect her, plus she was literally the ice princess.
Anna literally sacrifices herself for her sister, as an act of true love.
It never would have worked if she knew that was what she had to do.
I liked that they deceived the audience into thinking it would be the kiss.
I agree. I was expected the Disney trope of the true love kiss.
Olaf was a cute character. His Sony about summer was hilarious.
They had to put in comedic relief from what's a pretty harrowing story otherwise.
