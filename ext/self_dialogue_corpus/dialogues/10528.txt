Hey, the kids are bugging me to take them to the movies for their birthdays.
Yeah? Take them then, they will have a good time.
But I don't know any good kids movies.
Take them to see the Minions movies. The little yellow things from the Despicable Me movies? They will love it.
Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that. Sure, that sounds good.
Hey, wanna go to the movies with me? I'm bored right now.
Sure, what are you wanting to see?
The new Mission Impossible movie. Rogue Nation.
That's a good choice. I would love to go with you.
I was about to go to sleep until this movie came on. I ended up staying up late watching the whole movie.
Yeah? What movie?
Spy! With Melissa McCarthy. It was so good, I might watch it again tonight.
Ha ha, okay let me know. I will watch it with you.
Yeah, sure!
My friend wants to go with me to the movies, but I have no idea what he wants to see.
Take him to the new Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens. All men like Star Wars, haha.
Okay, that's true. Well, good idea then. Thanks.
Do you wanna go see Straight Outta Compton with me?
Sure okay, what time?
In about 5 hours, I have to go to the store first!
