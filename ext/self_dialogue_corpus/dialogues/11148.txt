Did you see the dress that Kathi Lee wore on the Today show yesterday morning?
Yes, I liked the color.
Really?  I didn't like that color on the dress because I thought it was too bright.
No, neon and bright colors have made a big comeback.
I can't believe that neon is making a comeback
Yes, my teenage daughter owns lots of neon shoes and leggings.
It is weird how fashions from other decades make comebacks.
Yeah I remember when bell bottom jeans became popular again.
I actually saw Rihanna wearing a pair of bell bottom jeans to an award show recently.
Oh yeah I think I saw that show, she looked weird.
I know I saw an actress wearing a fishnet top in People magazine last week.
Oh no, I was hoping that style of top would never make a comeback.
What about those floral dresses I've been seeing around lately?
I think they are way too loud.
All those bright flowers on the new dresses look like they clash too much.
And what kind of sweater or shoes would you ever wear with something that looked like that?
I think you're supposed to wear solid colors with a print.
I really think Emma Watson dresses well.
I saw Emma Watson at a publicity event for Beauty and the Beast and she was wearing the most beautiful gold dress
She has really good fashion sense
