I loved that feathered Jonathon Simkhai gown Hailey Baldwin was wearing to the Art of Elysium gala in January.
The orange one with the cut outs?
Yes, the burnt orange one with the cut out panels and the long skirt split.
Orange is really big in designer fashion lately.
I know, I saw Naomi Cambpell wearing the most gorgeous burnt orange Atelier Versace gown recently. It was covered in sequins.
I loved that one too. Did you see what she wore to the Golden Globe awards?
She wore two different dresses right?
Yes, she wore two lilac dresses for the award show and the after party.
I thought the lilac Versace gown that she wore for the red carpet was perfect for her.
I agree she knows her fashion. She always looks polished and beautiful.
Have you seen the new Balenciaga spandex boots?
I think so, those are the above knee boots that Miranda Kerr was photographed in?
Yes, she has the black ones but they also come in red and purple.
I don't know if I like them.
They are definitely different. Sometimes I am not a big fan of shoes or boots with a very pointed toe.
It depends. Sometimes a pointed toe can work and other times it just doesn't look right.
I prefer a classic riding boot most of the time.
I do too, but I can never seem to find a simple, classic riding boot that I like.
Have you looked online at frye, they have a lot of great styles.
I will definitely do that soon. Thanks!
