Who can we say are the best male vocalest ever
can we pick any era
yes
alright I would say Elvis
agreed
Michael Jackson
I would put him on the list
how about Frank Sinatra
yes he deserves a spot
I think Michael Buble needs to have a place on the list too
I agree the way he has brought back the classic music is great
yes and he has brought a whole new generation to know these old songs
Phil Collins
yes for sure
how about Jon Bon Jovi
I do not think he would be in the top 10 myself, maybe further down the list
I think the top 10 is fitting for him
How about we add Neil Diamond
for sure he get in
Love Neil Diamond
