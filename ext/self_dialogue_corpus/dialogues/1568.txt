Hey, what's up?
It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
EJ is playing with some real vets.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
My guy at least won a Super Bowl in the past five years.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about.
They started 3-1. At least they were competitive.
If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract.
No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
Free agents usually don't go for the bidding wars, but I guess they are staying put for now.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
