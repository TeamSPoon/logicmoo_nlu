What did you think about how the Star Wars movies portrayed Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader?
It was done well I think. He went from an innocent little boy in 'Phantom Menace" to a full-fledged Sith in "Revenge of the Sith."
Yeah, I think the movies did a good job showing how Senator Palpatine manipulated him as well.
Yeah, that actor did a good job. He gave off such a creepy vibe.
And while I wasn't a huge fan of Hayden Christiansen as Anakin, he did an alright job and I enjoyed the movies he was in.
Ewan McGregor really stole the show though, right?
Yes! He was so awesome as Obi Wan! I don't think they could have picked a better actor for that role.
I agree, and I really thought he added a new depth and layer to the whole Obi Wan and Anakin relationship.
Yeah, such a tragic storyline.
Yeah, but at least Anakin found his way again before he died in "Return of the Jedi."
