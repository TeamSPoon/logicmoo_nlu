Do you think Coldplay is a good group?
Yeah but I dont think they make pop music.
What about Boy George?
He is definitely a pop musician.
Did you find him offensive?
Not really, all musicians are quirky.
I really like what he did in Culture Club.
It was a phenomenon in the 80s.
Would you ever listen to that kind of music again?
Yes I love pop sensibilities.
