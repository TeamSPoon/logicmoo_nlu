Do you like 'Airplane'?
That's my favorite comedy movie! It's so stupid.
I know, I love it. Just the simplest jokes but they work so well.
That type of stupid humor is the best. Do you like 'Groundhog Day'?
Who doesn't?! It's a classic and Bill Murray is funny in everything.
'What About Bob' is another great one with Bill Murray, but lesser known.
I don't think I've heard of that, I'll have to see it.
It has Richard Dreyfuss in it too - it's so cringey and awkward.
Bill Murray always does awkward humor better than anyone.
Oh yeah, he's one of the all time great comic actors.
