I cant wait for football season to start
I agree and its not just for the game, then it will be fall and we can get a break from this heat
Who is your favorite team?
I love the redskins
really, being from new england I would have assumed the Patriots were your team
They are my second, who is yours?
I love the cowboys
whew, as long as you dont say the giants
ya, I agree, even though they did really well last year
Redskins havent done much in a few years
I agree, I am hoping this year we will come back
Have you ever gone to the superbowl?
I havent, its too pricey for me
I agree, I also like being home with family and friends and watching it together
we should plan an event together for this year
Thats an awesome idea, maybe it will be redskins vs cowboys
That would be something
I will bring the wings
I will bring the beer
I cant wait
