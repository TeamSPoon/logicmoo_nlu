My wife asked me last week if there was anything special I wanted for my birthday next month.
Happy early birthday! How old are you going to be?
45. For her last birhday, my wife wanted something really special. So she was checking to make sure in case I wanted something big too.
What did your wife want for her birthday?
A fancy ring with gemstones and diamonds she saw at the mall. It cost over two grand.
Wow, and you bought it?! You're a really great husband.
I know, so don't you think if I wanted something nice I should get equal treatment?
Of course, what did you ask for?
You know how I love football, and the Pats, and Tom Brady. I want an autographed football helmet they have listed online in the official NFL shop that's signed by Tom Brady.
That sounds like a great present for you! What's the problem?
My wife refuses to buy it. She said it is way too much money for something that sits on a shelf.
Uh oh, how much is it?
Fifteen hundred dollars. But it's authentic. It's hand signed by Brady, and has a certificate from the NFL that it's authentic.
Would it lose value later if someone suspected it wasn't authentic?
It has a special hologram with a number that will show if it's tampered with. This helps guarantee it's the real deal.
Did you try telling your wife it could actually increase in value after Brady retires?
I tried to tell her it was an investment and could always be sold later, but she thinks the value will go down.
Generally that might be true, but when you're talking about one of the great, well known players like Brady, the value should at least hold even.
It's a Super Bowl Champions helmet, signed by a five time Super Bowl Champion, so I'm sure it would still retain its value.
Well, the only thing you can do is just keep mentioning over and over how you bought her the ring she wanted, but if she isn't going to reciprocate, then in the future you will just get her small sensible gifts, and that will scare her into getting you that helmet.
