Are you planning to watch that new movie Alien:Covenant?
Definitely! I'm super excited to see this new installment.
Did you catch the latest trailer for it?
It looked super exciting.I was amazed by who they chose for the new cast.
I can't believe they got that one funny actor in this movie.
Are you referring to Danny McBride?
That's the one. I'm looking forward to seeing this other side to his acting.
What do you think about David in this movie? My friends think he's going to be a bad robot!
Looks like he might be since there is another version of him in this movie.
It also has that one actress from that recent Harry Potter movie.
Fantastic Beasts?
Yes her. She looks like the type of actress that does really well with crying.
I'm just glad that they made another Alien movie.
I enjoyed Prometheus so I hope it moves us closer to that answer they were seeking in that movie.
The one about where we as a species came from.
Yes. I also hope they can get more into the alien species with this movie too.
Wouldn't it be crazy if the next movies to come out in the future brought the Predator movies into play?
That would be epic!
When are you planning to go see the new Alien movie?
We should make it a date and go check it out now.
