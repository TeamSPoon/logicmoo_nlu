What are your thoughts about the Cardinals?
You know I think they actually are going to put it toegether this year.
I agree.
The have done a great job drafting and developing players
Its been sneaky though.
Its sort of slow and steady over the last few years
I just worry about Palmer
I know. He is still good but I don't know how much longer than can ride that horse.
He certainly looks like he has lost some arm strength
But with a defense like that around him...
Yeah, no kidding.
They play great D
If they could only get some consistency  otherwise they would be dagerous
I wonder what the solution to Larry Fitz will be in the future.
No kidding. I think they need to stop looking for the next one of him.
And just find a good receiver...
Exactly!
I wish teams wouldn't try to replace a role player with someone in that same role.
Its impossible
And it never works
