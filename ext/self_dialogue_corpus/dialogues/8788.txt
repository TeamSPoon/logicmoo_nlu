So I'm thinking about buying tickets to Blink 182 tomorrow.
Are they in town?
Yeah.  Tickets haven't really been in demand though.
They're kind of a bit of date.  Doesn't seem like people like them as much.
Well, one of their singers left and it just hasn't been the same.
Yeah, the guy moved to Angels and Airwaves.
Tickets are relatively cheap though.  Want to go?
Yeah, pick me up a ticket.
Cool.  Make sure you wear your 90's clothing.
Still do!
