What do you think is the best rom com ever made?
There are so many.
I think that is one of the more popular genres.
I like the ones made pre nineties.
Like, When Harry Met Sally?
Yes, I love that one.
I thought Billy Crystal was hilarious in that one.
I loved the chemistry between he and Meg Ryan.
I liked the slow build in to their relationship.
The will they or won't they you mean?
Yes, it took what, like almost two decades to end up with one another.
That one reminds me of Sleepless in Seattle.
Some how we were rooting for the couple who had yet to meet ?
Yes, Meg Ryan was great in that one too.
So was Tom Hanks.
The whole premise was so cute.
I loved the little boy in it.
Was so sweet when he called in to the radio for his dad.
A lot like Youv'e Got Mail.
That one was so sweet too.
