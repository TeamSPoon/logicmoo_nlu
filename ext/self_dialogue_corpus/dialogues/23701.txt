Have you seen The Founder?
Remind me what that was again?
It was a movie based on the history of McDonalds.  Starred Michael Keaton.
Oh yes!  I did, I really enjoyed it.
Yes, me too.  I had no idea McDonalds was found by someone other than Ray Kroc.
Me neither.  I did not know the full history until I saw the movie.
The movie quietly had a really good cast.
Yes.  Michael Keaton of course.  But also Nick Offerman, Laura Dern, BJ Novak, and some others.
Keaton has had quite the career resurgence.
Indeed, he really has some momentum now.
It's really crazy to think about how long he's been acting and some of his roles when he was young.
Yes.  There was Batman, but he was also in a lot of other stuff in the past.
I remember Beetlejuice, Gung Ho, and a lot of others.
Yes, I really liked Beetlejuice.  And of course Batman.
Did you like him in Birdman?
I did.  It was a tongue in cheek reference to his actual career.
Agreed, that's what made it funny.
Anyways, back to The Founder.  Did he deserve an Oscar for this movie?
No, I don't think so.  He was terrific in it, but there were better actors this past year.
Yes, I agree.
