Have you seen Daddy's Home?
Yea, that movie was hilarious!
Yea it was, Will Ferrell is a genius.
He sure is, and Mark Wahlberg was funny too!
Yea, he's always great.
Watching them fight over that little boy was so funny.
Yea, that scene where he teaches the kid to fight was classic.
The dance battle at the end was the best!
I really hope they do a sequel.
Me too, the way they ended it made it a possibility.
