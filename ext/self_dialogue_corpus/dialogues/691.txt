Hey Uncle Lenny I am free today did you want to hang?
Most definitely Brandon I am setting up for the football game tonight.
Cool, are you guys playing or just watching?
We can play a bit in the backyard but we were just gonna watch.
Which game is on tonight?
I think we got the Redskins and the Vikings.
Two good old school offensive teams, I'll definitely be there!
Great, and yeah it should be a high scoring beast of a game.
Did you hear the Redskins want to keep Kirk Cousins?
I heard that but he is an expensive guy, we will see what happens to the team.
I think the GM would make a mistake in recommending letting him go.
He is one of the best quarterbacks in the league that is for sure!
Not only that, he is a vital QB on a team that really needs a ring.
I think the West in general could use a ring, instead of those Pats!
I would love a ring, and I'd love for a team from the West to snag it.
Come on through when you are available, I actually have a Cousins jersey.
Nice, I actually just bought an Antoine Boldin jersey for cheap, when he was on the Cardinals.
Great buy, I want to see it!
I'll be over to show it soon!
I'll be waiting for ya!
