Who is your favorite music artist of all time?
Hands down, Sarah McLachlan!
Oh yeah, she has crazy skills.
Her voice is INCREDIBLE.
What are some of your favorite songs of hers?
"Possession", "Into the Fire", "Sweet Surrender" but I like them all honestly.
I love "Possession". I have heard techno remixes of that song.
Yeah. Nothing beats the original. Do you have any albums of hers?
I don't. I'm guessing you do since she's your favorite.
Oh I do, almost all of them. Who's your favorite musician?
I actually like Sting, Phil Collins, older bands.
Phil Collins is a really talented drummer.
He is. Very talented. I liked him with the band Genesis, too.
I know a little of their music.
Who else do you like besides Sarah McLachlan?
Katy Perry I like a lot.
She's good, but I don't like everything she does.
She was awesome when she performed at the Super Bowl a few years ago.
Yeah, she rode in on that giant Tiger. That was awesome.
The dancing sharks were funny, too. I love her song, "California Love" with Snoop Dogg
