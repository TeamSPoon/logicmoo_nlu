Have you seen the recent Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
No, I haven't yet. Have you?
Yeah, I saw it just the other day.
Was it any good?
It was pretty good. I thought the plot was a little weaker but the characters better.
How so?
Well, the first one seemed like it was more exciting, you know?
That's different. Usually the first ones are more boring because they're setting up the universe.
Yeah, that's what I would have thought too, but not this time.
But the characters were cool, then?
Yeah, I really loved the bad guys, the Sovereign.
Are those the gold people? I saw them online.
Yeah, they're the gold guys. They're really funny and cool.
They didn't look very funny from the clips I've seen.
They are! They have these like video game ships that are awesome and their reactions are hilarious.
Sounds pretty sweet then. I'll have to go see the movie.
You should, it was great. The plot was pretty funny too, even if it wasn't as exciting as the first.
How was the soundtrack?
The soundtrack was awesome as usual.
That's good. I'll go see it then.
