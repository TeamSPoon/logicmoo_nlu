Do you have any Lady Gaga albums?
Just her first one, but I have the double CD version.
I have all of them.
I'm not the biggest fan of hers. I feel like she needs too much attention.
I see why you say that. She does put herself out there.
Like wearing dresses made of meat.
Right, and she's done other similar things. I like some of her songs, though.
I like some on that first album.
It is her best album.
My favorite song on it is Just Dance. It's fun.
