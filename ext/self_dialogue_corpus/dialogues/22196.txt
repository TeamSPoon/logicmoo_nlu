Hey have you seen Hidden Figures yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
Yes, I want to see it too.
Who plays in it?
Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Kevin Costner are a few.
That looks so good, its about the smart women in the space program.
Yes, another one I haven't seen is Rogue One.
That one came out last year.
Yes but I never got to see it.  I may have to rent that one.
Ok.  Do you want to go see Hidden Figures soon?
Yes, how about Saturday?
Saturday sounds great.
I was thinking we could go see it after we stop by the mall.
Did you need to pick up anything there?
Yes,  I wanted to buy a copy of Rogue One while I was there.
Ok, well that will be fine.
We will see Hidden Figures after the pick up.
Will it be the 1pm showing?
Yes, that's the one.
I can't wait!
