Have you ever seen Death Proof?
What was that?
It was a Tarrentino movie.
Oh, was that one of the one's that was released as the double feature?
It might have been.  I only saw this film from it though.
Oh, I think I saw both of them.
Well, this is the one with the car.
It had Kurt Russell, right?
Yeah, he was the crazy man in the car.
Yeah, I thought it was him.
Did you like it?
It started off kind of slow for me.
Did you like it when it picked up though?
Oh, yeah!  It was a nailbiter!
Yeah, I freaked out when he was chasing that second group of girls.
Yeah, I honestly thought he'd get at least one of them.
I think he thought that too.
Well, it didn't work out too well for him though.
Not at all.
I loved that ending.
