Do you think Pete Rose should be in the hall of fame?
I've thought about this before and decided I don't think he should.
Really, that surprises me. What are your reasons?
Well he bet on baseball while he was still playing. He knew it was wrong and did it anyway.
You really think thats a good enough reason?
I can tell by your tone that you don't agree.
You can't just ignore all the records he set and all the awards he got. He was one of the best.
But he broke the rules. Thats why they suspended him and kicked him out of the sport.
Yeah I get that part. Although he has always maintained that he never bet on games he played in and never purposely tried to lose.
So we are just suppose to take his word for it?
Okay lets say we don't believe that. don't you think he has been punished?
Well yeah but not being in the Hall of Fame is part of that punishment.
You can't just rewrite history. He did what he did and you can't just leave out his contribution to the game.
Yeah so you think we should reward him by putting him in the Hall with all the great players who did not break the rules?
I think a lot of them did. They just didn't get caught.
How do you think it should be handled?
I think you put him in there and tell the whole story. Under his statue or picture or whatever you put all the things he did for the game good and bad.
I can see your point. Just put it all in there how he was suspended and everything.
Yes otherwise it's all just a lie. He is a part of the history of baseball and leaving him out would be a lie.
Do you believe the same for the players that did steroids and got caught?
