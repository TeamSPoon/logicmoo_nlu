Who is your favorite actor?
Colin Firth is my favorite actor.
He was the guy in The King's Speech, right?
Yep, that's the one.
He was phenomenal in that role.
He won an Academy Award for that performance.
Wow, that's amazing.
I know. So who is your favorite actor?
My favorite actor is Benedict Cumberbatch.
Oh, I've only ever seen him in August Osage County.
The performances by Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts in that movie were amazing.
I know. It's such a shame that movie didn't do very well with critics.
I think the subject matter was just too dark for most people.
I agree, but I thought it was a work of art.
Definitely.
So what Benedict Cumberbatch movies would you recommend?
I would recommend Dr. Strange and The Imitation Game.
Dr. Strange came out pretty recently, didn't it?
Yeah, it came out last year.
I thought so. Last I heard, it was well received by critics.
