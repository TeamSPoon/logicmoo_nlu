Which of the movies from episode I to III is your favorite?
I guess it would have to be Revenge of the Sith.
Oh yeah, that was great as it got to show us how Anakin fell to the Dark Side.
Indeed, Palpatine was such a manipulative influence.
We also got to see how little separates a hero from a villain.
And it really showed us why the Jedi Order wanted to be without emotional attachments.
It can be argued that emotions are a strength, but in this case it was a clear weakness.
For sure, as it was feelings that allowed Anakin to be so thoroughly manipulated.
The best part of the movie for me had to be the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin.
For me the best part would have to be how Anakin embraced the Dark Side and became a full fledged villain.
