hey, have you seen the friday the 13th remake they did a few years ago?
unfortunately i have.
come on, it wasn't that bad.  it had it's flaws, but i thought it was ok.
it just seemed a bit campy.
Isn't that what the friday movies always were?
to some extent, but this one was over the top.  like the guy having sex with the girl and says "you have perfect nipple placement."
yeah, that was a bit odd.  seemed like they might have tried to put too much in one movie as well.  kind of skimped over jason's mother
yeah, that was the cool thing about the first movie a lot of people don't remember.  Jason's mother was the killer, not jason.
I would have like to see more of her and more of the back story of jason as a child.
yeah, someone should do a movie on her back when jason was still alive and a child.
