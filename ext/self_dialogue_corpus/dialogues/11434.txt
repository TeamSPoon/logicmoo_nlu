How familiar are you with The Beatles?
I know a lot of their music. My parents used to play it all the time.
Do you like them?
Yes, especially the really early songs. I love "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
I like their later stuff. I think "Blackbird" might be my favorite.
That's from The White Album, right?
Yes. It has so many great songs. "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is really beautiful.
My mom liked that one. George Harrison was her favorite Beatle.
My mother liked Paul the best.
I just saw him on a talk show. He's pretty old now.
