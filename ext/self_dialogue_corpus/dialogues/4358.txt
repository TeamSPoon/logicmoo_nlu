Did you ever get to see Black Swan?
I've seen it a couple of times actually. It was great.
Natalie Portman was amazing in that movie.
She really became the swan, literally and figuratively.
The director's cinematography was fantastic as well.
It really surprised me the scene between her and Mila Kunis though.
Oh I'm sure no one was expecting that, it was a shocker.
But there were a lot of people who enjoyed it though.
That's for sure. I like that Winona Ryder made an appearance too.
That's true, it's been so long since we've seen her in anything worthwhile.
