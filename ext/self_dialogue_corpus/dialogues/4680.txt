Hey. Do you know when baseball season starts?
Yeah! Its already started.
What? You mean to tell me I missed baseball's opening day?
Yep. Missed it by over a month.
Oh man. Thats horrible. Do you know when the baseball all star game is?
Yes. Its in July. Will you be attending the baseball all star game?
I wish. I can barely afford a ticked to a regular season baseball game.
Do you even like baseball? Ive never met a fan that didnt know when opening day was.
Of course i do. Im a big fan of baseball. My favorite team is the Yankees
Yankees?!? How is that possible? You live in Chicago
Ive always liked the yankess since Reggie Jackon played on the team
Ok. He was a good player. I cant argue with that
Whos your favorite baseball team?
The Cubs! Thats a given. I am a die hard cubs fan.
Must suck having to go 100 years without winning a championship.
Thats ok. We're champions now. Aren't we?  Hey... hey what do you say? The cubs are going to win today.
Ha Ha. You have one championship and we have tons of them.
Yeah but we appreciate it more. It might be another 100 years.
Now thats true. So true. The yankees are going to win this year.
You always did have a great imagination didnt you? I have to go. The cubs are about to play. Gotta love baseball!
