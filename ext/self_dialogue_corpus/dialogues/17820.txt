You like simple, straight forward guitar music right?
Yes, I do.
Well you have to hear this guy: Raul Midon.
Never heard of him. What kind of music does he play.
He is kind of a jazz style music player.
Very nice. And how did you come across him?
Well he sings this unbelievable song with Jason Mraz, called: Keep On Hoping.
I love Jason Mraz too. I should listen to that song first.
You will not be disapointed. And this Raul Midon has something very unique to him.
What would that be?
He is blind. And he plays the guitar like a beast!
Wow! Stevie Wonder kind of thing.
Yes some talent like that. I don't know if that level, but something similar.
I will definitely listen to some of his music.
When I first heard of him I spent like a full month just listening to him.
And, what other songs do you recommend?
"State of Mind" is really really good. The guitar technique is outstanding.
Maybe I can get some new inspiration for my own guitar playing through him.
I'm sure you will want to try new things after you give him a listen.
Thanks for the recommendation.
