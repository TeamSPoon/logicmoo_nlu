Apparently, they're doing a new Blade Runner movie.
Man, I'm so sick of all these reboots!
I hear you, but this isn't actually a reboot.
So it's a sequel?
Basically, yeah. It's still got Harrison Ford, but he's not the main guy this time around.
Who is?
I think maybe Ryan Gosling? But I can't confirm.
Gosling is a pretty good actor, so I'm fine with that.
Yeah, he has impressed me with some of his recent movies.
I'm not sure I know how to feel about a Blade Runner sequel.
Yeah, I'm similarly ambivalent.
It's one of the all time great movies, no doubt.
For sure, it's a sci fi classic.
But I just know these days Hollywood is trying to build all these 'cinematic universes'.
Because they're a cash cow. Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc.
Yep, and I can see them thinking they can do that with Blade Runner.
Which would be a mistake, I'd say.
Definitely. Blade Runner was always more about mood, atmosphere and the like than about the world.
I agree. If they lose the mood and stuff the sequel with a bunch of labored world building, it will be a shame.
I'm going to need to see what critics say about it before going to watch it.
