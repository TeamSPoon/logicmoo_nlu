Hey, I hear Dave Mathews will be coming to town this year.
Really, I haven't seen them in years.
You're a fan?
Oh, the biggest. That band reminds me of my college days so much.
Me, too. How many concerts have you been to?
Me and my wife have seen them at least ten times.
Awesome. I've been to a few concerts of theirs as well.
There's just so much energy at their concerts.
I know. I love when they just go off script and jam and then manage to bring it all back together.
Seriously! I love when Bella Fleck plays with them.
He's awesome, but Carter Bueford is probably the best drummer I have ever seen.
You think so?
Oh, without a doubt. Have you even seen him play? He uses both feet.
Wow! I never even noticed.
I love the jazz undertones, too.
Yeah, it's like a blue grass, jazzy, rock band.
Sometimes, I wonder why they still aren't mainstream.
They'd be selling out.
I guess your right. You going to get tickets when they come around?
Definitely!
