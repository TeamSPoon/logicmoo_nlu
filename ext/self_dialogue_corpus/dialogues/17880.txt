Do you like Nine Inch Nails?
I used to but haven't heard any of the latest albums.
You should check out the latest one called Not The Actual Events, its really good.
Nice, I will.
Frontman Trent Reznor went back to lots of layers in songs, like the old days.
Awesome, thats one thing I really loved about NIN, the layers.
They are going to tour this summer, I want to catch a show.
That would be awesome, I've never been to a NIN concert.
Me neither, they are supposed to be great shows.
Yeah, I've seen some footage, looks great.
What is your favorite album by them?
The Fragile is by far my favorite, how about you?
Yeah The Fragile is my favorite too, followed closely by The Downward Spiral.
Yeah The Downward Spiral is my second favorite too!
Supposedly they are going to release two more albums this year.
Whoa, nice. I need to check out the last few albums still, the last album I bought was Things Falling Apart.
Definitely. There are some good ones you have missed.
Yeah, sounds like it.
Get the latest album first.
I will.
