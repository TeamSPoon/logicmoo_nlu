Did you know during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds.
Really? only 3 seconds? That doesn't seem like a lot.
Yeah, I heard they don't make very much.
I heard NFL cheerleaders typically make $50–$75 a game. However, by the time they spend money on makeup, hair accessories, dance classes, etc., they end up losing money.
Eek, that's a shame. Do they all have cheerleaders?
No, actually 6 teams in the NFL don’t employ cheerleaders: the Bears, the Browns, the Lions, the Giants, the Steelers, and the Packers.
I thought all NFL teams had them. Like it was requirement.
No. Super Bowl XLV was the first Super Bowl with no cheerleaders at the game because neither the Steelers and the Packers have cheerleaders.
That is crazy. I can't get enough NFL facts. I wonder what they did for half time.
You know I don't remember. But the the most famous NFL cheerleading squad is the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders who was originally a male/female group called the CowBelles & Beaux.
I definitely don't remember that. I didn't know they even had mixed cheerleading squad in NFL. I thought that was college thing.
As of September 2012, the Dallas Cowboys were the highest-valued sports franchise in the history of the United States. You know they do things big in Texas!
Yes, they do! I've always been a big fan.
Yeah, the Dallas franchise to me is one of the best. They just go all out.
Agreed. It's got to be your second fave if your team isn't playing well.
Yeah and one of the most lucrative.
What do you mean?
The wealthiest team in the NFL is the Dallas Cowboys who have an estimated value of approximately $2.1 billion and generate almost $269 million in annual revenue.
Holy cow!
Yeah, I imagine some big oil tycoon owning the team, sitting behind a big mahogany desk and wearing a 10 gallon hat!
