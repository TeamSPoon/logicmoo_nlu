How is your day going so far?
It is has been very boring up to this point!
I know what you mean. Maybe it would help if you turned on some music.
That is a great idea actually! Have any suggestions for songs?
Have you ever heard that new song called Humble?
I think so, is that the one by Kendrick Lamar?
Yes, it seems to be a pretty popular song at the moment.
I like that one actually. Know of any more good ones?
A friend of mine was telling me about a new song called Bad Liar.
I have not heard that one before, who sings it?
I think that is Selena Gomez' new song.
That is right! I can not believe I did not know that!
If you are like me, then a lot of times you do not have time for the new music!
I am the same way! A lot of times I just end up listening to older music.
What kind of older music do you like?
I used to be a huge fan of Macy Gray!
I have not heard of her in such a long time!
I used to love that song I Try. It was my favorite song for a long time.
I remember that one! My sister used to sing it all the time.
It was a great song! I think it still is to this day actually!
