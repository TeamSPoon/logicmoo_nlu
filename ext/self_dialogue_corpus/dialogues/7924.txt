Do you like girl bands in pop music?
Sure. Its awesome when women artists are represented that way in music.
Yeah its really great. Wish there were more.
So who do you like?
Go Gos, Bangles, and Pussy Riot.
Pussy Riot, okay. I'm not familiar with them.
Sure, they're not mainstream in the US.
Go Gos, they're really solid.
Some good musicians there.
Bangles are fun to listen to, too.
