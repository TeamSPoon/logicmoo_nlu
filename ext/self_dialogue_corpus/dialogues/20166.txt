Do you prefer movies that make you question the plot?
As in thrillers?
Yes, movies that keep you guessing what will happen next?
Oh yes, I enjoy movies that are hard to predict.
I like movies where the movie itself holds a secret from the audience.
I have seen some like that, it is a genius way to keep people watching.
I like thrillers the best, over any other type of movies.
I enjoy horror movies, I like being scared.
I find that movies these days all seem to be alike.
What do you mean?
As in the plots all seem the same, the use of monsters and such are no longer scary.
Have you seen the Conjuring?
No I have not, is it a horror?
Yes, it was voted one of the scariest movies ever.
Really? I would like to watch it. DId it scare you?
It did very much, felt so real too.
I need to check out the Conjuring then.
It scared me and everyone that was with me watching it.
It has been a long time since I have felt scared from a movie.
Trust me, the Conjuring will scare you.
