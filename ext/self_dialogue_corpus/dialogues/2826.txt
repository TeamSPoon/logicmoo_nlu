Falcons Vs Dolphins, what are your thoughts?
Well, i'm a Dolphins fan but the Falcons are on the rise.
I know people say "Pre-Season doesn't count" but i feel it's just as imporant.
i think the same way. It's how they shake out the weak players.
True.
Now Atlanta pretty much has the same team as last year.
Miami is in the same boat.
So team-wize it's pretty much equal.
I would say so, i havent really looked at their draft pics.
Dont forget the free agents.
Also, true..... free agents seem to be more prevelant lately.
Yeah, and that's not cool either..... it's like being your own lawyer.
HA ha, that is so true.
serious tho.
So back to game one.....
Yes, i'd like to say Miami but i got a feeling it will be Atlanta by 7
Really?
Yes, based on the stats from last season.
Sigh, i hope your wrong. I want Miami to have a good year.
Me too, me too.
