Are you still a San Francisco 49ers fan ?
No, I have a new team this year. I'm tired of waiting for them to win.
Who is your new team?
The Jacksonville Jaguars, they are not a good team, but I did move to Jacksonville this year.
I wondered if you would start following them after your move.
I've always lived in Florida and followed all the teams, but this is the first time I've lived in a city with an NFL team.
How far away from the stadium do you live?
I can see Everbank Field from in front of my apartment. I think it's about a mile away.
Wow, that's close, I guess I'll be spending some weekends visiting you this year.
That sounds great, we'll have to plan out some weekends when the Jags are playing at home.
Hopefully they will play the Tennessee Titans in Jacksonville this year.
The Titans play the Jaguars in week 2 this year, and it's at Everbank Field.
I will be sure to come and watch that game with you this year.
That will be a lot of fun, I've never been to an game in person yet.
I will of course have to be wearing my Titans shirt to go.
I will have to buy a Jaguars jersey before I go to the stadium.
Are you going to be embarrassed to be seen with me in the Jacksonville stadium with my Titans jersey on?
It depend on which team wins.
I'm sure the winning team will be my Titans.
I'm sure that you are wrong, the Jags are going to have a great year.
