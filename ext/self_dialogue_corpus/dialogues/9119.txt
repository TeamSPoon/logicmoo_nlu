Do you like older rock?
Like 1970s rock n roll? Yes, who doesn't?
What's your favorite band from that era? Mine is probably Led Zeppelin.
I love Led Zep. It's tough to pick though - so many amazing bands.
Weren't there? Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones...
I love Creedence. My favorite is probably Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Amazing band! It's a shame all anyone knows is 'Freebird'.
Isn't it? It's a great song but there's so much more to the band.
They did that gritty Southern rock better than anyone in the 70s.
They sure did. Such an iconic, recognizable sound.
