This playoffs this year have been really disappointing.
I agree. I dont know what happened to competition.
Lebron James and the Warriors happened.
Yea, can we just fast forward to that series already.
That would be better. Those teams are gonna be squaring off.
Yea, I just wish there was more competition.
Don't we all. They need to do away with these super teams.
Yea, its getting old already.
Yea, I don't know how they can avoid it.
Me either. These players keep joining together.
It seems like it. They want to win.
Yea, true, but whatever happened to doing it without teaming with others.
Well, it takes a team to win.
True, I agree.
Yea, I know what you mean though. Its not natural.
Yea, Lebron had to leave and then come back to establish himself.
Yea, he did that in a big way.
He sure did.
Yea, where are the criques now.
They are still out  there under tables and chairs.
