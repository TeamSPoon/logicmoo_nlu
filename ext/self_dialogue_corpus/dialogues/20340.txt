Do you like Kubrick movies?
The ones I have seen. Yeah.
What have you seen.
Oh, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, 2001. I loved those
You ever see Barry Lyndon?
No. It's a Kubrick film?
Yeah, he did it in the 70s. It's real different from those other movies.
How?
Well it is real long and very slow-paced. It's set in 18th century Europe, but it starts in Ireland.
That is different. Who stars in it?
Barry Lyndon is played by Ryan O'Neil. It really is mainly ablout him.
He's OK. Not my favorite. Who else is in it?
Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee. it has a good solid cast but not a lot of well-known names.
OK. Well what is it about, then?
An Irish rogue named Redmond Barry who rises through society.
That sounds kind of boring.
Well it isn't. It is slow, but he fights several duels throughout the movie. In fact duels are a big part of the story.
Like that movie, the Duellists?
Well, not as much but still a lot goes on. You should check it out.
I might some time.
