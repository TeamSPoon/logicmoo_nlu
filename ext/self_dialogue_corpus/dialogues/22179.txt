I recently saw Moana.
What did you think?
I thought the singer for Moana was amazing. Such a pretty voice!
I agree! her songs were really beautiful. What did you think of the plot?
Eh, not one of Disney's most interesting. I'm kind of trying of the chosen one trope.
Yeah, me too.
It was no Mulan, that's for sure.
Hahaha, you mean no Zootopia.
Oh, I love Zootopia! I love the characterization, the humor, the depth of the plot . . .
It's really amazing, isn't it? Have you seen the Beauty and the Beast remake yet?
Not yet, though I hope to soon.
I won't tell you any spoilers then, but it's definitely worth a watch.
Good to hear! I wasn't super impressed by the Cinderella remake.
Neither was I.
But then again, Cinderella isn't one of my favorite fairy tales anyway.
Same here.
Which Disney movie would you most like a live action adaptation of?
Hmmm...Maybe Anastasia?
That's not Disney! I'd pick Mulan.
Good choice.
