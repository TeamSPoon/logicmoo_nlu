Do you like Star Wars?
Of course, but I like the old ones the best.
The old movies made or the oldest storyline?
The older movies. The ones with Harrison Ford and Leia.
Yea. I would have to agree. Although, the ones coming out now are doing pretty good in the box office.
Agreed. But George Lucas made his name off of those old movies.
That's true. They kind of messed up on those middle movies with Jar Jar Binks and the likes.
Exactly. I am glad they are back to their winning ways.
Me too. So many people love Star Wars. It is nice to see them do good movies.
Yep. And they make more money too.
