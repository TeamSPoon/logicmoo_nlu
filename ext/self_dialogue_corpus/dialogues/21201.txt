What movie are you most anticipating?
I am dying to see the new It film.
I saw the trailer , It looks like they did a great job. So creepy.
Ya it looks better than the original film to me. I love Tim Curry as penny wise but this updated version looks amazing.
Pennywise does look especially scary in this new trailer. Tim Curry is awesome, I loved him in the film clue.
Never heard of it.. like the board game?
Yep. teh movie was made based off the game clue. Really funny. Great halloween movie.
Oh cool , I will have to check it out.I am also looking forward to stephen king's other big movie. Dark Tower.
Yes! I loved that book series. I am a little weary of the film version.
Why is that?
The books are so epic not sure the movie will do it justice. Also don't love the casting.
I agree the casting is a little off from the book character descriptions but elba is a strong actor.
I am a fan of his. Just not very true to the original material. I would have rather seen matthew McConaughey as the gunslinger Roland.
He looks closer to the book version true. But I still think this movie will be great.
I hope you are right about that. The trailer does look well done.
Stephen King is really going to town with the movie adaptations this year.
I know they have been trying to get the dark tower made into a movie for years now.
Interesting it comes around as the same time as the new IT movie.
I am sure he will be racking in the profits.
I would be laughing if I were him. These two movies are probably going to sell so many tickets.
