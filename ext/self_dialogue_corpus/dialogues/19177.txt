What kind of music did your parents listen to growing up?
My mom would play a lot of music from the 60s.
Yea I guess it would depend on when your parents were born, mine played music from the 70s.
My mom was also a HUGE fan of John Denver.
Well who wouldn't be? I knew some of his songs.
He was pretty talented. Sad that he lost his life at a young age.
How did he die?
He passed away in a plane crash.
Oh how sad! I didn't know that.
I can still hear my mom playing his song "Leaving On a Jet Plane."
I think maybe someone remade that song actually.
You may be right, I have no idea.
I remember his song "Take Me Home, Country Roads".
That actually came out in the early 70s.
Right it did! From the album "Poems, Prayers and Promises".
I think that is the album my mom would play the most.
I only know a couple songs from that album.
She also loved the album that came out in 1969, "Rhymes and Reasons."
Oh okay, not as familiar with that one.
To this day she still listens to John Denver music.
