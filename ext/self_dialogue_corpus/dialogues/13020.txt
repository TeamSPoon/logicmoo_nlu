Who is your favorite character from the prequal trilogy?
I think my favorite character is Sebulba.
Haha, that is a great one.
Yeah, he is Anakin's podracing 'nemesis' and he is one of the most unique looking aliens in the whole series.
I can't disagree there, he is pretty freaky looking.
I remember when I was young I thought it was so funny how he got around with his arms and used his feet as hands.
I'd be curious to know who came up with that character design.
Me too, I know he was voiced by Lewis McLeod.
Oh now I remember that, he even had to learn some Huttese, the language Jaba speaks.
Yeah it definitely wouldn't be the easiest language to learn.
