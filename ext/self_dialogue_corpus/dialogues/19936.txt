Aww man, you are playing my music.
You like tears for fears?
Do I? I grew up in the eighties and that was when music was its best.
Everybody Wants to Rule The World is such a great song. I just love it!
This song will never get old﻿.
I was just thinking of that.
I remember hearing this as an '80s high schooler. It's old-proof.﻿
This music is a masterpiece. I mean it!
Tears for Fears will never get old in my book.
I wish I was around during the eighties.
Definitely a perfect song.﻿ I've listened to this at least 500 times now still hasn't gotten old﻿.
Nothing ever lasts forever﻿.
Except this song﻿.
It's amazing how this song is finding a new generation of fans.
I am happy to see a younger generation discover real music. Welcome aboard.
Real music?
You have to admit this song it way better than most of the noise they play on the radio today.
I don't want to but you are right. This is real music.
Push that repeat button. I can listen to this all day long.
What have I started?
