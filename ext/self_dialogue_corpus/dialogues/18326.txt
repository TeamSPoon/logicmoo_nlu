What deceased musician do you wish you would have gotten the chance to see live?
That's a hard one.  Maybe Michael Jackson?
That would definately be a good concert.
I'm sure his concerts must have been awesome.
Sure, he was a great performer.
Yeah, he was a great dancer.  And his music was terrific.
Would you have wanted to see the tour he was working on?
Of course!  Who wouldn't have wanted to see it?
Have you seen the footage of when he was working on it?
Yeah, it looked like it would have been awesome.
Okay.  Would you have rathered seen him live for that concert or a concert in the eighties?
Wow, that's a really hard one!  I guess the eighties.
Yeah, me too!
Well, we knew all the hits in the eighties.  And there were so many of them!
Yeah, and we didn't quite know what we were getting into with 2000s Michael.
I'm sure it would have been great though.
Did you get the CD released after his death?
Yeah, and it wasn't bad.
I liked the song with Justin Timberlake.
Yeah, but there were other good songs on the album too.
