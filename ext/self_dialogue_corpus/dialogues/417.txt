What do you think of the Seahawks chances?
I dunno, seems like they can't get over the hump.
Maybe, I think they have a strong year though.
How many games do you think they win?
I'm guessing 12.
I think they win 10.
Russell Wilson makes them competitive.
Yea, with him in the game, they always have a chance.
They sure spanked the Lions in the playoffs last year.
That was a beating.
I hope their defense is improved.
It had better be.
I miss the Hawks being in the AFC.
Yea, it still seems funny with them in the NFC.
I miss the rivalries with San Diego, Denver, etc.
Those were great times.
Steve Largent was an awesome receiver.
Is he in the Hall of Fame?
If not he should be.
I couldn't agree more.
