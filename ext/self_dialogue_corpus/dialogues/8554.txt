Have you listened to the radio lately? There's some awesome new pop hits!
I have! Which ones do you like so far this summer?
I really like Bruno Mars' new song, 'That's What I Like.'  I can dance to it all day.
That's a really good song! I have been listening to 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran!
Is that his new song? I didn't know that was him!
It is! The song has some really interesting beats.  Super pop!
It's definitely different from his usual love songs.
Right, so different from his previous songs 'Photograph.'
Don't forget his breakout hit, 'Thinking Out Loud.'
That song was really memorable.  I still listen to it from time to time.
