Have you been to the bowl?
Yeah last year.
Who did you see play?
So so.
How were they?
They sounded just like the album.
Did they play song to my car?
Yes, it was really good.
Did they have a full light show?
Yes, it went well with the music.
I don't know why they get bad reviews .
I think I do.
whenI saw them years ago, when it was time for the concert to start, the song was drunk.
Really?
Yes, then he came out only in a thong.
That's so rock and roll.
I know, and he sang really well.
Now, he was dressed last night.
Was he drunk?
Yes
