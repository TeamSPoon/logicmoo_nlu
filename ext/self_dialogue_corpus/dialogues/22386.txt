Have you heard they are remaking the movie "IT?"
Yes, I hear it comes out in September!
I want to see it so bad, the original scared me so bad!
The clown was very creepy, I wonder what he will look like in the remake.
Have you seen any of the trailers for the remake?
No I have not, does it seem like it follows the original?
Oh absolutely. It follows it very closely!
Do they show what Pennywise looks like?
They only show very small parts, and he looks so scary.
I loved the original IT, I watched it so many times.
Me too, such a long movie!
I wonder if the remake is just as long as the original?
I hope so! There is a lot to the original.
I heard Steven King said they did a phenomenal job on the remake of IT.
I heard that as well. I wonder who plays Pennywise in this new one?
I am unsure, but I know Tim Curry did an amazing job in the original.
Well, we need to make plans to see it when it comes out!
Its a plan, September right?
Yes, September but I am unsure what date. I will look.
I can't wait to see it!
