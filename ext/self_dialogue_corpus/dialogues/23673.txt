I love watching good clean family movies that my daughter can watch, do you know of any?
I sure do, does it matter when they were made?
Nope, I am just looking for lighthearted films that we can enjoy together.
What about Matilda?
I have heard of that one, is there anyone in it that I would recognize?
Danny DeVito and Mara Wilson are the two main stars.
Great! I have always enjoyed movies with DeVito in them.
I agree, he is a legend for sure. I think the two of you should check it out.
Can you tell me more about it?
Sure, it is about a little girl who has magical powers; and she uses them to make up for a lackluster family and an evil school principal.
That sounds very interesting, I think we will have to order that one and watch it.
It has a great story to it, and it is one that will be great to watch with some popcorn!
Thanks for the advice, have a couple of others in mind?
Another good one that comes to mind is Jumanji. It has a couple of bad words in it but it is mostly fine for kids to watch.
I think I have seen that one, Robin Williams is in that one correct?
Yes he is, and he does a terrific job in hos portayl of a man that just returned from years spent in the jungle.
I have seen that one, but I do not think my daughter has. There is another one for us to watch!
Tim Allen has some nice family movies as well, do you like him?
I sure do, my daughter and I just finished watching the Santa Claus movies!
Those are great! You should also check out Jungle 2 Jungle as well!
