Who do you think will win in the NFC this year?
I'm particularly fond of the Falcons to repeat.
Do you even think the Falcons will win their own division?
Well, that might be tough for them, but they should make the playoffs and they are as dynamic as anyone.
What about on the defensive end?
They might not be able to hold their own, but who else is going to score as many points as them?
That is true, but if the Seahawks or someone similar can compete on the defensive end, they might give them trouble.
I'm still putting my money on the Falcons!
Well, what about the AFC?
The Patriots clearly have the edge, especially after getting Cooks.
He might be as dynamic as any receiver they've had since Moss.
Definitely, and a healthy Gronk can only help them.
I'm personally very fond of the Raiders.
They should be pretty dangerous too.
If Carr hadn't gone down, they might have been playing a lot further.
But, does the team live and die with Carr?
They might, but as long as he is healthy, they will be dangerous.
Well, all I can say is I'm excited for the season to start.
Me too, should be a very interesting one.
Yep, about as interesting as any year we've had in a while.
