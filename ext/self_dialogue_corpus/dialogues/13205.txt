Did you like the music from The Revenge of the Jedi?
Yes, I love all of John WIlliams music.
You can hear certain music, and know exactly who the music is referring too.
I know, Darth Vador's music is memorable.
I also like the celebration music at the end.
But didn't the music change from the original version.
I think so, I seem to remember if being a little more upbeat, and some words being sung.
Yes, I want to say right before the fade out to the credits I remember the words Celebrate the Law.
And the Ewoks banging the drums didn't quite match the music on the new version.
I wonder why they changed it.
