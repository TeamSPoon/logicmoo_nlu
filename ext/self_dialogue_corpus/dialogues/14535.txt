SO WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE IN THE NBA FINALS?
I THINK IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE CAVS WILL PLAY THE WARRIORS AGAIN?
YEP THEY ARE THE TWO BEST TEAMS WITHOUT A DOUBT.
PLUS IT WILL MAKE IT A MORE INTERESTING FINALS AT LEAST.
ITS TOO BAD THOUGH THAT THE SPURS AND CELTICS BOTH HAD THEIR BEST PLAYERS INJURED.
THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE NBA THOUGH MY FRIEND.
YEP FOR SURE BUT STILL IT IS UNFORTUNATE.
I AGREE PLUS THE SEMI FINALS ARE NOT WATCHABLE ANYMORE.
I HAVE STOPPED WATCHING BECAUSE THERE IS ZERO DRAMA NOW.
WELL AT LEAST WE HAVE THE FINALS TO LOOK FORWARD TO. WHO DO YOU LIKE IN THE FINALS?
I'M A WARRIOR FAN SO OF COURSE I'M GOING WITH MY MAN CURRY.
HAHA I THINK LEBRON WILL HAVE ANOTHER GREAT SERIES LIKE LAST YEAR.
AS LONG AS IT GOES 7 GAMES I'M COOL WITH IT.
ME TOO MAYBE WE CAN PUT A SMALL WAGER ON THE FINALS.
OK HOW ABOUT 20 BUCKS?
YEP 20 IS COOL I DON'T WANT TO BANKRUPT YOU HAHA
HAHA WHAT'S 20 BUCKS AMONG FRIENDS.
OK WE WILL SHAKE ON DURING GAME ONE.
COOL MY BROTHER THATS A BET
ALL RIGHT MAN TALK TO YOU AT THE START OF THE SERIES.
