I love the band Paramore.
I love that band too! The singer has an excellent voice
Her name is Hayley Williams. She is so cool!
Totally! She is always very fashionable.
Sometimes she dyes her hair interesting colors too. She is a great and interesting front woman for the group.
Does she play instruments too? Or does she just sing?
In the band I think she just sings.
I first heard about Paramore in 2007.
That was when the album Misery Business came out, right?
Correct! That is still one of my favorite records.
Did you know they just released a new album?
I did not! What is it called?
The title is After Laughter.
What does it sound like?
The album has a lot of retro vibes.
Does that mean it was inspired by an earlier decade? If so, which one?
A lot of the songs have musical elements that were popular in the 1980s.
I love music from the 1980s!
In that case, you will probably love this record.
I'm going to go to the store to buy a copy today!
