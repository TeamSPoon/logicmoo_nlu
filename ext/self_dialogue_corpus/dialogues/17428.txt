This album was created in late 2012.
Hmmm, interesting. That year was a great year for cinema!
Yeah, which allowed for more music to be put out into the world!
Hmmm, you think there are any new music genres that may come up?
I heard about these two new genres, which everyone likes hearing in the midnight dusk.
Which ones are they?
Ever heard of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and Trap?
Not really, no.
Well, those music genres are usually played in the nighttime, when everyone's drunk and partying til the early morning!
Hmmm, did these genres come out recently?
EDM actually existed back in the 70s and 80s in the UK, but it spread to the US later on
Why do these music genres always gotta come from the UK?
Well, not all of them originate from the UK, but a lot of our music is derived from it,
Why is that?
Well, I guess we take things for granted with our ex-mother country.
Huh, makes sense.
However, what do you think of any new music genres coming up?
Ummm, not sure. Anything else to talk about?
What's on your mind?
Thinking about what fur coat to buy my girlfriend!
