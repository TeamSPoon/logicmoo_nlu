I really enjoy watching Disney movies.
I really enjoy the newer movies where the women have powerful roles.
Me too. I really enjoy that they do not have to be saved by the men of the movie anymore.
I also enjoy the comical relief from the animals in the movies. They are always helpful or funny.
I like the Disney movies where there is an evil princess or queen.
I also enjoy the characters that are a little mean, it makes the movie more enjoyable.
Disney movies are not too long, and are always well thought out and beautiful.
They are always creative, magical and colorful.
I cannot wait to go to Disney Land someday.
Same here! I just need to save money!
