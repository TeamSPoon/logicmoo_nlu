Did you see that Texans Vs. Packers game last night?
Yea, the Texans played horrible in that first half.
I know right. They couldn't even get a field goal.
That's true. Green Bay didn't do as well either.
Yea, they only scored one touchdown in the whole first half.
The second half was a little bit better though.
Yea, both teams moved the ball down the field a lot quicker.
Do you know how many total yards Osweiler threw for?
I believe it was about 184 yards.
What about Rodgers for Green Bay?
I think Rodgers threw for about 209 yards.
How many rushing yards did the Texans have?
I think they had about 123 rushing yards.
What about the Packers. Did they do good in rushing?
They did okay. They had 109 rushing yards.
So the Texans did better in rushing yards, I see.
Yes, and the Packers did better with receiving yards.
Do you remember what the final score was?
Yea, the Packers had 21 to the Texans' 13.
Okay, I think I'll try to catch the highlights on the internet later on.
