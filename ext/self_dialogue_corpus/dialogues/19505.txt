Have you heard of Carly Rae Jepson?
Yea isn't she the girl who sung "call me maybe"?
Yea but her whole cd is actually really good.
What is it called?
Its called Emotion and she just released extra songs on an album called Emotions Side B.
I'll have to listen to it sometime.
Its really good and I think she only gets credit for it online.
Yea I've only heard a couple songs of hers on the radio.
There's rumors too that she might be releasing a new album soon called Spread Love.
How did you hear about it?
I read on some blogs that when she released another song on Spotify it said it was from an album called Spread Love.
Did it rank high on the Billboard chart?
Not here in the US.  It debuted at sixteen but in Japan it was really popular.
Oh thats kind of weird.  Is she from there?
No, shes Canadian. But, for some reason they really like her and it was certified platinum.
What have American critics said?
They have really supported the album and graded it pretty high.
Doesn't she have some kind of business with Justin Bieber?
They are managed by the same guy but she isn't as manufactured as he is.
Good, because that gets old quick.
