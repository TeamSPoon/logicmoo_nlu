You were up late last night. What was that movie you were watching?
Bone Tomahawk. Have you seen it?
Is that that Western film with Kurt Russell?
Yes, that's the one!
I haven't seen it. Any good?
It's a slow burner, takes a long time to get started, but once it takes off it's incredible!
What's the story about?
A few people from a local town get kidnapped by a native tribe, but it's no ordinary tribe.
What's so different about this tribe?
They're trogdolytes, and use bone whistles embedded in their throats to communicate. They also happen to be cannibals.
Wow that sounds really creepy. Is it a horror movie then?
Yeah I guess that's what it turns into after awhile.
So the kidnapped people get eaten?
Some of them do, I guess. But Kurt Russell organizes a party to go out and search for them. That's when it gets good.
Who else is in the movie?
Let's see.. Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, David Arquette.
Nice cast. Maybe I'll check it out. Is it on Amazon Prime?
Yes, it is. Right now it's one of their free included features, but that won't be forever, so better check it out fast!
I will! But I don't think I'll watch it at night. I don't want to have bad dreams.
Yeah you'll have trouble falling asleep after watching it, for sure!
