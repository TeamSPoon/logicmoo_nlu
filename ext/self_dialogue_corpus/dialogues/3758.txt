Did you ever see the silence of the Lambs?
Is that the one about Hannibal?
Yes it is.
No but I know what it is about.
It is a really great watch, a true thriller and it is suspenseful.
I like those kinds of movies.
You would enjoy this, it is a great movie.
It has a great story.
Yes it is unique for the time it came out, and a true pioneer of a movie.
Wow that sounds important, I will give it a watch.
