How old were you when Star Wars came out?
I wasn't even born yet. That was before my time.
Are you familiar with the movies?
The only one I've seen is A New Hope. I'm going to watch The Force Awakens tomorrow.
You should really watch them in chronological order so you can understand everything.
You know, I've been making it a point to do that. Maybe I'll do it over the next two days and then see The Force Awakens this weekend.
That's a good idea. I know you're going to enjoy them.
I'm sure I will, I love epic sagas and that's definitely a huge one.
George Lucas is a genius. I heard he created the languages for the movies, and they have actual translations.
Really? That's incredible. That's real dedication to your work.
