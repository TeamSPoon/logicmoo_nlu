What was the last movie you saw?
I saw "A Dog's Life".
Oh, did you like it?
Yes, I liked it but it was quite sad throughout but with a happy ending.
Why, what happened?
it was about a dog who kept dying and getting reincarnated.
Oh, how sad.
Yes, every time the dog died I felt sad and tears welling up.
How depressing.
It was sad but not real depressing because the dog kept getting reincarnated.
Oh, what were his lives?
He had four different lives.
What were they?
He was with a boy and his family for years, then went to be a police dog, then he was a single woman and her family's after she got married, then a bad owner after which he found his way back to the first owner.
Oh, how interesting.
The last reincarnation the dog had a bad owner who eventually just drove him somewhere and left him.
Then what happened?
He found his way on his own to the first owner which a lot of the story focused on.
So it was a happy reunion?
Yes, the original owner realized it was his dog reincarnated and gave him the same name, Bailey.
