Have you ever been to see a symphony concert?
Yes, I saw the El Paso Symphony once when I was visiting my grandparents.
Did you like it?
I guess so. I don't really remember what they played.
I really enjoy symphonic music but my favorite kind of music is the music that they use to accompany a movie.
That's called a soundtrack isn't it?
Yes it is. John Williams is a famous composer of sountracks. Have you heard of him?
Of course! He wrote the music score for Star Wars.
That and a lot of other film scores. I like Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack the best.
I didn't realize he wrote that. What else did he write?
Let's see, he did E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, and even Haryy Potter.
Holy Cow! That guy is really amazing. I know a lot of his music even though I didn't realize he wrote it.
I just heard that they released a three-disk boxed set of all the musical scores that John Williams did with Steven Spielberg.
I'm going to ask for that for my birthday! Does he ever play the music he writes?
I think he plays the piano so I suppose he does.
I bet it doesn't sound the same on a piano.
I'm sure it doesn't, but he also conducts the musicians that play his music in the studio.
How do you know so much about John Williams?
I wanted to be a studio musician and play movie soundtracks and he is the best there is in the business.
Well I hope you get to work with him some day.
