Woo to the hoo, training camp and preseasons games start up next month!
Yeah they do, I've been looking forward to this all year
Yep, football football football, best time of the year if you ask me
I'd have to agree with you, if I even thought there was a good time of the year
Oh buddy, why so glum?
Well I was a Colts fan but mostly because I was such a big supporter of what Peyton Manning did for that team year after year
He was a great athlete, still is, I could see why you were bummed when he got traded
well of course you can see why, I'm wearing a t-shirt depicting Andrew Luck's head on a stake
You sure are, pretty graphic
Welp, that's how most of the real fans wanted to do in Indy felt when Manning was released
No kidding, I was there, we couldn't quite corner Luck being an angry mob of mostly non-athletes and Luck being one of the more athelitc young QBs in the league
But he sure has proved his naysayers wrong
has he? We all said he sure was no Peyton manning, and I think so far that's proven 100% accurate, they are clearly different people, induspitably so
Spot on you were with that call. What about Russel Wilson, how much time you think he's got left in Seattle?
Welp if he goes, I go... out to the optomitrest, for a test, because I wouldn't believe my eyes to see anybody but Wilson suiting up at QB for the Seahawks
Not in this lifetime, am I right?
No, actually, we'll both probably outlive Russel Wilson's tenure as a QB in Seattle or in the leagure period
Welp, that's what some people probably said about Favre, and some of those people probably passed on before he retired, he was pretty old and some folks die unexpectedly young
Yeah, especially folks that eat cheese a lot and live near cows and like Green Bay
Yeah it's so cold they probably get a lot of colds and there's not much Vitamin C in cheese
