Did you watch the Pirate game yesterday?
Yeah, they finally scored some runs.
I didn't get to watch it because it was a day game but did see they won.
Yeah, at least they didn't get swept by the Nationals.
I read that Jung ho Kang lost his appeal on his dui sentence in Korea
Really?
Yeah, doesn't look like he will be rejoining the team anytime soon.
That sucks, but why would you put yourself in that situation?
Exactly, I think he is a bit of a reckless person.
Me too.
Remember last year when he was accused of raping someone in Cincinnati?  What was that?
I know, he is a good player but I am wondering how much more the Pirates can take before releasing him?
I know.
He just isn't making good decisions.
Seems like they are experiencing a lot of that.
I know.
What was Marte thinking using PEDs.
Cheater, no wonder he was so fast.
Not good examples but I am sure they are one of many in MLB
I agree.
