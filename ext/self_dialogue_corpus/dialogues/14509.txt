Hey there, are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yes I am! I have to watch every game
What do you think of how it went so far?
It's been so one sided and unfair
Ya, both teams are going to sweep their way into the finals
Everyone knew Cleveland would win though
Yea, Boston has no chance. And now Isaiah Thomas is injured, Cleveland has it in the bag
Yea. But the Warriors look like they will sweep too
Yea, after Zaza's dirty play, I think the Spurs have no chance
They don't have Kawhi or Parker. They won't be doing anything this year unfortunately
So it looks like we will have 2 teams sweep their way into the finals
Yea, it'll be a Golden State versus Cleveland finals, yet again
Yea, we knew that all season long
Well, in the playoffs, some of the first 2 round games were exciteding
Maybe just the Wizards and Celtics and the Rockets and Thunder were the ones that were entertaining
I really wish the Rockets or Thunder made it further though. The Western Conference is stacked
Yea that would have been nice
Well, who do you have winning it all now?
Cleveland of course, yet again
I agree. Lebron is at his prime
