Hey Matt, I have a music question for you.
Oh, hey Elliot, go ahead, I'm ready for you!
What's your favorite musical group.
Hmm, that's a good question.  Why do you want to know?
I'm looking for some new music to listen to, and know you have good taste.
Thanks man, right now I think my favorite band is Metallica.
Metallica?  Are they still around?
Sure they're still around, they just released a new album a few months ago, and are on tour.
Wow, is their new album any good?
I like it a lot, it's their best music in years.
Really, I liked them in the 80s and 90s, but haven't heard much of their later stuff.
You should check out the new album.
What's it called?
Hardwired to Self Destruct.
Nice album title!
Yeah, I think so too.  You can watch some YouTube videos of them recording the album, they're pretty interesting.
I bet they are.  Are there a lot of them?
Yeah, there are at least 5 I think, its fun watching them think of ideas as they go along.
Thanks for the music advice!  I appreciate it.
No problem, man, enjoy!
