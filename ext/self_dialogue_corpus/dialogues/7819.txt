Wow, I just finished the Goblet of Fire movie, and some of the visuals were just insane.
What part do you mean? The fight at the Ministry?
Well, that is the big one of course. The Dumbledore and Voldemort fight.
The sheer power was amazing, it actually felt real for the first time.
Agreed, a lot of the show of power before that was just kinda cheesy in the other movies.
But this felt like an actual fight to the death, right? The lightning crackling sealed it for me, it was so cool.
Then after the fight you see the sand moving.
That part was too much, I had trouble breathing.
Yep, the sand moving slowly and you know something bad is going to happen.
Then Harry gasps and Voldemort tries to take possession of him. Most intense part in any of the movies to that date at least.
