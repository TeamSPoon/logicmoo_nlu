Hey! Have you seen any of the Pitch Perfect movies?
Yes! My favorite is the first one. How about you?
That was my favorite one too! I love Fat Amy's character.
I know right. The third one comes out next year.
Really? Yay. We should go see it together.
Sounds like a plan! That reminds me, the second Incredibles movie is coming out in 2019.
Oh my gosh, I can't wait. They keep postponing it!
We should dress up and go see that one too!
Let's do it! Haha! I'll be Mr. Incredible.
Okay. I'm baby Jack Jack!
Pixar has my most favorite movies; Toy Story 1, 2, 3, and Up.
They're all so wholesome. I think they're great too.
I wonder if they'll make another Toy Story eventually.
No matter how old we get they're still enjoyable to watch. Isn't that funny?
You know what they say Pixar movies never get old!
Do they say that? I might've heard Woody say it once before. Haha.
Maybe.. or Buzz Lightyear. Haha.
I'm also looking forward to the remake of IT.
I wasn't too scared by the first one but it was one of the first of its kind so I'm excited to see what they'll do with that.
For us older folks it might just be a laughing matter to watch the youngins be scared, maybe even scarred.
