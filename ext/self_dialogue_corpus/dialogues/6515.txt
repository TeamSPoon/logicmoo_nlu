What are your top three Disney Movies?
Hmm  Three?  Is that all I get?
Yep, just three!
Ok, so I'll go with... Beauty and the Beast, Moana and Lion King
Ooo Oldies mixed with a brand new one!  You didn't like Frozen?
I liked it, but I liked Moana better.  And I've loved Beauty and the Beast and Lion King since I was a kid.
Ok, why do you like them all so much?
Definitely the music!   Circle of life, Tale as old as Time, and You're Welcome.  How can you go wrong with those?!
To true, but what about "Let it Go"??
That's a good one, I just love the others so much more!
