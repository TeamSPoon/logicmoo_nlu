Do you like the NFL?
Like, as a whole?
Sure, I was thinking the games and the teams.
Yeah, I mean I don't love NFL football but I don't hate it either.
I feel the same, really.
Like, I could never be a giant fanatic.
Yeah, like painting your body and going to every game.
Exactly, I do like a good tail gate party though.
Me too! Do you watch games with your friends?
Sometimes, if I get invited.
Oh, so it's either with them or not at all?
Yeah, unless it's a team I like playing.
Who do you like?
The Vikings, Steelers, Packers....
Oh, I love the Packers!
Really? They are my family team!
Mine too! My family has always loved them.
They are amazing, really underappreciated.
They actually have won more than half the other teams.
I know!
