What was the best concert you've ever been to?
Well that's hard to say, I went to a lot when I was growing up and a few really made an impression on me.
Pick one of those then.
Well a friend of mine as a kid was a big Prince fan, he had every record, was a member of the fan club and so on.
Oh Prince! I loved him too as a kid!
So when my friend was 16 he found out that Prince was playing a gig in a city hundreds of miles away, so on the spur of the moment I said "Let's go".
I bet it was expensive.
I can't remember, probably. We took the overnight train and wandered around the city until it was time for the concert.
So what was it like?
He was incredible! The stage show was so over the top with all these props, but when he started playing guitar the place went crazy!
What year was this?
Around 1988, just at the end of his "purple patch" as it were.
Ouch, what a terrible pun. So he played all the hits?
Yes as far as I can remember. I think it was nonstop for at least 2 hours, in fact we were starting to get worried that we'd miss our train back.
So the stage show was what was so memorable?
No it was him. He took turns playing different instruments, singing, playing basketball, and was great at everything!
Basketball? But wasn't he tiny?
Yes he had a hoop set up on stage and would spin a ball on his finger then get it in the hoop every time.
Now I wish I'd got a chance to see him live now. You weren't even a fan!
I was after that concert though, I went out and bought loads of his records.
