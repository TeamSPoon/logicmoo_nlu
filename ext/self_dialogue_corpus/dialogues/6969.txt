I liked the remake of Beauty and the Beast.
Oh, I loved it! Emma Watson is like a cartoon come to life.
It was actually scarier than the cartoon.
Yes, but I really liked the clock that the Dad made.
And I don't remember the book that transports people in the cartoon.
Me either!  And Gaston was so much more evil in this one!
I don't want them to remake the Lion King with people.
I saw the Broadway show, though, and it wasn't bad.
But in a movie, that's different. Come on, people in masks?
It may be CGI!  Let's hope.
