Have you seen Sherlock Holmes?
Yeah, Robert Downey Junior was great.
I know, he pulled out that quirkiness perfectly.
He was quite funny.  I liked the second one too with Moriarty.
Yeah, classic Sherlock Homles.  And how he faked his own death.
Yep, just like in the novels.
What do you think of Benedict Cumberbatch?
He's perfect.  Him and Downy are both fantastic.
I agree.  Both great actors.
And they seem to hold pretty true to the stories and who Sherlock really is.
