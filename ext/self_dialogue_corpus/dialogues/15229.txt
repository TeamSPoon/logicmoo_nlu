Have you heard the new Lorde album yet?
I don't even know who that is.
She's a pop singer from New Zealand. She sang that Royals song a few years ago.
I remember that song I like it. I'll have to check out her new cd.
It's really good. I've been listening to that and a lot of EDM lately.
What's EDM?
It's electronic dance music. Like the kind that they play in clubs.
Cool. Who are some of your favorite groups?
Well, I like Dillon Francis, Skrillex, and Major Lazer.
I know them! They did that song with Justin Beiber!.
Yeah, Cold Water. That's a pretty good song.
They play it on the radio all the time.
What have you been listening to?
A little bit of everything, but mostly old school hip hop.
Like who?
A Tribe Called Quest and Diggable Planets
I remember that one song from the 90s. Something about leaving a wallet somewhere.
Yeah! It's "I left my wallet in El Segundo.
I'm going to have to download some of their stuff.
Be sure to download the Low End Theory. It's their best.
