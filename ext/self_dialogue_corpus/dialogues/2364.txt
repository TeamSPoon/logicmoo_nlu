Who do you like to win the Super Bowl this year?
Every discussion starts and ends with the Patriots.
I agree, but they aren't necessarily gonna win again.
Yes, but they are favorites for a reason. Tom Brady is just the ultimate winner.
I think the Cowboys have a shot to come out of the NFC.
I see some regression with Dak Prescott and they are in a pretty tough division.
I think Houston is also in a good spot.
They definitely are well coached and have a great defense.
What do you think about Green Bay this year.
I like Aaron Rodgers obviously. It just seems that they can never stop anyone in a big spot.
For some reason I also think Pittsburgh can make one last run with Ben.
They definitely have a bunch of playmakers.
If their defense can hold they can put up a lot of points.
Big Ben, Brown, and Bell are a a really solid top 3 offense.
Who do you think will be the worst team in the league this year?
It has to be the Jets.
The Jets? Why do you think they are going to be bad.
It seems to me they are tanking on purpose. They've added no one and don't have a quarterback.
I can't wait to start researching my fantasy team and the start of the season.
I agree. Hope it's another exciting year and my hometown Lions can stay competitive.
