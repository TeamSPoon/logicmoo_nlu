I remember when the animated Lion King came out.
That was a great movie.
Disney really knows how to do animation right.
Yes, they use top talent because they know having great actors is important even if they are only heard and not seen.
I'd say it's even more important if they are only heard and not seem. A great actor can covney a lot with their voice that a lesser talent cannot.
I can't imagine anyone else but Jeremy Irons in the role of scar.
And what about James Earl Jones as Mufasa? Brilliant.
And Sir Elton John's score?
Oh Lord! I love, love, love those songs!
It's the Circle of Life after all!!
