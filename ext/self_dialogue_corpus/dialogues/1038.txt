I have the worst co-worker at my workplace.
What, are they stealing your stapler?
Even worse, they're a Steelers fan.
Ah, I see.
Steeler fans are everywhere and I can't figure out why.
They are a popular team.
Right, but nobody is ever actually from Pittsburgh.
I think people like their uniforms.
Yeah, the yellow and gold definitely stand out.
I think that's part of their allure.
What I really can't stand is the terrible towel.
Man, they love waving those things.
They are everywhere too.  Can't watch a game on TV without seeing them.
They seem to rally the team pretty well.
Guys like Bell and Brown really do seem to get a jolt of them.
Speaking of which, Brown is probably the best receiver in football.
He's up there, not sure I'd say he's #1 though.
Best route runner though, don't you think?
Possibly.  He's so explosive, I'd love to have him on my team.
Most teams would!
