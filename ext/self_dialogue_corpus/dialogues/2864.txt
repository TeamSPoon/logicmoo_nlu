Did you see report on ESPN about concussions in football?
I did, they are devoting  a lot of time to it.
Do you thinks that the players claims are ligitimate
Yes, a lot of players hide their injuries just so they can  keep playing
Have you talked to any teams about it?
I spoke to the  Jets, Giants, and Falcon.
Are they going to change any of their protocols?
I think they are. The Jets have bought on a consultant
Is the consultant a medical doctor?
Yes, this Doctor used to work with the Cowboys a few years ago
Did the Jets have to run this by the Commissioner's office?
I think someone high up placed a call to someone in his office
I assume their office would want all teams to do the same thing.
I'm not sure. They do not want any more press on this subject
That's true. Have you from any quarterbacks on this?
I have calls into Brady, Brees, and Rogers.
I would be surprised if you hear back from them
Yeah - me too.  I'm holding out hope though
If you get just one quote from them, you'll be good
I think I might have to place a few more calls to Dak, Matt , and maybe even Eli
