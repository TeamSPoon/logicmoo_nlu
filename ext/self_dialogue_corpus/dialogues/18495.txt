What kind of music is your least favorite?
Oh wow, that's a tough one.
Is country one of them?
Yes actually. I used to like country oddly enough though.
What made you not like it anymore?
I think it just got too whiny for me after a while.
I can understand that.
Yeah a lot of the singers talk about the same things and sappy love stories.
That's true. I heard someone say that country is now just like pop with a twang.
I definitely agree with that, modern country is very much like pop.
What about older country?
I would say things like bluegrass are more country than modern country.
Is bluegrass considered older country music?
I think it's pretty much old folk music, but in a different way that people consider folk music nowadays.
I think I've liked every bluegrass song I've heard.
Most of what I've heard is instrumental, and there's plenty of violin and banjo.
True, I've heard both of those in bluegrass.
It's a shame that more classic country artists aren't as popular.
Yeah, there's definitely more talent in them I would say.
I agree with that, more mastery of an instrument for sure.
