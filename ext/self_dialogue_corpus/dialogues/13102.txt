Do you think Darth Vader was really evil?
Yes. Look at all of the horrible things he did.
True. He did do some horrible things. But in the end, he turned good.
One good deed does not make up for a years of bad things.
Yes, but if he was evil, could have really done something so noble?
By that thinking, no evil person can do anything good.
Why would they?
Self-preservation.
Fine. But when he saved Luke, he wasn't protecting himself. He was more endangering himself. If he had had failed, the Emperor would have killed him.
Darth Vader was evil. Period!
