What kind of music do you like?
I like hip-hop, country, r&b, rock, classical.
Wow, a lot of different tastes!
Yeah, the only thing I can't stand is punk and alternative rock.
Oh really?
Yeah, my husband listens to it and I feel like my brain is going to explode!
Haha, yeah I can sympathize with that.
What do you like?
I like country.
Oh yeah, what artists do you like?
I like Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Shania Twain, pretty much all of them!
Yeah, there isn't a lot of country I don't like.
Me too, although I tend to shy away from anything that is too twangy.
Yeah, I get that.
What's your all time favorite song?
I love Don't Stop Believin by Journey.
Great song!
I love Journey, I grew up listening to them.
Yeah me too.
They are a great band.
