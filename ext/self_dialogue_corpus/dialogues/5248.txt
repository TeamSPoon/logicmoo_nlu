Hey, did you see the new Disney movie Cars 3?
No, I haven't been able to watch it yet. Have you?
Yeah. You really should watch it. It released this week and is amazing.
I definitely will. Which actors make up the cast of the movie?
The cast includes Owen Wilson, Nathan Fillion and Kerry Washington among the major cast.
Oh wow! Cars 3 seems to have a really star studded cast.
Indeed it does. The major part of Cars 3 I loved was the soundtrack. I cannot get it out of my head.
That sounds great. Disney really seemed to have made many movies with brilliant music this year.
I definitely agree. So when will you watch Cars 3?
I think I will surely book my ticket for this week.
