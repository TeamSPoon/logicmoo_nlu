So do you like rihanna?
Well, I do like her but I am not huge fan of her.
Isn't that a contradictory statement?
I mean she is okay for me. Nothing special.
She just gave birth to twins.
Oh yes, I heard about it.
I don't know when will she be back with singing again.
I am pretty sure that not in a while, taking care of kids is not easy.
I agree, But then rich people can hire care takers.
I think it depends on how soon rihanna wants to return.
I am a huge fan of her.
well, good for you.
If it's not rihanna then who is your favorite artist?
I am more into taylor swift stuff.
Oh great, I like her as well.
As much as rihanna? more or less?
I would say a bit less than rihanna.
I don't understand what do you see in rihanna?
I think it is subjective thing.
Oh yes, I forgot about subjectivity.
