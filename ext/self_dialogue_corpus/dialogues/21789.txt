Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?
Yes, my favorite scene was when Diana charged through No Man's Land.
Did you like the new Guardian's the Galaxy Movie?
I haven't scene it yet, but I heard Kurt Russell was good in it.
I can't wait to see Spiderman: Homecoming next month.
Me too! Robert Downey Jr. is going to be in it!
I heard some crazy things about The Book of Henry.
It's not as weird as the critics say, Jacob Tremblay was awesome.
Speaking of Jacob Tremblay, he's going to be in the movie Wonder.
Is that the movie where Julia Roberts is the mom?
I'm really excited about the Han Solo movie.
I was, but I read two directors got fired or something. I wonder what that's about.
I'm so glad Joss Whedon is finishing the Justice League movie.
Yeah, but you know that means some character is going to die now.
I finally saw the live action Beauty and the Beast.
The movie was beautiful. Wasn't Emma Watson terrific?
My boss said the movie Logan was too violent.
Yeah, but it's Wolverine, he's supposed to be violent. And anyway, the movie was really good (but sad).
The movie Get Out was good, but not as good as I expected.
What are you talking about? I thought it was super scary. Thank goodness Chris got away.
