who do you wanna see in concert?
i wanna see twenty one pilots
they have a great live show, i heard
it is just going to cost so much!
thats always the issue.
it will be like over 100 for decent seats
yeah, my friend paid 100 to be in the back
they've gotten so popular
i wish i knew them back when they released vessel
i found out about them too late too
yup, when stressed out came out in the radio
that song blew up so fast.
it went to every pop radio station.
i thought they were stupid at first
how come?
the lyrics were kinda cheesy.
"my names blurry face and i care what you think"
yeah, it just sounded kinda weird and stupid
i get what you mean.
i still like them though
