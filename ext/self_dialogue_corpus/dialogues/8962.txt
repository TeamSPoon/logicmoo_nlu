So what's the best concert you've been to?
I've been to a lot, but hands down, The Rolling Stones was the best.
It's really hard to believe those guys are still touring now in their 70s.
I saw them about 20 years ago when they were in their 50s, and they had the energy of 30 year olds.
They are one of those "timeless" rock bands, that you can imagine their music being played long after they're gone.
Oh, I know, like Wild Horses- wild horses, couldn't drag me awayyyy.
Everyone made such a big deal over the Beatles, but I always liked The Rolling Stones better.
The Beatles only lasted a decade, but The Stones have evolved over decades and had a much longer career.
I'm amazed Keith Richards has lasted so long considering what a bad boy he was.
That's one of the things I love about the Stones though, is how the band members have stuck together.
