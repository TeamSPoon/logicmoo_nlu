Do you want to come watch The Dark Knight?
Heck yes, I love that movie!
Me too, I must have watched it one hundred times.
I was never really a fan of Heath Ledger until The Dark Knight.
I don't know, he was pretty good in "10 Things I Hate About You."
Are you serious right now?
Kinda.
You would say something like that.
Seriously, I agree though, his role as the Joker was awesome.
I know it was. I've seen every Batman movie and none of them can hold a candle to this one.
