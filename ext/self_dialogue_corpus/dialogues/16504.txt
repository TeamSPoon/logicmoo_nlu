well, the western art music, or classical music as many call it, does have odd time signatures. Anything in odd multiples of 3 IS odd.
But they feel like waltzes, and waltzes are not very cool.
No, but odd time signature indeed. It doesn't have to be complicated to be in an odd time signature and that is not an requirement for a music to be good
No it's not. but certain odd time signatures are very cool, like many used in jazz or fusion.
many many classical pieces uses odd time signature in sections. There are so many examples, I don't know where to begin.
The composer and the piece is a start.
Ok. Fine. One example is Bela Bartok's Dance no 5 from six dances in Bulgarian rhythm is in 9/8 time signature.
That's a real odd time signature.
Except he expresses it as 2+2+2+3/ 8 It's just weird.
probably to make it easier on the players. Play 2/b notes is not that hard nor is playing 3/8.
Yep. Exactly.
Play 2/8 three times and then play 3/8 once, except in one fluid bar. I can see that.
Yep, but the piice itself is kinda bizzare.
Well, most of Bartok's music is bizarre..
He even invented a pizzicato named after himself.
Bartok Pizzicato.
Yep. First used in his 4th string quartet. 4th movement to be exact.
Nikita Koshkin adapted it for the guitar.
Yes. In Usher waltz.
My favorite adaptation of the technique for any instrument by far.
