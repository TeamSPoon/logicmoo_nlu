Sometimes watching the NFL really bothers me.
What? Why?
Because of the lack of color options for the uniforms.
Be serious.
I am.
I thought you were going to talk about something important like injuries. Not uniform colors.
It's important to me! It really bothers me.
What exactly bothers you about it?
There are so many teams that share colors.
So?
so each team should have original colors. Not 100 teams being blue and white.
I don't understand why it matters. It's just colors.
Both the cowboys and the Giants shouldn't be blue. They're supposed to be their own teams.
They are their own teams.
If they are, they should be different.
We would run out of colors eventually.
If they have to be blue, they should all have to use a different shade of blue.
Some do that.
Well, then they can't say 'blue' they should say 'teal'.
you're ridiculous.
