I just got to the end of The Goblet of Fire.
What do you think so far.
I never saw the plot with Barty Crouch Jr. pretending to be Moody coming.
That was pretty insane especially since he acted just like the real Moody.
I thought it was hilarious when he turned Malfor into a ferret.
I nearly died laughing.
IT was nice how he comforted Neville.
What happened to his parents was pretty sad.
I still can't believe Cedric died though.
Me either Hufflepuff doesn't get much attention.
