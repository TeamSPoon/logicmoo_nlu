did you see the basketball game last night?
Yeah, not good.
The refs were terrible
they missed some really important call
I really hope the refs call a fair game tomorrow
They sure couldn't do any worse
The Balsac's sure could have shot better
You have to admit Mentsrals played played some pretty good defence
Yeah I agree DiaPHramn played one hell of a game
Yeah nothing was getting past D
I think Pen is going to have a good strong gave and will play hard
I agree he looked a little limp last night
Yeah I think Coach V will really get him up for tomorrows game
Yeah I heard a rumor that he has a new strategy for tomorrow,
I hadn't heard that Yeah what is the new strategy?
Instead of the Triangle Offense hes going to use what he call 4 Play offense
Wow sounds interesting do you how how it works?
Yeah you move the ball around and try to make as much contact with defender to get them to open up
Sounds like good strategy to me for our sake's I hope it works
Yeah my guess is if does work the whole league will adopt it.
