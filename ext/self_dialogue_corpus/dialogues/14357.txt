Hey man how's it going? Have you been watching the NBA this year?
Good man. I've been trying to keep up but I don't always have time.
It's been a lot of fun to watch, you've missed some good games let me tell you.
Well tell me! You know I love the Spurs.
I was amazed at how well they've done so far, I was into Houston.
Come on really the Rockets? I'm surprised your rooting for them.
Don't tease me you know I've always liked the Rockets just not that much.
I remember you we're into the Wizards for quite a while.
I still like to watch the Wizards but I'm just not as strong of a fan for them anymore.
That's alright we all have favorites that fade in and out, it's not weird.
I'm just happy watching the Rockets do their thing, I'll get back to the Wizards eventually.
I understand I'm the same way with a few of these teams.
I'm really happy with the way Harden and Gordon have been working together.
That makes it easier when the team fits, I forget who's the Center these days do you know?
Right now it's Nene, I'm reasonably satisfied.
What do you think about the battle with the Warriors coming up?
I'm not worried I've never thought much of the Warriors this year it's all luck.
Luck can take you far in the NBA sometimes though.
Either way I'm looking forward to the Championship.
Me too, I was thinking about having a party at my house if you and the guys want to come watch!
