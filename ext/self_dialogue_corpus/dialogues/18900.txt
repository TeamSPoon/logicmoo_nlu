Do you like Josh Groban?
Who's that? Sounds familiar.
He's that guy were were listening to the other day. The track with Imogen Heap?
Oh, of course. Now or Never, right?
Yeah, lady. That's the one.
You know, I've never heard anything else by him.
Never? You really should check out the album Awake. That's the one with the Imogen collaboration.
I will. I love anything with Imogen Heap anyway.
Did you know she used to be in a group called Frou Frou?
I love Frou Frou. I wish they would have made another album.
I don't think they ever will. Their one and only album was made 15 years ago.
Who was the other guy in the group?
Guy Sigsworth. And he's worked with a lot of big names. Bjork, even.
They were such a perfect duo. Psychobabble is close to my heart.
How can you choose just one song?
Well, what if you had to? What would you pick?
Hmm. Gotta be Flicks. It's so sad, but somehow it's uplifting.
Yeah, you're right. It makes me think about death, but not in a scary way.
She's a genius. She does these blog videos where she shows off her studio. She plays like every instrument.
She has enough talent for 10 of us.
