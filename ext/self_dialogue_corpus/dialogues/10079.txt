I caught the movie The Great Wall the other day, have you seen it yet?
The one with Matt Damon in ancient China times right?
Yeah that's the one, it was really entertaining! Matt Damon is such a good actor.
I love Matt Damon in the Jason Bourne Series and I was hoping this would be just as fun and it was.
I think Matt Damon brings such a charisma on to the screen. In The Great Wall he plays a thief that ends up helping this Dynasty protect their walls from these demon monsters.
Wow, I didn't realize that film had monster elements! I haven't watched it yet but this sounds like my type of movie.
He battles these demon monsters that are threatening to take over the world. They repopulate really fast and are just terrifying.
It sounds like a movie Matt Damon would be pretty good in! As long as it's action and he get's to kick butt I think the movie will be enjoyable.
Oh he certainly does kick a lot of demon monster butt. I think you'll enjoy it the cinematography is really good and the action is tons of fun.
I'll look for The Great Wall when it comes out to add to my Matt Damon movies collection.
