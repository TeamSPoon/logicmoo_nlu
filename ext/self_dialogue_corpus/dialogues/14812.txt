Do you remember Napoleon Dynomite?
Oh, I remember when that came out.
Yeah, it was hilarious.
Well, it was a different kind of humor.
Did you like it?
Absolutely, but I have a strange sense of humor.
I remember everyone wearing "Vote for Pedro" shirts.
Yeah, and trying to do that dance.
What was your favorite part?
I thought it was funny when he was yelling at the llama.
