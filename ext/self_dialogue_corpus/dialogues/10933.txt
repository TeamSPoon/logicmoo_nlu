Did you see Bishop's new deal?
Yeah all I saw was he got a NMC
Guy probably demanded it.
Hes been traded too much for me to have faith in him.
Yeah I think the same thing.
Nice to see him finally get a deal though.
Well he does it to himself.
Are you saying hes played poorly?
No, just that he hasnt shown enough.
Hes been a victim of circumstance.
Well in any way, he has a good deal.
I think its a tradeable contract.
True but he cant be.
Oh yeah, do you think he plays it out?
Its all guaranteed and not a 35 plus deal so yeah.
Can he be elite.
I think its passed that, but he should be good for awhile.
He doesnt have the tread on his tires for his age.
Hes finally been handed the keys.
Usually that helps goalies produce better.
