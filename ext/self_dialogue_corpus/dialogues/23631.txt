Did you ever get into the Friday the 13th movies?
I've seen all of them at least once, but I'm not a big fan.
Why not?
Jason Voohries is too predictable.
What makes you say that?
You watch the movies.  Kids acting stupid get slashed.
Pretty much, but that doesn't make it bad.
I guess not, but it gets boring.
What gets boring about a machete wielding maniac?
Pretty much everything.  You know what is going to happen way before it happens.
Is there anything you liked about the movies?
It started out as a good story.
What do you mean?
I mean, they let Jason die, so he comes back for revenge.
Also, he was a kid.
Yeah, a kid that died and came back.
But you still didn't like it.
No, I mean, it makes sense that he just runs around with a knife, but it's boring.
And they can't kill him.
Yeah, and then we really don't get into his story any further.
