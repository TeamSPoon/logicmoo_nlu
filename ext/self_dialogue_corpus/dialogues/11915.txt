Do you ever listen to The Beatle's?
Not really, but they're a great band.
Can you name a favorite Beatle's song of yours?
It's before my time, but I like "Hey Jude" when I'm in the mood for that kind of thing. What about you?
They're before my time also, but I tend to like their later, more experimental sounding stuff.
You mean the trippy Sergeant Peppers type stuff?
Yeah, like Strawberry Fields and Octopuss's Garden.
What's your favorite Beatles album?
I think Abbey Road is their greatest album.
I've heard of that. Maybe I'll check it out on Spotify.
