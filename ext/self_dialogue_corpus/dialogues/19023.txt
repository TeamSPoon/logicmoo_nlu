What kind of music do you like?
Oh, all kinds. I really like Pop music.
Me too, I also like rap.
Yeah, some rap is pretty good.
Lately I've been into throwback music, though.
Throwback music? What do you mean?
Mostly like, 1990's and 2000 songs.
Oh okay, yeah I loved those eras of songs.
I've been getting into old Maroon 5.
Yes! This Love is a classic.
Yep, I also really like Wake up Call.
Yeah, I always thought they had great lyrics.
And the beats! They come together so well.
Yeah, besides Maroon 5 I think Usher is a throwback.
Yes! Especially "Yeah" with Ludacris.
I still love that song after all this time.
His new stuff is also good though.
Yeah, he has a lot of collaborations.
I like the one with Justin Timberlake.
I like anything with Justin Timberlake!
