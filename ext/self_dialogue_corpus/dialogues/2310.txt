who do you think the greatest quarterback ever was?
In my opinion it was Peyton Manning. What about you?
I knew you were going to say that! for me, it is probably Tom Brady.
I respect your opinion, but I don't agree.
You don't have to agree, his rings speak for themselves.
I wish Peyton had a better team a lot of the time he was playing.
You can't blame his shortcomings on not having a good team!
I'm not, I'm just saying if he had a better offensive line, he probably wouldn't have ever gotten hurt.
And what does that have to do with this conversation?
If he didn't ever get hurt, and he had a good offensive line, he would have won more rings.
I don't know about that.
The only person worth anything on the line was the center Jeff Saturday.
This has turned into a pity party for you and Peyton.
No, I'm just saying.
Just saying what?
It requires help. A quarterback can't do it all by himself.
Yeah I guess that's true.
And tom has had a lot of help.
I can't argue with that.
Good, so don't even try.
