I just re-watched an animated film I liked a lot as a kid.
What was that?
The Secret of NIMH. Have you seen it?
Yes, but I only saw it a couple years ago.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was okay but there were a lot of major changes from the book.
Really? I never read the book.
So you know how in the film Nicodemus is a wise old rat wizard?
Yes, he was always my favorite character.
In the book he's not a wizard at all, just a wise old rat.
Really? Who gives Mrs. Brisby the magical amulet then?
There's no amulet at all in the book. There's no magic, just technology.
That's very surprising!
I'm not saying the movie is bad though. I just didn't think it was a good adaptation of the book.
Were there any other big differences?
Well Jenner isn't a villain in the book, so much as just a dissenter. Also, Jeremy isn't quite as goofy.
Speaking of Jeremy, did you ever watch An American Tail or Fievel goes West as a kid?
Yes, I liked both of those a lot.
The same voice actor who played Tiger the cat was also Jeremy in Secret of NIMH.
That's funny that he's the goofy big animal sidekick in both films.
