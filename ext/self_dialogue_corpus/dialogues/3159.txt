Have you been following the NFL thjis off season?
yes, some ... Marshaun Lynch to the Raiders, the Raiders moving to Los Vegas, and the draft.
It'll be interesting to see if the Raiders QB will come back after his injury. Also, they lost their RD to Minnesota.
Raiders may still be up there, but Brady and the Patriots are the team to beat.
Yes, I know. I'm a Bills fan, and NE picked up the Bills best cornerback in free agency. That's after the Chris Hogan disaster.
So NE improved on a Superbowl team. That's impressive.
Yes, the Bills have a new coach, but have some rebuilding to do. They won't end up in last place with the Jets in their division.
Okay, the Pats are the team to beat, but who can do it?
KC looks strong, with Andy Reid, if they stay healthy. The Raiders, if Lynch still has something left. Pittsburgh is always in the hunt.
Some team will shine, like Denver did with that defense a couple of years ago.
I 'm an AFC fan, and don't follow the NFC much. Who's rising there?
Carolina, maybe the NY Giants, seem to be up on top.
Which team got the best from free agency or the draft?
NE got Buffalo's Safety. A lot of changes, but nothing that seems to be a turnaround.
The Vikings got the Raiders best RB. Watch out for the Jaguars, Tom Coughlin is back down there, to work on things.
It'll be interesting to see which of the new coaching staffs do well. Example Buffalo's or Jacksonville's.
I will be watching Coughlin. He put together teams several times, he'll do it again.
Don't leave out Pittsburgh. In November there always looking at playoff positioning.
It's wait and see for now. I'll have to read more on the pre-season predictions.
Yes, the sports editors write a lot, but sometimes they miss things like Denver's defense 2 years ago.  See ya.
