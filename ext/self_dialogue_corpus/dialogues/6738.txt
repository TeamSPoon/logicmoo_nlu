What do you think disney most popular movie is?
Hard to say do you mean for me personally or overall ticket sales and profits?
Well now I am curious on both aspects.
For highest profit I think it would now be frozen.. but not sure.
Ah yes that would makes sense , it was so wildly popular.
For me personally I think Lion King. It was crazy popular when it came out as well.
Ya Lion King was good. I love J.T.T. at the time.
You and every other young girl. He was good for the role. His voice was very fitting.
I don't know how played scar, or voiced him rather but his vocals were also a perfect fit.
Scar was such a good character. Lion King had so many good characters and songs.
