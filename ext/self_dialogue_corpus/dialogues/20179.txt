Have you seen anything lately that you recommend watching?
Have you seen Logan?
I have not.
I would definitely recommend Logan. You don’t even have to be an x-men fan to watch it, although it helps.
Yes I did see the trailer in the movies, it did look good and I do like the x-men.
This one only has professor x, I’m not going to give anything away but it will make sense why when you watch it.
Cool. I just watched x-men Apocolypse at last.
What did you think?
I actually really enjoyed it, although I do like all of the newer x-men movies.
I agree, I really enjoyed days of futures past. The plot is a little wacky but I didn’t care and it had wolverine in it which was cool.
Yes, he is my favorite character. If you enjoyed them, then I think you will like Logan. It’s a different spin on the same character.
I think the marvel franchise is doing amazing work right now.
I totally agree. Ant-man was probabally one of my favorites.
Brilliant movie. I was suprised when I heard Paul Rudd was taking the role, but he really impressed me.
Me too, I couldn’t imagine anyone else playing the part better, he was surprisingly perfect for the role.
I had the same feeling with Dr Strange, I wasent expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.
I agree, I wasent really looking forward to it but it blew my mind when I saw it at the movies.
Yes, it had that inception vibe to it, it worked really well.
Benedict cumberbatch suited the character perfectly, I did not see that coming.
I know, who would have throught that Sherlock Holmes could make such a good Superhero.
