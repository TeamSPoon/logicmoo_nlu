what do you think about the force awakens
honestly, it was okay
a lot of people seemed to love it. i guess you dont.
that is true. it was kinda boring.
did you like kylo ren at least?
he is nothing like the force that was vader.
he did not do it for you, huh?
he was just an immature child with power.
yeah, but that makes him interesting.
not to me
