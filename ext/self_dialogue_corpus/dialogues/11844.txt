i got lots of beatles albums
can i buy some
man thats gonna cost you a pretty penny
come on man let me have them for a good price
i can't let these beatles albums go for cheap there classics
that's why i want them how much for two
i really was'nt planing on selling them
i'll give you one hundred dollars for five of them
no way man the beatles go for more than that, try to double that
man tha's high way robbery ,but i'll pay you that if there in good shape.
