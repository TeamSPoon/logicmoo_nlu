Out of all the Star Wars movies what was your favorite?
Personally I liked Episode 1.
Why do you say that?
Because I really enjoyed Jar Jar Binks.
No one likes Jar Jar, how could you?
Because I thought he was funny.
Really? He's kinda dumb.
Yea but he was suppose to be like that. He was the comic relief.
I don't think so. He was just a nuisance.
Sure, but I still think he was funny.
