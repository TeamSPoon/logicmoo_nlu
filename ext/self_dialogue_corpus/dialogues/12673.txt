So if someone who never saw Star Wars was going to watch the entire series, how should they start watching it?
Well, some die hards would say start with episode 4 and watch them in linear sequence.
Hm, that would be kind of silly. I think starting with episode One and follow it thru to episode seven.
Well now, that being the case you would have to tuck Rouge One inbetween episode Three and episode four.
True. But what about the animated Clone Wars series. Would you tuck them in somewhere as well?
That's a good question. Would you try to squeeze in the Star Wars Christmas special too?
Too funny. I guess you would have to sit down and plot out everything that is Star Wars and make a time line.
I agree. You definately have to spend a little time and work it out.
I guess "The Force" would have to be with you!
Ha ha ha, yes, it would have to be!
