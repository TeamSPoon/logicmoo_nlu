What would you say is your favorite comedy?
I loved the movie Daddy's Home.
Doesn't that have Will Ferrell in it?
Yes it does and Mark Wahlberg.
I need to watch that soon, haven't seen it.
I bet you would really like it if you enjoy comedies.
Have you seen the new movie Fist Fight?
Yes actually I have, that has Ice Cube in it right?
Yes he is hilarious!
I really do too.
