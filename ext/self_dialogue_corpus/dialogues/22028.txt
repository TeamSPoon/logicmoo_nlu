I really like watching Food Network. Why aren't there more movies about food out there?
I feel like there are! There are a lot of documentaries though.
Like what?
Well, there's Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
Is that a documentary?
It is. It's about a world-class sushi chef.
Hmm. Okay. What else?
There are a bunch of documentaries about NOMA, that Danish restaurant.
Ah, I've heard of them! That could be exciting.
I'd recommend it.
What about fiction?
Hmm. Well, there aren't as many. There are some classics, like Tanpopo.
What's that?
It's a film about a ramen chef.
Anything else?
I saw a movie about a chef who runs a food truck a few weeks ago.
I think I saw that. With Sofia Vergara?
Yes! I think it was just called 'Chef.'
That was a good movie.
I liked it a lot.
