I saw a good John woo action movie last week.
Oh yeah, which one.
The Replacement Killers.
That movie had Mia Sorvino in it.
Yes, it did.
I thought that not only was the action good, but it was well scripted.
I noticed that also. The storyline was interesting.
You can't beat a John Woo film for action.
Yeah, it feels like you are actually in the movie when you watch it.
Hong Kong style action cinema is the best.
