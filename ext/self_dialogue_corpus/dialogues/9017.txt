What's your favorite Iron Maiden song?
That's a tough one but I think it's Fear of the Dark.
That's a really good choice, one of their best live songs ever.
What about you?
Mine is probably Aces High.
One of the best live openers of all time.
Yeah, Aces High is just so memorable because of their live shows.
Is it safe to say that Iron Maiden is one of the best live bands of all time?
Oh totally, their catalogue and stage presence is amazing.
It'd be awesome to see them in South America, the crowds they get there are amazing.
