What new or upcoming movies are you excited to see?
I'm excited for 'Dunkirk' to come out.
What is that movie about?
It is a movie based on a historical event, the evacuation of Dunkirk.  It was an event during World War II.
Who directed 'Dunkirk'?
The movie was directed by Christopher Nolan.
Who stars in the movie?
There are a lot of big names in 'Dunkirk'.  Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, and Kenneth Branagh are just a few.
When is it released?
I think it gets to theaters in late July.
So, do you think that you'll see 'Dunkirk' in the theater?
Probably.  I would definitely like to.
Do you find you are more selective about what you go see in theaters?
Yes, I feel like I see fewer movies in theaters than I once did.
Why do you think that is?
I think a lot of it is the increased cost of a trip to the movies.  I also think the speed with which things are available for streaming is also a factor.
'Dunkirk' is one that appeals to you enough to get you to the theater, though?
Definitely.  I'm very interested in history.
I'm anxious to see Edgar Wright's 'Baby Driver'.
That also looks good.
