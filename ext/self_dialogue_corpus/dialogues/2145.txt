Hey, do you know when the NFL season starts?
I think it starts in less than 2 months.
I am so exicted. I can't wait.
Who is your team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals. How about you?
I am a Raiders fan. I think they will go far.
Yeah, that quarterback they have is pretty good.
And he is young too. THey were able to add some talent in the off season.
Yeah, the Cardinals were able to bring back a lot of their veterans.
Do you think they can get out of their division, though?
I think the Seahawks will be tough, as usual.
You are not worried about the Rams or niners?
No way. I think they are trying to figure stuff out.
Im worried about the Broncos, they are always our toughest competition.
Yeah, those Raiders Broncos games are always epic.
They can get pretty rough, too.
Yeah, but that's what football is all about.
True, hard play, hard hits.
I'm getting sick of all these calls protecting players. The game is getting soft.
Yeah, they should just let those guys play.
