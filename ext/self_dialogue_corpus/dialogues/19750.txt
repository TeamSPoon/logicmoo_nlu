What's up with that guy from Soundgarden dying last month?
I know, too many musicians commit suicide.
Kurt did the same thing.
Kurt?
Kurt Cobain from Nirvana.
Oh, yeah, that band.
What's that mean?
Oh, just Nirvana weren't the first to be signed out of the scene.
Yeah, Soundgarden were.
Yup.
It's sad he's dead now.
Yes, was he working on a new album?
I don't know, you sound like the Soundgarden expert.
I don't know either.
Kurt's lyrics were more poetic, especially on his tapes.
Yes, I agree, Soundgarden were more pop.
Kurt wrote "School" from Bleach about Soundgarden
Oh? How so?
Well it's all about conformity, in high school and on the record label. He said he could have called that song "Pearl Jam" or "Soundgarden" as well.
You can hear the Tad influence in that album.
