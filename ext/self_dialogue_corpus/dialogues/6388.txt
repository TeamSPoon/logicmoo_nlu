Did you ever see Fantasia?
Do you mean the old version or the more recent one.
The original, not Fantasia 2000.
I did.  It was alright I guess.
What was your favorite segment?
The Mickey one with all the brooms.
That was kind of an iconic scene.
Overall, the movie isn't really a movie, just a cobbled together stretch of scenes.
They're good to see every now and then.
Yeah, but not something to watch on repeat.
