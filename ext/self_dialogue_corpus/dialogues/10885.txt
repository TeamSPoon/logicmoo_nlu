Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?
The Fate of the Furious, yeah like 4 times already.
I just watched it for the first time last night.
Ok, first question, how did you "just" see that movie?
I know I'm super late, but I couldn't get a chance to see it in the theaters.
Well anyway what did you think of the first part in Cuba?
Where Dom freaking drove a car backward to win?
No, I mean where he drove a car backward, that had been ripped down to the studs, and was on fire?
It is by far the best way to open that movie.
Are you kidding me, every action movie should open with that scene; not just racing ones, I mean action movies in general
