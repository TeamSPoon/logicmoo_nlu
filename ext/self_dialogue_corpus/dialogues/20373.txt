Are you exited about the new Justice League movie?
Not realy, I didnt like the previous DC movies.
Oh yeah, howcome you didnt like them?
The movies are too loaded and they have great visual effects but sometimes its too much.
I know I liked the last Batman trilogy I thought it had just the right  amount of effects and a great story line.
Yeah, the last Batman vs Superman movie was quite dissapointing.
I didnt like it either I expected a lot more from it.
What do you think of Ben Afflect as the new Batman?
Well I didnt particularly like him, I thought Christian Bale was doing a great job.
Yeah he was, but he left the Batman movies while they were glorious.
I liked the trilogy with him a lot.
I liked it a lot as well, its not the same anymore.
Yeah, hopefully things will get better and the directors will notice these mayor flaws.
I think they went with all those visual effects in order to challange Marvel but this ended being their downfall.
Yeah, they started with the left foot.
Whats your favorite DC superhero?
Well I like Batman the most, what about you?
Ive always been a Superman fan although Batman is pretty cool as well.
Yeah, those are the best characters really.
I like the villains a lot.
