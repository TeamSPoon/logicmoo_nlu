Miley Cyrus is releasing a country album soon.
Really? Are you sure?
That's what a lot of the tabloids are saying.
Wow. It seemed like she would stick with at least pop music for the rest of her career.
I don't know. I always felt like her new persona was just an act.
Yeah, I can see how you could say that.
She was just acting so outrageous.
I wonder how the fans she gained during her pop/hip hop phase will react to her new album.
I don't know. Maybe her new album will appeal to some of her original fans that liked her country music.
It's so weird to think about how she started off as Hannah Montana, and now she's switched her music genre so many times.
I liked her music best around 2009.
Me too. I loved her song Party in The USA.
That song always reminds me of summer.
I know. It's such a great song to play around summertime.
I also like to listen to All Summer Long by Kid Rock every summer.
Me too. I loved his album Rock n Roll Jesus.
I enjoyed every song on that album.
I think the most underrated song on it was Sugar.
I liked the song Roll On the most.
That was a great one, too.
