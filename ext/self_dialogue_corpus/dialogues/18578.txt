Do they have any new albums up to date?
They actually are, since they're a relatively new band, which started out in 07.
What's the newest album?
It's called Relaxer
Oh, cool name!
Yeah, it seems pretty cool!
Well, you know what else is cool? Listening to the latest remixes!
Like which one?
It's called "Pop Songs World 2015 - Best Of Party Mashup" Look at this!
Oh damn, this one's pretty good!
Yeah, the beat's pretty sick!
Seems pretty popular to me!
Hmmm, we should start up a band!
Nahhh, that'll be too tough for us and our friends.
Hell, nahh, it'll be worth it.
What genre would we start with?
Like a mashup of classical music and modern!
Dude, do you know how tough it is to do that?
How tough can it ?
Well, with people back in the old days, when they would wear suits, tuxes, long dresses, and furs ranging from Fox to Tanuki Raccoon, it'll be really tough!
