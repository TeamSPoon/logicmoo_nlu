What's your favorite Pirates movie?
I would say the first one.
That's too easy. Everybody says that.
Because it's true.
Yeah, but there's got to be another one that's better.
Nope, the first is always the best.  It was more fun than the others.
True.  Some of the plots got a bit silly.
A bit silly?  You couldn't even follow them!
The last movie was a bit easier to understand than some other ones.
By no means easy though!
