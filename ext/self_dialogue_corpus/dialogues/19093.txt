What kind of music genres do you listen to?
Mostly classic rock and 60s folk, what about you?
I'm an indie lover, but I also like modern country.
Wow. Those are really different. What's modern country like?
I think of it as a mix of pop and soft country.
Huh. So like Taylor Swift?
More like The Band Perry and some of Brantley Gilbert's stuff. Taylor swift is more pop by now.
I'll have to check that out. Personally, I don't like the twang and themes of a lot of old country, but this sounds like something I'd enjoy.
Yes, it's pretty great. In some ways it's similar to folk.
Really? So maybe we'd enjoy some of the same 60s folk music.
Yeah, I think so. I'm a big Pete Seeger fan.
Oh, I love his music, so authentic. Ever heard of John Prine?
No, who's he?
He's definitely more 1970s, but he's an easygoing, sarcastic, anti-establishment folk singer.
I'll have to check him out. Sometimes I really wish more modern folk/indie singers channeled 60s folk values.
Yes, good point. Some, like Julien Baker, are really good, but they mainly sing about love.
The Fleet Foxes and Neutral Milk Hotel are very mystical, but convey antiestablishment.
I can see that in the Fleet Foxes. But I think you have to go to modern rap to get real antiestablishment values.
But rappers don't live out those values, usually. They get caught up in wealth and fame, at least the big ones.
Not Jay-Z. He does a lot of good.
