What do you think of black metal music?
I don't think I know what that is.
So basically, it's a style of metal based on heavy distortion, tremolo picking, screamed vocals, and satanic lyrics.
So basically what everyone thinks metal is already?
Pretty much.
That doesn't sound very appealing to me.
I can get why. The vocals alone are an acquired taste.
I just don't understand how anyone can like music with unintelligible vocals.
I used to think that way, too, but they I started reading the lyrics.
Did that make a difference for you at all?
It made all the difference. I found out that there's a lot more depth to that type of music that most will just brush over.
But didn't you say it revolved around satanic lyrics?
Some of it. That's a trait that popularized it, but not all black metal revolves around satanism.
What other lyrics can you find in black metal?
There's a band called Immortal that does basically anything that all other black metal bands do, but their lyrics have more mythical lyrics.
Mythical how?
They have this concept of a land called Blashyrkh, which is essentially a land of endless winter. That's also a regular theme in black metal.
That doesn't sound too bad.
It really isn't. If you're willing to give it a chance, I recommend you start with Immortal.
Maybe I will. I'll get on YouTube right now.
