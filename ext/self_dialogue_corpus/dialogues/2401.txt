The NFL is getting closer and closer!
I know, I wish it would just get here already!
What is your favorite story-line heading into the season?
I am looking forward to seeing if the Oakland Raiders can continue to improve.
Yea, it seems like they have been bad for a very long time.
Now they have some nice young talent and the franchise is finally starting to look good.
Don't they have a pretty good receiver?
Yes, they have Amari Cooper and he has been very good for them.
He and Derek Carr seem to have something going with one another.
Yea they have excellent chemistry on the field together.
Do you think they will make the playoffs this year?
I really feel that they will get there this time around.
Any other story lines that have your attention?
I am very interested in Cam Newton Actually.
What about him exactly?
I just want to see if he can return to form and play like we are used to him playing.
He did not have a good year at all last year.
No, he just seemed off last year. So I think this is a big year for him.
Do you feel that he is an elite NFL quarterback?
I really do, but he has to prove it on the field.
