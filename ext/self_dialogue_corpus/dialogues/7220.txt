Have you seen that Disney movie Beauty and the Beast?
The new one with actors, or the animated one?
The original animated one.
Of course.  My daughter watches it all the time.
Who is her favorite character?
She loves Belle the most.
Of course, but does she like any other characters?
She loves the little cup...I think his name is Chip.
Oh, I love Chip, too.  Him and his mother, the pot.
Her name is Mrs. Potts, I believe.
