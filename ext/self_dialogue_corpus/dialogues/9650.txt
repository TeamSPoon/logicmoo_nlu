The Slim Shady LP might be raps best album ever.
Yeah Eminem knew what to do.
I have to give props to Dre as well
He produced it right?
Yeah he hooked them beats up!
He has an electic background that allows for that in my opinion.
I just think hes good.
I think he knows what he is doing.
Thats for sure the dude has had a ton of hits.
Not really, I think he found Eminem and rode that gravy train
