What do you think of the Star Wars prequels.
Episodes one through Three, or the chronological sequels?
A bit confusing, I know, but Episode one through Three.
I think they do not get the credit they deserve, I liked them.
I did too, I thought the plot played well.
It did. It showed a back story into the rise of Darth Vader.
From a lowly Anakin, on the sand planet to all and powerful.
Yes. It showed both his rise and the start of his fall, very complex.
You did not think it was contrived at all?
No, it was mean to be what it was. A story into the past, of the movies at least.
