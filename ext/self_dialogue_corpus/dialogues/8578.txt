So let's play a game. Best pop male vocalist right now, go!
That is simple. Adam Levine.
Adam Levine? The absolute best is Adam Levine?
What is wrong with Adam Levine? He is so talented!
He is great, don't get me wrong. But he has a band to back him up.
Well who would you suggest?
Bruno Mars, he is the only vocalist so you know all that talent is him.
I do love Bruno Mars, but I don't think Adam Levine being part of a band has any impact.
I guess we just disagree.
Have you listened to Adam Levine's solo stuff? Try that and I know we will agree.
