What are your top five favorite movies of all time?
Let's see. There's going to be a couple John Wayne movies in there.
Oh geez! YOu're not one of those, are you?
One of what?
One of those people who think all old movies are great and all the new ones suck.
You got sonny. These new movies, all they have is sex, drugs and cussing.
Okay. Stop screwing around. Seriously, what are your favorite movies?
Well, if you'd asked a year ago, John Wayne's "McClintock" would have been up there.
Never heard of it.
It's a comedy western.
Like "Blazing Saddles"?
No, nothing like "Blazing Saddles." It can be a comedy western without being like "Blazing Saddles."
Okay, so what other movies do you love?
"The Fifth Element" with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.
Oh man, I watch that movie all the time. Never thought of it as a favorite though.
That's how I determine my favorites. The ones I watch all the time.
So, what else? Anything new and modern?
I loved "Star Trek Into Darkness." Walked out of the theater and told my wife "Best movie Ever!" You can ask her.
I might. What else?
"Starship troopers!"
