I want a Separatist Star Wars film. There I said it.
Like with Count Dooku or General Grievous or something?
Sure, it could be about them. Or it could be about the Separatists who held out and kept fighting after the Clone Wars were over.
Sort of like those Japanese soliders who kept fighting after World War II ended?
Yeah. It could take place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and show their futile fight for their beliefs in separatism.
I suppose it is hard to believe that an army that managed to conquer half the galaxy would disappear overnight.
Exactly, the Confederacy of Independent systems had a lot of support. Even without the droid armies I'm sure some people would keep on swinging.
Well, it's good to want things. I don't think we'll ever see that movie, though.
And that's fine, I would also take a General Grievous or Count Dooku film. Maybe showing what they were up to before Episode II.
Like I said, it's good to want things.
