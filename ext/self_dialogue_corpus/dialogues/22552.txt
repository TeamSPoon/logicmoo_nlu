You know what I was wondering?
What's that?
How come they never show that movie that Robert Dinero made with Wesley Snipes?
Oh, you're talking about The Fan?
Have you seen it?
Yeah, I saw it when it first came out.
Me too. That was over twenty, maybe twenty-five years ago.
And don't nobody ever show it.
I think that's the only movie those two have made together.
I know right. After that Dinero had a bigger career.
He did what, Heat, Casino, and a whole lot more.
And Wesley did maybe Blade and then virtually fell off the map.
Yeah, that Blade was corny. I didn't see it but it just looks corny.
I liked Wesley when he did that Spike Lee Joint Mo' Betta Blues.
Can you imagine? Wesley and Denzell both in the same flick.
You know that was back in the day. Won't happen nowadays in this economy.
Spike Lee had that pull. I like his version of Malcolm X.
His version? Ain't nobody else do Malcolm X.
I'm talking about Denzell's portrayal of him.
Oh, okay.
