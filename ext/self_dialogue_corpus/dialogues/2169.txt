Who do you think will be the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year?
I will have to say New England since they are the defending champions
There are a lot of solid teams in the NFL this year
Yes. The Patriots have Tom Brady
Brady is getting old though
You seen what he did last year at 39. He is only going to get better
I think that the Raiders are going to be solid this year
David Carr should certainly have them in contention
You certainly cannot count out Atlanta
That is true. They are the defending NFC Champions
They could have easily beat the Patriots last year in the Super Bowl
I still cannot believe that the Patriots came back in that game
The Falcons just imploded. They done nothing in the second half of that game
You can never underestimate Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick
I am a Redskins fan so I hope they can do something this season
Their offense took a hit in the offseason though
We did end up doing good in free agency and in the draft
Who were some of the players you picked up?
Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger to name two.
Nice. Then you did not do too bad then.
