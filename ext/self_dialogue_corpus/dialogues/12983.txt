You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes I have.
Do you like Obi-Won?
Yes but he's too trusting.
Is that a bad thing?
It was when he trusted Luke too much it almost got him killed and so many others.
Luke made his choices.
Yes but they could have been prevented sooner.
I don't think so.
Obi could have seen it coming.
