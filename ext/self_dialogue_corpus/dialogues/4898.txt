What do you think of the baseball season so far?
It's been a little of a surprise, especially with the Cubs struggling.
Yeah, everybody and their brother already placed them in the World Series again this year.
That's true. I got tired of all the bandwagon fans last year.
I've never seen so much Cubs gear in my life as the season went on.
I preferred it when they were the loveable losers like in the past.
That's the way sports and society is now...people jump on the latest trend very quickly.
Do you think they will rebound and end up winning the division?
I hope not. I can't live through another year of all these "fariweather fans."
Hopefully, my Cardinals will beat them out this year.
How long have you liked the Cards?
I grew up in the area, so pretty much all my life.
So, I assume you have been to games before?
My dad's company had season tickets that they shared with employees, so we used to go to 8-10 games per year growing up.
It is probably the best atmosphere in baseball, even when they aren't as good.
Yeah, I plan on going later this summer when the Cubs come to town.
That should be a rowdy atmosphere.
It's going to be great. I'm going to bring my son with me for the 1st time.
That should be a great time. Let me know how it goes and if he enjoys it.
I will. Go Cards!!
