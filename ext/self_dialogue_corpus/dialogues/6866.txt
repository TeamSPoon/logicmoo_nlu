Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast?
No, I loved the cartoon
Then you should go see the new one!
yeah but i dont want to ruin the cartoon
I hear ya but I think you would be surprised.
Disney always does a great job at these things.
They really do.
I think I want to keep my view of the movie as it is
It will only enhance it!
Alright maybe I will.
