You know, the football will be on soon.
I can't wait! Tired of baseball and golf.
I watch five games a week.
I see as much as I can.
We got robbed in that Seattle game!
That Russell Wilson got lucky. He can't really pass.
He passed enough that game!
He's more of a college player.
We probably won't play them this year. Carolina is getting better.
Another running quarterback.
Cam Newton? He actually is a good player.
We can beat them. I don't know about Atlanta, though.
Yeah, that Super Bowl was crazy!
We need to shore up our defense by then.
A good offense is a good defense.
Those recievers are all getting bigger and bigger.
You hit them low and they go down.
They got new rules now; you can't do that anymore.
They should let the players play.
This isn't the 50's anymore; they had to do something.
