How do you feel about the last Beatles album?
Let it Be was maybe their best.
Not Seargant Peppers?
No, I think that was great but Let it Be sort of let it all go and said this is what we are.
I think they went back to basics with this album.
Yeah its been said that they played this one together.
Across the Universe is a great track.
I think it stands out as their best from the album.
I also loved Ive Got a Feeling
That song didnt do to much for me.
