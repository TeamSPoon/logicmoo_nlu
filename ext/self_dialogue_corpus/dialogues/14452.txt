How about this game tonight?
I can't believe Boston actually closed the gap!
I know!  Tied at 99?
Oh, Cleveland's up 2 again.
Boston tried for the 3-pointer!
They're really putting up a fight tonight.
It's about time!  That last game was humiliating.
It sure was.  A loss of 44 points?
That's sad.  I know they lost Thomas but he isn't the only good player on the team.
Well, it's good to see them fighting again.
Yeah.  I've been seeing plenty of fouls tonight.
They're scared and fighting hard with the Cavs.
Yep, and now they're up by 1 again.
And tied again.  This is crazy!
2 minutes left!
They just keep going back and forth.
Another foul, this time by Smith.
They were trying to play keep away.
The refs are checking for the 3-point line.
Good, a free throw.  And Boston's up one again.
