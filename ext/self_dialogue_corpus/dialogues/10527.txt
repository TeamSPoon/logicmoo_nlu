Music in movie trailers these days is awful.
I know right? So cliche.
Its always ending with the huge scary robot noise.
Thanks inception.
It was there before that! Even michael bay was doing it with transformers.
Media is dying a slow death.
And the special effects. Does anyone know how to puppet anymore?
Everything looks fake these days.
Star wars though, they knew what they were doing.
Were they? I didnt see it.
Oh man, you have got to check it out!
Why?
They used legit old puppets and stuff like the old films!
Oh snap!
I know! Its super cool.
You changed my mind for sure.
Yeah its pretty great. A diamond in the rough.
Yeah, not much treasure out these days.
Nothing good in theaters at all.
Lets just watch nickelodeon.
