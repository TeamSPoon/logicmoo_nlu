Did you know Flubber was a disney movie?
No, I should have!
I loved Robin Williams in it.
He always did a great job on what he acted in.
His character was hilarious.
He was meant to play the role of a lovable scientist.
Well he was in charge of many other things.
I loved how the story was so fluid
What specifically?
Just how he managed to have so many quirky one liners while maintaining his laughter.
