Wow the NFL preseason is only about a month away. Time flew this offseason.
Yuck, it will be the same old teams winning, all the ones I hate again.
Come on now, your Vikings showed some potential last year, at least early on.
Yeah, but they ended up jinxed as usual. Nothing changes.
Well who do you see winning the divisions this year?
I'd say Patriots, Steelers, Texans, Raiders, Cowboys, Packers, Buccaneers and Cardinals
Whoa...Buccaneers?
Yeah, I think the Falcons will go in a tailspin after their massive choke job. Still mad about that by the way.
Yeah, why do other teams always choke and do the stupidest things against the organization that is always up to something suspicious. Weird.
Buccaneers were pretty good at the end of last year. Winston was coming into his own.
You think Seahawks won't win NFC West?
That was a toss-up..I thought the Cardinals caught too much bad luck last year.
Yeah, it's bound to reverse itself, but I don't trust Palmer anymore.
My one buddy from San Diego is convinced the Chargers will do well now that they've left, just to spite him.
They'll lose 60 percent of their starters to injury like usual, but still average 30 points a game...
And go 5-11 with eight losses in the final minute.
I'm going Cowboys over Raiders for the Super Bowl.
That would be a popular game to watch no doubt. I think both those teams are going to step back though.
Well who do you see winning the Super Bowl?
Gonna go Patriots over Packers.
