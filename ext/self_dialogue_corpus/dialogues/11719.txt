You know what's funny? I just realized I'm listening to the same music my parents listened to at my age.
Oh yeah, what's that?
I'm really getting into The Beatles. I just listened to the whole Sergeant Pepper album.
Hasn't that been voted the greatest album all time by some of those Rolling Stone type magazines?
I'm not sure, but it's hard to believe this album is 50 years old. It somehow still feels fresh and new.
Some of the songs seem a bit dated to me, but others like "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" sound like an indie band could have made it in the past 5 years.
It's really amazing. Think about the TV from 50 years ago. It was all black and white and doesn't hold up at all today.
Yeah, The Beatles are timeless, I'll give you that.
Not to mention how influential they are. Whether other bands give them credit directly or not, they were trailblazers.
They were revolutionary. It's easy to think of them always being there, but they had to create this music that became the foundation for so much later music we love now.
