What country besides USA has provided the most to world music?
You kind of have to go with England, right?
That'd be my first thought.
English Punk, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath... the list goes on.
It's tough to think of another country that even comes close.
What about Canada?
Alannis Morrisette and Justin Bieber. Not quite stacking up!
Haha, that's not quite fair to Canada. They have produced some fine musicians.
How about Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen?
OK, decent musicians, for sure.
Neil Young? Celine Dion?
Celine Dion isn't really my cup of tea, but she's a talented singer. And Neil Young is legit.
How about Rush?
Pretty decent band, sure.
And what about The Guess Who and the Band?
Hey, I'm not saying Canada hasn't produced good music. Just not like the UK.
That's fair. I just think Canada kind of gets overlooked sometimes.
Yeah, I hadn't thought about all those singers until you mentioned them.
Our neighbors to the north have made some great music.
Here's to Canadian music!
