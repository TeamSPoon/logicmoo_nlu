Besides The "I am your father" thing, was ther3e anything else you thought was a surprise in any of the movies?
I'm thinking of a couple of them from VI, but I can't remember how surprised I was the very first time.
You saw this in a theater, first run?
Yes. I was definitely surprised that Leia was the bounty hunter at the beginning.
That one got me too.
I'm lucky in a way.
How's that?
My memory is so bad, I'm still occasionally surprised.
Ha, ha! At your age, having seem it first run, I'm not surprised at that.
Surprised at what?
