Are you watching the halftime show right now?
Just turned it on. Wow! Her outfit is amazing.
I know. I can't believe she's performing Born This Way at a football halftime show.
Right? And they are loving it.
I'm so glad. I think it is such a wonderful message.
I also love Telephone. It's completely my dancing song.
It's so high-energy and makes me feel fierce.
Million Reasons is so beautiful.
I love that she can play the piano.
I know. She is such a talented musician.
