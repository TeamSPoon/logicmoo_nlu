Did you see the Crosby hit the other day?
Yeah, that looked kind of dirty.
I don't think that it was.
Why not?
He was already falling to the ice and the guy just stuck his hands out. He wasn't trying to hurt him.
I don't know if I agree about that. He didn't have to hit him with his stick.
Sure, but it was just instinct.
Maybe, but I still think he was trying to hurt him.
Well, either way, Crosby was out.
It doesn't seem like it mattered that much though. They still won the series.
Yeah, they always seem to beat the Caps.
Ovechkin just never seems to show up when he's needed.
Yeah, even in the Olympics he hasn't been very good.
Yeah, they were pretty terrible in the Russian Olympics. They didn't even medal. I'm sure Putin was pleased.
Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't have them taken care of.
I don't blame them too much though. Canada looked really good that year.
Yeah, Canada has looked very strong the past few Olympics, but that one was pretty amazing.
They always have pretty stacked teams
Indeed. They could field two teams.
It's kind of too bad they had to split them up for the last tournament.
