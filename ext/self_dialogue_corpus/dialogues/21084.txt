What do you think of these live versions of musicals NBC keeps doing?
I'm not the biggest fan of musicals anyway and these are just not good.
Have you seen them all?
I saw The Sound of Music and part of Grease.
You didn't like Carrie Underwood's performance?
I love her but she was not a believable Maria.
That's actually what I thought too. What about Grease?
I hate Grease in all its forms.
I didn't know that.
I do. It's annoying. Some of the songs are OK but that's it.
I don't mind it but it's not the best or anything.
I refused to watch the other ones because they weren't movies or plays I ever enjoyed.
I don't know if I watched every single one. I may have missed one.
All these remakes keep coming out. It's not just these NBC things.
Yeah, I know. Disney keeps doing it.
I'd like to see some new ideas.
It almost seems like Disney has run out of them. I wonder if that's true.
You'd think they'd get new writers or something.
It doesn't seem to me that any company that size could run out of ideas but then you see all these remakes and wonder.
I had the same thought when I saw them doing Beauty and the Beast.
