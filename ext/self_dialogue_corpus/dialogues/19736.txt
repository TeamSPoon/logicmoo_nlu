What kind of music do you listen to?
I like all kinds I usually play the mix station on Alexa.
Do you have prime music I heard they had a lot of songs and stations.
Yes it's totally worth it, they have millions of songs on demand you can even make your own playlist.
How does it work?
You have to have a subscription for Amazon Prime then you just tell Alexia what to play.
I heard that was expensive, how much is it?
It's $100 a year but it's worth it unlimited music and you even get other perks with it too, like discounts on items Amazon sells.
I might have to look into that, can you ask her to play a genre of music or just play a song or album?
You can ask her to play anything from a song, genre, or even ask her to play relaxing sounds.
That's cool how do I make a playlist is it easy?
It's super easy you log into your prime account or get the application and search the music you want then check add to playlist.
Is there a limit on how many songs you can have?
No I currently have over 300 songs on mine and still have room to add more.
Is it a hard drive?
No it just saves to a cloud server, so there really is no limit.
So all I have to do is say "Hey, Alexa, play my music?"
Yes, simple as that.
Well I know what I'm ordering next.
Smart choice.
