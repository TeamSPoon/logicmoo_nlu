do you like bring me the horizon
they changed so much
their new song is much lighter
their old songs were brutal
that was real deathcore
yeah, he was spitting so much
i like the new bring me the horizon though
its much easier to hold on to
they have choruses now
i do like the sadness will never end
that songs is so dark and depressing
i think its about suicide or something
yeah or just him wanting to die
its a painful song but the singing is beautiful
that singer should pop on more songs
yeah but oly sykes can sing better now
thats true
so he doesnt need another singer
he's still not THAT good though
yeah but he is trying
