I don't care about LeBron.
You and every hot-taker.
I literally don't.
No.
I literally, literally don't care about it.
He's a good player.
He stinks.
What?
He stinks bad.
He kills.
He's lame.
The man slays. He owns.
I just don't care for him.
He's always dynamic.
Hahaha.
I'm serious.
He's not.
He's always doing something new .
He's literally not.
He's a good player.
