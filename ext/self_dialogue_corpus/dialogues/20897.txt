Do you like thrillers?
Yes I do. They are a great combination of action, horror, and all sorts of things.
Are there any of them that you really like?
I like the Jason Bourne movies a lot?
What are those movies about?
Well, a man that is actually a CIA agent loses his memory, and the CIA is trying to take him out because of all he knows.
That does sound really exciting.
It really is. The whole series is really good.
Who is the main star in the movie?
Jason Bourne is played by Matt Damon. He really did well in that role, even though he doesn't usually play the action star.
I like a lot the movies he has done. I really liked Good Will Hunting.
Who's in that movie?
Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Ben Afleck all star in that movie.
I remember hearing about that movie, but I've never seen it.
Matt Damon plays a janitor that ends up being brilliant. Matt Damon and Ben Afleck actually wrote the script.
That sounds really interesting. Are there any other movies by Matt Damon that you like?
I really liked Rounders?
Isn't that the one about him being a poker player.
Yes, he is in college to be an attorney but can't get away from the rush of poker.
I didn't realize what all went into poker before I watched that movie.
