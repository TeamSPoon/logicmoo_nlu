What are some of the songs that Lady Gaga sings?
The Cure, Just Dance, Bad Romance, Telephone, Applause, way too many to list.
Do you like her music?
yes, Born this way is probably my favorite. I can really relate to it.
I've seen her on a couple of interviews, and thought she was way out there.
Are you talking about the "meat suit"?
among other things, but she does have a good sound
Yes she does.
Have you heard Perfect Illusion?
Not yet. Will look for it when I head to the music store later.
