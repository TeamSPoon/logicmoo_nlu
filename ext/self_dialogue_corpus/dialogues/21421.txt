I'm in the mood for a horror movie. Do you have any recommendations?
My favorites are Halloween, The Shining and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It depends on what you're in the mood for.
I'm really in the mood for a slasher type movie. I haven't seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
That's definitely a slasher movie, it's really gruesome and scary.
From what I've heard about it, the really scary thing is that it could actually happen.
Yes that's true. People could get stranded in the backwoods somewhere and stumble upon some maniacs.
It sounds good but is it very dated considering that it was made in the early 1970s?
No, I think it absolutely holds up. There was a remake about a decade ago, but the original is better.
Yes, some friends wanted to go see that in the theater but we saw something else. Who was in that?
Jessica Biel and a bunch of unknowns. R. Lee Ermey also is in it.
I think I would rather see the original.
Good choice. You won't be disappointed.
I want to make it a double feature, do you have another recommendation? Something more recent that's good?
A movie I saw in the theaters and would watch again was made a few years ago called The Strangers.
Who's in it and what's it about?
It stars Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. They're a couple in a remote house who get terrorized one night by mask-wearing psychos.
Are there a lot of good scares in that one?
Yes, I'm thinking of a couple right now and just got the chills. It's not as gruesome, it has more build up and suspenseful scares.
Thanks for the recommendations. This sounds like a good combination of movies for a double feature.
I think you'll enjoy it. A classic slasher film and a more tense psychological thriller.
