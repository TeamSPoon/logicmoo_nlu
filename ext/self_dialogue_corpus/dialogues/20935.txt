I really want to see that new Despicable Me movie.
I can't believe that it will be the third installment.
Me either. I love those movies.
Me too. It's so funny when Gru destroys the gamestand in the first movie to win Agnes a unicorn.
I love when he reads the book to all the girls about the three little kittens.
I know. It's so funny how he turns into a family man.
Yep, he gives up being a villian and in Despicable Me 2 he's turned to selling jam.
It's so comical, but I saw in the trailer for Despicable Me 3 that Gru and his wife go back to being villians.
Really? I must not have seen the same trailer as you.
Yep, it sounds like it will be very interesting.
Yes, those movies are always nice and lighthearted.
They are great to watch with younger and older children.
I know. My cousins love the minions.
Mine too. My youngest cousin dressed up as a minion for Halloween.
Aw, that's so cute. I only wish I knew what the minions were saying.
Their voices and crazy outfits are what make them so hilarious.
I love how the minion that does all the housework dresses up in a maid's costume.
I know. It cracks me up.
Even my dad loves those movies because of how ridiculous the minions are.
The minions are so popular there's even a minions ride at the Universal Studios theme park.
