Hey did you see the Green Day show last night?
What?! They played here last night?
They sure did. The show was awesome.
That's unreal. I haven't listened to them in forever.
They just put out a new album this year.
Did you like it?
I listened to it a few times. They sound like old Green Day.
Like very grungey?
Yeah that mixed with a bit of punk.
That's awesome. I didn't really like their pop stuff.
Yeah I think they were trying to be more radio friendly.
I'm glad they sound like their old selves.
Me too. I was worried about them for a while.
Especially with their broadway musical.
Yeah we don't talk aobut that.
Ha good point.
I'm sure it wasn't awful, just not my thing.
Yeah I agree.
Maybe we should go see it sometime.
Ha maybe we should!
