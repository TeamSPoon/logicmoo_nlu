Do you think that Linkin Park will do well on their tour?
Yeah I think so. They have been around forever.
I agree, they know how to put on a great show and keep the crowd engaged.
Do you think they still play their old music at their concerts?
Oh I absolutely think they do. Have you heard their new CD?
Yes, but I didn't really care for it. What about you?
Yeah I did too, but I rather enjoyed it. They continue to evolve and I love that.
That is true, but I'm just not in to it.
I can respect that, but what CD do you think is their best?
I'm not sure really. I think I like their first CD the most.
Do you mean Hybrid Theory?
Oh yes! I love that CD
What is your favorite song on it?
I think I would have to say In the End. What about you?
I would say Crawling because it really spoke to me.
I hear you man! That song really rocks!
I think I would have to say my close second would be In the End as well.
Yeah, it was so different when it came out.
It really helped me get through a lot of emotions I had when I was a teenager.
Yeah me too. I was able to get through them instead of hide them.
