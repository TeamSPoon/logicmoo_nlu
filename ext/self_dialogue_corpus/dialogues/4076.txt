What thriller films  have you watched lately?
The Hills Have Eyes. Wes Craven really has some good movies
I hate that movie. That one is so scary. Kathleen Quinlan was really good in it.
Yea it was pretty bad. Even scary to me and I love those type of movies.
Not me. Thrillers are not my cup of tea.
Well sometimes they can be pretty scary, how about Children of the Corn?
That is another that I hated. I just cannot watch those kind of movies.
Well, I guess some people can and some can't.
I can't. I cannot get them out of my mind after I watch them.
Well better to stay away from them then.
