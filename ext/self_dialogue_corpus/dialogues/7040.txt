What do you think of disney's more recent work?
I think disney puts out so many films it varies.
That is a good point.
The caliber of film they put out varies so widely, you have hits like frozen and but also have Teen beach movie 2.
Ya, they almost seem from different worlds or studios altogether.
They  are certainly different in quality.
That is the thing with disney such a huge studio now they produce all kinds of movies.
Well overall I think they produce some of the best films out even today. take frozen or even the new star wars films.
True, the work they have done on star wars is impressive and high caliber.  But don't forget flops they have to like tomorrowland.
I did not think of Tomorrwland as  a flop, but they do have different levels of work quality now more than the past.
