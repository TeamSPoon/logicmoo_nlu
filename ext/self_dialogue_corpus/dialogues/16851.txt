Hey, were you ever a New Kids on the Block fan?
Oh my gosh, yes!  I loved them back when I was a kid.
Me too.  They had incredible music for that era.
Yeah, they really did.  Did you know they reunited in 2007?
I hadn't heard that!  Which of their songs did you like best?
I think Hangin' Tough was my favorite.  I remember listening to it at the roller skating rink.
Yeah, I liked that one, too.  I also liked Be My Girl, their first single.
Oh yeah, that one was great.  So do they have a new album?
Well they had one called The Block that came out in 2008.
So how was it?
It was okay.  It had two singles called Summertime and Single that were both allright.
I haven't heard them.
Yeah, I didn't like it as much as their old stuff but it was still okay.
Was it still all the same members?
Yep!  Every one of them is still in the band.
That's crazy.  Usually some of the members kinda disappear after awhile.
Yeah, it sure has been awhile.  They had Lady Gaga opening for them in concert.
Oh wow, I guess I could see that.
Yeah.  They're definitely much older than today's boy bands.
Yes, they could be their dads practically.
