Any good movies that were originally books?
I'd say the harry potter series.
I only saw parts of the 1st movie
Really? its really popular
Yea, I remember people were reading the books and posting spoilers to the movies
Thats pretty mean.
Usually books that turn into movies do pretty well.
The story works well most of the time
I also liked the hungers games series
I read the books first, and then watched the movies, it was really well done
Jennifer Lawrence was a great actor in them
I think she does well in all of the movies she is in
She is very talented
I think story and acting is the most important in movies
Yea, a boring story cant be fixed
And crappy actors make you lose interest
Jurassic Park was a book too!
I've never read it, is it good?
I liked it, the movies were more interesting
Thats surprising, I guess seeing the dinosaurs is more exciting than reading about them
