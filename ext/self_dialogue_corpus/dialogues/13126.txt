What was your favorite scene in Episode Seven?
There's so many great scenes that I can't pick a favorite but a few stand out, what's yours?
I liked the battle on Takodana. It was epic with lots of actions and everything about it was great.
I like the part on Jakku when Rey and Fin were being chased by the First Order, especially when the Milenium Falcon was revealed.
Oh wow, that was really cool. I saw The Force Awakens in the theater and everyone cheered when the Milenium Falcom showed up.
That was a great aerial chase scene with the Millennium Falcon and the First Order Tie Fighters.
What I really appreciated is how much detail they put into the Milenium Falcon interior to be sure it matched with the interiors from the original movies.
If you didn't know any better you might think that they were using the exact same set for it as they did in the original trilogy.
You could really tell that JJ Abrams put a lot of thought into little details like that.
He was a Star Wars fan himself so I'm sure he was passionate about making all the little things just right in the movie.
