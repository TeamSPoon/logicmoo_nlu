Do you know anything about basketball?
Not really.
Would you like to learn some basics?
Sure.
Have you ever seen or handled a basketball?
Yes.  It's a large ball that bounces easily and can be held in one hand, if it's a big hand!
Right.  Have you seen a basketball court?
I have.  It's a large open floor with backboards and hoops on either end.  It's about half as wide as it is long.
Right.  Do you know the objective of the game?
I think so.  Points are scored when a player throws the ball through the hoop.  Who ever scores the most points before the clock runs out is the winner.
That's right.  Do you know how many players are allowed to play the game?
No.  But I do know that some are playing while others sit on the sidelines.
Yes, some are one the sidelines resting while 5, per team, are on the floor playing the game.  So a total of 10 players play the game.
I see.  Who are the people with the stripped shirts who are on the floor?
They are the referees.  They watch the play to enforce the rules of the game.
So the game has rules?
Yes, a number of them that makes the game fair for each side.  Too many to go into detail now.
I see.  What are the names of the positions on the court?
A couple of positions include a point guard who shoots shots from the perimeter and a center who is the tallest person who shoots under the hoop.
I have alot to learn about this sport!
