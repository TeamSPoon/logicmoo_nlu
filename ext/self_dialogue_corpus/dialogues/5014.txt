MLB needs to shorten these games.
I watched a game the other night have 10 runs scored total and it went 4 hours.
How do you suggest they do so.
Making relief pitchers at least throw to 3 batters.
I dont think you should do that.
Well it stops the pitchers from going out and going to commercial.
I think once they come in, they have to start throwing right away.
Yeah they practice in the back and then come in and throw more pitches.
Thatll save 30 seconds per reliever.
What about the amount of time between pitches?
That too, make the batter not leave the box or its a strike.
See now we are getting somewhere.
I would also stop with the commercial breaks between innings.
Teams need that for ad revenue.
OK but you could do it during the inning during downtime.
If you are eliminating time between pitches there wont be.
Sure theres foul balls and the such.
I just dont think its feasible
Fans going to the park wont mind these rule changes
It translates more to TV In my opinion
