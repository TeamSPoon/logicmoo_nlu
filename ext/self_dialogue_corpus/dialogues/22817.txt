I like the movie TOP GUN.
Val Kilmer was in that movie.
Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete.
He works on a carrier.
It was the USS Enterprise.
He went to Fighter Weapons School.
He went with his friend.
The friend was Nick "Goose".
School was in San Diego.
It had great action sequences.
The effects were great.
It had aerial stunts.
The movie got mixed reviews at first.
But then it got popular.
It was re-released in 2013.
It became a 3D version.
It got an Academy Award.
Yes, for the song TAKE MY BREATH AWAY.
It was by the group Berlin.
That is a great movie.
