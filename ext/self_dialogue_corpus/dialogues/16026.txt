Megan and I were talking the other day, and we were trying to come up with a list of the best Weird Al songs.
I used to listen to him a lot when I was like ten.
I feel like everyone has! It's a fun list to make.
So what's your go-to?
My personal pick is Everything You Know is Wrong. It's the most off the wall.
I remember that one. I couldn't figure out what "prosthetic lips" would look like as a kid.
I'm still not really sure. What about you?
Hmmm... I like Amish Paradise.
That one gets stuck in my head for days after I hear it.
Yeah, I might not even know the original, but I definitely know all of the lyrics to that song.
It's weird how that happens. I feel like that isn't usually the case with song parodies.
I think it's like that with Weird Al because he's so out there.
One of my favorite jokes in 30 Rock was when he "Serious Al'd" a silly song.
Yeah, that was a great moment. Okay, what else is on the list?
The Night Santa Went Crazy, for sure.
A perfect Christmas song.
Sure to put coal in your stockings.
I might actually listen to some of his stuff later. Just for fun.
Might as well. Let me know if you come up with any more!
Will do.
