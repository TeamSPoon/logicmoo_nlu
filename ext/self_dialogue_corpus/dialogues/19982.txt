Have you ever heard of Black Veil Brides?
No, who are they?
They are a rock band.
No, never. Do they play anything on radio?
Not really. I guess if you could find a rock station that plays new stuff.

They formed in 2006. I just heard of them about two years ago.
Why did you see a video or something?
No, my daughter.
Do they have any good songs?
Yes, actually a lot of them.
Tell me a few, maybe I'll give them a listen.
In the End is a great one.
Is that their newest?
No. It's from 2014.
Did you ever see them in concert?
Yes. Actually we saw them twice.
Did they sound good?
Yes, they did and put on a good show.
