Crazy Train is Ozzy Osbournes best song. Don't you think?
Without a doubt.
That song has been used in so many different ways.
It has.
It's been in movies, ssports arenas and still played on the radio.
Do you have any of his CD's?
I have Blizzard of Oz.
I don't. Thats a good album I have Diary of A Madman.
Back then we couldn't afford to buy them all.
I know, but know we culd just listen on Youtube.
