Do you think the Rolling Stones will come to our area for a concert anytime soon?
They were just here a couple of years ago, weren't they.
They were but I missed them.
Too bad because I saw them several years ago in Durham and they were fantastic.
Really - how much were the tickets?
One hundred dollars but worth every penny.
So the Rolling Stones concert was good?
Yes, they sang all of my favorites.
Did they have another band before they came on?
Yes, but I can't remember who he was, but he was good.
What did they sing for their first song?
Start Me Up.
Did Keith Richards smoke on stage while he was playing guitar?
Yes, of course, it was not a role model moment for my children.
What song did your kids like best?
Jumping Jack Flash and I could tell it was the Stones' absolute favorite as well?
They really got into it, huh?
They did and I hope you get a chance to see them soon.
The Stones have been around almost as long as I've been alive.
They are an amazing band with fabolous music.
