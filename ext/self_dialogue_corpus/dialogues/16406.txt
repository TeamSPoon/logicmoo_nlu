Do you like heavy metal music?
I do. I especially like some of the instrumental aspects of it.
What do you mean? Who would be an example of instrumental heavy metal music.
There are lots of them. Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, just to name a couple.
I've heard of them. Aren't they kind of older acts?
They've both came on the scene years ago. You can still find tem both on Youtube.
Joe Satriani's music has kind of a more positive, or happier vibe than lots of other kinds of heavy metal, doesn't it?
It does. That's because much of it is written in a major key.
What is a major key?
Songs written in a major key use the major scale, which is known as a happier sounding scale than minor.
So heavy metal usually uses minor key?
Yes. Blues music is also quite similar to the minor key.
What kind of scale do most regular rock and roll songs use?
Actually, most rock songs use either a blues scale or minor scale. Rock and roll itself comes from blues music.
Is there any way to know whether a song is written in a major or minor key?
Yes. You need also need to keep in mind, though, that there are other scales sometimes used.
Okay. So how would I know if a rock song is written in a major key?
Well, basically, if it has kind of postive or happy sound to it, there's a good chance it's written in a major key.
That sounds like a lot of different scales to learn for a musician.
Actually, it's not that bad. Most scales have the same patterns that just start and end in different places.
