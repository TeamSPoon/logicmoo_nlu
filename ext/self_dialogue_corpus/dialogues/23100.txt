Hey have you seen that new Alien movie yet?
No, I haven't yet.
I think it's better than Prometheus.
I thought Prometheus was pretty good.
I don't know, for a movie about space archaeologists, there wasn't much space archaeology.
Those little flying drones were cool that made a whole scan of the ruins though.
Yeah I bet it would be handy to have one of those.
I'm not sure I really understood the robot's motivations in the film.
Yeah I don't know about that.
Do you remember who played him?
I think it was Zachary Quinto.
No, I just remembered, it was Michael Fassbender.
Also, what was with the scene of the rolling ship?
Yeah. Just run a different direction!
There was no need to be crushed by it.
So have you seen Alien: Covenant yet?
Yes, I just saw it a couple days ago.
Oh I'll have to watch it soon.
I won't tell you any spoilers.
I appreciate it.
