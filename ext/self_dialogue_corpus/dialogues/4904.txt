The Miami Marlins might as well stop playing baseball.
This team is putrid, horrible and awful combined into one.
First of all, no one goes to the games down there.
Yeah and on top of that, this team has lost 9 out of it's last 10
Talk about unwatchable. This team couldn't compete against some minor leaguers.
Yeah this is not how baseball was supposed to be played.
If any team needed a day off tonight it is them.
Yeah, they should give them the whole year off.
The only bright spot seems to be Marcell Ozuna.
Are you talking about their Left Fielder?
Yes. He is currently batting .302 with 11 homers and 29 RBI
With those numbers he should be playing for a contender.
You would think. Not many people know this guy because his team sucks.
Yeah hard to get notoriety when no one is watching.
Can't really blame the fans, this is a bad product.
It really is and those folks down there are not the greatest when it comes to supporting local teams.
Yeah that is very true. Combine that with an awful product. and you get tons of empty seats.
Yeah it's like a ghost town out there. I don't know how this team is making money
Me neither. I'm just glad this is not a team that I follow.
Yeah me too. If it was I'd be pretty ticked off right now.
