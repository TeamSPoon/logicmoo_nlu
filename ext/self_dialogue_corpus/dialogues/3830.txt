Have you seen Argo?
Yes, good movie.
It has a crazy good cast with John Goodman, Afleck, and Bryan Cransten.
That's probably why it won best picture.
Yeah, and it won best screenplay too.
It was cool seeing how they had all those plans and get those six people out.
It was, sometimes these based on real events stories are just as thrilling as fiction.
I know, they say truth is stranger than fiction.
You know, Ben Afleck was good in that movie too
Yeah, he always is.  I don't know why he gets such a bad wrap.
