Did you know that the rock band Poison was from Mechanicsberg , Pa. ?
No I didn't.
Too bad we didn't get to meet them growing up.
They lived so close to us. Too bad they moved.
They had some great songs.
They had some of my favorite songs.
Talk Dirty to Me was the best of all times.
Don't forget I Want Action.
Love that one too.
Bret Michaels has a great voice.
