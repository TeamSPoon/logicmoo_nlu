Do you know the movie Donnie Darko?
I have heard of it, but I don't know what it's about
It's about a disturbed teenage boy who keeps seeing a scary rabbit
Why does he see the rabbit?
I think it's because he is a little crazy
What does he do about it?
Well he always had the choice to obey what the rabbit says or not
And how scary was the movie?
It wasn't too scary, it's actually my wife's favorite movie
Oh, it doesn't seem that bad. I really want to see it now!
