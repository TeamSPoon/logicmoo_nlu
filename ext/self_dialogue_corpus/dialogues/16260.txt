What kind of music are you into?
I like pop as well as soul.
Oh that is interesting.
I like Beyonce a lot!
Did you like her Lemonade album?
I have not heard that actually.
Seriously? How can you be a Beyonce fan and never hear of that?
I am not sure.
So that last album you heard of hers was the self titled one?
Pretty much.
What songs do you like on that?
Blow and Partition.
Those are very catchy songs.
I always get in a great mood listening to them.
I can see why.
I also like Rihanna at times.
Red Lipstick is good by her.
I agree.
It was great talking to you.
Nice speaking to you too!
