So do you like movies?
I sure do!  Do you?
Yes!  Do you prefer to see them in the theater or at home?
I like to see movies in the theater about once a week and at home the rest of the time.....what about you?
I used to like theaters but they are so expensive!
I know what you mean.
What have you seen lately?
The Shack was great.  I read the book and bought the DVD
I bought that one too
I think you like to see them mostly at home
Okay, well, that's pretty much true.  That way I don't have to get tempted by the theater's buttered popcorn
what are some of  your favorite types?
Another reason I prefer to watch at home...my absolute favorite is documentary. and they don't show those in theaters much
i love those too, but i really love action movies most
then you must be pleased with the current batch of movies
yep.  but a good drama can also foot the bill. i guess i like shoot-em-ups most of all...
so  no rom-com for you?
not if i can help it.
I am not much of a rom-com fan myself...
i can't believe it!
