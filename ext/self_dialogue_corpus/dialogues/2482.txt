How's it going? Are you pumped for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I am, I have been counting down the days until it begins.
Me too, I am really looking forward to seeing my favorite players.
Same here, who are you most excited to see play?
Ezekiel Elliot, I want to see if he has another monster season.
Yeah he was amazing last season.
It was pretty awesome to see a running back dominate in the era of passing the ball.
Yeah, he was just on another level.
Who are you exited to see play?
I am very interested in Mitch Trubiski.
Yes, he has a lot to live up to with the Bears.
He will need to become a franchise quarter back for them.
I think they will have a decent season, maybe make the playoffs.
Yeah, but that division is tough, the Packers, Lions and Vikings can all have good seasons.
That is true, guess it depends on a lot of factors.
It does, a lot of it depends on if teams can get out to a good start.
Yes, if the Bears start 4-0 they will probably make it to the playoffs.
I can agree with that.
So are you going to go to any games next season?
I might, I'll let you know so we can go together.
