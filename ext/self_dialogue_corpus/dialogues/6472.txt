Why don't you like Disney movies?
Because they're bad influences on our children, that's why!
How on Earth are they bad influences?
Cinderella stayed out all night with a man she didn't know, Snow White shacked up with SEVEN men she didn't know, and Tiana was kissing on animals.
Okay, it was totally different back in their times. And Tiana didn't go kissing on animals, just one frog!
Like that makes it better?
He was a talking frog, and he told her he was a prince. He told her a kiss would set him free.
Okay? That still doesn't make it okay. He could've just been a talking frog who was lying to her.
That's true. But what is life if you don't take chances?
I suppose. But nothing would ever make ME kiss a frog!
