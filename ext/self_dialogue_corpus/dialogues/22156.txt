You never did mind spoilers, right? Mind if I throw out some spoilers now?
It sounds like that idea has been buzzing around in your head for awhile. I know if I don't let you get it out of your system now, you will practically tell me the whole movie later.
Okay, so Kurt Russel doesn't really get to accomplish his goal in the movie. I felt cheated.
Doesn't something like that make the movie more interesting? Did he have to figure out some other way to accomplish his goal or something close to it?
No, he did not anyway.
Did he die?
Yes, he died partway through the film, sorry for the spoiler.
You're not sorry. How did he die?
I am not going to tell you that part, but I will say that his companions carried on in his stead.
So there was some sort of positive conclusion to the affair?
No, I don't think there was. I think that the ending, and all of the exchanges just became a vehicle for Tarantino's usual blood lust.
Let me guess. Everyone died in some horrific way, yet the plot was able to keep moving on in spite of pivotal characters dying?
Yeah, but unlike some of his other films, things still made sense, but it felt lackluster compared to the types of showdowns you tend to see in other westerns.
It just sounds like another sort of western to me, kind of like 3:10 to Yuma, the original.
No, Tarantino knew what he was doing. He even had Leigh describe the epic fight scene that everyone was waiting for. You knew it had to come down to that.
I don't think you watch enough westerns. Not all of them have epic showdowns. Some are just a quick bullet to the head.
They set the tone in this movie though- they knew there was supposed to be a big shootout- instead they showed us a massacre.
See, I want to see it now so that I can make some fair comparisons. I think you're exaggerating the issue.
Fine, what day are you free?
I can go see it with you next Wednesday.
