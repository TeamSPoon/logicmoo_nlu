What do you think about Lady Gaga's music
well, her music style varies along with the advancement of her ages
yea, you spotted a pattern?
yea kinda of, before Gaga was married, her songs were more wild and energetic, such as Paparazzi and Poker face.
I heard those 2 songs have broken quite some records
yes indeed, and I personally like them very much
I heard them quite often back then as well, but have you seen the music of video of Paparazzi?
no, I can only imagine it was wild
wild indeed, Gaga put herself in quite a show, the video involves around her secret relationship with a man
could it be reflecting her real life?
