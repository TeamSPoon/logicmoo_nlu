Who is your sleeper team for this year?
Tampa Bay Bucs are looking scary on offense.
Didn't they get Jackson the wideout?
Yep, he is super dangerous.  They also picked up a tight end in the draft.
They have put together a lot of tools for Winston.
It is going to be hard for defenses to pick who to cover.
Winston might have a break out year with all these options.
The downside might be trying to keep everyone happy.
Those wideouts and tight ends are all going to want the ball, yep, you are right.
This is going to be a good problem to have.
Adding Jackson into the mix means every play could go the length of the field.
The guy is really dangerous when he is used right.
The real sleeper is the new tight end.
Keeping those chains moving is idea.
Having good players all around is a luxury.
They are really loaded up.  Teams are going to have a hard time on defense.
Winston will be in the conversation when it comes to stats.
They just have to keep him protected.
Pass rush might be the only thing that can slow him down.
Winston is big and strong, he just has to stay healthy.
