I just sat through Toy Story with my nephew and boy do I miss the old Disney movies.
I agree the old Disney movies were great, they just seemed to have more heart.
Which Disney movie do you remember the most from your childhood?
I would have to say Old Yeller, you know that movie about the boy and his dog.
I agree that was the best.  I didn't have a dog when I was kid but when I saw the little boy Travis with his dog Old Yeller, that made me beg for one!
Wasn't that also the movie with Fess Parker as the father Jim?  He used to be in so many Disney films, he was like a father figure back then.
Of course the thing everyone remembers is the part where Old Yeller gets rabies and they have to shoot him.
I cried like a baby at the end of that movie.  It seemed so cruel after the dog had saved the boy from the bear earlier in the movie.
I'm not sure but I think the little boy in that movie was Kevin Corcoran, I remember I thought he was so cute.
Really makes me sad to think how old we all are now, that movie came out in 1957!
