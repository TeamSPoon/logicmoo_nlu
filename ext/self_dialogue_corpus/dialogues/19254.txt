What band changed your life?
Man I could say Eminem or even the band Thursday
I have heard of both of them
Well Eminem was huge and Thursday not so much
Those are 2 eclectic genres and very different
Yeah well they each mean a little to me in various parts of my life.
What did you like about Eminem?
I thought he could deliver lyrics better than anyone.
Yeah I agree and how about Thursday?
They are from New Jersey so I gravitated towards that.
Thats all you care about?
Of course not, I fell in love with their debut on Victory Records
What was it called?
Full Collapse, it was genre defining.
OK I have heard it referenced before.
You should check it out, they still tour off of the album
When did it come out
I think early 2002 or summer 2001.
So it still sounds good today?
Yeah albums like that age very well
