What do you think of Blade Runner: 2049?
Oh my gosh, that Johann Johannson score in the trailer is amazing!
For sure, it hits all the right Vangelis notes while remaining its own thing.
Did you hear his score for Arrival?
For sure, it was ridiculously beautiful and downright chilling at times.
Tell me about it, all those wordless melodies and experimental percussion.
Anyway, I saw the trailer and have to say I'm getting a sweet The Martian vibe.
Yeah, looks like Ridley Scott must have shared his production notes from that movie with the Blade Runner director.
Did you know the Blade Runner director is actually the same guy who did Arrival?
Denis Villeneuve? I had no idea!
Yeah, I'm happy to see Scott handed off the reins after messing up Alien Covenant and Prometheus so badly!
Whoof, those were some hard to watch movies.
Then again, Prometheus had one hell of a trailer.
Just like Blade Runner 2049, uh oh.
While we're on the topic of dark sci-fi, what do you think of the eventual Matrix reboot?
Possibly a terrible idea, but maybe not if they get Jordan Peele to do it.
Is that possible?
It's certainly in the realm, because Warner Bros wants him for the White Akira movie.
Oh god that would be awful!
Give him the Matrix instead, he showed how to do mind-benders with Get Out.
