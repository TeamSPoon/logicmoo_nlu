Do you listen to Latin music?
Sometimes, what's your favorite band?
My favorite band is Intocable.
I've heard of them, but I like El Grupo Duelo better.
They are alright, I guess.  Have you heard the popular song "Despacito"?
I have, it's contagious.
I know, I can't help but want to dance when I hear it.
I'm not usually into that kind of music, but it's a catchy song.
I keep hearing it everywhere, even Justin Bieber has a version of the song.
Oh, yeah.  I heard it and I like it.
Me, too.  However, I like the Spanish version better.
I'm sure it will be one of the top hits of the year.
I agree.  I wish my favorite band could get a big hit like that.  I love their music, but they haven't had a big hit in a while.
Maybe they will with their new album.
I hope so.
Are you going to their concert?
Yes, I will definitely be there.  Will you?
I'm thinking about it.  Can we go together?
Yes, I would love to.
Great, I will get the tickets.
