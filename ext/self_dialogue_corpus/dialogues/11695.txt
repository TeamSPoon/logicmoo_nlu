I always heard there was a fifth Beatle
George Martin was their producer, and he has been called the fifth Beatle because of his active participation with their recordings
What did he do?
For one thing he played the piano and the harmonium in the Sargent Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band album
Was he involved with the classical music that was used like in the songs Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby?
He didn't play an instrument, but he conductor the orchestra
Sargent Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band sure had some different sounding music.  I remember when I first heard it I thought it was a very new sound
The band wanted to try something new.  They recorded the sounds of as many calliopes as they could.  Then they split the tape into one second portions and put them back together in random order.  That is the first time that had been done
I wonder who thought of that up?
John Lennon thought it up, but George Martin was the genius in making it work.
