Yea, it should be a great season.
Yea, there are a lot of teams that just seem to be ready to really complete.
What do you think of Tampa this year?
Well, Winston seems to really rally the troops. I like them.
Yea, they added Desean and that should help.
Yea, that guy is a playmaker, but he has to stay healthy.
Tampa should be able to make some noise this year, but it may not be enough.
Yea, I like Tampa. I also like Tennessee.
Yea, they have some players on offense with Murray and Marriota.
Yea, they can really score. They showed some signs last year.
I agree. Now if only they could play a little more defense.
It seems like these young quarterbacks are really running the league early.
Yea, having a good young quarterback goes a long way in this league.
I agree! Those who have them tend to win.
Yea, but you cannot expect to win right away.
Thats true! Some take longer than others.
Yea and some start out good and then flounder.
Wow, thats you RGIII. Wherever you are!
That was a good one. I do not know what is up with him.
Yea, his career may be just about over unfortunately.
