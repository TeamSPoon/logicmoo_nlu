Have you seen any of the Austin Power movies?
Oh yes, hasn't everybody?
I can't stand that character.
Who, Austin Powers?
Yes. He just annoys me.
Did you watch all of the movies?
Yes, my husband loves them.
Why do you watch them?
Well I do like a lot of the other characters.
Yes, I like Dr. Evil.
He is good and his mini-me.
Seth Greene plays his son, right?
I think that's who it is. I'm not good with actors names.
Fat Bastard is one of my favorite characters from the movies.
Yeah, he is great. He has so many funny lines.
Mike Meyers does a good job being so many people.
I don't know how he could keep track of the voices. Like I would be dressed as one and speak like another.
I guess he is used to it from playing so many.
I just don't get why Austin Powers is the main character. He is annoying.
I guess he is, I don't like the way he talks either.
