My son is very into Beauty and the beast.
How old is your son?
He is 3!
Mine was 4 when he started watching disney movies.
How old is your child now and what is his favorite?
He is 5 and he loved the little mermaid.
There was actually a scary part in that movie.
Which one?
When Ursala take's her voice and those green hands come out, its pretty creepy.
OH YAH i tottally remember now, he used to look away at that part.
