Have you heard of Avril Lavigne
oh yea, he was my teenager hood crush alright, I think she so cool and awesome
so what's your favorite music from her?
definitely the ultimate street style, confused teenager state of mind, that album, you know what I'm talking about?
I think you are referring Let Go
exactly! I was so obsessed with that album, especially songs like Complicated and I'm with you
yeah, now you makes me feel nostalgia
me too, those songs remind me of my teenagerhood, such a beautiful and struggling memory
why struggling?
well, when you were a teenager you had a lot of think about, emotionally.
