What is your favorite music group?
I love the Beach boys.
What's your favorite song from them?
I'd have to say, "Help Me Rhonda."
That's a fun one.
Can you imagine our parents at a high school dance singing these songs?
Yeah, it reminds me often of the those nostalgic moments.
I love the flashback movies with this type of music.
Me too.
It's just a classic time period.
I know and it all seems so fun.
I think of the time and forget my worries.
I think that was probably the goal of the musicians at the time.
Yeah, despite some turmoil at the time it gave people a way to unite.
I don't know if it united everyone, but it sure lasted a long time.
Yeah, the music is timeless.
I love singing and rocking to the oldies.
Me too.
It's interesting that some of the songs of the 80's are now getting to be "oldies."
I feel old!
