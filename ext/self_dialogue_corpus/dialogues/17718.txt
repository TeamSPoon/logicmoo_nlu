Have you heard the latest album from the band Phoenix?
No, actually, I've never heard of that band before.
Oh really? I think you'd like them.
What do they sound like?
They're a rock band that's from France and their songs are somewhat poppy and unique.
Oh so do they sing in French?
No, they sing in English mostly.  Every once in a while, they'll throw a French word into the lyrics.
That's cool. Are they more well-known in France or in the U.S.?
I'm not sure but in the U.S. they have a decent-sized following.  They have been on Saturday Night Live before as the musical guest.
Oh I must have missed that episode.
It aired a year or two ago, when they were supporting their last album.
So which album of theirs should I listen to first?
I'm a fan of the album they have called Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, but really all of their albums are good.
Ok, I'll try looking for that one first.
Another neat fact about Phoenix is that the singer for the band is married to Sophia Coppola.
The director?
Yeah. She's related to Francis Ford Coppola, who directed The Godfather.
That's interesting.
Yeah, it's neat. Anyway, check out their music.  I think you'll get a kick out of it.
Okay I will.
