When you were younger what was your favorite Disney movie?
I always loved The Little Mermaid.
Why did you like it so much?
I have red hair like Ariel so she was always my favorite.
I think most little girls like Ariel because she is a mermaid.
I agree, I think all little girls want to be mermaids.
I know I did!
Something about mermaids just seems so magical.
I still hope mermaids are real!
Me too! Maybe they are.
