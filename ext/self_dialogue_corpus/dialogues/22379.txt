What's your favorite movie genre?
Well, I like a little bit of everything. Depends on my mood.
I get that. I like action, but only when I'm really in the mood.
Yea, sometimes I just want to watch something light or funny.
I like comedy, but it's hard to find appropriate ones sometimes.
That's true. I like cartoons even to this day.
Me too. Pixar is the best.
I know. They're so innovative.
What's your favorite cartoon?
You mean besides the classics?
Yea, like recent cartoons.
I really liked Wreck-it Ralph. I thought it was super creative.
Same! I loved that movie.
Did you hear they're making a second one?
No way?! Do you know what the premise is?
I think something to do with the internet.
Oh that will be great. I can't wait to see what they do.
Me neither.
I hope it's not a let-down.
They're so creative, I'm sure it will be great.
