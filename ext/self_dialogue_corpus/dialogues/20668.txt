So I heard Ron Howard is directing the new Han Solo movie.
That's not true.  The guys who did The Lego Movie are doing it.
No, they were, but not anymore.
Did they get fired or something?
Apparently so.  From what I read, the studio didn't like what they had done.
What was the central problem?
Apparently the movie was becoming too comedic and screwball.
What did they expect by hiring comedy directors?
Yeah, I guess so.  So they fired them and brought in Ron Howard.
That's an odd turn.
Two completely different styles for sure.  Will be odd to see how it works out.
It's going to be interesting to see how they cut up the film.  Sometimes it's hard to shift directing styles in the edit room.
Yeah, Ron's style is a bit simplistic so it might work out just fine.
Wonder how the cast felt about it.
They were apparently okay with the room.  Some rumors suggest they were the ones who recommended the change.
Hollywood can be a tough place I get.
I don't feel bad for any of these guys.  They're all rich.
So when is the movie going to come out now.  Did it get delayed?
Nope, next May still.  Tough deadline.
Hopefully they don't screw it up for the fans.
