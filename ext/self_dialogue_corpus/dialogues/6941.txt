Did you see Beauty and the Beast?
I saw the cartoon version
It was a good one
Did you feel sorry for the beast?
I thought that it was a little harsh of the wizard
If there was a real life beast, he would need to stay hidden
I'm sure he was lonely
I hope he was not made to live like a beast for long.
He was able to save Belle's life because of being the best
I think a gun would have scared them away
