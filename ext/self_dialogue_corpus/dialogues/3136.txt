So how well do you think the Redskins will do this year?
Hopefully alot better than last season.
Yeah last season was a heartbreaking disappointment.
True, they really should have made the playoffs.
Well, if everyone stays healthy they may have a chance.
True, especially if Kirk Cousin's has a solid year.
Not only that but seeing that they lost Desean Jackson the other wise receivers need to step up.
Yeah, Jackson was so good it is hard to replace him.
The defense needs a overhaul.
Yes, the defense wasn't bad but needs some help.
Oh and the kicker was sub par as well.
I mean he tried his best but missed a few key opportunities.
This may be a semi rebuilding year for the Skins.
I have faith in them turning things around.
What do you think there record will be this coming season?
Well I would say maybe 8-8.
Hmm that seems a little low!
Well, ok then maybe 10-6.
I guess only time will tell.
Very true and i'm very excited to see what happens.
