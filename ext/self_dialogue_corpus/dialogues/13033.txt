How do you feel about the prequels?
I did not think that they were as bad as everyone thinks.
How about Jar Jar Binks?
Now that's something that everyone got right. He was pretty annoying.
Yeah he really didn't do much even after Queen Amidalia got in the senate.
I was surprised that the original senator turned into the emperor.
Yeah he seemed like such a good guy in episode 1 the phantom manis.
He must have been smart to plan all that.
But how cool was Darth Maul when they opened those double doors and he turned his double light saber on one side at a time?
The best.
