Did you hear Disney is making a new The Lion King movie?
Really? When is it coming out?
It's set to release around July 2019. And it will be a live-action movie.
Just like Beauty and the Beast?
I guess so. Maybe a musical, maybe not. Im fascinated by it. Knowing Disney, it will be amazing.
I know it will. I just wonder how they will do it and incorporate the animals. Timon and Pumbaa are my favorites.
The studio will find a way. An I bet it will also be 3D, it will help it come alive.
I just can imagine how amazing the effects and graphics will be.
No doubt it will be a must see movie.
I will mark my calendar. I won't miss it for the world
