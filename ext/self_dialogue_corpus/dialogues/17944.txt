What kind of music do you like?
I pretty much like anything except new country and rap.
What do you consider new country?
Anything that came out after the 80s.
So basically anything pre Garth Brooks.
Exactly!
I can understand that.  I guess he was the first major cross over.
It's all just too poppy now.
It is hard to tell if it's country or pop anymore.
It's like they came up with a particular formula and just ran with it.
Do you think we will ever get back to real country?
Not as long as the pop country is popular.
That's a good name for it, pop country.
I miss Willie and Waylon being on the charts.
Those guys are legends.  I don't think we will ever see musicians of that caliber again.
I can't argue with that.
It seems like no one can come up with anything original anymore.
Maybe it's all been done already
Maybe. I think the next Waylon is out there someone waiting to be discovered.
Let's hope.
