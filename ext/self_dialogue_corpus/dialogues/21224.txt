Let's talk about crappy movies.
Awesome! What would you like to discuss?
Crappy movies--I just said that. Anyway, what is your favorite movie that has awful reviews, say, 35% or below on Rotten Tomatoes?
Oooh, I love this. For all its ridiculousness, 2012 was hilariously bad with beautiful action sequences.
It wanted to make me scream! You can't outrun a volcano!
Hahah, I know, nor can you catch up to a moving plane on foot while outrunning a volcano explosion.
Plus John Cusack's acting was awful.
Yeah, that brought it to its peak. What's your favorite?
I LOVED, loved, Ninja Assassin.
You just said a certain word twice. What about that movie did it for you?
Grow up. I read over and over that it was horribly edited with a thousand cuts per scene.
Yeah, it was a bit of a headache.
But, it was a fantasy battle, like the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill.
I saw it with my good friend. We were laughing our butts off!
Plus the gore was so incredibly over-the-top, it was perfect.
Plus, there had to be a love story.
Ninjas killing each other rapid-fire wouldn't work otherwise.
Which of the two do you think was more over-the-top?
Ninja Assassin, because it defies physics. You?
2012, because the whole plot is set into motion by something that's impossible. At least Ninja Assassin had a useable storyline.
