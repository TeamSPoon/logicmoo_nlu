Do you like the 'Taken' movies?
I loved the first Taken movie.  I did not see the others.
Liam Neeson is such an imposing character as Bryan.
His "I will find you" monologue is one of my all-time favorites in all movies.
It was so well done.  That makes it all the more disappointing that the sequels were so weak.
Did Pierre Morel direct the other two as well?
No.  Taken 2 and 3 were directed by Olivier Megaton.
I see.  I wish they just stopped at the first one, since it was so good as a standalone.
Did you know there was a Taken television series too?
Yes I did.  I didn't find it fun, but it was renewed by NBC for a second season.
