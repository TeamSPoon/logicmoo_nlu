Are you a fan of any Batman movies?
I LOVED the Dark Knight.
Me too that was my favorite one!
Batman Begins was not a favorite of mine.
Me either, I really liked Christian Bale as Batman better.
I did too, although Ben Affleck really did a good job recently in Batman Versus Superman.
He did. I was not a fan of the storyline of that movie though.
It wasn't my favorite but I am really looking forward to Justice League this fall.
I know it looks really good!
I bet it will be. It has all the greats in it.
Yes it does, I'm looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman again in there.
Me too. I think Aqua Man should be interesting too.
I bet he will be, I'm not as familiar with his character though.
I'm not really either actually but I like his character.
Spider-Man is also coming out with a new movie soon, do you plan on seeing it?
I might, not sure if we will or not.
I've always enjoyed the Spider-Man movies.
They're not bad, I'm just more of a fan of Batman.
I can see that.
DC Comics has done well on movies lately.
