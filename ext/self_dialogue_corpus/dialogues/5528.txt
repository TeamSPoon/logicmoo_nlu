Hey have you watched Beauty and the Beast yet?
The original one or the one with Emma Watson?
Emma Watson! The newest one.
Oh yeah, I've seen it already. I loved it.
Same! I love the feeling you get when you watch Disney movies!
What do you mean?
They just feel so comforting and familiar I guess.
I know exactly what you mean! The introduction is my favorite part.
When the fireworks fly over the castle it just feels so good!
I wish I could always feel that way!
