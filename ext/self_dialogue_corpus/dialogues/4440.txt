What do you think of that one new movie about a guy with split personalities?
You mean the movie Split by M. Night Shyamalan?
Yeah that movie was pretty freaky in some ways. I found the Beast and Hedwig personality to be the most creepiest.
No kidding. James McAvoy's portrayal of that character and all the personalities was pretty amazing.
What did you think of the twist at the end?
I was a bit surprised since I didn't realize it was in the same universe as unbreakable. I would definitely like to see another sequel where David Dunn goes after The Horde.
Do you think Casey told the cop lady at the end of the movie about what her uncle did when they found her from The Horde?
I think so because she gave them this look as if she was going to.
If they do make a sequel to this movie about The Horde played by James McAvoy, would you see it?
Oh yeah I definitely would since it did keep me in suspense a lot with this one.
