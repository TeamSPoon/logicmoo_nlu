What upcoming Disney films are you looking forward to watching?
I am really looking forward to the Incredibles 2.
I loved the first Incredibles.
Me too. My kids can't wait to see it.
When exactly does it come out?
It is scheduled to be released in June of 2018.
That is so far away!
I know. I hope it is worth the wait.
I bet it will be. The first Incredibles really delivered.
You are right. Let's watch the first one in the meantime!
