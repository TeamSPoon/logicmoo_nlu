Do you remember Lost Boys from 1987?
Yeah, that was such a cool vampire movie back then.
I know the vampires were starting to get cool. Now they are almost too cool for their own good.
I know. That movie had a little bit of camp and humor thrown in with horror.
I remember. I thought it was a little scary then but pretty entertaining.
The make up was pretty good. Later the vampires in Buffy would kind of look like Keifer Sutherland.
Yeah, that guy had some wicked eyebrows. I think there were 2 sequels that followed.
There were. Lost Boys: The Tribe and Lost Boys: The Thirst and spawned the franchise by the same name.
Wasn't Corey Feldman in all three?
Yep, he actually seems to quintessential 1980's.
He did a slew of films in a similar genre. Gremlins (1984), The Goonies (1985), Stand by Me (1986), The Lost Boys (1987) and The 'Burbs (1989).
I remember most of those. I like the comedy horror aspect of them
Yeah, those were pretty good but I remember thinking Lost Boys was a different kind of movie that the ones I had seen before then.
Yeah, me too. There is always that insurmountable conflict and the heroic act that creates resolution.
Man, when you say it like that, it totally takes the fun out of the movie.
Hehe, 2 semesters of film class.
I remember that. We actually talked about Lost Boys and how it brought about a more youthful vampire.
You mean very un-grandpa like. For instance the Munsters or Vincent Price.
Yeah, those dudes were old then but this new vampire takes it out of the Dracula realm.
Yeah, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. It will be interesting to see where they go with from here.
