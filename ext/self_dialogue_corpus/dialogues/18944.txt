Woah, wait a minute. What is this you are listening to?
Father John Misty. You heard of him?
No! I love it though.
Yeah, this guy's great. He's really only gotten big in the last couple of years.
Do all his albums sound like this?
Unfortunately no. This one is Fear Fun. His first album.
First. So he has others?
A couple now, but they're just not as good. He just really nailed it on this album.
Well, some bands never even get one great album.
That's true! This guy also played with Fleet Foxes.
Oh nice! Another one that's great is The Morning Benders: Big Echo.
Oh yeah, I heard that one!
Yeah, and like this album, from what I've heard of it anyway, it's the same thing. The rest of the Morning Benders' stuff isn't very good.
How does that happen? I can't understand how a band can make such a mindblowing album but then turn out mediocre work.
It's the producer a lot of times, I think. Big Echo was produced by Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, who has a penchant for producing great records.
That's a good point. I need to check out other albums he's produced. Including more Grizzly Bear records too.
Oh definitely!
And I would like to see Father John Misty live. Just because Fear Fun is so good.
We should go. Next time he tours!
Definitely!
