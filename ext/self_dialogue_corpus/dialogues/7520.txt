How do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Honestly, I don't like them at all.
Why do you not like them?
I don't know, nothing that really interests me about he movies or the books.
That fine, normally a lot of people really like them.
I agree, I am normally not a person who likes what everyone else likes.
I can understand that, but if you have free time give one a try.
I tried to watch a few of these movies a few years back and I didn't like it.
I really like the movies, it is great to me.
Nice to hear, I hope they have more movies so you can enjoy them.
