Did Han Solo really shoot first in that cantina scene?
Yes
They went back and redid it?
Yeah. They edited it in a way where he gets shot at first.
Do you think that changes his character?
Not much
Was Jabba in the original?
No, they put him in a special edition
That is weird.
Yeah, it should have been left alone
