Which of the Harry Potter movies is your favorite?
That's a hard decision. For the earlier movies, I like "Prisoner of Azkaban" best.
Me too. How about the later ones?
Well, I like the second installment of "Deathly Hallows" best. It was great to see Voldemort destroyed.
I like that one, but I was sad to lose so many of my favorite characters.
I can understand that. Which of the later movies is your favorite then?
Definitely "Half-Blood Prince". That's where everything started coming together, and Snape was excellent.
You do love Snape, don't you?
Yes, he's definitely my favorite character.
Obviously.
