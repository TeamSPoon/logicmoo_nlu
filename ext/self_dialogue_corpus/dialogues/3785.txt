Are you a fan of the exorcist thrillers?
I love all of them!
I think they just keep remaking them since we keep watching.
There are five sort of cannon ones as of now.
I think they are supposed to make a few new ones too.
I love how scary the girl is in the first one.
You know the set of those films are supposed to be haunted.
I think it showed well in the movie.
The actors all seemed just sort of scared.
It made the movie seven more scary to those watching it.
