Have you seen the movie Doctor Doolittle?
Which one?
Any of them.
Yes!
Which one was your favorite?
I think the first one was my favorite.
I would say that as well.
I just loved the Guinea pig.  His name was Rodney.
Oh my it was too cute.
I also liked how realistic the voices seemed to match the animals.
I know if you didn't know better you would think they really talked.
I think in the first movie was when Maya was trying to hatch that egg wasn't it.
I believe so.
That was so cute when it finally hatched.
Yes, Didn't it call Maya mom?
I think so.
What was it?
I think it was an alligator.
I think she thought it was a swans egg.
I do too, but she got a surprise.
