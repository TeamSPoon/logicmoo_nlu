You need to go and watch "The fate of the furious"
Seen it.
You don't sound very excited
Yeah
Why is that so?
That movie is overrrated
You think so? I absolutely loved.
What did you love about it?
The adrenaline.
Really? I felt like I have seen that movie at least five times efore.
Of course it has a very cliche plot. But the action is top notch.
That's the thing. You can't simply throw fast cars and fight scenes in a movie and expect it to excite me.
I totally forgot you are in to well scripted movies.
Yes. That movie made me feel like I'd wasted three hours of mylife.
Let's hope it is the last one in the franchise.
I heard there are three more coming.
Three? Even an adrenaline junkie like I won't handle that.
They won't care much. The franchise enjoys a big and loyal fanbase.
Let's hope they improve at least then.
Hopefully.
