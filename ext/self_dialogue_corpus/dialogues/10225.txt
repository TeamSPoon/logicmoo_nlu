Have you seen the last Mummy movie yet?
No, I have not. What was it like?
Not sure, I have not seen it either, but I plan on going this weekend.
I have seen the reviews and they look pretty low.
Tom Cruise plays in this one, and hos movies usually are fantastic.
Yes it surprised me the reviews.
The Mummy has some strange looking makeup for the character that plays the Egyptian mummy.
Yes, Alex Kurtzman directed this movie. THe visual effects look like it will be a block buster.
I hoep the critcs are wrong on this one. I want to go this weekend.
Enjoy it, and let me know!
