I'm trying to remember who were the big music stars back in 1997?
Why 1997?
I was in high school back then.
Well let's see, I remember Eric Clapton won best record for Change the World
You can't be serious
Yes, I'm serious.
I hated that song. Can't stand it even today.
Well it won, you can look it up if you like.
Who else was nominated back then?
Celine Dion, Smashing Pumpkins, No Doubt.
Oh I loved Smashing Pumpkins back in the day
And Celine Dion?
Ugh, like nails on a chalkboard
Yeah, I agree. Blame Titanic.
Yeah. I liked No Doubt a lot too.
Yeah, they were good. Whatever happened to them?
I think they kind of disbanded, but Gwen Stefani is still cranking out good music.
Isn't she on the Voice as well.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I'm not really a fan of that show.
