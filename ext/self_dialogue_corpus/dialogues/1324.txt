Have you read sports illustrated articles on their NFL predictions?
No I haven't yet.
It's pretty interesting.
Everyone claims to be an expert.
They'res a lot of so called experts.
What are they saying?
They think the steelers,patriots and packers are the top teams.
Well they're in weak divisions.
That's a big reason.
They figure they are the only teams that can win twelve games.
I'm not sure about that.
What about the patriots or falcons?
Or how about the Giants or chiefs.
Nobody knows for sure.
There is a lot of factors.
Of course there is,such as injuries.
Right. Every team will have injuries.
The teams that have good depth will survive.
That's why the draft is so important for the depth charts.
Teams need to draft smart.
