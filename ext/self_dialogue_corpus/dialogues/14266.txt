Did you watch the playoff game, Spurs and Rockets?
No, I haven't been following the series. What's going on with it?
Today, the Spurs won in overtime. The game was a bit ugly, but it was close and exciting.
Was Harden getting a ton of free throws?
No, just a lot of turnovers and missed shots at the end.
Yeah, I guess that can happen with a team that shoots a ton of 3s.
So the Spurs are up 3-2 now, but game 6 is in Houston.
You think the Spurs will close it out or it will go to 7?
I think Houston probably wins at home, and then game 7 will be a toss-up.
Yeah, they seem pretty evenly matched from what I've seen.
I thought the Spurs were in trouble when Tony Parker hurt his leg, but Patty Mills has filled in pretty well.
Oh, I didn't realize he got hurt.
Yeah, out for the season. Nene on the Rockets got hurt too.
Both older guys, that makes sense.
I think either team is going to have to play out of their minds to beat the Warriors though.
Yeah, they're definitely another level above these teams.
Plus they are resting right now, while these teams play 2-3 extra games.
And you said this one went to overtime, so that's even more wear and tear.
True, good point. That's the beauty of being a top seed, you're more likely to win quick and get more rest.
Yeah, good call.
