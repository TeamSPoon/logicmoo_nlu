Who is your favorite movie composer?
Gotta be John Williams.
Funny.  I was going to say the same thing.
He's written all the classics.
Star Wars is my favorite.
For me, I'd go Raiders of the Lost Ark.
See, Star Wars is the most iconic.
Just because of how it is on the movie scroll?
No, when that music hits you from the beginning, you know it's Star Wars.
I'm not denying it's a great piece of music, but Raiders is still number one.
It's a good theme no doubt.  I like how it slowly builds.
Right, that's why it's better than Star Wars.
That makes no sense.
What I mean is that it doesn't hit you over the head, it's willing to wait.
But there's just something about watching a Star Wars movie and you getting engaged from the get-go.
I don't need music to get me engaged in Star Wars.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
But we can both agree that John Williams is awesome overall.
No doubt.  Wonder what he'll do next?
It will be great though!
