So, which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
I really like Deathly Hallows Part 1.
Really? I think that's the weakest movie in the entire series. Really drab and slow.
Huh, that's why I like it. They really make the audience feel like Harry is struggling with his decisions.
Sure, but it's so drawn out. I mean, they could have just released a single movie instead of breaking the last book up into two movies.
Well, that's true, but I guess the studio thought they could get people to come out to see both movies. Which movie in the series is your favorite?
I guess my favorite is probably The Prisoner of Azkaban.
Why is that your favorite?
Well, the first two were more kids movies, but by the third one the kids are starting to grow up, and they all do a better job acting.
You're right, and that's the movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron. He's one of my favorite directors.
