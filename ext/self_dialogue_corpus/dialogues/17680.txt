What would you say is the best album released this year?
That's hard to say. So much good music has been released.
If you had to pick a #1?
Probably Kendrick Lamar's album.
Yeah, that was pretty amazing. I'm not always huge on Hip Hop, but that album was great.
He's got incredible lyrical talent, and his songs are very interesting musically as well.
No argument. But it wasn't my favorite album.
What was yours?
I'd say probably the new Lorde album.
Ah, I'd never really gotten into Lorde.
You should give her a try. She's really talented.
Something about her just kind of makes me bored, but I can't really explain why.
That's weird, because I don't think of her or her music as boring.
Not her music. What little of it I've heard, it's OK.
So it's her personally?
I guess. In any case, Kendrick's album was much better.
Haha, did you even listen to Lorde's album.
Not really, but I still think I'm right!
Can't really argue with that. Music is tough to agree upon.
Yep, and that's part of what makes it great.
