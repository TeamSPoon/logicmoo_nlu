You listened to the Beatles when you were younger, right?
Sure, I think everyone did.
Well, I wasn't a huge fan until I became an adult.
Really, that is weird.
I was really into Elvis, my mother played his music all of the time.
Oh, so when you did get into the Beatles which one did you think was the cutest.
I switched back and forth. At first I was crazy for Paul.
Yeah, he was so cute but I had a huge crush on John.
I never had a John crush. I would switch to George.
Poor Ringo, he never made the crush list.
