Hey
What's up
Nothing, what about you?
Listening to Sam hunt on the radio
Oh cool, what song?
Body like a back road
Oh I love that song
Me too
It has a really catchy tune
And a great beat
I turn up the radio whenever it comes on
Me too
Do you listen to country a lot?
Yes I love it
Me too, one of my favorites is Miranda lambert
I love the gunpowder and led song
Shes edgy
Yes she is
That's part of what makes her great.
I agree with that
