What is your favorite Disney movie?
I have a lot of them.
But you can only pick one?
I guess I would have to say the Jungle Book.
Why the Jungle Book?
I'm fascinated by the boy and his ability to speak with creatures.
Did you like the most recent Jungle Book?
Yes, very much so.
What was your favorite scene?
I liked when the giant Orangutan sang.
