I just watched the first Fast & Furious movie.
Did you like it?
Yeah it was really awesome.
Wasn't Vin Diesel in that one?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in all of them.
Is Dwayne Johnson in that one? The only one I saw had him in it.
He's not in the first one. He joined later in the series.
Have you seen any of the others?
I've seen them all.
Cool.
