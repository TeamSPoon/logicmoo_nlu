You know who you don't hear a lot about anymore?
Who would that be?
Ol' Dirty Bastard. He was semi popular back in the 90's.
Can you remind me what his songs were?
He rapped that song called "Shimmy Shimmy Ya".
That doesn't ring a bell actually but I do remember the song "Back in the Game."
I think I know that one!
Didn't he rap along with Wu Tang Clan also?
I do believe you are right.
He rapped a few songs with them if I remember correctly.
