Did you like you the first "The Fast and the Furious"?
Yes! That was best movie of all the fast and furious movies. Brian Walker was just starting out and did a great job.
I actually liked the first movie because of Vin Diesel. I personally think he made the movie a blast.
Vin Diesel was good but all the actors in the movie made it a great success.
The story line was also great because what movie about cars is not great?
That is so true. I haven't seen a movie that involves cars that was not great?
This movie started the beginning of many fast and furious movies to come.
Tell me about it. Now there's like eight of them out now. I liked Ja Rule character as well.
Ja Rule was alright in the movie but I think any rapper could play his part.
I believe Ja Rule was uniquely fitted for that position.
