Have you seen any new movies lately?
I saw a movie last night but it was terrible.
Oh yeah? What was it called?
I think it was called, "Pandemic."
That sounds interesting.  Why was it bad?
It just had a very typical zombie and save the world plot to it.
That is what is really popular right now.
I enjoy those types of movies.  I just wish they would change the plots a little to make them more interesting.
I agree with you.  I have been watching comedies lately for that reason.
Anything good that would be worth watching?
I saw a comedy last night.  I can't remember the name though.
What was it about?
Well, it was about 3 generations of men in a family who go on a camping trip.
That sounds like it would be funny.
It was actually.  I enjoyed watching them banter back and forth.
Was it on cable or did you rent it?
It was on Netflix.  It was a recently added movie.
I will have to check that one out on Netflix.  I love watching movies on Netflix.
Yes, netflix is definitely worth the money.
I agree.  I watch it daily.
