Hey! Only 10 days until the NFL training camp starts!
I know, right! I can't wait to see what our rookies do from the draft!
What is your favorite NFL team?
I reallly like the Cincinnati Bengals.
Oh yeah, I follow them. I'm not a huge fan of their head coach Marvin Lewis but I do Ii,e the quarterback Andy Dalton.
Andy Dalton is hit or miss for the most part. He puts up huge numbers on game day typically.... it's mind blowing.
At least we don't have the Browns quarterback!
That's so true! The Cleveland Browns are by far the worst team in football!
Johnny Manuel was such a bust, what a waist of talent!
Yep, the browns got screwed on that one!!
Between the Browns and the Steelers I'm not sure which one I hate the most.
The Steelers play so dirty, I can't stand them either.... plus their coach is a smug asshole!
I'm Ben is pretty amazing. He plays hurt like it's his job
He's clutch under two minutes. I don't know how he pulls that off every single time!
Talk about clutch under two minutes..... Tom Brady
I swear Tom Brady has had to have sold his soul to the devil!
Dude is awesome.... deflate gate or not, he's good
True that! Between Brady and Gronk, pretty much unstoppable
You think they will win another ring this year???
Good chance of it!
