You've seen a lot of NFL games--what's the best game you've ever seen?
In person or on television?
Start with in person.
You know I'm not thinking of a particular game, but there is the most exciting play.
O.K--hit me with that one.
It was Steve Young's long run to beat the Vikings.
I remember that--how long was it?
I think it was about 50 yards, but that's not the best thing.
What was?
Well, he broke a bunch of tackles and barely made it to the end zone where he stumbled in for what was to be the winning touchdown.
O.K. what was the most exciting game including television.
"The Catch" when San Francisco beat Dallas.
Geez--everything is 49ers.
Well, I'm a 49er fan--what would you expect excitement about a Buffalo Bills game?
Point taken--so what was so great about that game.
At the time the Dallas Cowboys was the team--America's team if you must, and to get anywhere you had to get past them.
I remember.
Well, the Montana to Clark catch beat them.
Was it a great catch?
Well, admittedly it was just a little better than routine, but in context it was "The Catch".
