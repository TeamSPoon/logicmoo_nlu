What is you favorite Morgan Freeman film?
That's a tough one....
I really like Shawshank Redemption.
That is on of my all time favorites period!
Tim Robins was really good in that too.
Everything about that movie is compelling.
I've probably seen in 10 times.
"Oh, Andy!"
Ha. You do a pretty good impression.
That movie had some real rough spots though.
Yeah. The Sisters.
Oh, man. That was tough to watch.
But they got theirs in the end.
True. The ending was really the best.
I love a happy outcome.
All except for the warden.
He was a jerk.
Yup. Everything worked out.
Best movie ever!
Pretty darn close!
