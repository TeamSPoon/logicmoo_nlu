Have you seen the new loot crate clothing options, yet.
I haven't but im definitely interested in checking that out, i love their shirts.
Me too!  I bierfly checked it out but it looks pretty good.
Cool, what all can you sign up for.
Umm, i think there was one just for t-shirts and sweat shirts.
Nice, id probably get that one.  Did they have one for the socks.
They did, that was one i was thinking about getting, i love the harry potter and star wars socks i got.
I didn't get the harry potter ones but i have the star wars bb8 ones, they are so cute.
Thats a bummer the harry potter one had all the holecruxs on it.
Darn i would have really liked that i will have to check out ebay and see what they are going for.
Lootcrate also had a wearable one for the ladies.
O thats good, what stuff comes in that one.
I think it has purses, necklaces, and other stuff like that.
My sister would love that im going to check out that one too.
Ya i was thinking about getting it for a friend for her birthday, the prices arent too bad if i remember correctly.
O ya are they the same price of the crates?
No i believe they are a little cheaper.  Like 12 to 15 bucks a month.
Thats pretty reasonable, i think im going to go check out lootcrates site right now.
Alright, take it easy and let me know what you get.
If i had the money id get them all, lol.  talk to you later.
