Did you know that Lady Gaga performed at the Miss Universe Pageant in 2008?
I love Lady Gaga's music but I have no idea what the Miss Universe pageant is.
It is a pageant that women compete in. In 2008 the pageant was held in Vietnam.
That is cool. I wonder if Lady Gaga was well know in Vietnam at that time?
I don't know. She was not really that famous yet.
Which song did she sing at the pageant?
I think she sung "Just Dance" during the swimsuit competition.
Oh alright. That is one of her first mainstream songs.
Well, I did not care for that song. I prefer her later songs.
I disagree. I think her earlier stuff is better than the stuff she has now.
