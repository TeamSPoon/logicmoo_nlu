Hey! So there's this new movie I really want to see. I saw it on Apple Trailers.
What's it called.
It's called The Ornithologist.
Like someone who studies birds?
Exactly. It starts with a man in a canoe looking at birds through his binoculars.
Then what happens? Where is the movie set?
It looks like they're on some quest for a bird. But there's also a lot of mystery involved. Well the film is Portuguese...
So it's set in Portugal?
I think so! They're in some sort of jungle or forest setting. The main character seems to be with some Chinese girls.
Portuguese? Chinese? What language is it in? Are there subtitles?
Oh, you'll definitely need subtitles. There's a bit of English, but also Portuguese and Chinese.
That's okay. I really don't mind subtitles.
And you know what's cool? The director, Jo√£o Pedro Rodrigues, has sorta based this movie on a saint.
Which saint? It sounds like a bit of a leap.
Well the review in Variety calls it "playfully blasphemous modernized hagiography" of the life of St. Anthony of Padua.
Okay, now this sounds really cool. What else did that review say?
It says that "arthouse" cinema fans will really like it, but faithfully religious viewers--not so much.
I'm more of the first time. And I'm all about historical reinterpretations, no matter how indirect.
Then I think you'd love it! I'm equally excited for the scenery and for the story.
Even if it's strange, I want to see it too!
