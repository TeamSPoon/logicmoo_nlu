I've never really been into sports movies, but lately I've been thinking that maybe I should try them out.
Well, you know I have a lot of fun with them. But my definition is pretty broad.
What's your favorite sports movies?
So, this is maybe a controversial choice.
That's okay! Tell me!
I think my favorite sports movie is The Sandlot.
The Sandlot? I've never heard of it.
It's great. It's kind of a coming of age story about kids playing baseball.
So I should watch it?
Most definitely. It was a big deal for me growing up.
Any others?
Well, I'm also a huge fan of Air Bud?
Air Bud?!
Hey, there's no rule that says a dog can't play basketball, is there?
Is that really the reason they let him play?
In the movie? Yep.
That's ridiculous.
It's such a funny movie though.
Okay, I'm not sure either of them are sports movies, but I'll watch them.
You should!
