Did you see the new Stars Wars movie?
I did! I can't believe they got everybody to come back for it.
It's amazing to see Harrison Ford a part of the franchise again.
I know, and Mark Hamill.
But what do you think they're going to know with Carrie Fisher gone?
I know, it's so tragic.
I don't think George Lucas would ever replace her.
I don't think so either. She was so integral to the series.
Maybe they'll have some sort of flashback sequences with lost footage.
That would be a nice way to pay tribute to her.
