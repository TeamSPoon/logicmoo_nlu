Do you want kickoffs abolished?
I wouldnt mind having each team starting at the 20.
Yeah I think thats better.
Would it eliminate commercials though?
I think it would almost have to.
The NFL needs to speed games up
Yeah I think they do as well.
Its a bit odd that they dont try a bit harder.
They should eliminate extra points as well.
That would be like taking an entire position away
Yeah they should do that so teams can carry a punter.
I would be OK with that to be perfectly honest.
You could carry an extra offensive player
Or defense.
Yeah I mean it works out for everyone
Would the players union allow that?
I am sure they would outside of the kicker player reps
That would be a monumental change for the league
I think it could happen way quicker than we think
As long as it makes the game faster I think most fans are behind it
