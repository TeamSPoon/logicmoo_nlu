Hi, do you watch NHL games?
Yes. I am a fan of New York Rangers.
Great! I like New York Rangers too.
Good to know. We should plan to watch the next game of Rangers together? What do you think?
Excellent idea. When will be the next Rangers' game?
It seems to be 7pm this Friday evening. Do you have time?
I believe so. Shall we go to a bar somewhere in downtown?
I know there is a famous bar Night Owl in the downtown area. Many Rangers' fan still be there during the games.
I heard about that bar before but have never visited it yet. Let's go there together this Friday evening.
Fantastic! I really look forward to it and the Rangers' game.
How long have you been a Rangers fan?
Since 15. Hmmmm, it is almost 10 years. How about you?
The whole of my life. Rangers is the only team I support.
You must know Rangers a lot. Do you have many Rangers' souvenirs?
Yeah, I have collected different types of souvenirs, like T-shirt, hat, footwear, etc.
Do you have the Rangers' special edition T-shirt that was sold last year?
Yes, that is one of my favorites.
I always dreamed about having one in the past. How did you get it?
That is a long story. I visited a local fan's club and bought it since the seller was in a financial crisis.
I see. I should visit that fan's club sometime to check it out.
