Who do you think your favorite professor would have been?
I don't know that's a hard one. Probably Hagrid so we could get into trouble.
Not me. I think McGonagall would have been my fave. She knew her stuff but knew how to have fun sometimes too.
You're right. She had lots on one liners especially towards the end of the book when she was pissed off with Umbridge.
Ugh. Umbridge sucks so bad.
I know I still feel so bad for Harry having to carve that crap into his hand.
He really put up with a lot from her. She was the worst.
Right. She was worse than Snape.
Yeah Snape was just mental abuse.
I don't even blame Snape anymore for anything. Now that we saw the flashbacks.
