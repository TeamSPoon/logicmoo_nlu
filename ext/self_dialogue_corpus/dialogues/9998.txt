Would you consider Iron Man an action movie?
Yes I would say its a super hero action movie
OK some people would not consider it that so I was just checking.
I think the plot is not one of an action movie but it develops into one.
Do you think the comics are action comics?
No I feel like Hollywood brings that element.
I liked how Robert Downey Jr Played Tony Stark in the film.
He did an excellent job with him.
His enemy was right on too.
I cant remember his name but it was an epic battle at the end.
