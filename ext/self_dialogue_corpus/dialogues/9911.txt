I love Jay-Z.
Is he your favorite rapper?
By far! The stories he tells in his songs are amazing.
What is your favorite track by him?
I think "Public Service Announcement" is my favorite.
Why do you say that?
I love his flow. I also love the way that he samples the speech in the beginning.
That track is great. But I prefer 99 Problems.
I love that track too. The beat is incredible.
I am always impressed by his instrumentals and beats.
