You about ready for nfl football?
Yep. I've got my fantasy team ready to go.
AWESOME! who's your qb?
Tom Brady all the way!!
Solid pick. I've got russel Wilson from the Seahawks
That seems like an odd choice I don't hear much about him.
Well he passed for over 4000 yards last season with 21 touchdowns.
Ok. Wow seems like a solid choice. Brady threw for 3500 but had more touchdowns.
Yeah no doubt he's good but I just didn't want to pick the obvious choice again.
Again who did you have last year?
Aaron Rodgers. 4400 yards and 40 tds.
Wow. And your not happy with that.
No. Plenty happy just going a different route.
I got ya. Just trying to mix it up a bit. So what wide reciver did you go with?
Julio jones from the Falcons. You?
Odell beckham jr from the Giants.
Do you have something for the northeast teams?
Not in particular. They are just good!
Well I hope you do well this year!
Yeah you too.  Well not too good!
