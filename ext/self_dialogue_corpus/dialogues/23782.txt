I am trying to get into Science Fiction movies more.
have you went the whole Star Wars and Trek route already?
Of course, I mean more deep Science Fiction stuff.
Do you like Space stuff or more time travel and gadgets?
I think I could like it all.
Well, if you want to leave space I would start with the Matrix trilogy.
I think I saw the first one years ago, some guy named Neo.
Played by Keanu Reeves.
Yep, he did another sort of funny Sci-fi too.
What was that?
Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.
I had not even realized that was a Sci-Fi! I love that movie.
I think it was so funny.
I loved when they got Bethoven and forget he could not hear well.
My favorite was when the brought Benjamin Franklin to school.
Like it was show and tell.
That show and Ecino Man came out around the same time.
That is an underrated Pauly Shore movie.
The premise of the frozen cave man did not sound like it would work, but it did.
I liked the way he feel in love when they found his frozen cave girl friend.
