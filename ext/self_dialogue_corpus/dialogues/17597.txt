Hey sweetie. You having a good day at work?
Hey! Not really, but at least I can listen to music, right?
Music makes everything better. Speaking of music, I heard a song today that made me think of you.
Oh really? What was it?
Blake Shelton's Who Are You When I'm Not Looking.
Oh you are so sweet. I love that song.
Blake Shelton's got such a great voice.
He really does. I love his album that came out last year.
Was that called If I'm Honest?
Yes, that was it. It's got some great songs.
Do we have it at the house?
I don't think so.
Well, that would be a good birthday present for you, huh?
I would like that! He's got another one of his top hits too.
Let me see...  Is that Reloaded: 20 Top Hits?
Something like that. I think my friend let me borrow that once.
Was it good?
I enjoyed listening to it. Didn't have my favorite song by him on there, Ol' Red.
Wow, I forgot about that song. I'm going to go listen to that.
Okay, glad to help! Have fun.
