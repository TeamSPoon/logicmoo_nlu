You know who's music is amazing?
Who? Someone I know maybe?
I don't know if you know him or not but Ed Sheeran.
Oh I remember him!
Yes I really really love his song "Shape of You."
Yes it has such a great rhythm and beat to it.
It really does! I like to sing to it when I am driving.
Have you heard "Thinking Out Loud"?
Oh I love that one! Such a beautiful voice.
Yes and his voice doesn't match his look either, it's so funny!
