What was your favorite Matrix movie?
The third one!
You're joking!
I actually am.  I would probably go with Part 2.
For me, the original was the best.  The gunfights were awesome in it.
Sure, but the second one had the freeway battle.
Yeah, that was probably the best set piece of the entire series.
It must have cost a fortune to film.
Well, I think they built their own freeway section to actually film it?
Really?  That's incredible.
