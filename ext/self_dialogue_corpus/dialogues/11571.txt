I've never really been that into the Beatles man. I do like some of their songs but I never really got the Beatles craze.
Well maybe you haven't heard enough of their songs, or realize the significance of their music for that period of time.
Well I know and like the song Imagine. I think the message and lyrics are outstanding.
So you do like them afterall. I would recommend you listen to a greatest hits album to start with.
Growing up my dad would put on a Beatles record, I forget which one it was.
Do you remember if it had the song Hard Days Night.
Yes, actually it did. I remember dancing to that song on several occasion growing up.
My favorite song has always been Love Me Do.
I really like that song too. It brings me back to that time period and how much more innocent we were.
True. I did get to see Paul McCartney in concert about 10 years back. He put on a great show.
