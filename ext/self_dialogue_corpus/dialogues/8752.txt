What's your favorite genre of music?
It's probably Alternative Rock.
I like that genre too. What bands do you listen to?
My favorite band is Kings of Leon.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Yes, I saw them live once. It introduced me to so many of their songs I had never heard befoer like Arizona.
Yeah, so many like the hits like Sex on Fire, but their other music is better.
They put on such a great show. In one song, one of the guitarists picks up his guitar and screams in it. It's called Closer.
I like that song. I recognize the sounds you are referring to.
Closer was the first track off of Only by the Night album.
