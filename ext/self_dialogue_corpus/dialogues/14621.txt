Hey did you watch Game 5 of the Spurs and Rockets?
Yea the game was pretty crazy
I was shocked that a 39 year old Ginobli could turn back the hands of time
Yep, he was the x factor in that 4th quater
The Spurs really played amazing basketball in that game
So who do you think is going to win the series?
I see this going to a game 7, simply because the two teams are so evenly matched.
I agree,  I see the rockets winning Game 6 and it going to 7
The Spurs will beat the Rockets in Game 7
I think the better coaching will prevail, coach Pop has excellent pedigree
D'Antoni preaches no defense, so that is not going to carry the team very far
Defense is the way to the Championship
As much as Golden State has amazing fire power, they are also a good defensive team.
The same can be said about the Cavs, as they have picked it up during the playoffs.
With that defense, I can easily see those 2 teams back in the finals.
Noone is beating the Cavs in the East, but if San Antonio beat the Rockets, I can see them challenging the Warriors.
It is going to be an brutal series for both teams, but I can see the Warriors pulling it out.
I like the Spurs over them
The Warriors have way too much firepower, they will come out on top
Spurs in 6
