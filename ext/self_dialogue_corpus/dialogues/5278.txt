I saw recently that the first movie Mickey Mouse was in was called "Steamboat Willie".
What year was that?
Something like 1928.
Was it in color?
I don't think so. Maybe that's why you never see it now.
Was Minnie Mouse in that one, too?
I think so.  She's been there from the beginning!
Wow, they've been dating for almost 90 years!
Right?  He should propose!
I know!
