What's your favorite lightsaber duel?
Definitely Anakin vs. Obi-Wan
Why?
It's the most beautiful and most intense, with lots of flippy crap.
Ha, flippy crap, nice. I don't like that one.
Why not?
It's too rehearsed: fighting doesn't work that way.
I know, I know, battles should end in like 10 seconds. But this is science fantasy.
I liked Anakin and Dooku. Showed his progress and was short-and-sweet.
Obi-Wan surviving a PLATFORM falling on him was a bit ridiculous.
