What's your top horror movie of all time?
That's easy, it's The Shining.
Is it a violent movie?
There is some violence but it's fairly minor. It's much more of an atmospheric psychological type of horror.
That's interesting. Who made the movie?
Stanley Kubrick was the director and the movie is very much in his style. Matter of fact, The Shining probably is the best example to show someone interested in his style of film-making.
That's great. Where does the movie take?
Most of the movie takes place inside a large hotel, The Overlook hotel in Colorado.
I heard that The Shining is based on a book. Is that true?
Yes, it's based on a novel by Stephen King. However, the film is very different from the book.
