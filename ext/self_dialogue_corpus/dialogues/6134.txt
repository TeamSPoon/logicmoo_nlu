Do you want to go to the movies with me on Saturday?
Sure, I'm not doing anything. Is there something special you wanted to see?
Uh, it's not what I want to see. It's what my 6 year old nephew I'm babysitting wants to see....
Oh Lord. What's the movie?
It's Disney's new movie Cars 3. He loves Lightening McQueen.
Okay, that's fine. I love Owen Wilson, and he does the voice for Lightening McQueen.
My nephew loves the Cars movies, he has a Cars bedpread and toys and everything. I promised I'd take him while my sister and her husband go to a wedding on Saturday.
Well, since I'm single, I'd rather go to a Disney movie than go to a wedding myself and have to watch all the happily in love people.
I know, right?! And of course we can pig out on popcorn and candy from the concession stand.
All right, tell your nephew he has a date with both of us!
