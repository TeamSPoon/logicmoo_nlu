There hasn't been a good "Sword and Sandals" movie in a long time.
What is a "Sword and Sandal" movie?
They are movies that take place in Ancient Greece or Rome.
Do you mean like Gladiator?  Or Clash of the Titans?
Yes, that is what I mean.  I think the last truly great film in this style was Gladiator.
Gladiator was a superb movie.
Whenever it comes on television, I still can't help watching it.
Me too.  I love the scene where Maximus fights against the tigers.
The arena battle scenes were all well done.  Joquian Phoenix did a great job as the emperor.
Agreed.  What did you think about the movie "Troy"?
It had a lot of potential, but I think it fell short.
I thought it was pretty decent, but I think it was missing something.
I think the movie would have benefited if it followed the book, "The Illiad", with more of the "supernatural" route.
It would have been interesting to see the gods and goddesses influence on the different people in the story.
I know.  I would have loved to see that.
The action scenes weren't that bad in the movie.
I loved the scene in the beginning of the film with Brad Pitt's character, Achilles, facing off against that huge warrior.
That guy was massive!
I thought the scene was going to be a long drawn out battle, but no.  Just one hit and Achilles took him out.
I laughed out loud after he did that.
