Do you think George Lucas should have left the line alone in A New Hope for the special edition?
I personally do think he should have left it.
I agree, it fundamentally changes the character.
It kid of does, when Han shoots first it shows he is willing to kill before he gives someone the chance to kill him.
Yeah, by changing it to Greedo shooting first it made what Han did a 'defensive' act.
I rather liked it the way it was, I think Han would shoot Greedo outright if he thought his life was in danger.
Right? Now in the special editions he is a 'good guy' who doesn't shoot until the other person does.
I still think of Han as the original version, I don't like the soft Han that George made in the special editions.
Maybe they should make a 'ultimate edition' where they fix all the little things that George messed up by messing with the films too much.
True, it could also be a good opportunity to remaster some of the effects and other scenes with mistakes as long as they don't fundamentally change the content.
