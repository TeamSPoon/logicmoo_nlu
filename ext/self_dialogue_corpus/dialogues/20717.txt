You've seen Titantic, right?
Yes, of course.
I'm a sucker for romantic movies.
Me too, Titanic makes me cry every time.
Same, especially when the ship starts to sink.
The music definetely doesn't help with the emotions.
As well as the fact that Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio could've both fit on the door.....
That will make me mad forever, Jack Dawson didn't have to die.
He was such a great character, though.
Yeah, I thought the characterizations were written well.
Yes, plus the actors were amazing all the way around.
They looked like they had such a great chemisty, which I liked.
Who, Winslet and Dicaprio?
Yeah, but I heard they actually hated each other the whole time!
Wow, I didn't know that!
Yep, but that wouldn't really surprise me.
True, I'm sure a lot of movie relationships are like that.
Well, that's why they call it acting!
Now I just want to watch Titanic again.....
We should.
