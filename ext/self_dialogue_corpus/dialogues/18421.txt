How do you feel about Neil Diamond
well he has not done anything in a while
I know but don't you think he is a classic singer
sure what is your favorite song of his
Well I love all of the songs from The Jazz Singer movie
Oh yea I forgot he did that movie and all of the music in it
When I was young we had the album Johnathon Livingston Segall
what is that
I believe it was originally a poem and he wrote an album for it
wow thats weird
it is beautiful and shows off his vocals very well
Sweet Caroline is another great one
yes they have used that in a lot of movies
Longfellow Serenade is a classic
I have not heard that one
you probably have you just do not recognize the name
maybe I dont know a lot of the names of songs
What about America
yes that one is from The Jazz Singer too isn
t it
