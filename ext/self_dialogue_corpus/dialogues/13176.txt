Do you like the original star wars or newer star wars movies better?
I like the original star wars better, my favorite is Empire Strikes Back!
I agree, while I have enjoyed some of the new ones, I like the original three star wars movies the most.
Who is your favorite character in all of the star wars movies?
Mine is C3PO, I think he is hilarious, how about you?
I have always liked Han Solo the best.  I guess I like his rogue nature.
I guess I like the lesser characters addition to the movies.
I agree, the interactions between Chewy and Han are classic, and C3PO is sort of funny.
Did you predict Han and Leia having a child?
I did not see that one coming at all.
