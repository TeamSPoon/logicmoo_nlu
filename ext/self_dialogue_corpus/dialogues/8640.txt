Did you hear Foo Fighter's are going to have a new album out this fall?
No I didn't hear that, but hopefully that means they will go on tour?
Yes, and the album comes out Sept. 15. It's called Concrete and Gold.
Well, concrete is a rock, and so is gold, so maybe it's going to really ROCK.
Dave Grohl said it's going to be a GIGANTIC rock record.
They were playing Foo Fighters on the radio the other day, but it was one of their old songs.
Actually, Foo Fighters released a new song recently off the album called "Run."
I haven't heard that one.
They also played two new songs when they did a gig in Iceland recently.
We're going to have to get tickets when they go on tour.
