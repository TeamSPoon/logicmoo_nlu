Do,you,like,superhero movies.
For the most part I do.
I don't like all of them.
A lot of overkill with them.
Yes it is.
The batsman series is good.
Yes,a lot of different batmans.
My favorite was Michael Keaton.
How many batsman movies have there been.
I think 7 total.
Have you seen them all?
No I haven't.
I think jack Nicholson was the better joker.
I agree,but a lot of people think heath ledger.
I'm a big Adam west fan.
Loved the batman movie he made.
That was a classic.
Yes,with the rubber shark!
Hahahahah,wow that was corny.
Corny but good.
