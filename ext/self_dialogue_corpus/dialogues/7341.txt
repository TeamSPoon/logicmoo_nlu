I think Beauty and the Beast is one of the most unique Disney films.
How so?
Well, usually a character like the Beast would be Villain, right?
Well, maybe, he is a prince or something.
Yeah, but he's also a monster.
Okay. So what else?
Well, the actual villain is a stuck-up version of the character that would usually be the hero.
Ah, so that's what you meant.
Yeah. Gaston and the Beast totally switch roles.
I get that. That's fascinating.
