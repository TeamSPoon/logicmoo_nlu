What do you think about Queen touring with Adam Lambert?
I'm all for it honestly.
Really, I'm surprised I thought for sure you'd be against it.
You'd think that but there's nothing wrong with those guys getting out there with someone else.
So would you be against them putting out a record with Adam?
Now that I might be iffy on, especially dependent on how they label it.
You mean like what they did with Paul Rodgers?
Exactly what I mean, if they label on the box that it's with Adam Lambert then okay.
But isn't that a bit tacky?
There exists no other Queen besides the one with Freddy.
