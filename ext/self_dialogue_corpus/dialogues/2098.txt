Do you think the Dolphins stand a chance this year?
honestly, I do.
Why, did they even make the playoffs last year?
They sure did, they played in the first round against the Steelers.
Oh yea, they lost that game. So what makes you think anything will be different next year?
Well look at how they did it last year. They had a rookie head coach in Adam Gase.
True, but that doesn't mean anything.
Do you remember how they started out?
Terribly if I recall correctly.
You do, they started out with a 1-4 record.
Oh yea, then won a bunch right?
True story, they won 9 of their next ten games and made the playoffs.
That is fairly impressive.
Exactly, and they secured most of their core players from last season for this upcoming season.
Did they get any big names.
Not this year, but I think that's a huge difference, they don't need playmakers, they need team players.
Don't they have Suh on the D-line?
They sure do, he's a monster.
Yea he is, nobody is running him over.
Nope, he does the running over.
