Did you ever watch the movie called Major Payne?
Yes I have, starring Damon Wayans right?
Yes, he played that ROTC major that was helping those kids win the military games.
Yes,that movie is so funny. I just watched it the other day.
I have not seen that movie in at least 15 years or so.
That was the last time I saw it too up until a few days ago.
I forgot a lot about the movie, did you find it as funny as you did when you were a kid?
Yes, and I understood it a little better now that I am older as well.
The little kids in it are funny too.
Especially the little boy who is only 5. He is a riot!
I liked the end where they are at the military games, and they do the dances with their rifles.
I enjoyed that part as well, and when Major Payne made them be in the rain and mud.
I need to see it again, it has been so long!
I think it has been playing on tv, I can't remember which channel though.
I think the movie has a good moral to it.
I agree, the ending was really good.
I do not remember the ending much.
Well then, you need to watch it again!
It is worth the watch, I am going to see if I can find it on TV.
Let me know if you find it!
