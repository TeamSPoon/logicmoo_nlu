Do you like Dr. Dre?
I like all of the music he did with NWA.
Do you like his first solo album?
Are you talking about The Chronic?
Yeah, that one.
I do. I still listen to some of those songs on my Iphone.
I like the song he did with The World Class Wrecking Crew.
You mean Before I Turn Off The Lights.
Yeah, that song is a nice melodic slow jam.
I think it's a hip-hop slow jam.
