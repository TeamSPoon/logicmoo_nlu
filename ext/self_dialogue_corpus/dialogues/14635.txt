Okay, I have a confession about my sudden basketball interest.
What is it?
The only reason I have suddenly become intrigued by basktball . . . is because of the manga/anime series Kuroko's Basketball.
Really? Is that the one with the boys with oddly colored hair?
Ha, that description could apply to a lot of anime. But yeah, it's a basketball anime featuring talented basketball athletes with goofy hair.
Well, what did you enjoy about basketball in the series?
I loved the guy who could always make three pointers and could even perfectly make shots from over half the court if he wasn't blocked.
Uh, that doesn't sound realistic -
Oh, and there was the person who could perfectly copy any other player's move as soon as he saw it.
How does that make any sense-
As well as my absolute favorite: the player who no one really notices and who uses misdirection to basically be invisible!
...I'm really not sure how that works. Does he at least look fairly typical so that kind of make sense?
No, he actually has blue hair.
How can people not notice someone with blue hair?!
I'm not too sure to be honest. I've been getting the sense that real basketball is not like this show.
Yeah, that almost sounds like superheros playing basketball as opposed to normal people.
You're probably right. I've also been missing the focus on emotional arcs in the real life basketball.
Er, why would that be featured?
There are also so many meaningful speeches in anime!
Maybe you should just stick to watching sports anime instead of actual sports then.
