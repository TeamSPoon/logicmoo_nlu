Why do people call Michael Jackson "The King of Pop?"
He made a lot of contributions to the genre. His elaborate music videos are just one example.
What were music videos like before he came along?
Most of them were just performance footage. Michael Jackson changed all of that with "Thriller."
Wasn't that the one with Vincent Price and the zombies?
Yes. Don't forget the werewolf!
That looked so cheesy.
It was the 80s. Don't forget his dancing skills.
Have you ever seen his moonwalk?
I'm more of a fan of his work on "Beat It."
