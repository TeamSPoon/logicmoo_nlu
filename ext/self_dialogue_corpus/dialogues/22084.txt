Do you get out to the movies much anymore?
Not like we used to.  Kinda just stay at home and look for stuff on Netflicks.
What about rentals?
Not so much, although we will rent one off of Dish once in awhile.
O.k. here's a question for you--what is your favorite movie of all time?
Well, it's not going to be something profound like Citizen Kane or Network.
That's o.k., go ahead.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
Wow, Paul Newman and Robert Redford--pretty hard to go wrong with that.
It was so funny--the dialogue between them.  And there was suspense and action and symbolism.
I've kind of forgotten about it.  Symbolism?
Well, you know the passing of the Old West from wild to civilization--the bicycle scene was part of showing that.
Well, you obviously know the movie better than I, but I do remember a beautiful woman in it.
Oh, yes, Katherine Ross.  I was in love with her.
Wasn't she in some other iconic film.
Yes, The Graduate--I was even more in love with her in that.
Yes, Elaine--Dustin Hoffman yelling her name at the church.
Well, you do remember.
Oh, yes, that was quite a scene.
And then they ride off in the bus together wondering what have we done.
