I just seen the movie  Wonder Woman!
Oh fun! Was it good?
Yes, I give Gal Gadot ten stars!
Oh, that makes me want to go see it before it leaves the theater.
You really should see it soon.
So do you think that it's appropriate for a 13 year old girl?
I seen some teenagers in there and the movie does a great job of keeping it pg.
That's good to know because I hate being caught of guard .
The movie plot is very exciting and constant diolog and action.
I have always loved Wonder Woman and I'm gonna buy my tickets now, thanks!
