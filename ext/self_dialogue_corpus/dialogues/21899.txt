What did you think of Your Name?
It was really interesting. Thanks for recommending it.
I figured you'd like it. I was in Japan when it came out last year and people were going crazy over it.
Yeah, it was a heartwarming story.
And it was so pretty! All of those colorful shots.
I was surprised by it. Especially the scene in the cave, when the art style changes.
I thought that was a really unusual choice.
There were some parts I didn't understand though.
Like what?
Well, what actually happened at the end, with the power station?
I think they tried to keep that secret on purpose.
I hate when movies are withholding like that.
Hmmm. Can you give me another example.
Like, Donny Darko kind of does that too. You really have to read between the lines.
I've never seen that. Think that I would like it?
You'd probably like it more than I did.
Anyway, I'm glad you liked Your Name! I was sure you would.
Yeah, it was a really great experience.
Let me know if you want to see it again.
I will!
