Who is your favorite female singer?
Living or dead?
Well either I suppose.
I would go with jewel or no alanis morisette.
Jagged little pill was such a good album.
What is your favorite track on it?
You outta know. I think it is such an anthem for so many women.
Ya so many of her songs are the type you just want to sing your heart out along to.
Wasn't alanis engaged to ryan reynolds?
Yes, It was in 2004 they split. Had been together about 2 years.
I don't see them working well. I wonder how that ever happened?
Well they are both canadian so I am sure they had some common core beliefs or understanding.
Ah I did not know he was canadian.
Sure is, he is better off with blake lively. Alanis is too wild for him in my mind.
Probably plus I think she is somewhat older too. Do you know what song if any are about him?
I think Ironic is about their break up.
I heard what is ironic about that song is none fo the examples she gives are truly ironic and that is the irony in the song right there.
Interesting. Makes me think of it in a new way.
Well I will always think of her as a badass lady with a great voice.
Second that here! She is awesome!
