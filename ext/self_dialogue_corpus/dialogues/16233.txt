Do,you like Molly Hatchett?
Yes I love Molly Hatchett.
Ever seen them live?
No,never had.
I haven't seen the band as a whole but I saw the lead singer Danny Jo Brown livemyears ago.
Wow,no,kidding.
It was a phenomenal show.
I can imagine it was.
My brother and i partied with him after the show.
Really? Wow,how cool is that.
It was an unbelievable experience.
He's dead now right?
Unfortunately yes. He died quite awhile ago.
That's what I thought.
I know Molly Hatchett is still playing but it can't be the same.
Yea,I've heard they're still around.
They were near me last year.
Did you go?
No,I thought about it but I,decided not to.
Good music but different singer. Don't think I would have gone either.
