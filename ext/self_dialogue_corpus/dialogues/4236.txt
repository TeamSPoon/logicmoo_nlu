What are some of your favorite thriller films?
Wow, my favorites? I could go on forever. There are so many!
Okay, just tell me your all time favorite then.
Well, I do love The Bad Seed.
I've never heard of that one.
It's a black and white film from 1956, really a great one.
What's it all about?
It's a psychological thriller about a little girl who is born with the killer instinct. The movie discusses whether genetics or environment play a part in how a person turns out.
That sounds pretty deep, does the movie get boring?
Not at all, the little girl is so evil and engaging that it flows together seamlessly with the psychology.
