I you could choose a single Beatles album as your favorite, which one would that be?
Oh, there are quite a few albums that I like, but I'd have to say "Rubber Soul" is probably my favorite.
Can you tell me why that is? What in particular draws you to that album?
Well, I think it's the songs. "You're Gonna Lose That Girl" really draws me in, and it always has.
What is it about that song that you like?
It's the harmonies. When I was a kid I used to listen to it over and over again, to learn to sing harmony. It's so rewarding now to sing with the album!
Whose harmonies are you singing?
I think it's Paul - my voice and his have always been quite similar, so I can usually sing his parts. Though my voice isn't as good as it used to be!
Is Paul your favorite Beatle?
I always thought he was the most good looking of the bunch - but I have to say John and George were always next in line!
