Who do you think is going to win the superbowl this year?
I would say probably the Patriots
Oh god are you serious
How can they not, Tom Brady is back and the team is the same pretty much from last year
I know but at some point they have to start losing
I doubt it they have a hell of a team and a great coach
A Cheating coach you mean
even with the cheating he is still great
True, they still find a way to win
Who do you think is going to win?
More than likely in my opinion the Steelers
Ewww.  Big Ben and company?
Yeah they always have that resiliance that a lot of teams are missing
yup you cannot deny that they have great drive
I mean you can knock that team down and beat the crap out of them and they keep on coming
I remember when they had Jerome Betis that guy was a beast
you talking about "The Bus"
Yeah that guy would plow right through the defense
I know Bill Bellicheck loved that guy
yup
