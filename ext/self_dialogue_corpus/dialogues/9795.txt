Does Snoop Dogg still make rap?
No he is more of an entertainer now.
Does he still have his marijuana ways?
Like does he smoke? Yeah probably does.
I mean more along the lines of does he care about weed?
He still smokes it but I dont know if it consumes him.
He was such a good rapper back in the day
Anything he did was a chart topper
And I think that people relate to what he was rapping about.
Yeah most of his fan base also smoked the devil's lettuce as well.
