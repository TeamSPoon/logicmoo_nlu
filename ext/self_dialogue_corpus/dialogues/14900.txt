Have you ever seen 50 First Dates?
Was that with Adam Sandler?
Yeah and Drew Barrymore.
Yeah, that was a pretty sweet movie.
Yeah, pretty funny too, right.
I mean, it had funny moments, but I saw it more as romantic comedy.
I guess.  I wonder what that would be like in real life.
Well, it's based on a real life case.
Really, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I don't remember how the girl lost her memory, but there's enough to base it on.
