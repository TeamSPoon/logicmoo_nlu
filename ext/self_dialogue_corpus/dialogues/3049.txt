I was thinking we should have a superbowl party this year.
That sounds like fun! What teams are playing again?
This year it's the Patriots and the Falcons.
Hmm. I'm not a huge fan of either team, but I bet a lot of people here like the Falcons.
I'd be really surprised if they didn't.
Okay, then how should we decorate? Should we make it clear that it's a pro-Falcons party?
I don't think so. Let's just make some interesting snacks.
What did you have in mind.
When I watch football games, I always want pimento cheese.
That makes sense, for this part of the country.
Yeah. So I think we should definitely make that.
Okay. Do you have any other ideas for things we could do that's themed?
What do you mean?
Like, do you have any ideas for food that plays homage to one of the teams?
Oh, I see. Let me think.
I did have one idea.
What was it?
It's silly, but I was thinking we could carve a watermelon into the shape of a helmet, and then put fruit inside it.
That's too healthy to watch an NFL game!
I think we should do it anyway!
