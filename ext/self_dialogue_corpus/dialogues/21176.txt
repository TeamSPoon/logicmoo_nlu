Have you seen the trailer for the new Transformers movie?
The Last Knight? Yep I saw it, what do you think?
Man, I can't wait to see that movie.
Me too. I'm so pumped about it.
Did you see how Bumble Bee pull himself back together?
Oh my god, man. That blew my mind.
Mines too. It Bee was already my favorite before seeing that but now..
I totally agree. Bumble Bee is bad.
He is the best of all of the Transformers.
You're right and the car picked for him.
Chevy tough. Chevy plus Bumble Bee equal one bad camaro.
Definitely.
I hope they continue with this.
What do you mean?
I mean making Bee more than just a pretty car.
Give him substance. Make him someone the others will  follow.
You mean make him the new Hot Rod?
Why not? He already has the car.
I think we better wait and see the movie in its entirety before we start making any assumptions.
I so can't wait to see it.
