Do you like Lady Gaga? Her new music is definitely interesting.
Yeah she's super good, my favorite song on her new album is Joanne.
Really? I thought that one was okay. I kinda like her older stuff better.
Yeah, it feels like she is taking a new direction with her recent music. I still like it though.
She definitely had some crazy outfits way back when.
I know! The meat dress was a bit strange to me.
She has such great live performances though.
I would love to go to one of her concerts.
I hear she treats her fans with respect too.
That's great to see in a big artist like her.
