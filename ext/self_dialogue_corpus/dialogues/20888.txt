Have you seen Moana?
Yes, I love it! The Rock was great in it.
Yes! everyone is so good. The performances are top notch
The chicken was hysterical
I agree, I was surprised the characters so funny and charming
You know, I really loved the soundtrack too
The soundtrack was amazing. Has the Rock sung before?
Not that I can recall, but he has a really good voice!
He should have sung in Furious 7!
Ha! and in Baywatch!
I didn't see Baywatch, how was it?
It was okay, The Rock was the best thing in it.
Was it funny?
Yes, but not as funny as I expected.
I thoght he was really funny in Central Intelligence
That was with Kevin Heart right?
Yes he was in it too!
I should check that one out
Yes, he's done a bunch of big movies latley
They have good chemistry I should see it!
