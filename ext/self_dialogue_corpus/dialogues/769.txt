Who's your favorite team?
Definitely the Packers!
Oh, you're a cheesehead!
I don't really get into the cheesehead stuff, but I love the team.
My father likes them. He said they won the first super bowl.
Yes, they beat the Chiefs. It wasn't called super bowl, though.
Really? What was it called?
It was just a championship game.
When did it become super bowl?
The next game, played in 1968.
Who was in that game?
The Packers and Raiders, and the Packers won again.
So they won the first two championship games ever?
Yes.
Where did the super bowl name come from?
I read that Lamar Hunt from the Chiefs named it because his kid was playing with a super ball during the first game.
Too bad the Packers still beat them.
Packers will always rule!
Did you ever see go them play?
Yes, in 2015. I even got a ball signed by Clay Matthews!
