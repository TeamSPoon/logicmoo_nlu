Batman versus Superman, who do you think won in that film?
It really did not show. I do not even know why they called it that.
Well, Superman ends up dying, sort of.
But not exactly at the hands of Batman.
So, maybe it was more of a draw.
I think so. The real winner was Wonder Woman, to be honest.
She was the best part of that film.
Gal Gadot did an amazing job in that movie.
She did most her own stunts too.
I think it is because she was in the military, she really is a bit of a super hero in real life too.
