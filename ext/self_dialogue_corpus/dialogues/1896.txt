Are you a fan of the NFL?
Of course! I watch every Sunday in the fall.
Who is the team you follow?
I don't really have a particular team, I just like the game. How about you?
I'm a Patriots fan through and through.
Must be real difficult to like a winning team.
Well, they've been my favorite since before they started this new era. Drew Bledsoe was still the quarterback.
Ok, fair enough. So last year's Super Bowl must have been awesome for you.
Well, not at first. I was a little depressed when the score was 28-3.
I can imagine. But it was the Falcons' fans depressed at the end.
That's for sure. I really have never seen anything like it.
It seemed like a combination of the Patriots being really good and the Falcons just melting down.
That and an unwillingess to change the game plan.
What do you mean?
Well, the Falcons were always an offense with a lot of passing, but they didn't need to do that at the end of the game.
Oh that's right. Because they were almost in field goal range.
Right. So if they would've just run a few times, they probably would've won.
Not that you are complaining though.
Of course not. I got to celebrate.
And so did the Pats!
