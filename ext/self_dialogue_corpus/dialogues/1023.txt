Do you like football
No, I hate sports
Yeah, me too and I don't know much about it
Me either
I have been interested to see how politicized sports are gettig now
I know what you mean
Like the Kapernick thing
Yes, that was really disgusting
I know, you would think these millionaires could show some gratitude to the nation
I also hate the LGBT pushing
I agree, it is really not something sports fans like
I know a lot of people who just quit watching
And now they are pushing to take down name of Confederate Generals in Florida streets
Just play ball
Exactly
I think a lot of people are really turning against sports
I agree
I mean, we don't want a social agenda pushed
Especially not a gay one
That's true
