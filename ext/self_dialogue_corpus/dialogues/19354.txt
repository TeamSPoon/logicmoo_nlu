What's your favorite soundtrack?
I don't know. What made you ask me that?
Because I am listening to the soundtrack from Belly.
Oh yeah, that thing was hot. Which song are you listening to.
That joint Hard White with DMX and the LOX.
That's not Hard White.
I thought it was. My bad, that's not even DMX.
You listening to Tommy's Theme.
What you mean?
Tommy's Theme...that's the name of the song. It has the LOX and Made Men on their together.
Yeah, that's right. Remember big head dude Benzito?
Yeah, he's one of Made Men.
He was on Love and Hip Hop for a while.
I guess so, his rap career wasn't too tight.
But he spit fire in his verse on this track though.
Yeah he was hot but remember, that was over twenty years ago.
Yeah you right.
Play that joint with DMX and Method Man, The Grand Finale.
I listened to it already but I'll play it again for you.
Thanks. Put the phone near the speaker and turn it up a little bit.
