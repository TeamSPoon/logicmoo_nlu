Have you seen the movie Frozen from Disney?
yes, I have. It was such a fun movie, winter is coming.
You know, the main theme music, let it go?
yea, it stuck in my head for quite a while after watching the movie
such a good movie, I think it has good motivation for young girls, after all, it's trying to teach young girls' to be smarter and more realistic
Disney definitely did a good job on that
do you think it's possible they make a sequen on that?
I'm not sure, I think the ending was good enough, people always ask for more for movies they love
that's true
but I won't mind if there's a sequel
