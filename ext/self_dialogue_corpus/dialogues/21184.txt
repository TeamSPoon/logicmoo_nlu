Hey did you see the ghost in the shell ?
Well I didn't ...I have heard mixed reviews though
Well I don't think you should trust those online reviews
Oh..why not ?
Because they are biased ..trust me this is the best movie from Scarlet
but whole thing seemed a little gross ...
Well the way they have created the whole tokyo and robot thing ..so awesome !
oh I see ..there seems to be a lot of good action though
one of the best vfx I have ever seen
but hows the story ? I heard it's a little ..
shallow ?
yeah ...on the reviews
Well the reviewers were not really biased about the story ..it is a little shallow ...but its still so much fun
Oh I see
Specially if you enjoy it full IMAX ..you will love it
you sold me !
ya you should definitely check it out !
Ya maybe I will give it a try this weekend
Please let me know how it went !
I sure will ..thanks !
