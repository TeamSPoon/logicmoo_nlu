George Harrison seemed to be the quiet Beatle.
His lead guitar playing certainly wasn't quiet.
He has been listed as the 11th best guitar player by Rolling Stone Magazine
Didn't he study the sitar in India
He studied it for years with the master sitar player.  Again, as an innovator,  he introduced the sitar into music for the first time Rubber Soul in the song Norwegian Wood.
Did he write more songs for the Beatles?
George would often write a song and throw it in the pile to be recorded.  Often McCartney and Lennon were less than enthusiastic and it didn't make it on the album.
How about while My guitar Gently Weeps?
That was on the White Album, and Eric Clapton played the lead guitar.
I heard Something in the Way she moves is one of the top covered songs of all time.
