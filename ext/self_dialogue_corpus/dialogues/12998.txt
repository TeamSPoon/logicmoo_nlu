It's all about carrying a story though, and the prequels do it superbly.
That's an arguable point. Some may say the premise is boring and executed poorly
What?!?! Where do you even... I don't even kniow what that means. Excuted poorly? How?
Where did Darth Maul come from? Where was he born? How was he trained?
From that planet. With those demon witch women. Whatever they are.
But that's the story line from the TV animation series. We're not told this in the prequel.
No. This is true, but that doesn't mean it's executed poorly.
That's what it means exactly. The character development is a very impoirtant part of making a movie.
I guess I do agree with that point.
Yes. And Darth Maul just appears out of nowhere, and ttey start fighting.
