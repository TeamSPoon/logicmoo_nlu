Have you seen I walked with a Zombie?
I have. It's a great old movie.  It is definitely a thriller.
I like the use of the voodoo music.
I like that it was based on Jane Eyre.
I really like the way there was both a natural and supernatural explanation.
I would hate to see it remade today.
Yeah, they would add so much it would go on forever.
I like the development of the wife's character even though she never speaks.
Yes, you go from being sympatheitc to her to not sympahtetic at all.
It was a very suprising end.
