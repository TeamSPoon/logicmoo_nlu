I heard that the Kings are playing the Falcons tonight, want to go see the game?
No, last time I watched them play was just yesterday and they did just aweful
Do you not like basketball?
I do like basketball but would rather play then watch.
Even pro games?
I  mean they can be fun to watch but honestly I just have too much add for that
HAHA, you are a funny guy, but sports are about getting better and comeradery
What do you think of that team anyway?
Well I once was a huge fan but I have recently found that I would rather root for the Wildcats
Oh who do they play for?
They are my schools home team so I sort of feel like they must be my fave team.
Well that sounds cool, Who do they play
I think they play the hornets next week.
Who is there best player?
Prolly like player 7 steavonson
He is good I think he made like 200 pts last game
How is that even possible? That seems like a very large amount of points
Oh you would be supprised how high scoring these games can be.
So what was the final score?
It was a tie but I dont know the exact numbers.
