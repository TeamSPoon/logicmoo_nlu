Are you a football fan?
Yes, I grew up watching the Cowboys.  This got interesting when I was in Nashville.
So did you become a Titans fan?
I've never rooted for an AFC team in my life!  But my boys on the other hand...
You mean the didn't cut their teeth on Romo and Co?
I wish!  They'd watch the Titans game at noon, then go mow the lawn when the Cowboys kicked off at 4:00.
Disgusting!  How did you lure them back?
Football snacks.  I thought about forcing them to watch the Dallas games, but...
A plate of taquitos goes a long way.  It had to help that the Cowboys had a consistently good team.
Sure, but the media was all about the Tennessee Titans.  It was hard for Jerry Jones to compete.
I'd imagine, but they enjoy the game just the same.  You follow the NFL draft, keep up with who's on waivers?
I mostly just enjoy the season.  I used to know those things when Dallas was at Valley Ranch in the old days.
And now that you're in Michigan.  I bet everyone is a huge Detroit Lions fan.
We prefer Eli Manning--since Payton's retired.  Never cared for Archie professionally, though.
The ol' Cowboy-Saints rivalry, eh?  I know how it is.
Don't make me laugh, but yeah.  Archie Manning is a stand-up guy; love his sons.
And football, though it's become politicized these past few years with that Colin Kaepernick kneeling stuff.
Yeah, but maybe we should change the subject.
We could talk about the Red Skins and Supreme Court cases...
Washington?  Don't get me started!!!
