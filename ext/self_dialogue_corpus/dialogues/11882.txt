Who's your favorite Beatle?
Well, that's a tough question to answer.
Why is that?
Well, they were kind of unlikable in a lot of ways.
Really - how so?
Well, John Lennon was a notorious nutjob. He even beat his wife!
No way - really?
Yeah, and Paul is very difficult to work with.
That's a shame, I always liked Sir Paul.
Yeah - maybe he's changed. I guess my favorite would be Ringo!
