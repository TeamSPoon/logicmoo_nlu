did you see chasing amy
yeah, i liked clerks better though
both are kevin smith classics
the theme are kinda the same
well, the issue with the girl is very similar
the only thing is that clerks had a wider range of topics
yeah, they talked about working in retail
and in the end, they went back to it
you never know what you got until its gone, i guess
yeah, its always greener on the other side
it teaches life lessons
it really does
kevin smith is great at dialogues
well, he was great back then
his new movies dont really do it for me
yeah, well every director has their prime
every artist has their prime
he did very good for his time though
yeah, he had a few classics
mallrats and clerks were classics to me
