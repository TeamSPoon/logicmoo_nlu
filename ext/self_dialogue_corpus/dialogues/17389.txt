Sir Elton John has to be one of the best rock musicians ever.
Totally agree. He is so very talented.
His piano playing is so amazing. I wish I could play half as good.
I love Crocodile Rock.
What a great tune that one is.
It is so easy to dance to. Hoppin' and
Boppin' to the Crocodile Rock!
I want to get up and dance now.
He and Bernie Taupin wrote great music.
Daniel is a sad song.
Yes, didn't know that until I read the lyrics.
Yes, I prefer his happier songs.
Bernie Taupin did write great lyrics for him.
I don;t know if anyone but Elton could have sng and played his music so well though.
They are a music match made in heaven for sure.
Dont Go Breaking My Heart is up in my top 5 of his,
I love that duet.
Another one that is so catchy you cannot help but sing along.
It was used in some movies as well.
Well, people know good music.
