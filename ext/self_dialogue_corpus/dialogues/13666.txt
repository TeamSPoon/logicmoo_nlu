Hey, just curious which one of the Star Wars movies is your favorite?
Probably the Empire Strikes back.
Why? Jedi was a much better movie.
Jedi had such a bad warm fuzzy ending though, it was very cheesy.
Why does that make Jedi a bad movie though?
I don't know, there are tons of movies with obvious happy endings, it just seemed kind of lame to me.
Well what's so special about the Empire Strike back?
Luke gets his hand cut off, the Rebellion is in bad shape, it ended on a negative tone.
Why does that make it better?
Because its rare to see movies end on a negative, it was refreshing.
