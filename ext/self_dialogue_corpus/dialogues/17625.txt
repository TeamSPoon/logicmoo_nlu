Do you like Justin Timberlake?
His music?
Yes I should have been more specific.
Not really but I can appreciate it still.
Do you have a favorite song?
Probably can't stop the feeling.
Yeah that's one of his better ones.
Do you like any of his music?
A few songs like Sexyback.
Yeah that's also a good song.
Have you heard of his song Cry me a river?
Yeah but i'm not really a fan it's not my style.
Fair enough do you have any others you like?
Rock your body.
Why that one?
It's more upbeat and better for parties or get togethers.
It is a good party song.
That's what I used to play at small parties.
Think i'll listen to his music just to do it.
I might as well.
