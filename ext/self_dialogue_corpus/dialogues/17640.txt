Do you like alternative music from the 90's?
Absolutely by far my favorite genre.
What bands were you in to?
All the popular ones. Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Sound Garden.
I love Nirvana. Nevermind was the greatest album of all time.
That album was so great. Almost every song on it was a classic.
My favorite song was In Bloom! What's yours?
I know it's weird to say but Smells Like Teen Spirit by far.
What? That song is ok and I know it was a hit but come on.
I know everyone likes to trash it because it was so popular but I really like that song.
You never got to see them live did you?
No. I was to young and Kurt Cobain died so I never got the chance.
Yeah, I have watched some of their live performances on Youtube and they were awesome.
The Reading Festival performance was unbelievable.
Well at least Dave Grohl went on to form Foo FIghters.
Yeah I really like a lot of their music too.
I am thinking of going to the next Foo Fighter show when it comes to town.
Go for sure. I have seen them three times and each show was better than the last.
Great, I am really excited. I need to buy tickets. Should I buy the higher priced ones?
Get the best tickets you can. The show will be crowded and you want to be able to hear everything.
