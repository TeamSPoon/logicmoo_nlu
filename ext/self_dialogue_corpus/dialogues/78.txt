Have you seen the Marvel movie Spawn?
Yes but I didn't like it that much.
That's true, it was pretty campy. I love Michael Jai white though.
Yes he is a great actor and his martial arts skills are superb.
John Leguizamo was great in it also. He added much needed comic relief.
Yes he did. I couldn't get into the movie but I did like his antics.
Marvel sure has come a long way since then.
That's true. Back then they were pretty boring.
Even the first Spiderman movies left a lot to be desired.
I like the Amazing Spiderman series better. Spiderman Homecoming looks like it's going to be great.
