Have you seen any good thrillers recently?
I saw The first Purge movie
Isnt that the movie where they can do any crime for one day?
Yeah, so lots of people go out and commit crimes
Oh man, that's scary. I'd just hide in my house
Some people in the movie try that
And how does it go for them?
It works well, until their kids let in someone running for their life
Oh that's cool. I want to see it now!
Yeah, I'm going to watch the second one now!
