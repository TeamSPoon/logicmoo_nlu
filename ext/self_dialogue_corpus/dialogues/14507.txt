Hi! Are you a wizards fan?
Yes I am.
Do you watch the games on tv or listen on the radio?
I watch the Wizards on the tv.
Did you see that long time color guy Phil Cheiner has been sacked ?
Yes!
He was on the tv team for 33 years!
I know.
I cannot fathom why they did that.
When I first heard the news I thought he was just retiring.
So did I!
He is not ready to retire.
No he is not. Most of tho other DC tv stations have picked him up for "spot" analisis.
Hr still has a great voice!
Not only that but his comments are spot on.
Yes! He is still very sharp!
I guess they want to go younger.
I suppose..it's a shame.
I think The Wizards think most fans do not remember that he was one of the best shooters in the league.
That and I think that most fans do not remember that he brought Us our Last Championship ring!
