I think David Johnson is the best running back in the NFL
For the Cardinals?
Yes. He was at least the best of 2016
He was impressive to watch
Who do you think is the best?
Adrian Peterson hands down
He plays for the Vikings?
Yep. anyone else you liked?
Not running back wise
Who was your favorite kicker?
I like Mason Crosby
Of the Packers?
Yep. Who do you like?
Graham Gano of the Panthers
Did he tackle anyone this year?
I don't think so
I always love it when kickers have to tackle
They're scrappy little guys.
Mason Crosby made a nice tackle last season
I saw that!
