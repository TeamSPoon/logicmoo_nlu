Do you think the Empire in the Star Wars movies ever learns anything?
Not sure what you mean by that.    Please explain.
Well, they have built two Death Stars, and a third in The Force Awakens.
That was a Star Killer, not a Death Star.
Well, aren't the two weapons functionally similar?
Yes, I guess so, with the latter just being bigger.
So they build them, but there is always some minor flaw that can be found in the plans.
Exactly!    You would think they would have some better encryption.
Maybe not even that complicated.     Just add a virus into any set of digital plans.
That would be evil.      Automatically disable any droid's operating system!
