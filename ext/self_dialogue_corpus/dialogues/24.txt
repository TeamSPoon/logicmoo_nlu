The hulk is a pretty cool superhero
Yea, he is interesting.
I liked that he is a monster yet still good.
And he has cool one liners.
Yea, "Hulk Smash".
Bruce Banner is an interesting character too.
Yea, unlike other alter egos, he is a good one.
I like the science behind his transformation
He's like superman, that he can take so many bullets.
But he is green, which makes him cooler.
