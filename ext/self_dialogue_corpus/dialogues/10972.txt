Can anyone stop the Pens?
I doubt it
Maybe if Crosby gets hurt?
They still might find a way to win
And they'd have to kill Sid to keep him from playing
or maybe a bad concussion will do it
You know the other teams will try to hurt him
It might be their only chance
but Fleury is on fire too
it's about time
He has been lame in the past few years in the playoffs
but he's making up for it this year
but he can go South at any point
true, by Sid won't
agreed, Malkin sometimes disappears though
but I think they'll repeat
it looks that way after shutting down Ovi
Caps were probably the next best team
at least in the East
they'd top anyone in the West
