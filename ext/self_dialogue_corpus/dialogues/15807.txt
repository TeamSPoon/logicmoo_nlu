Which one of the boy bands was your favorite from the 90's? We both grew up then.
I would say definitely the Backstreet Boys. I had a crush on them big time.
Oh my goodness me too. They formed in 1993.
That feels like ages ago!
I know it makes me feel old.
I think I liked Howie the best, what about you?
I always had a crush on Nick Carter. He was my fave.
"Quit Playing Games with My Heart" was my most favorite song by them.
That was such a beautiful song. I remember that.
Remember their album that came out in 1999? It was Millenium.
I remember! I took that CD with me to camp that year where my stepdad worked.
I loved the song "Larger Than Life" on their.
I wasn't a fan of the "Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely" on that album.
Me either really. It felt kind of sad.
I agree.
Did you know recently they've been doing shows in Las Vegas?
I've seen that on social media. Wish I could go.
Me too. What an exeperience.
I always dreamed of meeting them one day.
We need to make that happen soon.
