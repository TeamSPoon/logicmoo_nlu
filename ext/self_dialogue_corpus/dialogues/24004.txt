Do you have a favorite movie?
Mine has to be The Fountain.
Oh, what's that? I've never heard of it.
It's a movie by Darren Aronofsky. I can't really explain what genre it is.
Is it realistic, or is it more of a fantasy movie?
It's more fantasy, but in a way that is about real life. Like, it talks about a real life situation, which is that this woman is dying of cancer.
But it uses the fantasy to get at the difficult parts of that situation?
Yeah. It's basically about how hard it is to say goodbye. I love it, but it makes me cry every time.
That's fair, I usually don't like sad movies very much. My favorite movie is Jupiter Ascending.
Wasn't that the one directed by the Watchowski sisters?
Yeah, it is. I find everything that they do so much fun.
They put a lot of effort into design, too. The Matrix looked really cool and I've heard that Jupiter Ascending does too.
The costumes alone are so stunning! The plot goes a little off the rails, though.
That's okay, I don't mind that. Who's in it?
Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are the main characters.
Anyone else I might know?
Eddie Redmayne is in it too. His performance is really dramatic and hilarious.
Sounds great. I really like Eddie Redmayne, because he's handsome and a good actor.
Hahaha, well, he's in a lot of this movie, so you might like it.
Sounds great! Thanks for telling me about it!
