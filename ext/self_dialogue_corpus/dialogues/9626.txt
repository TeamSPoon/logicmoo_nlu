What are some of your favorite vintage rap songs?
U Can't Touch This by M C Hammer.
I love that song and he wore some crazy pants in his video.
I also really like Run DMC's Walk This Way.
The original was good, but I like when they remade it with Steve Tyler from Aerosmith.
That was a really good version, too, although I liked the original better.
What About the Humpty Dance?
Who was it by?
Digital Underground.
I don't recall that one.
