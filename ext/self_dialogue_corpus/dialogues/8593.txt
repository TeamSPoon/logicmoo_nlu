There sure were a lot of great bands in the seventies.
There sure were. That was my favorite decade of music.
Mine too. Queen, Yes, David Bowie were all hitting the scene and people are still listening to them today.
That is why they are the classics. Neil Young was one of my favorites.
He is great. There are so many great bands from that era.
Yes, how about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin. I never saw Led Zeppelin, but I did see the Allman Brothers.
Wow. I never saw them. I did see David Bowie and Elton John. Now they both could put on quite a show.
Their music is amazing.
They truly are a couple of the greatest songwriters of our generation.
Yes, but it is a shame that Bowie passed away so young. He had so much talent.
