Have you been watching the playoffs?
Which playoffs?
Professional basketball playoffs.
No, not so far. Have you?
Yeah, my team is in the semi finals.
What is your team?
The Miami Heat.
Why do you like the Heat?
Mostly because I grew up in Miami.
That makes sense.
Do you play any ball?
No, not really.
That's too bad.
Why is that too bad?
Me and some guys play a game on Wednesdays.
Oh, that could be fun.
You want to try it?
Sure, why not.
Okay, tomorrow at the court right over there around noon.
Sounds like fun.
