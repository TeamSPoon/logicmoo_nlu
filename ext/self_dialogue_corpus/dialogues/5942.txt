I have always been a big fan of Disney movies, either animated or live action. How about you?
Absolutely. To be honest, I don’t know many people who aren’t fans.
Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
Probably The Lion King. I loved that movie growing up.
What about that movie really stood out to you?
Not only was it just a great family movie, it had an amazing voice cast, and just a great story.
I absolutely agree. I also felt it had some darker elements for a Disney movie, which makes it a bit more appealing to adults.
That is true, also. The story had some adult elements, which I think was a risk that paid off.
And this goes without saying, but, the sequels did not live up to the original?
Unfortunately, no, I just didn’t think the spark was there.
