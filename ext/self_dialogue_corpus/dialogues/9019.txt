You remember when Green Day was good?
That was a long time ago.  American Idiot was pretty much their peek.
Back in the 90's, they had some good hits.  Dookie was a solid album.
The last ten years or so has been pretty bad though.
I think their time has passed.  No one cares about alternative anymore.
Yeah, top 40 kind of got replaced by all the electronic junk.
I kind of wish they would have progressed past three chords.
Well, it's what made them money hence why they stuck with it.
It's hard to think those guys are in their late 40's now and so old.
Hey, you'll be old too someday!
