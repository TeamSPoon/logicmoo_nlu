Hey, so you like rap, right?
Not really. What made you think I liked rap?
There's that one song you were playing. It was by the guy that does Filthy Frank, right?
I mean, I guess so. I like that, yeah, but most rap out there is just terrible.
What do you mean?
It's like... All rappers and hip hop artists seem to do is use cheap, simple beats and only talk about drugs or alcohol or something.
Yeah but there are artists out there that don't do that. Swimming Pools is basically criticizing that kind of culture.
Sure, yeah, that's true. But that song isn't the majority of rap and hip hop. Think about it. Who have been the biggest rappers recently?
Uh... Lil Wayne. 50 cent, but he's not as big now. Eminem puts meaning into his stuff.
Yeah, but then you have Beyonce and Rihanna and others like Wayne and cent that once in a while do something good, but then they mostly just play whatever people think they're supposed to be hearing.
