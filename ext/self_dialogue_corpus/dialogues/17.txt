What do you think of all the superhero movies out now?
I believe they are somewhat saturating the market, but as long as people go, they will stil make them.
Ddi you see Wonder Woman yet? I thought it was awesome.
I saw it a few weeks ago and thought it was one of the best I can remember seeing.
Me too. There's just only so much I can see of The Avengers and Spiderman.
Of course, it didn't hurt that she was gorgeous to look at too.
I agree there 100%. What about the new Spiderman?
Looks good to me. I like the newer guy and that they went away from the love story from the earlier movies.
It does look good to me too. I'm excited to see it.
The new actor appears well suited to the role and should help it attract a sizeable audience.
