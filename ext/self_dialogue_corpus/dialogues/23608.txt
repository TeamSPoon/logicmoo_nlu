Didn't You finally watch Rocky 4 recently?
I did indeed!
It's about time, wasn't Drago the perfect bad guy?
He was, I've even heard people joke about that film singlehandedly ending the cold war.
Ha I've been one known to make those jokes, his lines were so quotable as well.
"If he dies he dies"
That's one of the best ones, I admit to crying the first time when Creed dies.
Yeah that scene was a bit rough, right up there with Mickey's death.
I would rare Mickey's just slightly higher, I was a mess man.
I can picture you in a corner a blubbering mess.
Not too far off, not ashamed to admit it.
Adrian's was the worst.
Oh I agree even though you didn't see it happen, my jaw dropped during the cemetery scene in Rocky Balboa.
I had read minor spoilers, bad habit and knew it was coming, but still hit hard.
I wasn't expecting it, may have made it worse.
Where would ypu rank Rocky 4? Curious now that I've seen it.
Among Rocky movies? Below the first two and just barely below Rocky Balboa, much higher than the other sequels though.
Similar to mine, but would flip Balboa and part 4.
Anyway need to go, but nice talking to you.
Yeah you too take care.
