Do you know what year the movie "Pinocchio" came out?
If i'm not mistaken, I believe it came out in 1940. That's a very old movie but it's so influential.
Ya, what was it about? Can you give me a quick summary?
Sure. It's about a puppet who is turned into a real life person but first must prove himself worthy to become a real boy.
Do you know what his father or creators name was? I think i'm starting to remember it.
His father's name was Geppetto. He wanted a boy so bad that he wood carved one.
Oh ok. I'm know about it now. There was a Blue Fairy who appointed Jiminy Cricket to be his "conscience".
Yep. that's right and every time Pinocchio lied, his nose would grow. It was hilarious.
I glad that Pinocchio finally became a boy at the end.
That just goes to show you that being honest pays off.
