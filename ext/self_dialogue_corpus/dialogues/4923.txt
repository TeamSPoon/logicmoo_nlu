Have you ever been to a baseball game?
Yeah, I watched the Cubs a lot when I was a kid.
Were you excited that they won the World Series?
I was so happy!
Me too. It was about time they won.
After being cursed for so many years, it was really nice to see them win that Series.
Do you think they'll ever do it again?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
They really did impress me.
Me too. I was proud to be a fan of them.
How long have you been going to baseball games?
Since I was about ten. What about you?
I went to my first Marlin's game when I was six.
That must've been fun.
Yeah, I went with my dad. He loves baseball.
Mine too. He's the one that got me into the Cubs.
Do you like any other teams?
No, but I really hate the Yankees.
I hate them too. I always root against them.
You have to root against the Yankees.
