Have you ever listened to The Bouncing Souls
No what kind of music do they play
Its a mix of ska and punk and rock
OK sounds like something I would be interested in.
Yeah its not that bad of a band
How many albums do they have?
Around 10
Do they tour alot
They do it all year around
Where are they from?
New Jersey I believe.
OH ok what should i look for if I download them
I would start with Lean on Sheena.
Is that a cover?
I think so.
I think a band called Avoid One Thing has the same title.
Maybe theyre different
That title is a bit specific
You are probably right.
Ill check them out tomorrow.
