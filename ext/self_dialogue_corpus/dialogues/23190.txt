I'm so tired of them making sequels and remakes of every movie.
Ugh. Me too. Especially superhero movies.
It feels like the world is being run by teenage boys.
For sure. And even when they make "girl" movies they're remakes or superhero movies.
Like Wonderwoman and ghostbusters?
Exactly.
I really loved Carol.
Right, that was so good.
Book adaptations I dont mind as much
Me either. at least it's only once removed from an original source.
Moonlight was excellent as well.
I really enjoyed that. All the actors were great.
Alicia Keys was especially good.
Did you see La LA Land?
No. I hear it's good. I just don't have a desire.
Me either. It looks pretty white.
Exactly. I don't have patience for that.
What did you think of hidden figures?
Oh it was wonderful. Amazing acting.
Octavia Spencer is great in it.
