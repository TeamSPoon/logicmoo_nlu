My alarm was set to wake me up with Led Zeppelin today. I'm feeling pretty craaaaaazy now.
I can tell. What-- Um-- What is up with those pants?
They're my ROCK PANTS BAY BAY!! I use them to climb the STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN!
Okay, but they are mostly skin I think, There's not much, what is that? Naugahyde? There's not much Naugahyde to them. Are you sure you aren't Lil Kim?
Hmmm. I do love a good Magic Stick. I might rethink my alarm music moving forward.
Yes, just stay away from the plastic surgeons. And the plastic pants, too. Just Yeah.
Whatever, are you ready for Ryan's party this weekend? I heard your manlover Sean is DJing.
Really? Oh god he has the best neo soul collection. I swoon.
Neo gag me. Wait, is what The Weeknd is? Also, who stole his fourth "e"?
No, Weeknd is more like, get your groove on music.
Get your groove on? How old are you? 107?
I'm not the one listening to Led Zeppelin to start my day. Did you have any Fiber One with that? Mmmmm yum.
I'm just saying. All Weeknd does is sing about getting high. And excessive drug use does not a good lover make.
True, true. What are you wearing to Ryan's? It has to be danceable if Sean is spinning. You'll be hating life if you wear those *shudder* Naugahyde pants. Can you even sit down in those? Won't they break?
Sit? I can do some sick hair metal karate style dance moves. High kicks! Heh! See?
Oh I saw. More than I should have seen. Maybe get a wax before the party okay? Or just wear different pants.
You're so boring. Even Led Zeppelin couldn't wake me up from you.
Watch out before you find yourself on that Stairway to Heaven.
Heh. So wait. That song is about dying?
No, I think it's about shopping. You know how the top six floors at the Galleria are all Nordstrom? It's like, the express escalators that go there. Pretty sure that's what he means.
