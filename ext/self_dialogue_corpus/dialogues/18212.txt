What kind of music have you been listening to lately?
I've been listening to a lot of electronic music.
What's the band you've heard the most?
I like Orbital quite a bit.
I haven't heard of them, are they any good?
Of course, I wouldn't listen to them if they weren't any good.
Oh, I see. What do they sound like?
They have a lot of good music that has melodies that last throughout a song and go through different phases.
That's nice, I like melodic electronic music.
Yeah, a lot of their stuff is very tasteful and soothing.
Do they have any aggressive songs?
They do, but I don't like those as much. Those are more for live performances I think.
What are some of their better songs?
The Girl With the Sun in Her Hair is one of their best.
That's an interesting title, can I find that one online?
I'm sure you could, they've done several different version of that song and it's very popular.
I'll have to look that one up.
You should actually look up the whole album that that song is one, it's all good stuff.
Do they have newer music out?
Yeah they still put out albums, mostly good stuff from what I've heard.
