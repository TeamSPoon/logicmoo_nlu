What's your favorite Beatles album?
I only know individual songs, not albums.
Well, what song do you like?
I think my favorite is "She Loves You."
That was their second album, so really early.
What did they do later?
Well, their Abbey Road album is quite famous.
Oh yeah, I've seen the cover of them all crossing the street!
It's iconic! I think a lot of those songs were written individually and not together.
It's sad that they weren't as close as in the early days.
