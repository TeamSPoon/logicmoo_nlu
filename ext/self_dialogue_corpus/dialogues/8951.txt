Lynard Skynard was from Alabama.
Yes. They used to record there too.
How do your know?
I watched a documentary about the studio where The Swampers used to record.
Who are they?
They were a backup band and they used to backup Lynard Skynard.
They are mentioned in one of Skynard's songs.
Sweet Home Alabama.
I remember that song. It was great.
The Swampers played backup for that song too.
