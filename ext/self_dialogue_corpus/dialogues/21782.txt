Whats your favorite Tom Cruise movie?
For me, The Last Samurai for sure!
I've never seen it
Dude, you need to get on that right away!
Whats so good about it?
Just the story about how a different culture can be viewed from the outside world, the acting was spot on, the fight scenes...
I'll check it out tonight!
I also liked Collateral
Yea, that was a good movie.
Him and Jamie Fox were such a good team
The plot was very engaging
I liked how even though Jamie fox's character was kidnapped he was still helping an assassin.
Have you seen Edge Of Tomorrow?
Yes, it was a bit trippy but really fun
I hear they are making a sequel
Really? Thats great to hear
Tom Cruise has a lot of good movies
I liked all of the mission impossible movies!!
Maybe they will make a Jerry Mcguire sequel sometime
That would be exciting
