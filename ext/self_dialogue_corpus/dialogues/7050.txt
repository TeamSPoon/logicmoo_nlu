I finally watched Up like you told me and I cried!
I think everybody has cried at that movie?
That whole thing with Carl and Ellie was so sad.
They made you love them and then they killed her!
I wanted them to just be happy forever!
But wasn't Russell just the cutest?
Yes! I want to go on an adventure with him and Carl.
But it'd have to be in that house right?
Well of course. You can't go anywhere unless you travel in that house.
And you have to adopt Dug!
