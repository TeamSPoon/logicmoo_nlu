I could watch Tangled every day of my life!
It is such an underrated movie!
I am Rapunzel! I just need the magical hair now.
Could you imagine having magical hair!
And having Flynn Rider being your boyfriend?
His smolder is the greatest.
And having little Pascal as a buddy.
I love the lantern scene when they are in the boat.
My favorite is when she is reunited with her family.
Yes, such a happy moment.
