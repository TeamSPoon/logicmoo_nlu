Salina Gomez is a pretty great singer do you know who she is?
I think so. Didn't she date Justin Beiber?
Yes she did!
Right. I know who she is now.
She sings one song called "Bad Liar".
I think I know that one.
It's one of her newer songs.
I think I heard it on the radio recently.
I think I like Taylor Swift better actually.
I'm a fan of both but she's pretty good.
Which of Taylor Swift's songs do you like the best?
I like her song "22" or something like that.
I know that one! It's a pretty song.
She always has upbeat fun music.
I agree. I could listen to her music all day.
How do you feel about Adele?
I love her song "Hello".
I totally agree! That one is my ultimate fave.
Did you see the music video? It's great.
I don't think I have. I'll have to check it out.
