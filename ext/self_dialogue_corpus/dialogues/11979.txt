Luke should have had a bigger role in The Force Awakens.
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense that he'd just stay out there on an island for decades.
Yeah. It's incredibly irresponsible, if you think about it.
Certainly.  Luke from Return of the Jedi wouldn't have just ran away, he would have gone there and grabbed Kylo by the ear and brought him back home.
It's not like he could have been scared of Snoke. Snoke is nothing compared to Palpatine, and Luke confronted him without hesitating.
They were probably trying to do the Yoda thing.
But Yoda had an excuse, he was really old, and on his last legs. He also lost when he fought Palpatine. And originally, he wasn't even supposed to be a fighter.
Luke doesn't have those excuses, does he? Maybe Snoke did beat him.
If that's the case, then they have to show it.  It's also implausibly. Luke was one of the best.
He wasn't that good. He was only half trained.
