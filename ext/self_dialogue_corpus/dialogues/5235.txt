Hey, are you a fan of Disney movies?
No, not really. But I do like musicals.
Well, if you like musicals you'll definitely like Disney movies.
Oh really? What Disney movies do you think I'd like then?
The movies made during the "Disney Renaissance" would pique your interest I think.
Were those the ones made in the early-to-mid '90s?
Yes, they are. Being that you're a fan of musicals, I would suggest checking out "The Lion King". Tim Rice wrote the lyrics for the songs.
Oh I am very familiar with Tim Rice. Great lyricist.
After you watch that, you may want to check out "Beauty and The Beast". It's another film that plays very much like a classic musical, with characters voiced by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.
Oh that sounds neat. I know of Jerry Orbach from his long career as an off-Broadway actor.
