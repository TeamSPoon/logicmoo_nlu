Are you one of those who is mad that the star of Mad Max wasn't Max?
Yes and no.
Uh-oh, are you about to get sexist?
No. She did a great job in her role.
So what's everyone's issue?
It's called Mad Max, and it's not about Mad Max. It's about Furiosa.
Sort of. It's Mad Max: Fury Road.
That's what I said.
No, it's about the road.
Ooooh, that actually makes sense
