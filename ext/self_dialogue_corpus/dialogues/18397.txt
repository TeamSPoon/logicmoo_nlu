Have you heard of the 90's R and B group Xscape?
Yes! Why?
Well they are supposed to be planning a reunion tour.
Oh seriously! I remember some of their songs.
Yes, they were great.
What ever happened?
The members got into many disagreements.
Disagreements about what?
I think that it may have beenmany things, four girls in a group, egos can get the best of you.
Yes that's true, were they young?
Yes,  like 15 or 16 years old. Singing, touring and selling millions of records got the better of them.
That had to be tough, so they just broke up and went on to do different things individually.
They recently runited for an awards show and sounded great.
Wow, I have to catch that.
It should rerun in the next few days.
That's great I will make sure I watch.
They are also coming out with a docuseries on Bravo.
That is wonderful. Truly it is.
I'm glad that they could put their differences aside for greatness.
I am going to put on some of their old music and sing along.
