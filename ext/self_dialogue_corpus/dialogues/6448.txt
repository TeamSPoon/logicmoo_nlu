I can't wait until the newest Little Mermaid comes out.
It looks fantastic from what I've read online.
Who is directing it?
According to imdb, Chris Bouchard and Blake Harris.
Who's staring in it?
The main stars are Gina Gershon, Shirley MacLane and William Moseley.
Wow, quite the cast!
I know right!
I can't wait to see it.
I suggest watching the original in the meantime!
