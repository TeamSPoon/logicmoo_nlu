What did you think about what Tinashe said last week?
What did she say? And who's Tinashe again?
"2 On"... remember that song and Drake did a remix?
Ah, yes, her! What did she say?
She was like, she didn't get accepted by the Black community because she doesn't appear to be fully black.
Wow! I didn't even remember her music.
Yep, I don't think anything of hers is memorable to be honest.
It's apparent visually, that she's black. Is she bugging?
I think she's really not thinking about her quality of music.
Exactly! Especially with this competition.
Yes, Rihanna has bops, Ariana has hits...
... and Tinashe has one-hit wonders.
That's not nice! I think she's pretty talented actually.
Oh yeah? How so?
I know she's a trained dancer, but her voice is really nice actually.
Yeah, I can see what you mean.
So sad she had to release such weak songs.
Yeah, I would've never known that it was her song and not OVO's
Yup, maybe this will make her more hungry to drop more quality hits.
Yup, I hope so.
