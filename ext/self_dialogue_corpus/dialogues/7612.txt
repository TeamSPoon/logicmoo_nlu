What did you think about the last Harry Potter movie?
I think it was good but there was a few weird parts.
What do you mean?
I didn't like Voldemort's character very much, the actor wasn't what I pictured for Voldemort.
I know what you mean, he wasn't my favorite actor. What did you think about Daniel Radcliffe?
I think it's so great that you see him growing up throughout the series.
Yeah, it's crazy watching all the kids get older as the movies go on.
Now I can't picture any of those actors in anything else!
True, I always see Emma Watson as Hermoine in all of her movies.
Definitely one of my favorite series ever.
