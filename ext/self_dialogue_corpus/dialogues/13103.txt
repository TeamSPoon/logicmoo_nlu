Hey, can I ask you a question? About Star Wars?
Sure, what's up?
Do you think all the people on Alderaan died? I mean, ALL of them?
What do you mean? The planet blew up, right?
Well yeah, but... I mean, there had to be some people off world when the planet blew up, right? I mean, everyone couldn't have been home at the time.
I mean, I guess so. So what's your point?
I wonder what happened to those people. What was it like when they found out the death star had destroyed the planet?
Hmm, that's a good point. I mean, it's not like having a flight cancelled.
That's one horrible day at the space station. "Sir, your flight is cancelled, because, um, I don't know how to say this, but Alderaan is gone."
I feel a strange disturbance in the force...
