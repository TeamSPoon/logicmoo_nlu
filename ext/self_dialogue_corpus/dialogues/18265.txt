Do you listen to Stevie Wonder?
Yeah, his music is great.
It's amazing he's blind and can make this music.
He's a true talent.
What's your favorite song?
I like Isn't She Lovely.
That song is always in my head.
Usually, the good songs can do that.
That song came out in 1976.
It has lasted the sands of time.
Music isn't that meaningful anymore.
It's very superficial nowadays.
Stevie is the opposite of superficial.
He worked with McCartney in a song.
Ebony and Ivory is one of my favorite songs.
It's a great song about unity and harmony.
That's what makes great music.
We should just appreciate the music.
Yeah, we don't have to look but just listen.
That's what Stevie Wonder did the best.
