The last thriller that I saw was Gone Girl.
OH that was a great movie.
I agree but the ending left me wanting to know more.
Yes I would say I agree.
I enjoyed the characters though.
It was good how they took the perspective of both people.
I though that too it kept you in suspense.
That's what a good thriller will do.
I felt this movie was a lot like the book.
I will have to read it to see that too.
