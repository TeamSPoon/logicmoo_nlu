Have you heard the Remy Ma's diss track, ShETHER, aginst Nicki Minaj.
Yes I've heard, it's all over social media!
Nicki Minaj needs to respond quick, Remy Ma based her so bad on the song.
I don't think Remy Ma's diss track was good.
Are you serious, Remy Ma had a nice beat and some really awesome verses.
Not so much, all of her verses were false claims against Nicki Minaj.
Some of them are false, but most of them are actually true!
You don't think she is doing this for attention?
Of course not, I think they are truly mad at each other.
I believe this is all a publicity stunt
