When did the 49ers win their first Super Bowl?
Back in 1982.
Wow, that long ago.
Yeah, it's been awhile.
Do you remember who they played?
The Cincinnati Bengals.
Oh I didn't realize the Bengals made it to a Super Bowl.
Yes, they've been twice.
Was Joe Montana playing back then?
Yes, a very young Joe Montana
Rookie year?
No, I think he was in his third year.
Any big players on the Bengals.
Anthony Munoz was the most famous. Not many after him.
Oh he played offensive line right?
Yes, that's him.
Yeah, I remember him. Played for a number of years.
Yes, almost all for the Bengals and then a small stint with Tampa Bay.
Tampa Bay...crazy.
Yeah, they weren't very good back then.
