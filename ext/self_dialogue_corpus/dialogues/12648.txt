When you watch the original trilogy now, what do you think of the antiquated special effects?
I would call them "classic" rather than "antiquated."
Why sugar-coat it? They're obsolete now, with CGI doing all the effects that anyone could imagine.
But look at the CGI in the second trilogy. It's soulless.
Some people would say it's beautiful, perfect.
That's part of why I like classic animation like matte paintings and stop-motion better. It's not perfect.
I don't get you. Isn't its perfection a distraction from the story?
No, it reminds me, even on a subliminal level, that human beings sweated blood and worked a zillion hours to make it happen.
I guess I see your point. More hands-on makes it meaningful to you.
Exactly. I admire the special effects teams who worked on the original trilogy, because of the hard hands-on work they did to make those films effective.
