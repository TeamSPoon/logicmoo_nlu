Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
I have but I didn't care for it much.
Oh you didn't like it? I thought it was ok.
Right for what it is. But they were introducing a powerful woman superhero so they should have done better.
I like the character that plays her though, Gal Gadot. Good actress.
Yes I did like her, and she does look a little like Linda Carter.
Did you ever watch the Wonder Woman series a long time ago.
No that was before my time. And I've never seen any reruns.
Oh that's too bad, you should find some on YouTube.
Maybe I will. I loved the battle scene at the end of the movie though, love conquers all.
