I saw the Disney Cinderella movie last night.
Cool.  When was that made?
It was released in 1950.
I heard Disney was in trouble then.
$4m in debt.  The movie reversed its fortunes.
Cool.  What was the great song in that movie?
"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"
Right.  Great fun.
I loved Jaq and Gus.
The mice!  They were great!
