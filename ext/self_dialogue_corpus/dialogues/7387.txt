BFG is such a weird name for a Disney movie, don't you think?
Yeah, the Big Friendly Giant is a little weird, too, but I like him.
He seems scary at first, but when you see him with the other giants, you realize that he's really kind of weak and scared.
I'm glad he figured out how to defeat those other giants; they were bullies.
I think it's hard to figure out who the real hero is in the movie: Sophie or BFG.
I think they are both heroes because Sophie comes up with the plan, but BFG has to be brave enough to do it.
I love the Queen character; at first she's kind of serious, but then she brings Sophie and BFG into the castle for breakfast.
The poor servants that had to serve BFG; I felt sorry for them.
What about the part of the breakfast when everyone drank the frobscottle?
Oh, that was the funniest and most disgusting part of the movie!  I laughed until I cried.
