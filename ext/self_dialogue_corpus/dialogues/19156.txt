Do you like Pete Townsend?
He's great,love him.
I think he's an underrated guitar player.
You could be right.
Don't hear his name,a lot when they talk great guitarist.
The beginning of pinball wizard is instantly recognizable.
The whole rock opera Tommy was ahead of its time.
See me feel me is from that also.
Hes written just about every Who song.
Yes he has.
I believe he's touring with billy idol doing quadraphinia classic.
I heard he was out doing that.
They still rock live.
No roger daltry with this tour.
Not from what I've read.
Well,that's interesting.
I think they just finished up a small who tour.
I know they were out there.
I hope they come around me again.
Yea,I'd like to see them again
