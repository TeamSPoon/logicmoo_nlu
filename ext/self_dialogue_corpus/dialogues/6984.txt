Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?
If I had to answer I would say none of them.
What?!?!?! How can you like NO Disney movies?
They all have the same ending and its boringly predictable.
That's what people love about them, they have happy endings!
It is precisely what I don't like about them.
Well what would you do then?
I would have the Beast kill Belle and then you can have a sequel.
That's....horrible.
No, that's marketing.
