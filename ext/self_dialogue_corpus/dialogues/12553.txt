What's your favorite Star Wars spacecraft?
Definitely the X-Wing.
I prefer the Imperial Star Destroyers from the original movies.
The X-Wing is like a fighter jet in space, though.
Imperial Star Destroyers are like battleships. That's really cool.
They're more like aircraft carriers. They carry TIE Fighters.
That's true. But X-Wings kill TIE fighters so effortlessly one wonders why they bothered.
Imperial Star Destroyers are at least effective in the movies.
Their triangular shape looks cool, too.
X-Wings look sleek and pointed, like a fighter.
