Have you ever seen the Professional?
Yes I did, with Natalie Portman.
Yeah, people forget about that movie.  It was pretty good.
Yeah, it was cool.  That French guy was an assassin but still had a heart of gold.
Kind of an odd thing to say but true.  They had a good almost parent child relationship.
Yeah, and in the end he sacrifices his life for her.
She grew up to be a really good actress.
She did.  And basically I've had a crush on her my whole life.
You too?  I thought that was only me.
One of the benefits of being the same age as her.
