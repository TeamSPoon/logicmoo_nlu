So, what is your favorite genre.
I like a lot of different kinds, pop, rap, country all other kinds too.
Country, who is your favorite country singer?
Has to be, the band Perry.
What does that band play?
If I die young, and a bunch of others.
I have heard that one! It is really sad but good.
They sing one called, "Better Dig two",you should listen to it if you like their other song.
I will have to check it out. I like Lady Antebellum a lot.
They sing the American Honey song?
Yep, that is them.
That is a beautiful song. So full of meaning.
Do you like any of their other hits?
I think one called , "Need you Now".
That is a bit older, but also a really neat song. They have a more upbeat one called Downtown. Super catchy.
I like county artists that can be both catchy and country, like tru country.
I think they do a great job of that. "Love don't Live Here", if pretty much a perfect mix of both.
I heard that one too. It is sad, but has a good beat.
All their stuff is really worth looking into, always written well.
I will have to check into them more.
