Did you think the later Terminators were better than the older ones?
I  mean, story wise, maybe.
What did you think of the second one?
Judgement Day?
Yes, what did you think of it?
The plot played better, not as much action.
Really? The Terminator exploding building not enough?
It had action, just more back story.
I liked the story of Connor's mom.
How she came to be the mother of the chosen one.
