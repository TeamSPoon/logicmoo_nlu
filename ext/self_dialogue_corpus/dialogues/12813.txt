Do you like the Star Wars prequels?
I like them, but some things bother me.
What sort of things do you have trouble with in the films?
In particular, I dislike the character of Jar-Jar Binks.
Why do you dislike that particular alien character?
Jar-Jar acts silly, and I found the accent more than a bit racist.
What else do you dislike about the prequel trilogy?
I did not care for the way Annakin turned so quickly to the dark side.
Don't you think the emperor explained the turn well enough?
I do not feel the Emperor's evil was evident enough.       The Jedi should've noticed his rapid aging.
