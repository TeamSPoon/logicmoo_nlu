I need a good movie for myself and kids included
Have you watched "Harry Potter"?
Oh ya, I have but my kids havent, thats a great suggestion
Its great for kids to be able to use their imagination
I should get the books for them before we watch
Thats a great idea, who is your favorite character?
I know most everyone says Harry, but I love Ron Weasley
I can see that, he is very funny in the movies
Lord Voldemort is creepy, but also one of my favorites
Oh I can agree 100 percent
