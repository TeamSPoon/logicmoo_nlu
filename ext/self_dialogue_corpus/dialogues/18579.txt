Hey, have you hear the new Linkin Park song?
Nah, I haven't heard anything from then in like 10 years.
It actually sounds pretty nice.
Oh, does it?
Yea man, it's not as heavy sounding as their older stuff.
I might have to check that out.
It's a poppy sounding song with a real mellow sound to it.
I love pop, it's my favorite type of music.
It's got a kind of a newer Fall Out Boy sound.
Who are Fall Out Boy?
You know linkin park but not fall out boy?
I love under a rock dude sorry.
No big deal, I'm only joking.
So who is fall out boy?
They've been around for ages my dude.
Oh yeah? Since when?
Early 2000s.
What genre are they?
They're alternative/pop punk.
Sounds awesome dude.
