Have you heard of the band less than jake
No I haven't what kind of music do they play
They are a punk/ska band there music is awesome and they are great live.
Cool I'll have to check them out do you know any of their songs.
No their songs all have crazy names you can search for them on YouTube.
Cool I'll look them up
Great they are playing here in Chicago in a couple of months and if you like them you can go with me
It's sounds like a good time how much are tickets
Only 25 bucks they keep the prices of their shows cheap for their fans
That's awesome sounds like a really good band to be a fan of
Yea they are better live than on cd which is rare these days
Yea all that overproduced mainstream music sucks
I agree I like bands that sound good live
Totally
Well let me know what you think
Sure I'll check them out tonight when I get home
I think you will like them
Yes sounds like I would
And it would be nice to have another friend come to their concert
Count me in
