Did you see Wonder Woman yet?
Yes, and I loved it! One of the best movies I've seen in awhile.
I know, same here! I've actually been to see it 3 times now.
Really? Well I was actually thinking of seeing it a second time.
You wanna go together?
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you you, haha!
I just love how they've made a super hero movie about a woman, and she totally kicks butt.
And without being sexist, for the most part!
Yeah! Did you know it was directed by a woman?
For real? That makes total sense!
Yeah, her name is Patty Jenkins. She's the one who directed Monster, too.
Ohh, I saw that one. I didn't care much for it though.
Yeah, it was a little too dark for my taste.
I agree. But Wonder Woman on the other hand - I can't get over how awesome it is.
Yeah, yeah, you know you mentioned Monster being too dark. Wonder Woman was the perfect balance of light and darkness.
I loved how optimistic she is. She still believed in the good of people after all that she saw in the war.
That's who Wonder Woman is. She really cares about people.
Well, I'm officially a Wonder Woman fan now! Do you know if they're coming out with a sequel?
I heard Patty Jenkins is already working on the script, so fingers crossed we're going to get it soon!
Oh, I hope so! I'm legitimately excited about it - which I don't think I've said any sequel!
