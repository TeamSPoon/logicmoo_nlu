Have you listened to anything good lately?
Actually I've been listening to some older stuff.
Oh really?  What have you been listening to?
Stuff from the 70s and 80s.  I've really been into Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
Tom Petty had some really good music.  He had a really distinctive voice.
Yeah, he music is just classic.  I think it's better now that it was then.
Yeah, it was different then, but it seems so right now.
I guess that sounds right.  What are your favorite songs by them?
I really like Don't Come Around Here No More.
Oh, I remember that music video.  It was so weird!
