How do you feel about foreign films?
Well, it really depends.
How so?
Well, there are so many different factors. I can't understand the language, so the actor has to be great!
Any preferences? How about French films?
With French films, I feel I'm always missing important symbolism.
Okay what about Dutch?
Dutch films are easier to follow, but they all feel oddly American. I like Japanese movies.
Really how come?
Well all movies from East Asia have their own style and flair.
I recently saw this East German film about a struggling pop star.
And does it take place in East Germany?
Yeah, it's called Solo Sunny, and it's really sad. And weird.
Like most East German films I would imagine!
There are also these really cool rubble films from the 1940s in Germany.
What are those? Films about rubble?
No, silly, they're movies made after the war. They couldn't hide the debris.
That sounds really interesting.
They are really well made. You should check out "A Murderer Amongst Us."
Thanks, I will!
