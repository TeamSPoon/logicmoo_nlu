Do you plan on watching football next year?
I usually don't start watching until the playoffs.
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
Not really, probably the Patriots now. Their Super Bowl victory last year was pretty amazing.
You like The Patriots? Did you hear about Tom Brady deflating footballs?
I don't think he ever admitted to it. Even if he did, it wouldn't give him that big of an advantage.
Probably right, only the greatest quarterback ever could have come back like that in the Super Bowl against Atlanta.
I'm not sure he's the greatest, that's debatable. After all, Terry Bradshaw won four super bowls.
Yeah, Bradshaw wasn't as good as someone like John Elway or Joe Montana.
It's amazing Bradshaw won four, I think it had more to do with the Pittsburgh Steelers defense.
Agreed, that's how the Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won their super bowls.
Any prediction on who is going to the Super Bowl next year?
You can't bet against the Patriots, but I hope to see the Seattle Seahawks make a return.
Seattle has a good quarterback, Russell Wilson is one of the best.
I don't know if he's one of the best, but definitely one of the most mobile.
Who is the most mobile quarterback ever?
In my mind, it was Steve Young. One of the first games I saw him play filling in for Joe Montana, and he ran for about 60 yards on one play.
Did Steve Young ever win a Super Bowl? All I remember about him is that he was Joe Montana's backup.
Steve Young has three Super Bowl rings. Two of them with Joe Montana as starting quarterback, the third when he was the starter.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005. I guess a lot of people thought he was pretty good.
