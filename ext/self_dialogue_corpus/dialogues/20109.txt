Did you see the new X-Men Movie?
I think so, I am not a big super hero movie fan. Which one was that again?
X-Men: Apocalypse and then Logan just came out.
Ah. I think I have seen Apocalypse but it wasn't memorable.
What types of movies are you into?
Anything really, just never got on the super hero kick. Seems played out.
What's your favorite movie?
Hands down Fight Club. Cinema genius.
Oh yea! (laughs) I have seen that. I remember the hate from the media. Man that was a long time ago.
1999 to be exact. I also really love anything with Jim Carrey.
The Mask was terrible but Me Myself and Irene is a great comedy.
I watch it every time its on. Even if it's already half way through.
There are several movies I do that with.
Which ones?
Anything Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Shawshank, The Green Mile, Inglorious Bastards and 40 Year Old Virgin.
(laughs) 40 Year Old Virgin is one of those movies that is dump but makes you feel good.
Yea. I truly believe its how Kelly Clarkson became famous. (laughs)
The waxing scene. How could I forget?
They're trying to hard these days with the remakes and the super hero stuff.
Yea I agree we're lacking in original ideas for some reason. Hope it gets better in the future.
