Judy Hopps is a true feminist
really?
yeah, zootopia is about feminism! it's also about equal rights for people of color
you really think disney is that deep?
yeah, i do! they always have been. the proof is in the pudding
i guess it does have a lot of scenes that could be about feminism, but it seems more about believing in yourself
don't the two go hand in hand?
i guess...
the reason more women don't believe in themselves is because we don't have enough feminism!
so i guess it's a good thing we have judy hopps
