When did you first listen to rock
My mom used to play it all the time when I was little, so I just got used to it
Really? What bands did she listen to?
Most 80's stuff, she loved Journey.
Wow I'm a big Journey fan! Whats your favorite song?
Girl can't help it has a special place in my heart
Thats one of my favorites too.
Whats your favorite song? Do you have one?
It sounds cliche, but I love Don't Stop Believin'
I can't blame you, its such an iconic song!
