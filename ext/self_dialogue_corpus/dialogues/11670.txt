Did you know I've never listened to The Beatles?
What? Are you joking?
Nope! Dead serious.
Not even, on accident or something? They play on the radio all the time!
Nah man, I only listen to Top 40.
Yikes...that's a choice.
Okay whatever, enough judgement. Which Beatles songs would you recommend?
I guess my favorite would have to be Piggy's.
This was a trick, man! I love The Beatles and you just picked their worst song.
Aw what the heck man? Not cool! Piggy's is a good song...
