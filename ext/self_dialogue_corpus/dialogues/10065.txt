What was the last action movie you saw?
I think the last one I saw was the matrix.
What did you think of it?
It was pretty good. The special effects have mostly aged well.
Yeah they were cutting edge at the time.
Absolutely. They did some interesting and innovative things to get those 360 degree slow motion shots.
Really, what did they do?
Well they had a ton of cameras placed in a circle around the actors and they took frames from the cameras in succession.
Wow that's really interesting. What did you think of Keanu Reeves?
He fit the part well, though his acting was a bit stiff as usual.
