i have to say the golden state worriers are the best team in the NBA.
i disagree the best team is the Cleveland cavaliers.
How? Curry ans the warriors have the most games won in NBA history.
True, but if you look at the stats the cavs can actually close out a game may i remind you of the finals last year?
dont start with that it was last years, its a new season
but your telling me that the warriors are the best Nba team How if the blew a 3-1 lead?
shut up we get it
im just saying you cant say they are the best. besides if steph were to leave they would be better off without him
no he holds the team together best 3 shooter of all time.
yeah but where is his all around skill he is decent at best all around player
well kevin durant can do it all
he is a bitch he is only in it to win a ring he gave up on okc like a child not getting his candy
well klay thompson is a beast
klay thompson should leave the warriors he can lead a team
they are like Mj and Pippin
dont even compare them to the bulls
they beat the bulls win streak last year they are not to compare
the 91-95 bulls were the ultiment winning machines
they couldnt beat the worriers
look i cant talk to you your a worriers fan that is ignorant to the whole NBA players.
