Do you get the meaning of the balloons in the movie Up?
Yeah, they were the way the house flew up in the air.
Yeah but it seems like they're everywhere in every advertisement for the movie.
Well yeah, they should be. They're kind of important in the story.
Well why don't they have that funny dog in every advertisement? He's pretty important.
Yeah, but he's not all that important.
A talking dog? What could be more important than that?
I guess you have a point.
Maybe they should start calling the movie: Dog.
I doubt they'll do that, dude.
