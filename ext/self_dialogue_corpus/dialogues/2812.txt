How could the Colts keep Pagano?
They still can't be as bad as last year.
The defense should improve some espeically with Hooker.
Yeah but it will still probably be awful.
The AFC is garbage.
Yeah the Pats will probably stroll though again.
The Steelers could be good.
Ben will get hurt like every year.
Maybe the whole league is garbage.
Not sure who is actually good.
Andrew Luck has to make the leap this year.
If he doesn't now when will he?
I don't knwo he's almost 30.
If he doesn't break out this year maybe he's just average.
I hope not.
The recievers are good the line is better there should be no exuses.
Well the coaches still suck.
He has to get past that.
If he doesn't there will be all new coaches again next year.
Well at least Pagano will get fired.
