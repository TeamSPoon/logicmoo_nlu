Hi
Hello
What's going on.
Not much.
You into baseball.
Yeah I like baseball.
What do you like most about baseball?
That's an interesting question.  Let me think.
Okay.
I guess it reminds me of my childhood.
Yeah that's a good point.
The nostalgia is pretty high with it.
Yeah I understand.
Did you ever play?
No never played. You?
Yeah I played some little league way back when.
Oh neat.
Yeah it was fun.
Good talking to you.
You too.
