I keep hearing people say Kylo Ren is going to turn good.
I don't know about that. I think he turned to the dark side in Force Awakens and he killed his father Han Solo! I don't think you can go back after that.
That's true, but there must be something between him and Rey. Remember we still don't know what the exact relation of Rey is in terms of who her parents are.
Yeah that's something that's been pretty controversial. I don't know though, I think Kylo Ren is going to stay the villain throughout the series.
I really liked the nod to Darth Vader's mask in Force Awakens.
How about actually seeing Darth Vader do his thing in Rogue One when he took out the rebel forces on the ship!
That was so cool to see. I was expecting that all throughout the movie.
I think we'll see his spirit in the follow up to Force Awakens. I think he's going to empower Kylo Ren somehow .
I think Kylo needs it after the beating he got from Rey!
I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie!
