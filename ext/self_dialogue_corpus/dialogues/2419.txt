Did you hear about the Gators?
No, what happened?
They cut 3 players at once.
Really?
Yeah.  They are bringing in new players soon.
That's pretty brutal, huh?
Yes it is.
Usually, it's one by one right?
Yeah, but coach said they needed big change.
Any major players?
You might know Brock Berrens.
Oh yeah, Big Brock!
He's gone.
Dang.
Chris Tomlinson is out too.
He wasn't THAT bad.
Guess coach thought he was.
True.
Last player was a bench warmer.
Name unknown.
