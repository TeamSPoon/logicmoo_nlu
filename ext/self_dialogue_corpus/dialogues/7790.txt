My favorite part about the first Harry Potter movie is when he is learning about magic!
Yes, me too. Especially when he learns about Diagon Alley!
Picking a wand and a pet must be soooo exciting !
I would go straight to Ollivanders !
I would be a little scared to see what wand chooses me.
I wouldn't, I'd be so anxious and ready.
Do you think you'd get a pet ?
I think so, probably an owl and you?
I don't think I would. Maybe a cat.
The owls are beautiful though.
