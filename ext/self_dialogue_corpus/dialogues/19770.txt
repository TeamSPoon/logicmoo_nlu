I got to see Lord Huron in concert last night, they were great.
Who are they again?
Oh come on you know, Folk Indie music.
Drawing a blank here.
They're from Michigan, they just had a song in 13 Reasons Why on Netflix
That sounds familiar, what are some of their big songs?
Umm, "She Lit a Fire," "Ends of the Earth", "The Night We Met" I guess
Oh yeah! I know who you're talking about.
There it is
Yeah, I'm a fan, how were they?
Pretty good. I drove up to Philly to see them.
Wow that's dedication.
Yeah, they played most of their stuff on Strange Trails
That's there newest album, right?
Yeah, it came out last year. They were rally good.
That's cool, their lead singer is really talented
Yeah he has a great voice
Definitely. Those songs hit me right in the feelings
You're telling me man. Next time they're in town we should go.
Absolutely - let's check out their tour dates.
