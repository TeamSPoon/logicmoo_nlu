Do you know what movie was on HBO last night?
Which one?
Wall-E.
Huh? Never heard of it.
Are you kidding me?
Nope. What's it about?
Well. First off it's a Pixar movie. I'm not a fan of animated stuff overall, but in my opinion Pixar hasn't made a single bad movie.
I did like Monster Inc. a lot.
This is so much better. I don't know how, but it's a kids movie that's actually profound.
How so?
Well first off, the whole first half of the movie doesn't really have any dialogue.
Woah.
But it doesn't even need to have any. They managed to create these animated characters that are so expressive, with just body language they convey so much.
Okay, sounds pretty good so far.
But the plot is also so great. It takes place in some dystopian future where we have pretty much wrecked the Earth with our wastefulness.
That sounds dark for a kids movie!
It kind of is. But it's also beautiful, and uplifting, and really funny.
Are you serious?
Absolutely, you should watch it if you have HBO. I think it's on again tonight.
Well you're recommendations are wrong pretty rarely. Okay, I'll check it out tonight then.
