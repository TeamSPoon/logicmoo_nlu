I was thinking we should do a disney movie night.
That sounds fun! How many people should we invite?
Maybe 3 or 4? What do you think we should watch.
Hmm. Which do you think are the most fun in a group?
To me that usually means the funniest ones.
Then maybe One Hundred and One Dalmatians?
That sounds like a good choice!
Are there any others we should watch?
How about The Lion King?
Sounds good!
