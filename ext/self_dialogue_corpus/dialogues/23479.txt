Did you like the Ghostbusters movie?
Which one?
Any of them.
I REALLY liked the last one. Girl Ghostbusters!
Funny, right?
Kristen Wiig was the bomb!
They all were.
Yeah.  I kept comparing each of them to their male counterparts in the original.
The guys from the original had cameos, did you catch that?
The best one was Bill Murray playing this stuffy expert.
He got tossed out a window by a ghost!
That was funny.
That was the ghost they caught at a rock concert.  Now that was a funny scene.
All their gadgets were updated.
Even the theme song was updated.
It was catchy.
Its a really funny movie.
Not all the jokes worked though. A lot of Melissa McCarthy's jokes fell flat.
I still like it a lot.
I want to buy the dvd.
