So what kind of music do you like?
My favorite genre is classic rock and roll.
What are some examples of bands you like?
I love groups like Pink Floyd and the Beatles.
How did you even get into music that old?
When I was in high school my girlfriend got me hooked on it.
Do you like any modern music?
I like some, but I'm not really in love with anything new.
I tend to listen to more mainstream music myself.
Don't you find it kind of bland?
I guess I don't mind it so much.
Is there any music you really love, or are you not into music that much?
To me it's mostly background noise when I'm shopping or driving.
For me, it helps me to unwind and relax after a long day.
What do you listen to when you want to relax?
After a long day I'll put on Pink Floyd's Wish you were here to set the tone.
That helps you relax?
It totally calms me down and makes me all mellow.
I can see that I guess.
There's nothing like some good music to set the mood.
