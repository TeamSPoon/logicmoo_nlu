I just watched all of the Harry Potter movies for like, the 10th time.
Yea! I've probably watched them like 20 times. Which one is your favorite?
Hmm, I don't know, the first one is so classic and I love the original Dumbledore actor.
I know, he was so much more like the book character. But I think the last two movies are awesome.
Yeah, they did an amazing job. I feel like I'm one of the characters when I watch it.
Totally. I think the hardest to watch is the Order of the Phoenix because of Dolores Umbridge.
Ugh yes. The cats!! And all of the new rules...
But Fred and George were hilarious in that one. The fireworks and flying through the testing hall was epic.
I know! I love Fred and George!
Me too, they're hilarious.
