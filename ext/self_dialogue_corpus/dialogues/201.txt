How many Superman remakes have their been so far?
I think three.
I only remember two.
Well, they had the original with Christopher Reeves and the relevant sequels.
Right.
Then they had the one that Bryan Singer did - Superman Returns.
Oh yeah, totally forgot about that one.
Then they had the new one with Zack Snyder directing that setup the rest of the DC movies.
Okay, it all makes sense now.
It's all overkill.  Superman's not that cool anyway.
