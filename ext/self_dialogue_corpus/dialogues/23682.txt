Is the new Star Wars movie out yet?
Not yet. At the end of the year I think.
I love those movies. I can't wait to see them.
They're great. I am excited too.
I love the addition of Adam Driver.
What character is he?
He plays Kylo Ren.
Is that the evil guy?
He is one of the evil characters.
I remember him. He was great.
He is a good actor. I liked him in Silence too.
Who else is in that?
I think Andrew Garfield.
I loved him in Spiderman.
He's great in that but I preferred him in the Social Network.
I loved that movie.
Me too. It was riveting.
Did that movie win an Oscar for Best Picture?
I think it lost.
That's a shame. It should have won!
