Do you like the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movies?
I do, I was always more of a 'Halloween' person though.
So you like 'Freddy vs Jason'?
I haven't seen it actually. Is it good?
Yeah, it's alright. It's not as good as the individual franchise movies, though.
Yeah, 'Nightmare on Elm Street' has I think more movies than 'Halloween'?
I'm not sure - there's loads of both movies though.
They're classics. They don't make horror movies like that anymore.
No way. I was so scared of going to sleep as a kid.
Me too! Freddy Krueger was such a terrifying character!
