Do you know of any new rules or changes for the upcoming NFL season?
I haven't heard of any yet.  Why?
I was just hoping they haven't messed with it. I like the games the way they are.
Me too.  i do have to admit though, that I like the change about kicking field goals.
Yeah, that did turn out to be a good one.  I had heard that they may want to do away with kicking all together though.
I heard that too and I hope they don't.  Kicking is an important part of the game.
It would be like doing away with punts.  You have to punt and have a return.
That's what makes the game interesting. You wait to see if the guy can run it all the way back or not.
True! So kicking is exciting.
It is!  What did you think of the female referree they had last year?
I thought she would be just a publicity stunt but I did see her try and break up a fight once.
That was surprising!  I thought she'd be to "cheerleader like" to do something like that.
Basically she just did her job and didn't make a deal about being a woman.
True, she did.  I wonder if the NFL will ever have a woman head coach!
Probably not for a long, long time!  More women have to get involved with watching the games first!
You can't coach what you don't know.  You have me thinking about rules and stuff and there's a lot to learn.
The NFL looks pretty simplistic but it's really not.
I wish the NFL would lower ticket prices to the games while we are talking about changes and stuff.
Oh me too!  It's way better to just watch on tv!
When you watch on tv you can see more emotions of the players.
