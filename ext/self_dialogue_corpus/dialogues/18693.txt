Hey Oliver, I see that you have some CDs there, got anything good?
Oh, hi Veronica, yeah, these are some of my favorites.
Can I look through them?
Sure, here you go.
Oh, you have Prince's Purple Rain.  I like some of his songs.
Yeah, that's a good one.  I especially like "When Dove's Cry."
Yeah, that's a good one.
He was a really good guitar player.
He sure was.  He played a lot of instruments, but I think I enjoy the guitar playing the most.
Same here, you should check out a YouTube video that has him playing during the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame a few years ago.
I'll check it out, what song was he playing?
It was "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" by the Beatles.  He was playing with a bunch of other guys.
That's cool, I will have to check it out.  Do you have any other interesting facts about Prince?
Of course, I heard that Michael Jackson wanted Prince to sing "Bad" as a duet.
Wow, that would have been awesome, I wonder why it didn't work out.
Well, from what I heard, Prince didn't want to sing "Your butt is mine" to Michael Jackson.
Oh, that's funny!
Yeah, I think so too.
I'm going to have to get some more music facts from you soon!
Ok, have a great day.
