Did Bruno Mars ever do the halftime show for the Superbowl?
Yeah, he did a few years back.
I don't remember that.
How could you forget?  It was pretty good.
Did anyone else perform with him?
I'm pretty sure.  I just don't remember.
Wait, was that the year Katy Perry was on?
Hmm.  It might have been.
What songs did he sing?
I honestly don't remember.  The singing and dancing though, were all everyone were talking about.
