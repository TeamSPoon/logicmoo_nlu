Did you like the Force Awakens?
I didnt like it that much, I'm a Star Wars fan but think the last movie wasnt as good.
I agree, I think theres many flaws, hopefuly this will get fixed.
What character did you like the most?
I liked the villain, I thought hes light saver was pretty cool.
Yeah it was, it would be interesting to see how he got trained.
I wonder how the next Star Wars movie will be like.
It will be interesting to watch Kilo Ren fight Luke.
That would be a pretty cool fight.
I wonder if Luke can put up a fight after all this time.
