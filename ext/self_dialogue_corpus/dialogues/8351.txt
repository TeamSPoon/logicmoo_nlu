My favorite song is BEAUTY AND THE BEAT.
It is by Justin Beiber.
I like when they dance in the wading pool.
Water is splashing everywhere.
I can feel your body rock.
Girl I can feel your body rock.
I like it when he does, eh, eh, eh.
His underwater part is cool.
They underwater phones are cool also.
I think they are cameras.
