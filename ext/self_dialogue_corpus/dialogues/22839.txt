What's your favorite comedy movie?
I have so many of them. I love Talladega Nights: The Ricky Bobby Story.
That movie is hilarious! I laughed so hard through that whole thing.
Yeah, the ensemble cast is great.
Have you seen Step Brothers?
Of course! And also Walk Hard.
I had a John C. Reilley marathon once, and I watched all three of those in one day!
That must have been a fun day! What's your favorite comedy?
This Is Spinal Tap.
That's a great one! Do you like mockumentaries?
Yes, but this is the best and the brightest.
Who was your favorite band member.
Nigel.
That movie is a classic. Did you see A Mighty Wind?
Yes, it was hilarious. The same guys, but in a folk band.
I'm a huge Christopher Guest fan.
Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show are brilliant.
Whenever I see a dog show I think of Parker Posey and the busy bee from Best in Show.
Haha! That's hilarious. I love Parker Posey.
She's great, I love her in Dazed and Confused.
