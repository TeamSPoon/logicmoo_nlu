Is it time for some football yet?
Not exactly, we still have some waiting to do!
I can not wait to watch my Los Angeles Chargers!
Do you think they will be a playoff team this year?
Not sure about that; but I can always hope!
I think the roster is pretty talented when you look at it.
We have some holes to fill; but so do most other teams as well.
Are there any players that you are excited to watch?
I really think Joey Bosa is a special talent.
Is he the defensive end from Ohio State?
Yes, he was outstanding for the buckeyes in his time there.
Well, he may be the player that turns the Charger's defense into an elite one.
I hope so! I feel like as long as we have Phillip Rivers we will have a chance.
There is no doubt about that. He has been a special player for that organization.
So what team do you cheer on?
I have always been a Washington Redskins fan.
Kirk Cousins has been really good for your team.
Yea, nobody really expected him to be so good.
Josh Norman was a great addition to your defense.
I know! I was so happy when we got him from Carolina.
