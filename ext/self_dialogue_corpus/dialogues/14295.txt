It looks like it will be the Warriors and Cavaliers again in the NBA Finals this year.
Yeah, this is the third year in a row now.
It should be a good tie breaker. Who do you think wins?
It's tough to say, both are playing great basketball right now.
Definitely! The Cavalliers just beat the Celtics by like 40!
Yeah that was crazy.
I think Kevin Love will be the X factor for the Cavaliers this year. He was injured their first year and didn't play that great last year.
Yeah he will have to play well this time. It's going to be a tough match up against arguably the defensive player of the year, Draymond Green.
That's true. Now that the Warriors have Kevin Durant he will likely guard LeBron.
Yeah, and they still have Andre Igoudala off the bench to guard LeBron. He won't start this time.
I still don't think they can slow LeBron down, the guy is just too good.
Probably not but now he will have to guard Durant which will wear him down.
True, in previous years they didn't have to worry about Harrison Barnes offensively. But Durant is one of the best in the league.
Im more interested in the Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry matchup again.
Man Kyrie was insane last year. They had no answer for him, and the game winner in game 7 was beautiful.
Curry isn't known for his defense, I would expect more of the same this year.
That's where Klay Thompson will have to step up.
Yeah but he couldn't stop kyrie either last year.
Good point. I can't wait for the Finals to start!
Same here, only a couple of more weeks to go.
