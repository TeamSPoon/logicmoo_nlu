What is your favorite movie?
Don't laugh but it is Real Genius.
Wow, never would have guessed. That starred Val Kilmer.
Yes, it did and it came out in I think 1985.
Yes, he was super young back then and very cute.
It was a fun movie.
That was when home computers and modems were all still new.
Yeah, and computer hacking was new also and harder to trace.
I loved the scene where Ick turns the dorm hall into an ice skating rink.
That was so funny especially when Kilmer skates around and says no one signed up for there competition.
Also when they trick Kent thinking he was talking to God.
Yeah that was genius putting a transmitter on his braces.
You do have to admit the best scene was the popcorn scene
Yes, I couldn't believe that anyone could make such a huge ball of corn kernels.
And they were so smart that they were able to direct the laser to hit the prism in the right spot so that it hit the ball.
Yeah and then Kent goes into the house.
And them boom! Popcorn explosion.
So funny how the house gets destroyed by popcorn.
You almost felt sorry for Hathaway when he came home to that.
Yeah almost, but not. So funny!
