How do you even start picking out a wedding dress?
It really depends on your style, there are so many these days!
I'm not sure what my style is, I suppose I want something that won't look super dated in the future.
Yeah that's really hard. I wonder if people in the 80's thought those poofy shoulders would look so dated like they do now?
I have no idea! They are are hideous though.
A-line is a very classic style that I imagine won't go out of fashion any time in the future.
You are probably right.
I would really avoid mermaid dresses for sure.
Yeah I don't like that style anyway. I had a friend that got one and she even said explicitly to me that she didn't want her dress to look dated either!
Yeah I can't imagine that would still be in fashion even ten years from now. The silhouette is just a bit strange looking.
I saw in stores that the fashionable thing now is showing a LOT of skin with see-through dresses.
Maybe in Italy! I can't imagine anyone wearing such a thing in the U.S. any time soon. We're too stuffy for such things.
I think you are right that an A-line would definitely be the best way at sticking with a classic style that won't look dated.
Luckily lace is coming back into fashion. Even though it goes in an out I think lace is a good idea if you like it.
I love lace! I think that would look great. Maybe even with a bit of sparkle.
Sparkles is always great! Just don't go too overboard. That gets scratchy feeling and you don't want to be uncomfortable!
That's a good point. What do you think of those high-low dresses? I've been seeing them more and more, even with wedding dresses.
I think they are really cute - but for a wedding dress? Maybe if you were having a beach wedding in Hawaii or something like that.
Yeah it would make a good destination wedding dress. I'll stick with the A-line like you mentioned. It's simple and classic.
Great decision. Lets go find the perfect one!
