Do you like any music by Bruno Mars?
I really like the song "Just the Way You Are" by him!
Yes I really love that one too.
Another good one is "That's what I like."
I know that one! I hear it on the radio a lot.
Me too. I love when it comes on!
I do also! I crank the volume when I hear it.
He has a great voice.
He really does. So smooth.
Definitely a favorite artist of mine.
