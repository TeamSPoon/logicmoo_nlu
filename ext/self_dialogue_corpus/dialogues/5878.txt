I will show you the world!
Did you just watch Aladdin again?
Yes. You know it is my favorite movie.
Why??
Jasmine is the greatest Disney princess.
She is pretty cool.
She wasn't just going to marry anyone, and then she met Aladdin and it was love!
I really like that she has a tiger.
And the flying carpet!
Well who wouldn't want a flying carpet?
