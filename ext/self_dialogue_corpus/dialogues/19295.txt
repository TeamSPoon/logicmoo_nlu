Have you heard of System of a Down?
I've heard that they're pretty popular.
But have you listened to their music?
No, I haven't. What do they play?
They play alternative metal.
What exactly is alternative metal?
It's pretty much what it sounds like. Like what alternative rock is to rock music.
But for metal? That sounds new.
It's not all that new. They've been doing it for years.
Do you have any recommendations?
I'd highly recommend their album Toxicity. It has some of their most popular songs they've ever made.
I think I might have heard of it, actually. Did Rick Rubin produce it?
Yes he did.
Alright, so I have heard of it. I'm a fan of Rick Rubin's production discography.
Then this is a good place for you to start checking them out.
Isn't the song Chop Suey on the album?
Yes. How'd you know?
I have a friend who always listens to that songs. The album title made me remember.
Well, there's tons of good songs on the album.
I'll take your word for it.
