How do you feel about the current state of rap music?
That is a really good question. I have always been a huge fan of rap music.
I know, I figured you would be the perfect person to talk with about this subject.
I certainly feel that there is some great talent out there right now.
Who would you say are some great young rappers at the moment?
I would say Meek Mill is up there. He is still in his twenties and has already put out some great material.
Didn't he have a beef with Drake at some point?
Yes he did and that certainly did not do him any favors in regards to his career.
He released a pretty decent album a few years back, right?
Yes he had some success with an album called Dreams Worth More Than Money.
What other rappers do you have some confidence in? In terms of the future of rap music.
Vince Staples and Young Thug are a couple of talented musicians as well.
It just seems like rap is not the same these days as it used to be.
I can see what you are saying. However, you really have to temper your expectations in terms of the future in general.
What do you mean by that exactly?
Well you used to have so many great legends like Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G, and others leading the rap game.
Yea, it would be unfair to expect rappers of today to turn into those guys.
That is pretty much what I am saying; we just have to enjoy rap music as much as possible while also celebrating its past.
I think that is a smart approach! I wished guys like Eminem would also make more music.
Eminem is very talented, I still think he is the leader of the rap industry right now.
