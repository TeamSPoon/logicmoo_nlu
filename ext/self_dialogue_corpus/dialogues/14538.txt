So are the Spurs the best ever?
Like as a team or a franchise or what?
I mean like all around.
Well theyve been doing this for 20 years so theyre the current dynasty.
Change the players, dont change the winning.
Its amazing in todays world.
So are they the best dynasty ever?
I dont know the Celtics and Lakers won alot more.
Different time, not as many teams.
Yeah so the teams were better and more stacked.
True but the Celtics just won year after year.
This is true but the Spurs have won in an era that has one and done mega stars.
Yeah I just dont see it.
Think about it, the Spurs havent created a 3 man team like the Cavaliers and Warriors.
The Warriors drafted all their guys much like the Spurs.
Yeah Cleveland and Miami and Boston all did it with free agency.
So are you ready to crown the Spurs.
Once they win 5 in a row.
Could they beat MJs Bulls?
Never, he was the GOAT!
