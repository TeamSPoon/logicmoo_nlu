I'm so glad that the Penguins tied the series.
Yeah it is anyone's series now
I am concerned though that the Penguins have a couple of injuries
Yeah it is a little alarming, but someone else always seems to set up
Yeah so far so good, but I'm worrried about the Justin Schulz injury.
Yeah he is a vital cog in their success
I just hope that they are able to overcome this latest injury
Well, when you still have Sidney Crosby, you still have a great chance
Very true. Crosby definitely gives them an advantage
And the Senators really don't have anyone on their squad that compares
Yeah you are right, but the Senators are playing well right now
Yes they are. They play very well collectively as a team.
That's why the recent injuries for the Penguins has me a little nervous
These are the types of things that can change a series
So true. Hopefully, these other guys step up now that they've been given an opportunity
Exactly. It's always next man up, especially in the playoffs.
I think Game 3 will be very pivotal and whoever wins that will have the inside track on the series
I agree. Game 3 is definitely an important game for both teams
I just hope the Penguins are the ones that come out on top
Yeah me too
