Did you see that Haruki Murakami has a new book out?
Yeah, what's it called?
It's a nonfiction book called "Absolutely On Music". He interviews a conductor about classical music.
What conductor?
His name is Seiji Ozawa. He conducted a bunch of famous orchestras all over the world.
Hmm. I love Murakami, do you think it's worth reading? I don't know much about music.
Probably. I read it at home and listened to all of the classical pieces they were talking about as I read.
Were they easy to find?
People have been putting up playlists on youtube and that sort of thing.
I wish they'd just sell it as a CD.
That would make things easier.
Does Murakami know a lot about music?
I mean, it seems like it. Sometimes it's difficult to tell which of them is the conductor!
That's surprising to me. I wouldn't have thought it.
Well, there are lots of references to music in his books.
I always thought that was just music he liked.
He talks a lot about collecting rare and unusual records, too.
Maybe I will pick up a copy!
I could just lend it to you.
Would you? Thanks!
