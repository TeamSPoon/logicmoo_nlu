Do you know the character Chewbakka from the Star Wars series?
Yes he's the furry one right?
Yes he is, he's my favorite character and I can make his wookie sound.
Really?  That's awesome.
I remember the first time I heard that I just laughed and laughed.
Yeah it was a  pretty hilarious part in the movie.
Do you think he is the last of his kind?
I'm not sure I would think not but I don't recall seeing anymore in the movies do you?
Me either now that you mention it.
That's kind of sad.
