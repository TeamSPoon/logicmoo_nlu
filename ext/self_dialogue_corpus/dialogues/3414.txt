What do you think is the best horror movie of all time?
I'd have to say Rosemary's Baby.
Really, that's an oldie.  Why do you think that is the best horror movie?
Because it really showed us the horror that lurks behind everyday life, especially in New York City.
Did you think that the actors that played Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse did a good job?
Yes, Mia Farrow was the perfect choice for innocent Rosemary and John Cassavetes did a great job playing the creepy husband Guy.
Do you remember the part where the old neighbor lady gave Rosemary those drinks when she was pregnant?
Yes, I do and that is why I never accepted food or drink from anyone but my own family when I was expecting!
Did you know that the movie was filmed at the Dakota where John Lennon used to live?
Wow, I didn't know that.  But that building really looked creepy and it looked like the perfect place for a bunch of witches to live!
