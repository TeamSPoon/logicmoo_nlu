Have you seen Inside Out
What is that
It is either Disney or Dreamworks
Its a cartoon
yes it is
I am not sure what is it about
It is about peoples brains and how they experiance different things
well that does not sound good
it really is, it is basically about a girl growing up and she becaomes rebelious
oh that sounds a little better
it is how people recall events and how things are stored in their minds
sounds deep
it kind of is but still understandable for kids
it is a wonderful show
is it funny
it is sad, funny, and serious
I may want to look into it
you need to you would like it
is it on Netflix
I do not think it is
