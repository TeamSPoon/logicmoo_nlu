What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Well, I watched a bunch of the older ones over and over again on VHS when I was a kid, so those tend to be the ones I'm most familiar with.
But you're not old enough you saw them come out in the theaters originally, are you?
Nope, but I think these tapes might even have been taped off of television!
So of the older ones, which one do you like the best?
Return of the Jedi.
Ah, the culmination. What do you like about that one in particular?
Well, first of all, the acting gets a lot better in this one than in the first two movies!
What do you mean?
Oh come on, the story is wonderful but the acting is so bad in the first film. Harrison Ford is by far the best, and he's not great.
