Are you going to be hosting NFL Sunday parties again this year ?
Yes I will, every Sunday.
I will be there every week, just like last year.
That's good. Are you going to wear your Browns jersey again.
Of course I will, that's my team.
How many games did they win last year?
They won only once in the entire last year.
What team did they beat?
They beat the Chargers, on the day that I didn't wear my jersey.
I thought so, maybe this year you should try not wearing your jersey.
That's not a bad idea, any help with luck would be good.
It's going to take more than just luck for the Browns to do good this year.
I was born in Cleveland and there are a lot of us die hard Browns fans.
I know, how many times have the Browns won the Super Bowl?
They have never been to the Super Bowl, but you already knew that didn't you.
Yes I knew, there are four teams that have never been to the Super Bowl.
The Browns have won an NFL championship game though, before the creation of the Super Bowl.
The Detroit Lions have also done that, and they have never been to a Super Bowl either.
This is the year the Browns finally make it to the Super Bowl.
I'll believe it when I see it.
