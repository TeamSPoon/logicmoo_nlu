Have you ever heard of Jonah and the Lion?
Is it some sort of book?
No.  They're a band.
No.  What do they sing?
They're just coming up.  They sing just about everything.
How can they sing everything?  What genre is it?
I'd say pop, but there's a fun element to the band.
Are they like those parody song bands?  Like Weird Al or something?
No.  They sing real songs.  They just have a lot of fun.
Well, I'll just have to check them out.  This will be interesting.
