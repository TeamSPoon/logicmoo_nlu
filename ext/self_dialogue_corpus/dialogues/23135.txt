did you like clerks
clerks was kevin smiths best
it was original and had great dialogue
the dialogue was on quentin level
it seemed like it to be honest
they both have irrelevant dialogues and conversations
but they all made a good impression on the film
clerks sounds boring on paper
but its such a good movie if you watch it
i liked mallrats better though
i liked clerks better
clerks 2 wasnt even bad
usually sequels are bad but you're right
the really bad movie kevin did was the tusk movie
that movie was atrocious
it seemed like a parody
it was a comedy horror
the dude turned into a walrus
it was disgusting
i regret watching it ever
