We just got back from the House of Blues. Saw a guy there named Gary Clark.
I like him. He's great live.
oh yeah. I had a great time and the music was hot.
I have some of his albums. Did you ever listen to anything by him?
No. A friend had an extra ticket so I went.
Okay - well check out an album of his called Blak and Blu.
I think I will. He played a great set.
He has a live album that came out in 2014 that I like.
Nice. Have you seen him play live?
Yes. House of Blues too.
What else do you know about him? Is he straight blues or does he do other kinds of music?
I'd say he's a musician more than anything and has played with all the big names like the Stones and Eric Clapton.
Oh nice. I am just getting introduced tonight to him but I love what I heard.
Yeah he is a guy that can hold his own live. Check out his live recordings to get that feel.
I will do that. next time he is in town, we should go together.
I'd like that - I am always down for a good show.
well I will get those CDs from you and give a long listen - I really feel that he could be a new fave.
He is already a fave of mine.
Sweet. well we will make those plans and see him.
yes. take the CD's - listen and learn!
