Did you want to go with me to a concert next week?
Who is gonna be there?
The Barenaked Ladies.
Oh wow I love them, I haven't seen them in forever.
Me either, but I won some tickets at work.
I'd love to go with you, that'd be great.
Good, I couldn't think of anybody else that would like them.
I've been a fan for years.
Me too what's your favorite song.
That's a hard one. Either Alcohol or If I had a Million Dollars.
Good choices, I actually like the song they wrote for the Big Bang Theory theme.
Wait that was them?
Yeah, you didn't know that was their song.
No but I think I just found a new favorite.
That's funny, I was suprised too when I heard it the first time.
I sing it every time I watch that show.
Me too, though I'm not sure if they'd play it on stage.
That be awesome if they did, but we can still look forward to the classics.
I just hope they play One Week and It's All Been Done.
Man, I can't wait to go now.
