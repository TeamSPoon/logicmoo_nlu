Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?
I don't think I have but I know about them from watching their trailers on tv.
Yeah, me too.  They look okay, kind of interesting.
Didn't one of the main actors die a year or so ago?
I think he did.  I think it's a little wierd that they keep making the movies and using his image in them.
I totally agree with that. It's a little creepy.
On the flip side, the car chase and race seens look pretty cool.
They really do. I do like Vin Diesel too.
Me too.  I'd like to see one or more of the movies just because he's in them.
The newest one is called The fate of the Furious and it's got some big name actors in it.
