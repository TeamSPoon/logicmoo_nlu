Do you like Jazz Music?
It is not my go to genre but I don't mind listening to it.
It is sad that not much Jazz music is written today or at least charted.
I agree and also a lot of the music today sounds to simmilar. I wish we could see Jazz and other genres on the charts again.
Yes the charts are mostly dominated by hip hop and pop these days.
I don't mind hip hop and pop but those genres didn't really exist 50 years ago and the world was fine.
I know I wish people would realize that and see there is so much more to music.
Yes it does not have to be as basic as some of the songs on the radio.
There is far to much recycling and borrowing going on. I don't like when artists essentialy reuse the beats of other artists.
Yes if they don't get permission this is a horrible occurrence.
I am definitely listening to some Jazz music when I get home.
Who is your favorite Jazz artist?
I really like Louis Armstrong.
I've heard of him!
I listen to "When the Saints Go Marching In" all the time.
Wow I knew that song and didn't even know Louis Armstrong was the artist.
He is and it is a great song. I miss music like that.
Same here we should try and bring Jazz back into the mainstream.
We could try but I doubt we can pull it off!
You're right but it is definitely worth a shot!
