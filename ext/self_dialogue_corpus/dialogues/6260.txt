Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?
Which one, aren't there more than one of them?
The latest one, it just came out on DVD I think.
Is it animated? or does it have real actors in it.
It has real actors, Emma Watson plays Belle.
I wonder who plays the Beast?
The Beast is played by Dan Stevens.
Where are you finding this information about the movie?
I went to Disney's Beauty and the Beast website, they have a lot of great interaction type activities.
I think I will go now and check that out.
