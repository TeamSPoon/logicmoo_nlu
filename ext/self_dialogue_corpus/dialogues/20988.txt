Are you a fan of the Transformer movies?
I do like them. I have been watching them since I was a kid so I admit I am biased.
I kind of wish they would bring Shia Labeouf back to the franchise.
Yeah, I agree. I think he kind of representative of the series and its a bummer he is no longer in them.
How do you feel about Mark Wahlberg being in them?
I think he does a good job acing, but there is something like depth missing from his character in my opinion.
I personally think he is too stereotypical and he doesn't strike me as the mechanical genius type as we are led to believe.
True, and his smoking hot daughter looks like she could play his reindeer in another movie so its hard to buy their familial relationship.
One thing that still impresses me about the series is the visual effects, they are fantastic.
Oh for sure, there is so much detail in all of the transformers I couldn't begin to imagine designing much less animating them.
I hope the story of the new one doesn't have optimus prime being bad, I hope he is just playing a part or become corrupted and goes back to being good in the end.
Me too, I sure hope he doesn't actually destroy Bumblebee.
I am literally going to cry if Optimus Prime kills Bumblebee, that would be so stupid.
Another thing I like about the Transformer movies is all the cool new cars they always feature.
The latest cars are always in the movies, its great to see the latest model of camaro and other cars.
I wonder if there will be a 3D version of the new film, I know there is a 3D version of the last one because I own it.
Do you prefer watching movies in 3D?
It depends on how I am watching it, in theaters or on big screen tvs I prefer standard to HD but if I'm watching with my virtual reality headset I prefer 3D.
Whats it like watching in virtual reality?
Well there are several different theaters you can choose from including a theater in space orbiting the earth and a drive in theater on a cliff so its pretty cool.
