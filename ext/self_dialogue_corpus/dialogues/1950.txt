Hey which teams do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year?
That is a tough one, but I think the Patriots and Cowboys will make it.
The Cowboys? Really?  They always lose in the playoffs.
True, but I think this year will be different.
Why do you think so?  History says otherwise!
Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott make for a tough matchup for any defense.
They are great players, but they are too young.  I don't think they have developed the necessary leadership skills yet.
I disagree.  You saw what Dak did in his rookie year alone.  He is a natural leader at the quarterback position.
He did well, but I think it was a fluke.  Rookie luck.
I guess this year will be the true test then!
I think you are right about the Patriots, though.  They never seem to lose!
Definitely.  Tom Brady is a beast.
Do you think Brady is the best of all time?
You certainly could argue that.  He has won so many championships.
For sure.  He has a competitive drive like no other.
It will be hard for any quarterback to replicate what he has done.
Unless it's Dak Prescott!  Haha.
Yeah yeah, he has a while to go before he gets to Brady's level.
You are right, but they are both good quarterbacks at this point in time.
Exactly.  Ok, I have to go.  Take care!
