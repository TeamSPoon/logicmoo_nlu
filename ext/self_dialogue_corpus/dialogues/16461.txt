What do you think of the band DNCE?
I am not sure I know who they are.
They are the one with Joe Jonas, kind of a pop and dance group.
Oh, the Cake by the Ocean people?
Yes! They have some really good dance songs.
I have only ever heard the one. I was a Jonas fan.
Did you like their music, or just their show?
I loved their music! It was always so happy and cute.
I like the Love Bug song.
That as my favorite. Nick has some good ones out too, now.
Like Jealous?
That one is really deep, far from the pop kid stuff.
Do you like the new style he has?
I do. I think he can sing really well.
I like the duet he did with Kasey Muskgraves.
The country singer?
Yeah, they did a cover of Peter Pan.
Was it good?
It was, he really does country well.
I never thought of him as a country and Western singer.
