How many times,have you watched The Wizard Of Oz?
I honestly don't know. Countless times.
Its probably the most enduring movie of all time.
I'd have to agree with you.
Wasn't Judy Garland only fourteen when they filmed it?
Yes,she was a very young talented actress.
What a voice she had.
You know they were going to leave out the song,Over the Rainbow?
Really? In I didn't know that. Why?
They thought it was to long and slowed the movie down.
Imagine the movie without that song?
Obviously it just wouldn't be the same.
Did you also know MGM wanted Shirley Temple to play Dorothy?
I didn't know that either.
ThenRuby Slippers were silver in the book.
Wow,no kidding.
The tin mans oil was actually syrup.
That had to be a mess.
How about the snow in the scene was asbestos.
Are you kidding me.
