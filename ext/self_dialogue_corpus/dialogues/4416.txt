Is the movie Split considered to be a thriller movie?
I think it is a horror thriller movie. Have you seen it?
No I have not seen it. Have you?
I saw it in theaters when it first came out. It is a great movie by M. Night Shyamalan.
I heard it is related to another one of his movies.
It has ties to Unbreakable. They say they are making a sequel that will include characters from both movies.
Oh that could be very interesting. What are the names of the two main actors from Split?
The main guy is James McAvoy and the girl is Anya Taylor-Joy.
I like James. He looks really scary in the trailers I have seen.
He is a great actor. He does a good job in the movie playing all those different people.
