So you're going to be on my new baseball team, right?
Yes. When are practices?
Saturdays at ten A.M.
I will definitely be there and if you want we can meet on other days to practice. My pitching is a big rusty.
That's an area I'm great in so I will help you with it.
Thanks. I want to be able to pitch really well.
You already bat well and you are a good catcher also.
Right so if I can learn to pitch I'll be a triple threat.
You will indeed.
I've never been as good at pitching, though.
You weren't bad in school.
No, but I wasn't great either.
We'll get you there.
I appreciate that. I'm sure if anyone can you can.
I helped Cam get a lot better when we used to practice.
Oh, Cam is great now. That was ouy helping him?
It was. We used to practice a lot.
Well if you can get me as good as him I'll consider you a miracle worker.
Cam plays for the Stars now.
Hopefully we don't play against them.
