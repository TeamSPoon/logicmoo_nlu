I need a new workout playlist. The playlist I have now just isn't motivating me anymore.
What do you listen to now?
Well, I have a mix of mostly EDM and rap but with a few rock songs mixed in.
What type of rap music do you listen to?
I like Wiz Khalifa, Eminem and of course the originals like Biggie and Tupac.
Eminem is one of my favorite rappers. I love the way his songs are almost always an entire story you can see in your mind.
Me too, I don't like a lot of rap music where the lyrics only talk about cars or money. I like more substance than that.
Exactly, songs about money, cars and women get very old very quickly.
What's your favorite Eminem song?
There's just no way that I could pick one. The Eminem Show is one of my favorite albums though.
I really liked that album.
Superman and Sing for the Moment were great singles on that album.
My all time favorite Eminem album is Recovery.
I actually think that might be mine too now that I think of it.
I must have listened to that album for about three months straight when it first came out.
I actually went and bought the CD. I don't think I'd actually purchased a CD for years before that.
I played Love the Way you Lie and No Love a ton.
I liked those a lot and I thought they were great collaborations. Rihanna and Lil Wayne were amazing.
Those songs will never get old to me.
I couldn't agree more.
