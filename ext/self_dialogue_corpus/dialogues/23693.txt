Which movie series have been the most successful?
Well that depends on how you mean successful. The Fast and the Furious is by far the series with the most movies.
Unless you count the Avengers movies.
That's debatable. The Avenger movies could be a series separate from the Captain America movies, and the Ironman movies.
Or you could go the other way and count all of those as part of the Avengers franchise, and include the Guardians of the Galaxy movies.
Just because they're Marvel movies and Stan Lee mad an appearance doesn't make them part of the same franchise.
Speaking of Chris Pratt: there's the Jurassic Park/World movies. I can't wait for the next one.
Chris Pratt's reboot was silly but fun. There was the Tomb Raider franchise.
That was only two movies, wasn't it? Is it a franchise if there are only two movies.
Point taken. There were the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe movies.
And the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. So do you count those as two franchises or one.
Gandalf makes it a single franchise. And speaking of Hugo Weaving movies, there was the Matrix franchise.
There was the Indiana Jones franchise.
That was excellent. And if you mention Harrison Ford, you have to mention the Star Wars franchise.
And if you mention the Star Wars franchise, you have to mention the Star Trek franchise.
Confuse them you must not.
There was the Jaws franchise.
No, not really. There was Jaws, and there's been an endless stream of bad shark movies every since.
So is the Fast and the Furious or Star Wars franchise the longest running?
Ponder this I must.
