Have you ever heard Liberace play the piano?
Do you mean live?
No,not live. On television.
Yes,I remember he was on Johnny Carson quits a bit.
Yea he was on a lot.
I don't know how anyone can play like that.
Well,you have to be born with that talent first.
Oh I agree.
But to get to his level it has to take an unbelievable amount of playing and practicing.
I can't imagine the hours he put in.
You really have to be super dedicated to your craft.
If you want to become something and play like him,absolutely.
I guess he was the best of my era growing up.
You know,I can't really think of anybody any better.
He just made it look so easy.
So smooth. Playing without looking at the keys blows my mind.
It's an incredible talent.
It sure is.
It has to be so hard to play with both hands.
Takes tremendous coordination.
