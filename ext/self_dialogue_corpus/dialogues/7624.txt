Just watched Harry Potter, there are some things that do not add up about the first one.
Like what?
Well, Harry's aunt and uncle were abusive. How did no one see this?
I do not think they let on to his living conditions to others.
Right, but what about when Harry went to his muggle school, how did the teachers not notice his clothes, his over all look of neglect.
Maybe it was magic?
No, this is before. The kid was pretty much a prisoner. Did people who came over to visit not see this?
Maybe the Dursleys were good at hiding?
They were awful ! I wish they would have gotten more of a punishment in the end.
They locked him up more than once.
