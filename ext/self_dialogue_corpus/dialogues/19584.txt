How do you feel about pop punk?
I love it.
Who do you think pioneered it?
Green Day in my opinion
I would say Blink 182.
Green Day started way before then
I think they broke into the scene as a rock band though.
They could have but they had that power pop sound.
I guess you could say the same thing about Blink 182.
New Found Glory probably were the original band that maintained their sound in the mainstream.
They still play that same style.
It is amazing how far they have come.
They stuck to their guns and something can be said for that.
Do they still tour?
Yes and are still releasing albums.
This is a shocker.
Not really, they enjoy making music.
Anyone else in the genre?
Sum 41 to an extent.
I feel like they had one single per album and thats it
