Have you seen The Princess Bride?
Is that the movie with Andre The Giant in it?
Yeah that's the one.
That movie is pretty funny.
I just saw it last night.
You had never seen that before?
No, I watched it on Netflix.
Dude, that movie has been out since the 80s.
Do you want a peanut?
Don't start quoting a movie that is 30 years old.
