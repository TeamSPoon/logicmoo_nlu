What's your favorite genre of music?
I like pop, but I also like country and alternative.
If you like pop and country, you must like Taylor Swift!
Yeah, I'm a fan. I liked her more when she was country though.
Really? I feel like she gained a lot of fans after the release of 1989.
It was a good album, but I feel like going towards pop music was a sell-out for her.
Wow, that's surprising. 1989 was the best selling album of 2014!
I had read that online, I thought she would have more competition.
Well, Adele and Ed Sheeran didn't release albums that year.
That's right- Sheeran's newest album came out in 2017.
Yeah, it's called "Divide". It's really good.
I like "Castle on a Hill" from that album.
Me too, it's used in a trailer for an upcoming movie.
For the movie Ferdinad!
You're right. I hope he wins a grammy this coming year.
He has a good chance. Harry Styles, could too.
Harry's new album is so different from his One Direction songs.
I agree- it's more rock than pop.
I think it shows how he has involved as an artist.
I agree. He's already leading the 2017 Teen Choice nominations.
