What was that movie with Liam Neeson in it?
That's most unhelpful.
The one where they kidnap his daughter.
Oh, you mean Taken.
Oh yeah.  He's such a thug in that movie.
His whole "I don't know who you are..." quote is just money.
It helps make his character that more threatening.
You should know not to miss with Liam Neeson?
Did you ever see the sequels?
Nah, why bother when this one was all you need?
