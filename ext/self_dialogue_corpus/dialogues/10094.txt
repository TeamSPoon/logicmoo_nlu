The A-Team movie was on yesterday.
Really, I love that movie. It was a great extension from a not so great tv show.
Liam Neeson did a great job as Hannibal.
He is a top notch actor.
The fight scenes were intense although some of the action was over the top.
I agree. The CGI graphics were a bit much some times.
The actor who played Mr. T's role looked just like the original.
He really did look like him.
This was definitely an underrated film that didn't get much attention.
It sure didn't get any critical acclaim.
