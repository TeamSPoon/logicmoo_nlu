Do you know Key and Peele from Comedy Central?
Yeah, what about them?
Well they made this hilarious movie called Keanu.
Oh I really wana see that, is it good?
Yes, its one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
I'm really glad to see those guys careers taking off like that.
I know right, they did so great on their show on Comedy Central.
I used to watch that show every single chance I got.
Me too, It sucks that they aren't making new episodes anymore
Yep, but that's just how it is. They had to move on to bigger and better things.
