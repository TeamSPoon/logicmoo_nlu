Do you like kids movies?
Yes, they are good for adults too.
I enjoy them also
I loved Frozen
Me too, I heard they were coming out with another one, but I don't know for sure
That would be great
Hopefully it would be as good as the first one
Exactly  I wonder what the plate would be on that one
I dont know they didn't leave anything where you think there would be a second one.
I know, we'll I still hope so anyway
Have you seen Trolls?
No but I really want to
Me too, I was going to see it in thesters, but I never got the chance
I heard it's really good
Me too, my kids want to see it really bad too
Did you like the movie home?
It was cute
It was okay, it's not a movie I would want to watch more than once
No me either
But it was good
