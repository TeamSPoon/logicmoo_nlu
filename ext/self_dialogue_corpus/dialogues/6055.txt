Do you know that they're remaking Mulan?
Yeah, I heard. Man I love the original Mulan!
It'll be great to have an actual Asian princess, bonus that it's not stereotypical.
Yes, I saw that the director finally decided to cast a Chinese actress in the principal role.
The movie won't have music though.
That's a travesty!
But hey, if Eddie Murphy is still playing Mushu, I'm happy.
That is one of the most iconic Disney roles ever!
That, plus the Genie in Aladdin!
Robin Williams, may he rest in peace.
