They are still a solid team, but that proved to be a big loss last year.
Yea, they really didn't have much of a leader on the field.
Yea, Marshawn set the tone my example.
He just went out and played really hard, didn't he?
Yea, he really did. He gave it his all on the field always.
Yea, he has always been a man of few words, but he always tries to compete.
Yea, I agree. Well Seattle lost that to Oakland now.
Yea, they did and Oakland should have a great team this year.
Yea, it is time that they make some noise in the AFC.
I agree and I truly think that they will this year.
Yea, there is no reason that they shouldn't.
Yea, they are pretty much stacked.
I agree and having a good quarterback tops everything.
Yea and theirs got his money so he should be ready to compete.
I agree. Sometimes the money could lead a player both ways.
Yea, it can, but I think Carr is self motivated.
Yea, its just too bad they had a tough injury last year.
Yea, that was really sad.
Yea, just when they were trending upward, their main star got hurt.
Yea, but injuries happen. He will be back this year ready to go.
