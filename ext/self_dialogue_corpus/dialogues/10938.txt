Who do you think will be MVP this year?
Not sure its up in the air.
Yeah you are right this was a strange year.
Either way, it will be someone deserving.
I think there are too many NHL awards.
The Lady Byng is embarassing.
Yeah it is, Martin St Louis used to win every year.
Hey man he was concerned for his fellow players.
He was as boring a player as you will find.
He was good for awhile.
Well, do you think the Golden Knights will have an MVP?
A team MVP!
Thats funny. I dont think they will either.
They may have some issues with management.
Why is that?
Gallant isnt that great of a coach
He did bomb out with Florida
Coudnt do anything with all that talent
Speaking of that how is Jagr still in the league?
Who knows!
