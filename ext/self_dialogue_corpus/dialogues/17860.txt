Do you like Metallia?
Heck yeah I do.  They are amazing.
I really liked Nothing Else Matters.
That was a pretty awesome song.
You know Metallica is just the apex of post 70's rock.
I know what you mean.
What about Enter the Sandman?
Great song.  That's one of my favorite songs to lift to.
It just has this drive of energy.
It's that heavy base and creepy part.
Yeah tell me about it.  Good for Halloween too.
When I think 90's rock it's Metallica and Nirvana.
Yeah both were just fantastic.
Yeah, like Smells Line Teen Spirit.
You know, technically they both started in the 80's.
Yeah, 87 for Nirvana and 81 for Metallica.
Awesome hard rock though.
Couldn't agree more.
Yeah, and yet another artist taken too soon.
I know.  Yet all the bad ones stay.
