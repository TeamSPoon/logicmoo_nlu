My granddaughters favorite Disney Movie is Sleeping Beauty.
Really? Thant was a good movie.
She love Princess Aurora and Prince Philip.
I loved those little fairy ladies, what were their names?
Flora Fauna and Merriweather.
They were so cute.
Yes they were.
It was pretty scary when Princess Aurora touched the spindle of the spinning wheel.
That was scary.
That was a good movie.
