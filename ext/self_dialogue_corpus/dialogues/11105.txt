What do you think of my new pants?
They look right on you.
Why do you say that?
They are. Is it hard to walk in those.
A little, but I like the way they look.
They do look nice. I like the rips over your knees.
There didn't come like that.
What happened?
As I was trying to put then on,I pulled them up fast and they tore like that.
Wow, they are poorly made.
Yes, but I like them.
Come to think of it, they do look nice.
I could look pass then looking tight. My girlfriend will like them.
Good luck
Thanks. What do you think of my shirt?
I like the country look on it. I just woke not tie it up in a knot.
Do you think my girl friend will like it?
No, torn pants and a tied up cowboy shirt. It's not  look your look with her.
I guess your right.
Do us both a favour.
