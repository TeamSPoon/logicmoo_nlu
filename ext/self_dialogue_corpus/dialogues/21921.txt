You want to see a movie this weekend?
Is there anything good out in theaters?
Nothing new, really. Hollywood sucks this year.
I agree. If everything is terrible, why would you ask?
Well, theres a local theater playing old classics on saturday!
Oh yeah? What kind of movies are we talking about?
This weekend is old anime!
I dont think I know any old anime. Sailor mooon?
No, silly. Studio ghibli films!
I havent seen those before.
Woah, you are missing out. They are amazing films that shaped the industry for sure!
Really? I've never heard of them.
Dude, we have to check this out on saturday. It'll change your life!
I guess so!
Castle in the sky, totoro, you have so much to catch up on.
Sounds like it, I'm down for whatever!
Its going to be a long weekend of watching movies.
Is anything playing on sunday?
Sunday is nothing but romantic comedies.
I'll sit that one out, thanks.
