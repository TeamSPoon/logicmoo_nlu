hey neighbor
Hi there
what are you grilling, smells great
Pork hops and corn on the cob
Hey whats that song your playing, I love it
Kaleo, way down we go
Wow, his voice is amazing, where from the south is he from, he sounds like he is from the bayou
No, he is actually from scottland I think
what other songs on on his album, I need to download some
no good, and all the pretty girls are also really good songs
I will have to go to itunes and get his album
I love that bluesy sound, I love Jeff Healy for that as well
Isnt he the blind guy from the movie roadhouse?
Yes, he is really amazing
His voice is really amazing
It makes my spine get the chills
mine too, he is very talented
I dont hear much about him since the movie
Come to think of it, no, your right
dinner is done, want some?
