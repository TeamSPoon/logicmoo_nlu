Hey can you smell that? It's in the air Fall is almost here and Football is in the air...Can you feel it?
Oh yeah, I can feel it, the NFL train is near, all day Sunday, Sunday Night, Monday Night and don't forget Thursday's.
I love it all also. What is your favorite night?
Monday Nights.
Really?
Yes, there is just something about continuing football from Sunday to Monday. I think the NFL got it right this time.
What do you think about the signature songs for these nights?
they're really cool, I look forward to who's singing the new song every season.
Do you know which teams will be playing the first Monday night game?
I am not sure, I need to check my NFL schedule.
Are there any rookie players your looking forward to watching?
I want to see what the rookie Running Back James Conner drafted by the Steelers heard he was a beast in college.
I'll keep an eye out for him. They also have a new quarterback Dobbs?
Yeah, he has a great arm they could use a replacement I think Ben is getting old and slow.
Boy, I would love to see the Steelers win another SuperBowl.
If the rookie can show up Ben then they may get to the playoffs, not the Superbowl.
Wishing thinking on my part, but the NFL is so unpredictable at times.
You are right teams that made it to the playoff one year may not make it back there for years.
I love me some football, there's nothing better than the NFL..
You could not have said it better...
