What was the most pleasant surprise last year?
What do you mean?  Movie-wise.
Yes, sorry for not being specific.
I would actually say Hacksaw Ridge.
I heard that was really good!
It really was.  What was surprising is I didn't even know Mel Gibson directed it?
Really?
Yeah!  He didn't slap his name all over the promos for it.
Well, with some of his recent publicity, that makes sense.
Right.  Was probably a smart move overall.
But the movie itself you liked?
It was beautifully shot.  Great war scenes throughout and great acting.
I heard Andrew Garfield was quite good.
Yeah, he showed some pretty serious acting chops.
And it was based on a true story, right?
Yes.  Not sure how much was fiction vs. real, but based on one.
I'll have to give it a shot.  I love a good war movie.
I'll loan you my copy if you want.
Is it kid appropriate?
No.  Wait until they are a teenager for this one.
