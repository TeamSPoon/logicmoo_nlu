I'm afraid to go out on the boat this weekend.
Why's that?
I just watched Jaws on Netflix.
Oh boy.  That wasn't a smart idea.
I'm not sure what's more scary: the shark or the music.
Definitely the music.  That's a classic theme.
But so simple.  It's a very simplistic piece of music
And uber-effective.  It's too bad the sequels were so poor.
They made sequels?
Forget I said anything.  They're not worth the time.
