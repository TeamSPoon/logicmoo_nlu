What's that tattoo on your wrist?
It's the symbol for The Red Hot Chili Peppers band.
That's cool. Chili Peppers are an awesome band.
One of the band members has this symbol tattooed on his arm, and it's thir symbol on a lot of their cds, so I had it tattoed on my wrist.
You must really love that band.
Yeah, I listened to them all the time when I was in college in the 90s, and their music really helped me get through some crazy times.
Let me guess- that song Under The Bridge?
I love the opening guitar part on that song, and sometimes in college I did feel really lonely.
They have a lot of good sing along songs.
I know, I probably kept a lot of my dorm room mates up singing along at night while I was studying!
