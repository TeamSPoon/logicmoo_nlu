This upcoming NFL season should be awesome!
I can not wait to watch my Colts have a great year!
Do you have high expectations for them this year?
I sure do, I think Andrew Luck will really have a strong season.
He has all of the physical tools to be great, that is for sure.
The bad thing for him has been the lack of consistency among the offensive line.
Yea, this year may be the best line that he has played behind in his career.
I am excited about Le'Raven Clark at right tackle. He seems to be a good one.
He is young still, but he certainly showed potential last year.
Yea, hopefully our line can at least stay together and avoid serious injuries this year.
Playing behind a bad offensive line will make even the best quarterbacks look bad.
That is true, I feel that it is the most important unit that there is in football.
I agree with you on that one. The offensive line is crucial for any team to be successful.
What team are you most excited to see this upcoming season?
I have always been a big fan of the Green Bay Packers. So I can not wait to see what they will do this year.
Arron Rodgers may be the best quarterback in the entire league.
I sure think that he is, we are so close to being a great team that it drives me crazy!
What do you think is missing?
I really wished we could improve on the defensive side of the ball a little to be honest with you.
That would probably do it because the offense is in control for years to come with Rodgers running the show.
