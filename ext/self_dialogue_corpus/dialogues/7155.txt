hey i want to get better at cooking but dont want to go back to school
all you got to do is watch the movie ratatouille
im being serious and this is what you propose?
yes because i am being serious also
and how is watching a disney movie going to help?
well in the movie the rat had a strong desire to cook and even though he was looked down upon for being a rat he never gave up
so how does that apply to me?
well you love cooking so find it within yourself to get the motivation to teach yourself to cook so you can become great like ratatouille.
well when you put it like that it sounds promising
of course it does, your welcome now go be the best chef you can be
