What types of songs did you like that the Beatles played.
Their early songs were mostly love songs like "She Loves You"
Then as time went on there were ballads like "Yellow Submarine" and others
They went from mostly love songs to more social and songs of rebellion, mostly covert in nature.
The worst was when the madman Charles Manson thought that the Beatles album Abbey Road was a call to a violent revolution and he started his horror show.
It was awful, the music was all about peace and loving one another, like in "Hey Jude"
They became a little bizarre with some of their impressions from drug use, like "Yellow Submarine"  as they must have been really stoned to write that song.
It was too bad that success started to break them up. creative differences and ideas and the like.
I loved songs like "Yesterday"  It has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written.
I agree, they had such a wide range of talents and songs, many still sung today, most highest selling of all time i think.
