Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Luke Skywalker, who's isnt?
Well thats a very expected answer, but mine is Obi Wan Kinobi.
Why?! He just dies and doesn't really do anything useful.
He was very useful actually.
Oh, how so?
Well if it weren't for him Anakin would have never turned into Darth Vader.
Doesn't that kind of prove my point?
No, because with Vader there is no major antagonist.
That still doesn't make him useful.
