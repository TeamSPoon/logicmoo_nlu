I know you like heavy metal music, and you like science fiction, have you ever heard of Ayreon?
No, I haven't actually what kind of music are they?
Well Aryeon is a musical project headed up by one guy who creates all the music and tells a story with each album.
Oh, so it's like a concept album?
Yes, there's different vocalists playing different characters and each album plays out like a rock opera or a musical.
And I assume the storyline has to do with science fiction?
Yes it does.  The creator of the project has created a vast storyline which spans mutliple albums.
This is really interesting.
Yes it is, the stories encompass almost anything you can imagine, from time travel, to time dilation, and even suspended animation.
Wow, this is almost like everything I love all wrapped up in a single package.
Exactly.  Each album plays out like a movie.  All you have to do is sit down, play the album on and let the whole story line surround you.
That sounds really interesting.
It is actually.  The interesting thing is it's almost like a book in that the story is being told and you're the one who imagines the scenario.
Unlike watching a movie where everything is right there in front of you.
Exactly.  You can create your own version of the story apart from everyone else's.
I really like that.  To me it seems as if doing that can stir up really interesting conversations within a group of fans.
Yes.  I've had interesting conversations already with a few people, you should check out the albums, who knows, you and I could have some interesting conversations as well.
Wow, I actually look forward to doing that.
Is there an album you recommend I try out first?
Actually yes, since the Ayreon records weren't released chronologically, like the Star Wars movies, I recommend you check out the 8th album first as it's the prequel to the entire story.
