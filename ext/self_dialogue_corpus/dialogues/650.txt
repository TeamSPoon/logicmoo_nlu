Hey, what do you think about football?
I love football!
Oh, really?
Yea I love watching big men collide with eachother
That's a little different...
They're so big and strong and...
A bit of a different opinion...
Their tight butts working it hard!
Dude...
What?  They're so hot!
Okay.. but do you like the game itself?
Sure!  As long as one of my boys are playing!
Your boys?
Like Payton Manning!
Oh, he's a great player!  One of the best QBs!
Oh I totally agree!
Did you see the last game with...
He just has the cutest butt!

Oh, maybe so!
