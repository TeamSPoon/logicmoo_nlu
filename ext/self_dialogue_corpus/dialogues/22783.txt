Have you seen despicable me?
Yes, I loved it.
Steve carell is so good as the voice of gru.
Totally the perfect casting.
I love the journey the Gru character takes, so touching.
I think that is one reason it was so popular.Lovable  guy.
The minions are also crowd pleasers.
They are and so funny.
Who would have thought little yellow guys you have barely any idea of what they are saying would go over so well?
Crazy idea but works so well.
It certainly does. Have you seen the sequel?
Despicable me 2, yep, love it too.
I feel it's one actually good sequel.
I love the start with gru at the party especially as the fairy.
That was cute. Again just makes him so lovable.
The daughters facial expressions are so adorable and lovable too.
Agreed. the youngest is the cutest.
Agnes is the name of the youngest I believe. She is cute.
Common to make the youngest the cutest.
It is that way often, the oldest is usually the most responsible, or at least portrayed that way in films.
