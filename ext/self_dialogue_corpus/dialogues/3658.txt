Do you like thriller movies?
I guess so.  Aren't they kind of suspenseful?
Yes I think thriller and suspense are synonymous.
I like Alfred Hitchcock.
He was the thriller master.
My favorite Hitchcock thriller is Psycho.
I like the Birds.
That is good too.  It made me hate birds for awhile.
Another good old thriller os Murder on the Orient Express.
I will have to check that out.
