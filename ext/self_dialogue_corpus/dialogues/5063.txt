LOOKS LIKE THE CUBBIES WILL WIN ANOTHER WORLD SERIES THIS YEAR
YEP THEY ARE LOOKING STRONG ESPECIALLY THE PITCHERS
RIZZO IS HITTING LIKE MICKEY MANTLE TOO.
HAHA I AGREE GOOD THING THEY TRADED FOR HIM
PLUS JOE MADDEN IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS MOTIVATING ALL THE PLAYERS.
YEP WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HIM AS A MANAGER
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PITCHING STAFF?
I THINK THEY WILL HOLD UP ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE GOOD RELIEF PITCHERS.
I AGREE WE HAVE A VERY VERSATILE PITCHING STAFF.
YEP PLUS OUR STARTING PITCHERS ARE THE BEST IN THE MAJORS.
YEP PLUS I LOVE HOW OUR HITTERS ARE NOT ONLY GOOD HITTERS BUT FAST ON THE BASE PATHS.
YEP WE WILL STEAL OVER 200 BASES THIS YEAR.
I AGREE WE GOT THIS.
HAHA ITS NICE TO BE A CUB FAN.
FOR SURE ITS BETTER THAN BEING A WHITE SOX FAN.
HAHA PLUS WE GOT THE BEST FIELD IN WRIGLEY.
YES NO MORE 100 YEAR WAITS FOR THE NEXT CHAMPIONSHIP.
AS LONG AS WE STICK TOGETHER WE WILL BE A GREAT TEAM
OK LETS CHAT AGAIN SOON ABOUT GOING TO A GAME NEXT WEEK.
