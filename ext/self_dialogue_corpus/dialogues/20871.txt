Have you watched Patriot's Day?
The Mark Wahlberg and John Goodman movie about the Boston marathon bombing?
That's the movie. I watched it recently and really liked it.
I did see it awhile back in theaters when it was still out. I thought they did a really good job of showing us how that event happened as well as the investigations leading up to the findings on the bombers.
I thought it was so suspenseful and touching for a devastating movie based on real events.
I hated Kevin Bacon's character in that movie at the start, he seem like such a know it all as the lead investigator.
I know, I almost forgot Kevin Bacon was in it. Remember when Kevin Bacon was in every movie?
I know, that's where the sixth degrees of separation stuff from Kevin Bacon was from.
I really liked how they gave tribute to the victims and survivors. Some of those scenes were so painful but powerful.
Mark was really good in this movie as the cop that loved his city so much.
This was really such a pro Boston movie, but in a good way, and one that made you feel pride for your country seeing the city band together.
It was a strong movie. Surprisingly pretty action packed too.
That scene in the neighborhood with the shoot out as they trapped one of the bombers was so intense and suspenseful.
The explosions and gun shots definitely sounded really realistic.
Oh did you catch the cameo from Supergirl?
What do you mean Supergirl?
The main bomber, the older one, his wife with the child, that was Melissa Benoist, also known as Supergirl.
Wait, Melissa Benoist was in this movie?
Yes! She was the bombers wife, I was mind blown when they interrogated her out of the mask and hood. I had no idea it was going to be her. The real life person she played was also similar to her.
Wow, I didn't even recognize her!
