The Redskins are going to own this year.
That's a bold statement.
Just a fact.  This is their year.
Explain what leads you to believe this.
For one, they've got the best QB in the league.
You're a funny guy, aren't you.
I'm telling you, Kirk Cousins is the future.
He's a decent QB, but the best?  You're crazy.
Name three quarterbacks better than him?
Three?  I'll give you five.  Rogers, Brady, Prescott, Ryan, Wilson...
Those guys are all overrated.
Yeah, okay.  You're being such a homer.
Look at what Cousins did last year with nothing.
What do you mean nothing?  Their OL was okay.
But they had no receiving help.
No, they had some.  They went and drafted a billion this year I think.
That's because guys like Crowder are good, but not #1's.
Yeah, but not sure if they've got anybody that puts fear in defenses.
Well, just saying, they are going to surprise this year.
Maybe.  I would be surprised if they surprise me!
