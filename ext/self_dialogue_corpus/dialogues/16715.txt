Hey, do you like punk music?
Oh yeah I do!  Do you have any favorite bands?
Yep, I have SO MANY that I absolutely love.  The ones I think are the best are The Dead Kennedys, FEAR, D. I., The Germs, & The Sex Pistols.
Oh wow, you definitely have to include the Pistols in any collection!
No joke!  They are the "grandfathers" of the genera!
I have to say that The Dead Kennedys are my favorite out of all of the ones you listed though.
Why do you like them above all of the others?
Well, because of the political stance that the band took.  They always had the best lyrics to go with the climate.
What do you think they'd say about the current state of affairs??
Oh, I'm pretty sure that Biafra would totally slam everyone!
Were you ever able to see them in concert?
No, not the whole band.  I was just able to see Jello Biafra doing spoken word.
Which other punk bands do you listen to?
Well, I like FEAR too.
Oh, have you ever seen them live?
Yeah, I sure did!  Had to drive all the way out to Chicago to see them.
Well, how was the concert?
It was great!  The venue was small enough that you really got to hear the music & actually SEE the band playing!
I wish that there were bands now that had the same sound as the 70's & 80's punk bands.
Me too, but there could always be some miracle band in the future that would bring that sound back!
