Do you remember the last time the Sixers made the finals?
No, they've always been irrelevant.
Sort of--they mostly are, but during the AI years they were decent.
Okay. And?
Remember when they were in the finals against the Lakers?
That was way back in the mid 90's?
No, 2001.
Oh, feels forever. Hahaha
Very funny. Anyway...
Did you have a point?
Well, I saw AI on TV and was just remembering the finals.
What was so interesting about them?
Well, when the Sixers won, it was by just a couple of points. But their losses were blowouts.
Seriously?
Yeah, AI scored almost 50 and the Sixers won in overtime by 6.
What about the other 4 games?
They lost 98-89, 96-91, 100-86, and 108-98.
Those aren't blowouts.
I guess they just seemed like it at the time.
Might just be size: tiny AI vs huge Kobe and Shaq.
