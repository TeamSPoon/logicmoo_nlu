Who do you prefer: NSYNC or Backstreet Boys?
Definitely the Backstreet Boys.
Really? Aside from I Want It That Way, all of their songs are terrible.
I really enjoyed Quit Playing Games (With My Heart), Everybody (Backstreet's Back), and Larger Than Life.
I forgot about Larger Than Life. That was a good song too I guess.
Yeah. So why are you so adamant about NSYNC being better?
Aside from the greatness that was the album No Strings Attached, I think Justin Timberlake was far and away the most talented person in either boy band.
I think that is undeniable, but I would say that Justin Timberlake's best work came later during his solo career.
Very true. I think that Cry Me A River is the best breakup song ever recorded.
Really? I much preferred his song What Goes Around...Comes Around.
I just found it too much of a copy of Cry Me A River to be honest.
To each their own. Did you know the rumor that Cry Me A River was reportedly about Timberlake's Relationship with Britney Spears?
No, although that does make sense now that you mention it. Speaking of Britney Spears, what has she been up to recently?
Aside from a residency in Las Vegas, she released some new music last year.
Anything that I might recognize?
She released the song Make Me..., which featured G-Eazy.
I think that I know who G-Eazy is. He has that song Me, Myself & I, right?
Yeah, I really the girl who sings the chorus to that song. Who is she again?
Bebe Rexha.
That's the name. I really like her single I Got You.
