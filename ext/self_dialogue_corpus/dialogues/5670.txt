Which is your favorite classic Disney princess movie, Cinderella or Snow White?
I think definitely Cinderella.
What about the dwarves in Snow White, though? They're so funny!
Yes, but I love the mice that help make Cinderella's dress.
Okay, they were pretty great.
Plus there's the romantic dance at the ball!
Yes, but Snow White's prince gets to wake her up and save her life.
That's true, and the evil witch is a great Disney villain.
Cinderella gets a great dress, though!
And she gets to wear the glass slippers. That's my favorite part!
