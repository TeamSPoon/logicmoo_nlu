What do you think of the latin music movement in America right now?
What do you mean?
Well popular music is incorporating Latin base lines and even latin rap
You mean like Justin Beiber's Despacito?
Yeah. And Pitbull, and that latin base line you hear in Despacito is becoming more popular.
Huh.  I didn't realize that was Latin.
Yep, it's interesting.
Why do you think it's happening?
Well, latin music is by nature easy to dance to and good for parties.
Yeah I've heard a lot of these songs in dance settings. But America has always liked to dance.
That you are right. The Latin movement has always been around, take Enrique Iglesias as asn example.
Oh! I love his song Bailando.
Yeah that was a great song. It was popular like 5 years ago. But now we're seeing latin hits every year.
Intersting. You think this trend will continue
Yeah. I think as American radio becomes more supportive of all cultures, latin music will make it to the top?
You think latin music is the best music--
DESPACITOOOOO.
I'll take that as a yes.
I love it man. I hope it continues.
Sure, sure.
