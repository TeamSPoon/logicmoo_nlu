Have you seen any awesome thrillers lately? I know you've always got the know!
Ummm, let me think for a moment... I did see the Fate of the Furious.
Oh! Vin Diesel! I like!
Yeah, man, it was awesome.
I'm sure they've upped the stunts in this one.
They did. There are some crazy parts. I won't spoil it for you though!
Just tell me... Will I be amazed?
Oh, definitely. It's just amazing.
Would you see it again? I know you're a fan of The Rock, right?
I am indeed! Hit me up if you do end up going, for sure.
