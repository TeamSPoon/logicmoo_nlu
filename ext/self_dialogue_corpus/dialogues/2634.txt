It is almost football season!
I know! I love drinking and watching games on the weekend.
What network do you like watching the best?
I prefer Fox. They have better graphics over CBS.
NBC is my least favorite but they have the late games so I don't watch much anyways.
Do you play Fantasy football?
I am in a couple leagues at work.
I am having trouble deciding on who I should draft for my QB.
You have to get a strong QB like Tom Brady or Drew Brees.
Good suggestion but those guys are getting old.
You can gurantee they will get a few touchdowns each game.
Brady looks better tham ever.
True but Drew Brees is hanging in there with him. Each year the media tries to count him out.
It helps when you have great receivers. I thought it was interesting the Saints picked up Ted Ginn Jr.
That guy is really fast but can't catch a ball.
He has the worst butter fingers.
Hopefully he will just be a distraction for the other Saints receivers to make the plays.
I didn't think about it like that. Good point.
Didn't the Saints trade away Brandin Cooks.
I think you are right. Not sure where he ended up.
