Who do you think is the best band of all time?
That's easy, The Rolling Stones.
Really? You think they're better than the Beatles?
I know some people would think it's a horrible thing to say, but I think the Stones were better.
But you're not denying that the Beatles were great?
No, of course not. But I'd list the Who right up there with them.
You know who else I would put right up there with them?
That was a bad pun. Who?
Van Halen, that's who.
With Sammy Hagar?
No, of course not. With David Lee Roth.
Well if you include Van Halen, you have to include KISS.
No argument there. And I'd include Metallica.
I agree with Metallica. And AC/DC.
Yes, they deserve to be included. Pink Floyd should be on the list.
I'm not sure about that one.
Pink Floyd changed music forever.
Okay, I'll agree with Pink Floyd. But if you include them, it seems like Nirvana should be on the list.
Nirvana wasn't around long enough to make the list of best bands of all time.
They changed music forever.
