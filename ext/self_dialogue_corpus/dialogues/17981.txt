got a favorite eminem album
probably the marshall mathers lp
that album was so dark
everything about it was moody and dark
he just got famous and made that album
his mindset was criminal minded
he talked about violence, drugs and fame constantly
he even kinda threatened dr dre.
and dr dre was his savior pretty much
yeah, dre made him famous
eminem just didnt care during those days
he said whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted
he got sued constantly
stan was such an amazing song too
the storytelling was so unique
not many artists did the letter raps as good as he did
theres a reason its a hip hop classic
and now stan is in the dictionary
as someone who is a major obsessive fan, right?
yup.  a diehard
