Hey, so what do you think of Britney Spears?
Oh wow, she was one of my favorites back in the early 2000's!
Yeah I loved her when she first came out, too!  She had such style and her hits were great.
Like the original Hit Me Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did it Again?
Yes, those were amazing.  I loved the videos, too!
Yeah, she had some great dance moves.  It was such a clean pop sound with those songs.
Yeah, I didn't like her subsequent stuff as much though.
Well in 2007 she really started to go downhill.  I think she released her fifth album then but her personal life was a mess.
Yeah, I think it distracted from her music a lot.  She had all sorts of nonsense going on.
Definitely, and then Circus and Femme Fatale were her sixth and seventh albums.  I thought they were a flop.
I didn't like them at all either.  To me, her original hits were really what made her a success.
Yes, I agree.  Toxic was a great song, though.
That was from In The Zone, right?  Her fourth album?
Yes, it was.  It was reminiscent of some of her original music.
Yeah, I think that was before she started to go downhill.
It's really a shame.  She was a great musician.
Well we all have to grow up someday.  She was kinda outgrowing the pop industry.
That's true, but look at people like Cher.  They stuck around much longer.
Well Cher was in a different league than Britney Spears.
I guess you're right.  They don't compare.
