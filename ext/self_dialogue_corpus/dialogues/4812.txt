Did you see the Cardinals game on Wednesday?
Yeah, that was a tough loss.
I know!  They have been doing so well lately.  It kind of derailed them.
Yeah, they will bounce back tonight against the Giants though
I agree. They started off very rocky, but they are turning things around.
That they are.  Aren't they leading the Central right now
I believe so.  But I would have to check.
I honestly don't care who is leading the Central as long as it isn't the Cubs.
I know right?  They win 1 World Series in over 100 years and suddenly they have millions of fans!
Yeah, bandwagon fans at best.
Right?  Did you see the Reds troll them?
I saw that video, that was great.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.
Me either!
Who do you have going for it all this year.
Well in the AL the Yankees are very dominate, as much as I hate to say it.  NL is a complete toss up, but it is still early.
Yeah I don't think the Yankees will stay this strong.
Me either, but who knows, it is very early in the season.  Ask me again after the All-Star Break.
I can do that.  You going to any games this year?
I have tickets to a few this year, what about you?
Nah, unless you have an extra ticket!
