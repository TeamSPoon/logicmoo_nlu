You remember Master P?
Yeah, I remember his music played all the time in the club like fifteen years ago.
Wasn't he from New Orleans?
Yeah, I think he was.  He was associated with a lot of the acts from down there.
Did you have any of his CDs?
I don't remember, but I had one of the 504 Boyz.
They were associated with him, right.
Yeah, I don't know if he started them or produced for him.
They might have been on his label.
Yeah, probably so.
