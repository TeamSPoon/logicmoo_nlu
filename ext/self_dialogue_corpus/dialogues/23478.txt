Isn't Daniel Day Lewis a great actor?
He is pretty amazing.
I heard he is a method actor.
What does that mean?
He takes special care in getting ready for roles and really dives into them.
Did he do this when he played Lincoln?
He did! I heard he wouldn't respond to his real name.
That is dedication.
It totally is. He was rewarded for it too.
How so? Did he win any awards?
I think he did. Plus, he was paid handsomely for the role.
Actors like him probably make so much money.
Yes, but I think they love the craft too.
They probably do. It seems like a fun job.
For someone like him though, I don't think it is fun.
What does that mean?
He views it as hard work and does his very best.
I remember him in Gangs of New York.
He probably used method acting for that too.
It showed. His performance was incredible.
