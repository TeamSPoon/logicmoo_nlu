What did you think of the Clone Wars?
That was episode two, right?
I liked the romance aspect of it.
Between Anakin and Padme?
Yes, I liked the way he always loved her.
You did not think it was gross Padme was so much older than him?
She was not that much older than him.
I think four years, but she knew him as a kid.
But, she was young then too. They had always loved each other, just not in the same sense.
I wish they would have let her live.
