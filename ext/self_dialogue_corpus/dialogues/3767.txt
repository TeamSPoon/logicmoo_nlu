Did you watch 'The Visit' yet like I told you to?
Yes, I watched it last weekend with a friend.
Was it as good as I said it would be?
I actually loved it, and I appreciate you recommending it.
I hadn't seen an M. Night Shyamalan that I liked in years.
Yes, he seems to be up and down with his movies.
I either love his stuff or I hate it, and there's no middle ground.
It's funny because I agree completely.
Did you get fooled by the grandparents in the movie?
Well I knew something strange was going on, but I couldn't put my finger on what.
