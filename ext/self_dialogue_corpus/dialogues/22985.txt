What is Denzel Washington's greatest movie role, would you say?
Oh man. So many great ones.
He's definitely one of the better actors of the past 30 years or so. But what's #1 for you?
Right off the top of my head, gotta say Malcolm X.
Yep, that was an epic performance.
But amazingly that's not a movie he won an Oscar for.
Which goes to show that the Academy gets it wrong sometimes.
His performance in Glory was amazing too. Also, his performance in The Hurricane.
He was great in Glory, but I don't remember seeing The Hurricane.
You missed out! He plays a former boxer who is unjustly sentenced to prison for murder.
Sounds gritty!
It's a very soulful, raw performance.
He won the Oscar for his role in Training Day.
Honestly, I feel like he's been better in other movies.
Then why do you think he won there.
I think to some extent it was a make up award.
Like paying him back for times when he should have won but didn't?
Exactly.
Well, if there's an actor that deserved a make up award, it's Denzel.
For sure, he's top tier!
