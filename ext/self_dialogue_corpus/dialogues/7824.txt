I'm not a big Harry Potter fan.
I don't really get the hype either.
I have seen a couple of the films, but they don't do much for me.
Me either.
I did like Alan Rickman's character.
Yes, he straddles the line between good and bad very well.
It seems as though movies and tv shows about magic are very popular these days.
Yes, JK Rowling really tapped into something there with the Harry Potter series.
I have to confess it might be kind of fun to go to a school like Hogwartz.
It would be fun to learn spells and incantations, if they were real.
