I was just telling my daughter about an old movie I loved to watch.
Which movie is that?
Somewhere in Time.
With Jane Seymour?
Yes and Christopher Reeve.
I forgot about that movie. Haven't heard about that in a long time.
She saw my DVD and was making fun of me. It's a love story.
Yes, but a neat concept for a movie back then.
Yes, I really liked it. Jane Seymour is beautiful.
Yes she still is, even with age.
It is a shame what happened with Christopher Reeve.
Yes it was. He was a good actor and he still stayed positive afterwards too.
Yes he did. He was pretty good in the Superman movies.
Yes he was.
Hard to believe that movie is actually thrity seven years old.
Really, it came out that long ago?
Yes. They used to play it on T.V all the time. When they stopped I bought the DVD.
I remember flipping channels and I would see it.
I think people forgot that film.
Me too.
