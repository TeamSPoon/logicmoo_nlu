Do you remember the movie Big?
The one with Tom Hanks?
Yeah, did you see it?
Oh, I used to watch that all the time.
I loved that movie!
What was your favorite part?
I liked the whole part of the kid being an adult and doing what he wanted.
Any parts in particular?
I liked when the girl was hitting on him and he invited her to a slumber party.
Oh, that was memorable.
