How did you feel about De La Soul?
I think they were OK not very big.
I think they were very influential in terms of hip hop.
Yeah I was not that big into them because I think they lacked a direction.
I think De La Soul is Dead was a superb album.
I didnt hear it in the tracks, I thought they were bland.
No way the artistic abilities in that album were second to none.
And what about the preceeding album?
3 Feet High and Rising was mediocre.
Most fans would argue your logic is flawed.
