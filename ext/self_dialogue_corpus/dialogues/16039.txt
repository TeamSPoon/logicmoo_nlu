Do you watch the voice?
Yes its a great show
My favorite part is when the coaches perform with their team
I love that part too
Whats your favorite part
I love the auditions
Thats a fun part too
I enjoy how the coaches cant see them
Me too
It makes them focus on their voice
Yes they arent distracted by anything else
I hope this next season is good me too
I wonder how jennifer hudson is
Me too
I hope she does good
Miley was okay the last time
Shes so pretty
She is but i hate her outfits
They do take away from her prettiness
I wish they could see that
