Guess what may be back in fashion this spring and summer, Sue.
I don't know.
It's a trend of the eighties that no one really fought to keep.
Which one is that? There were so many back then.
Shoulder pads. They are back in style.
Shoulder pads. Give me a break.
I'm serious but these are the boxy long kind.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Look at this article in the Cosmopolitan. See for yourself.
The boxy shapes seen on the Balenciaga catwalk are likely to be too extreme for us mere muggles but more relaxed shapes at Chanel and Marni gave an insight into how we could take on the trend, too.
What did I tell you?
Just because some fashion designer had models walking the catwalk with these huge, boxy shoulders, that does not mean that is what is in.
You never know.
Look at the part about the sheer fabrics. Who is going to walk around in public with sheer pants on?
Won't be me.
Me neither.
I think these designers are just throwing things up in the air and waiting to see which one catches on.
You think?
I do would love to have that boxy shoulder jacket in the picture.
If I saw you walking down the street dressed like that, I would go the other way.
