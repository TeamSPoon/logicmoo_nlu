Do you prefer to watch horror movies at home or the theater?
I like to watch them at home.
Same I don't want to embarrass myself in front of other people.
At home I can scream as much as I like.
Do you like horror movies that have comedy?
Yes because it lightens the mood.
That's why I liked the movie "Get Out" so much it was funny and scary.
I also like strictly horror movies like "It Follows".
I like the genre has a whole.
Yes I enjoy the horror genre as well.
