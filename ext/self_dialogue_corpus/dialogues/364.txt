I'm so excited to see Logan
me too, i hear this is the last one with hugh jackman in it
oh wow. he made a really good wolverine
totally. I love seeing him shred up bad guys
wolverine is my favorite marvel character, so this will be bitter sweet
I hear there are some cool chase scenes in it, hopefully it lives up to the hype
the reviews have been pretty good, so i'm hopeful
yeah, a lot of these super hero movies can be pretty forgettable
the marvel movie universe has gotten pretty big
yep, its getting hard to keep track of!
