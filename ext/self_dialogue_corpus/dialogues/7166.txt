Did you used to watch the Disney Channel original movies? They usually did one each month.
I did and most of them were great. I wish they would put more out on DVD.
Smart House got released.
Really? Any others?
Wish Upon a Star and the original Seventeen Again.
I thought that was originally one of those but it got remade.
It originally had the twins from Sister/Sister.
That's right. I saw it once.
I want the Zenon ones to be released.
I'd buy those for sure.
