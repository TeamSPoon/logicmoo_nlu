Alright we discussed Julio Jones and Odell Beckham Jr. but where does Antonio Brown fall into this?
Antonio Brown I would have right there with Julio Jones.
In my opinion I think Antonio Brown is a better wide receiver. He's a lot more dynamic on the field.
I think they're tied in talents and ability and I don't think many will argue one is far better than the other they're both the top wide receivers today.
The Pittsburgh Steelers are always so consistent year in and year out.
They really are except they can't seem to avoid the big injury.
You mean the Big Ben injuries.
Yeah Ben Roethlisberger is so tough but he always falls to unfortunate injuries that dampens their hopes.
Ben is a top quarterback in this league, he's a Superbowl champ. He has awesome weapons on the offense and the Steelers always seem to reload their offense for him every year.
What's the current word on Le'veon Bell?
He's still holding out and there's the contract situation going on.
I hope they work that out because the Steelers can't afford to lose Le'veon Bell.
I agree. I can't see the Steelers not making it work. Bell is too valuable for them to not go after.
Imagine if Bell went to the Ravens.
That would be heartbreaking for all the Steeler fans. He would go to one of their most hated rivals.
Do you think the Steelers can challenge the Patriots this year?
I think they can if they get Bell back!
Big Ben needs to stay healthy too and Antonio Brown too.
I really enjoy Steeler games because of the action and offensive excitement. It wouldn't be the same if Bell left.
I'm hoping he stays! We'll see in time.
