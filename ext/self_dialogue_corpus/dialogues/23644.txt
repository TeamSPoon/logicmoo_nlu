Are you excited for the new Wonder Woman movie tomorrow?
Sort of.
Why not ecstatic? You love superhero movies.
I'm honestly just not a big fan of DC comics adaptations.
You're just sexist and can't handle a female superhero.
That's not even remotely true.
I know, I'm kidding.
I'm interested, thought, because the reviews are outstanding.
Are you going to see it in the theaters or wait for redbox?
Not sure.
Did you hear about the women-only showing?
No, what's that?
There's a theater that's screening Wonder Woman just for women.
No men are allowed?
Right.
Now THAT'S sexist.
True, but they deserve to do it.
True, let women celebrate a woman superhero.
Besides, it was probably just a handful of guys.
Yeah, the news likes to blow things out of proportion.
