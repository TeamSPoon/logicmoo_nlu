What do you think about the Cincinnati Reds this year?
Not sure yet.
They are really young.  I think they might be decent.
Ya, they have some growing up to do but I agree they could make a run.
They are really swinging the bats well.
Ya they have to ride the hot offense while they can.  There pitching is not very good.
That is true.
It worries me as the season goes on.
I agree, they might need to make a trade to bolster there rotation.
Or maybe they will get Homer Bailey and Anthony Descalfani back.
Yes.  That would be a major boost for the team.
If they get those two guys back there rotation becomes a lot better.
Yes it does.   They could move two current starters to the minors.
If they do that then there team would be more complete for sure.
They just have to keep hitting the ball well and get decent pitching.
I agree.   Think they can make the playoffs?
Maybe.  They might be a year or two away from that.
True, but they are definitely turning the corner.
I agree.   There manager is doing a great job.
Yes he is.  Bryan Price is proving to be a good manager.
