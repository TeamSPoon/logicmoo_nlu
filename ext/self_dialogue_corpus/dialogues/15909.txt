So, what David Bowie albums do you think are the best?
Wow, that's a difficult question because his discography has no real obvious high point.
Okay, well, let's go chronologically, starting with the first best one.
Well, a lot of people like "Hunky Dory," which has these sort of charming and whimsical pop songs on it, released in 1971.
What about when the Bowie we think of today really emerged, or came into being?
Well, "The Man Who Sold the World" actually came out the previous year, but it's a much harder rock album with sci-fi themes.
Sounds like Bowie was getting into the Ziggy Stardust character with that one...
Yeah, and Bowie embodied the Ziggy Stardust character on the album of that name, and "Aladdin Sane," both of which have awesome guitar work by Mick Ronson.
Then Bowie went and did a 180 and put out a soul album, right?
Yeah, the 1974 "Young Americans," which I'm not overly fond of aside from the title track.
And I heard there is something called the Berlin Trilogy -- what is that?
A series of three albums -- "Low," "Heroes," and "Lodger" -- that Bowie recorded with Brian Eno between 1977 and 1979.
I've heard a lot about those albums; do you like them?
Yes, they would be my favorite of Bowie's because they mix pop music, electronic instrumentation, ambient soundscapes, and other cool things very creatively.
So when do we get that '80s Bowie that I remember seeing on MTV as a child?
That would be circa "Let's Dance," which came out in 1983. A lot of people think his career kind of tanked by that point, but I find it very enjoyable.
But I know Bowie himself has said he's kind of embarrassed of his 1980s attempt to be a big pop star in the MTV/New Romantic era.
Well, for someone who made such difficult art, to suddenly take a swing towards accessibility maybe felt like a step backwards.
So which one is your favorite, out of them all?
I would have to go with "Low," from 1977, because it's so well-crafted and immersive.
