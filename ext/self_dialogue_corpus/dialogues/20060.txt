Have you seen Get Out yet?
No I havent, is it good?
I am going to watch it tonight.
I am interested in knowing where it goes.
Well its a horror suspense type of deal.
I think its interesting that Jordan Peele wrote it.
Whys that?
Well for startes hes a comedian
Yeah but what should that mean?
That he doesnt go into those kinds of films.
Thats a double standard for Hollwood.
How so?
Jim Carey has done many different films.
So has Steve Carrell.
Exactly, thats why you cant say that.
Well acting and directing or writing are two different things.
I think a creative mind is a creative mind no matter how you spell it.
Thats true guess I am narrow minded.
Well dont be, Peele obviously has talent.
Which is why I think this movie is going to be great.
