Did you ever listen to Kanye?
Who has not?
Some people are turned off by his beliefs.
I mean yeah he sounds like a jackass but I dont fault him for that.
Golddigger is a well oiled song.
Yeah he knows how to lay catchy hooks
What album do you think is his best
I loved Late Registration
For me it was the college dropout.
Thats another great one that i can listen to from front to back.
