Do you want to come with me?
Where are you going?
"Under da sea, man"
That is funny, I love that song. Sebastian is one of my favorite characters.
I think he's in mostly everybody's top ten.
And it's because of that song.
Well that and kiss the girl.
Oh yeah, that one is pretty great too.
I wish I could live down there with them.
Who wouldn't? Everything better, down where it wetter, take it from me.
