Ever seen the movie Snowpiercer?
No, I've never even heard of it.
Oh, it's a pretty cool movie!
What's the premise?
The idea is that the entire world has become inhabitable, and all of humanity that remains is stuck on a self-supporting train.
What on earth?
Yeah, it's a pretty weird premise. But very neat, too.
So the idea is that the train can support life by itself?
Pretty much. Though life is not easy on the train.
I can imagine not! So would you call it a science fiction movie?
I guess that might be accurate. It's definitely not realistic.
Who is the main star of the movie.
Chris Evans is the star, but it also has Ed Harris and Tilda Swinton.
Ohhh, I love Tilda Swinton.
Yeah, she's pretty great. Her performance in Snowpiercer is delightfully unhinged.
Hmm, that alone kind of makes me want to see it.
It's worth a watch.
Is it currently in theaters?
No, it's been out for a few years now.
Ah, I'll see if it's on Netflix then.
