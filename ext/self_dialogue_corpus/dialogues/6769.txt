Did you ever see Aladdin?
Yes, that's probably my favorite Disney movie of all time.
I love the songs in that one.
Me too, which one is your favorite?
I love "A Whole New World."
Yeah, that's my favorite too. Which character do you like the most? I like Abu.
I like the Genie the best. I miss Robin Williams.
Yeah, he was outstanding in that role. It's a shame he didn't appear in the sequels.
Yeah, the sequels to Aladdin were okay, but nothing was quite like the original.
Agreed. Aladdin is definitely the best of the best.
