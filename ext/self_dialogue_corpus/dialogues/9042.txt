Do you ever listen to Radiohead?
I know a few of their songs, such as Creep. Do you listen to them?
Yeah they are my favorite band. Creep is a decent song but the album it was one wasn't the best.
Wasn't it their first album?
Exactly. Their next album, The Bends, was a much better effort. You should listen to it!
I will, but I have to be honest the lead singer's voice is somewhat annoying.
A lot of people say that. It takes a little getting used to. But give the album a chance I think you'll like it.
Oh! Is this the album with Fake Plastic Trees on it?
It is! That song has great lyrics!
I agree... it's one of my favorites from the 90's
