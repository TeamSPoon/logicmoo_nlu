Isn't the new Transformers movie coming out soon?
This Friday I think.
What's even going on with these things anymore?
I can't keep track myself.  This is the fifth movie or something by now I think.
You can only film the destruction of the world so much.
To me, the movies are just too loud and dumb.
Yeah.  It was cute at first, but got old quick.
But they'll keep making them until people stop going.
Fat chance of that.  Too many fanboys.
I'll probably watch them all someday when I'm bored.
