Do you like Coheed and Cambria?
Yes I think they make great music.
It is so interesting
I love they release their albums as concept albums.
Yeah sometimes I want to hear the story the right way so I listen to them in that order
Its cool to hear how different each album is.
What is your favorite Coheed song?
I dont know if I have a favorite song.
What about album?
I loved their first one, Second Stage Turbine Blade
I think that is my favorite too
They were supposed to make this into a movie
Yeah I dont think they grapsed the funding they needed
It would be cool to see the songs come to life
Yeah I think it would easily write itself if they could get a studio behind them
Do you think they rip off the band Rush?
They play the same genre of progressive rock
What about the singers voice?
Yeah I think that has some relative closeness.
I think they stand on their own to be honest
