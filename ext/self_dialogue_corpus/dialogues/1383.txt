Did you catch any of the game last night?
Dude, it was amazing, the way ward came down with it on the ten the hard way then ran it back 90 yards.
I'm still in shock on that one.
I can't believe they came back from it; I mean three sack in a row then a soft pitch on the off hand.
I was almost hiding behind my couch after the second one.
I was too, then when I saw him catch it I almost hit the ceiling.
I knocked over my girl trying to get a better view.
How did that go over?
She clocked me in the jaw cause I was blocking her view of the screen.
That is funny man, when's there next game?
Thursday, at Dallas; it's gonna be epic.
I can't wait, do you want to watch at my place, just got a new 4k TV, the picture is crystal.
That would be awesome, I'll bring the refreshments.
Better bring some extra, you remember what happened the last time we played Dallas.
Don't worry I'll bring my helmet this time, just remember your pads.
Will do, I can't wait to see Brown running circles around them.
I just hope Big Ben is doing alright by then, he's gotta be sore after all those hits.
He'll be fine, he's got the iron curtain to shield him.
I'm hoping this is our year to go all the way up the stairway.
Seven rings would make my decade.
