I want to watch Fright Night!
Original or remake?
Original of course.
The remake was pretty good.
I never saw it.
The remake had had Anton Yelchin as Charlie Brewster.
Nobody can replace Stephen Geoffreys as Evil or Roddy Mcdowell in the original.
That's true.
Did you like Chris Sarrandon or Colin Farrell as Jerry Dandridge more?
Sarrandon for sure.
I love that guy. He's in all kids of good stuff. Childs Play, A Nightmare Before Christmas, Bordello Of Blood, and so on.
He's so freakin good in Fright NIght.
I love the thing he does in the movie with the apple.
What about it?
Through out the movie he's sometimes eating an apple.
Oh yeah. He throws one at Charlie.
Yup.  That was an acting choice from Chris Sarandon.
Vampires like apples?
They were a way for Jerry Dandridge to keep his fangs clean.
That makes sense. Too bad he's not in Fright Night 2.
