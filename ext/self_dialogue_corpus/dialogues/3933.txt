We watched a pretty good thriller the other day.
I LOVE thrillers, what was it.
It was "Kidnap". It had Halle Berry in it. It was pretty good. Not the best I've ever seen, but still good.
Was it better than "Get Out"?
They are very different. Get out is a little weirder. I wasn't sure if I like that one. It felt like they were trying to make a political commentary a little bit and I despise that in movies.
Hmm, I din't get that...
It feels like they don't make good thrillers anymore. They are mostly horror and I don't like horror.
The new one "Baby Driver" that's coming out looks good.
Oh yeah, I really want to see that. It has Jamie Foxx in it right?
Yeah. It should be good.
