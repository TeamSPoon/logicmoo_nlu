Did you know the Ariana Grande Benefit Concert in Manchester is going to be on TV live in the U.S, tomorrow?
No, I knew right after the bombing that she said she was going to do one, but this is super fast.
She's a brave, talented kid. I'm going to record it. Gotta find the station first.
Who is broadcasting it?
ABC Family. Though it's ot called that anymore. I think it's called Freeform.
Who else is going to perform?
Unbelievable. Off the top of my head-ustin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, Pharrell Williams, Usher, Niall Horan and Take That
What an amazing lineup. It's not gong to be where the concert on May 22 was is it?
No, they couldn't do that. It's at Manchester's Old Trafford Cricket Grounds
They must expect a huge turnout. I'm sure security will be super tight but it makes me nervous.
Well, we can't hide from these terrorists. When you think a about  it the concert makes that  point.
You mean that we're not going to hide and we're going to go about our business? What's the benefit called anyways
One Love Manchester. Makes sense to me because the way these things happen I don't think we really CAN  hide.
True, though frightening. It hasn't even been 2 weeks since the bombing at her concert.
I'd love to go and show my support. But I'll have to settle for watching it on TV
Who are proceeds going to?
All of them are going to the Manchester Emergency Fund in partnership with the British Red Cross
Sounds good to me and the money will help out the victims of the bombing, their families, the city and more.
This musical extravaganza starts on Sunday at 7 p.m. U.K. time/2 p.m. ET
I'll be watching and crossing everything I can cross that everyone will be safe
