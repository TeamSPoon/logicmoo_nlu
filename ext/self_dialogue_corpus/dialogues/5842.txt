Had you ever seen the original Adventures in Babysitting?
I didn't know there was an original.  Was it good?
I loved it as a kid, but I didn't like it as much when I watched it again.
Oh, that sucks.  Should I even bother?
I guess.  There are some funny parts to it.
I guess you thought it was funnier when you were a kid.
Probably so.  Was the newer one any good?
It was okay.
That doesn't sound promising.
I guess neither one was great.
