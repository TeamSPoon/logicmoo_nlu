Have you been getting ready for the new season?
What, the NFL season?
Ya man!
Of course I have! I just got a new TV the other day for watching with my friends.
Oh sweet man, are you gonna have football parties?
Oh ya definitely, and you're always invited man!
Sweet thanks man, who are you rooting for this year?
Normally I'd root for Patriots but this year I'm thinking the Falcons
Oh really, I've always thought of you as a Patriots fan for life.
They'll always have a special place in my heart but I just don;t think they can win this season.
Oh really what makes you think that?
Well for starts Tom Brady is starting to get pretty old.
Ya I guess you're right about that, he's definitely getting up there.
Ya, that's what I'm saying, you can only play well for so long.
What's making you go for the Falcons?
Well they had a pretty good season last year, and their games are always fun to watch
You're not wrong about that, I'll give you that.
Ya, especially on the new TV haha
Of course! I'm excited for some games.
Me too man, me too.
