Hey man you ready for some football?
Oh yeah. Go packers!!
I didn't know you were a packers fan.
Oh yeah. I guess I got it from my dad.
Oh cool. I like Payton manning. I don't care what team he's on.
So your a Broncos fan right now?
Sure am. He's a great quarterback. I Was so happy when he left the colts.
Yeah I never was a colts fan.
I'm not a Patriots fan.
Well yeah but I think Tom Brady's pretty good.
You do? What about deflating the footballs and cheating by looking at plays?
Well I'm not so sure all that happened.
Which one?
Both of them.
Well they got fined for the deflating balls. I think they did for looking at the play books.
I just don't belive someone like Brady would cheat that way.
Well how do you explain how they win so much?
They are just a really solid team.
I'm not so sure.
Look at the last Super Bowl. They came back against the Falcons. They couldn't have cheated then.
