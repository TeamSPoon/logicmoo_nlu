Do you have any connections to any booking agents?
For what kind of act?
My buddies and I started a punk band.
I'm not really into punk music these days.
Yeah the scene has died down in this city, it sucks.
Yeah, I used to live in a hosue full of punk musicians, but we got kicked out and parted ways.
Do you ever talk to them?
No, unfortunately. Some of them would probably be able to help out with booking too.
I'm totally new to this field. I know nothing except how to play music.
Have you produced anything?
We have enough songs for an EP I think, but we don't really play shows.
That's what you gotta do first.
That's why I'm struggling, I'm not sure how to go about finding a place to play a show.
My best advice would just be to do what you're doing- ask around.
Really?
Yeah, eventually if you keep talking to other musicians, you'll make connections and people will start remembering your name.
Thanks man.
Are you on social media at all for your music.
No, why?
You gotta start a bandcamp! It's the best tool for musicians to spread their word.
