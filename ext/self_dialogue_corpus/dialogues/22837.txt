What are your thoughts on David O. Russell?
I really loved The Fighter, and I thought Silver Linings Playbook was excellent.
Me too, but if I'm being honest, I think that both those movies are buoyed by the performances.
Christian Bale gives an amazing performance in The Fighter.
Melissa Leo also gives a great performance!
Who plays Micky Ward's girlfriend in that movie?
Amy Adams; she's a little out of her comfort zone as an actress, and she does great.
Right, well, Silver Linings Playbook is also really well acted.
Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in that!
Honestly, I liked Bradley Cooper's performance a little better, I thought it was more nuanced.
But I mean, what do you think of O. Russell as a director?
Really, I think he's just okay cinematically, but as we were saying he draws out really great performances.
He was sort of the darling of Hollywood for a while, it felt like everything he did was nominated for Oscars.
Yeah, even his bad stuff, Joy was pretty awful.
I thought Jennifer Lawrence was okay, but I didn't think she deserved the nomination.
It was definitely not her best performance, and I thought the script wasn't too great.
What's that other movie he did with Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence?
American Hustle!
Christian Bale gained all the weight for that role, right?
Right, and it got him an Oscar nomination!
