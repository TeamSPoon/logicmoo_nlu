What did you think of the latest star wars movie?
Which one? Force awakens?
No, rogue one.
I thought it was pretty good, I really liked the scene where darth vader went all crazy.
At the end? Yeah he took it to the rebels.
It was pretty dark though.
That's what I liked it about, like how Empire was dark.
True, I just wish there were more lightsaber fights.
Yeah, the ending made up for it though.
And especially when vader looks out at the leaving ship very pissed.
Yeah! I wonder if they are going to do more one-off movies like this in star wars universe.
I don't know, probably now that Disney owns it they'll be doing something with it.
Lucas really did start to mess up all his great movies.
Yeah, have you seen the ET edit where the cops are chasing the kids with walky talkies?
Yes, that's hilarious! Or the worst in the pub with Han.
Han shot first!
I hope Disney does something with the game side things.
The movies at least are great.
Force awakens was kind of just a remake of the first one.
How do you mean?
