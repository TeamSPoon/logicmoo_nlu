2016 was a tough year for music.
I know, we lost Bowie, Prince, and Lou Reed.
Those were three of our favorite artists.
Three of the best. Three of the most original.
Highly original, with their own aesthetic and boldness in pursuing whatever they wanted to pursue.
I know. Think of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, I think it's commercially unviable and just not a great album, but it is an artistic statement.
Yeah, and Bowie was an absolute chameleon. That guy changed his style and aesthetic so many times.
Plastic soul! Honky tonk! Punk! Rocknroll! Post-Punk! Electronic! Jazz!
An absolute chameleon! Prince was a chameleon in his own way.
He changed his name to a symbol.
And he wrote a funk album, a rock/nu wave album, a blues album, albums that sounded kind of metal, an r&b album. He was prolific.
Super prolific. It was tough to lose such innovative musicians and people.
2016 was a tough year for music, but I can remain hopeful knowing that each artist plants many more seeds in people's minds and that we're not done hearing Prince, Bowie or Lou Reed.
Great point. They'll influence others for years to come.
Yes, the influence will take variegated forms, but we'll still be hearing each of them generations from now.
Do you have a favorite Prince song?
Yes, I do. It's not super well known, but it's called "When You Were Mine."
I don't know a thing about that song.
It's a raw new wave and rock song with one of my favorite pop melodies of all time. Think Prince plus Elvis Costello.
That combination sounds so incredibly amazing! I must listen!
