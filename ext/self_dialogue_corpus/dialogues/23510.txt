Are slasher flicks all but dead in todays film world?
Are you trying to make a pun?
No, I am being serious.
I think they pop up every once in awhile.
They may but do they have success?
Not really.
Why do you think that is?
I think people want to be involved and interested in the movies they see.
So those movies aren't interesting?
I think they are a bit too basic.
So people have to be stoned to see them?
I am not advocating that.
So why do you really believe they dont make alot of them anymore?
I mean how much can you make of a gory genre of film?
I am sure they can squeeze out some plots.
They just keep making sequels to older ones.
Like a 16th Friday the 13th?
Yes and the allure of some of those characters is just not there.
Do you think a new Chucky would do good?
I think it would be one of the worst movies to come out this decade.
