What genre of rock is your favorite?
I love industrial rock.
I know about industrial electronic music, but I don't know any industrial rock songs.
You probably do! Have you heard Du Hast by Rammstein or Closer by Nine Inch Nails?
Yeah, I know Du Hast. It gets me pumped whenever I hear it.
Industrial rock is like that. You should try other Rammstein if you like Du Hast.
What are some songs you think are good by them?
Sonne, Engel, and on the slower side, Wo Bist Du.
Cool. Where should I start with Nine Inch Nails?
The entire Downward Spiral album, beginning to end, in one sitting.
