Are you excited about the new force awakens movies?
Well, I am glad they finally came away from all of that nonsense Episode 1, 2 & 3.
What do you mean? It was great to see the back story of Darth Vader and Obi Wan having the lead.
Anakin, aka young Vader was so dreadful to watch, not to mention even Samuel Jackson's part couldnt liven things up much.
I see what you mean. I am excited about the new characters. It is great to see Chewbacca return, and BB-8 is so lovable.
I do like seeing the old school movies mixed with the new story line. Po and Fin are both entertaining characters to watch.
I like what they have done with all of the storm troopers, too. They aren't just one kind, like in attack of the clones.
Yes, the storm troopers have all kinds of different weapons and obvious ranks, it makes the fight scenes that much more intriguing.
I can't wait to see who the new ultimate bad guy is. I think Snoke may be his name.
Oh yes, he sounds like a good nemesis. Hopefully he is very powerful and gets a good story line.
