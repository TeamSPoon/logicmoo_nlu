Hey Brandon how's it going?
Going well Dan just watching some old foozeball games.
Ahh cool me and my uncle used to watch the old Superbowls too.
I'm watching some old Patriots videos, I never realized Tom Brady has been playing since the 90s.
That is truly remarkable, and his arm hasn't ever looked better.
The guy is stud with an incredible team at his back.
I completely agree man, and with Gronkowski coming back from injury they should stay solid.
I completely forgot about Gronk, he's really coming back from injury?
Yeah man, it was bad, and it seems like forever since he played.
I remember last year they went 17-2 without him which is just insane on it's own.
Bellicheck and Brady can handle the game.
Oh for sure, but it's just child play for them now.
These guys are getting older, and the younger teams seem to be really hungry.
Very true, but fear an old man in a place where men die young.
That is a strange analogy, but I kind of understand.
It's just dog eat dog out there, and the wisest players are the most experienced.
You are right, that experience and intelligence has carried the Patriots through a lot of wins.
You want to watch some more film with me?
Oh for sure I could watch and talk football all day.
Take a seat and grab a beer bud!
