You know, the first time Harry goes the the Weasleys' house in the Chamber of Secrets, it looks like he feels like he is probably home.
Yes, it's so homey and comfortable messy in the Burrow. They did a great job on the set design.
And Mrs Weasley is the perfect mother figure, even if she yells at her kids a lot.
Mr Weasley balances her out. He doesn't care if his kids fly a car or not.
He thinks it's really cool actually.
And he's a supportive father even as his kids go off to fight Voldemort.
He's just crushed when Fred dies, though.
They all are. Fred was an integral part of the family.
Imagine George making a joke after his death. It just wouldn't be the same.
They'd still be homey and welcoming, but they'd be missing something.
