Hey, did you see the Force Awakens?
Yeah, I did.
Cool, did you have any problems with it?
Well, I thought the whole Solo's son goes bad was a little unoriginal, I mean the old Expanded Universe did the same thing with Jacen Solo.
True, true. I always thought that was kind of hokey and unnessecary.
Yea, I mean what is Solo-Skywalker clan cursed or something, every generation someone seems to go to the dark side., whether owned by DIsney or not.
That's about the size of it, any other issues?
Well, I didn't like them killing off Han Solo, but at least they did it well.
That's true and think about it, Harrison Ford is a really big name in movies, so he's probably pretty expensive to have.
True, his career took off after Star Wars, but Mark Hamil didn't do nearly as well.
