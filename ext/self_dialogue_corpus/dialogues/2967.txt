Hey man, what you think about the Bears this year?
Oh gosh, talk about a re building year.
Well I don't think they'll be that bad.
I don't know man, trading for Trubisky might be one of those trades that haunts a team for a long time.
Yeah I don't know, he might be really good.
Yeah but they already signed Mike Glennon in the off-season.
Wasn't he just hired to take the lead dog role while Trubisky got ready?
Possibly, but they sure signed him to fat deal to just be a book mark.
What did they give away to get Trubisky anyway?
Bro, all they moved up was one spot, and they gave away I think three or four more draft picks.
Ooh, yeah I didn't know that.
Yeah, so now you've got a developing quarterback, with no help on the roster.
Yeah and that's a big deal.
Right, quarterbacks don't get better when they scrambling for their life because no one is open.
Right, or the line sucks because you've ignored it all in the draft.
Right, which is the mistake I think the Bears made.
Boy the Niners sure did well in the draft huh?
Yeah for being a brand new gm, John Lynch did alright.
At least with that deal anyway.
Well yeah, you never really know how good a draft is until years later anyway.
