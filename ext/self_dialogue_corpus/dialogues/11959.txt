Which movie is your favorite out of the Star Wars original trilogy?
I definitely love Return of the Jedi the most out of the three!
Why do you like Return of the Jedi more than the other two movies?
It is because it is the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord.
I think the final fight scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord was awesome!
So do I! The special effects back then were amazing!
The Sith Lord's lightning powers were very cool to look at.
I especially love when the Sith Lord was thrown over the railing.
I was shocked that happened because I thought it would be Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader to die.
So was I, I had to watch that scene a couple more times.
