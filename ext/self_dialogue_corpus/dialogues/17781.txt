I am into so much music these days I think it is all coming out my ears.
What do you mean?
I just can't hook myself into one genre. i can listen to jazz, country, reggae, rock, indie, pop in one day and not blink and eye. What type of music do you like?
Like you, that's kind of hard to pinpoint for me.
Amuse me.
Okay, if i name one then I would have to say I like k-pop.
What is k-pop?
K-pop is short for Korean pop. Lots of people in the united states really get a kick out of the sound.
So they sing in the Korean language?
Yeah. Well, they kind of mix it up. Some English words along with Korean.
What is your favorite k-pop band then?
That's easy, they are called BigBang. They are kind of a boy band.
You mean like the old Boys to Men boy band?
Yup, but much cuter and they sound amazing.
Tell me the name of a few of their songs?
Bang Bang Bang, Fantastic Baby and Loser. But that is just a few.
They do sound interesting and maybe I could add another genre to my growing list.
You should really check them out.
If you do, give me feedback. I want to know if you really like k-pop of not.
Of course!
