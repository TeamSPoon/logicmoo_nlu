Do you recall Super Bowl III?
Not really, it was before my time.
Have you heard of Joe Namath?
Of course.
Well, he predicted the biggest upset in saying the Jets would win Super Bowl III
Oh that's right. Who did they beat that year?
The Baltimore Colts.
Oh right, Johnny Unitas at QB.
Yes, they were the heavy favorites.
What year was that?
That was back in 1969, but for the 1968 season.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, and they used to play the game in mid-January.
Who was the coach back then?
I don't remember the Jets coach, but Don Shula was the Colts' coach.
Don Shula who went on to coach the Dolphins?
That's the one.
Wow, I had no idea he coached the Colts as well.
Yeah, he's been around for a long time.
Crazy.
