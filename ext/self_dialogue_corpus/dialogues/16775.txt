So, I was just listening to BabyMetal.
What?
BabyMetal, it's a group from Japan.  It combines these three girls singing J-Pop with heavy metal.
That is... bizarre, but considering some of the stuff that comes out of Japan, not altogether unexpected.
Yeah, but their music is pretty cool.  I mean, of course, I don't know what they're saying, but I get that with a lot of American music
Yeah, especially Death Metal.
Hahah!  But yeah, they're a pretty awesome group, you should check them out if you get a chance.
Cool, I'll look into it.
Anyone good one to look up is Rob Dougan.
You know, I think I've heard of him from somewhere...
Yeah, he did this album Furious Angels and a lot of his pieces were featured in the Matrix movies.
Sounds familiar...
Yeah, in the first film he did a piece called "Clubbed To Death" which is done in that scene with the girl in the red dress.
Red dress?
Yeah, you know, when Morpheus is telling Neo how anyone still plugged into the Matrix can be taken over by an agent.
I remember that scene, but I don't remember the song that was playing.
Well, you should Youtube it, it's pretty awesome.
Okay.
Another good one he did was "I'm not driving anymore", the instrumental appeared in the DVD menu on the second film.  Course, I prefer the original with the lyrics.
Have to check it out.
