Question: Who was more wrong by Harry - Snape or Dumbledore?
What in the world are you talking about? Snape was always horrible to Harry. How can you say Dumbledore was wrong?
Did you not finish the series? In Snape's flashback it is explained that Dumbledore was basically raising Harry like "a pig for slaughter."
Ok yes that's a good point. But still, it's Dumbledore we are talking about!
That doesn't negate all he did.
He didn't do it because he was evil. It was necessary in his mind to save all of the world! He loved Harry.
I don't call that love.
I don't call how Snape treated Harry love. He took care of Harry all that time only because he was Lily's son.
Yes but which is worse?
Snape will always be worse.
