Saw an interesting announcement last week. Did you see Doug Williams is going to the Redskins front office?
I did. Think he can save them from their crazy owner?
Daniel Snyder has more money than sense.
You're right. What's happening with Cousins?
Kirk Cousins is a class act.
I agree. did they ever get his contract straightened out?
Not sure. July 15 is the deadline.
There's just too much drama on this team.
I agree, but I think there's drama on every team.
In know, right?
San Francisco didn't renew Colin Kaepernick.
That's probably for the best. The guy was a huge distraction.
So disrespectful when he would take a knee during our National Anthem.
You know who I miss?  Tim Tebow
I liked him. I never understood why Denver let him go.
Denver had Peyton ready to go. That guy is a machine.
Is Peyton coming back this year?  I never heard.
How did you miss that?  He retired from the NFL.
Probably a good move for him.
Agreed, go out on his own terms as  a winner.
