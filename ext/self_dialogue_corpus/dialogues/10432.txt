Hey, how's it going?
Pretty well, you?
I'm doing solid. Listen to any good music lately?
Yeah yeah, I've been into Childish Gambino.
Childish Gambino? That's Donald Glover, right?
Yeah, he's good at pretty much everything.
He just put out a new album, right?
Yup, it's called Awaken, My Love.
You like it?
I do! It's real funky, kinda weird sometimes though.
What do you mean?
It just seems like there's too much going on in some tracks.
Oh, I got you. But there a chill songs too though, right?
Yeah yeah. I like Redbone and Me and Your Mama.
How does it compare to his earlier stuff?
I'm not an expert or anything, but this album feels like it's really trying to tell you something.
What does that even mean?
You'll just have to listen to it.
I guess so. I'll check it out.
Awesome.
