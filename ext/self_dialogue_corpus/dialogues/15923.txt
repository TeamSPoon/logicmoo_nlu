who is your favorite music artist
I would have to say old Madonna
really old like when
more of when she got started
in the 80's
yes, her songs were better then
what songs do you like
Like a Virgin
that is a great one what else
well I also like Cindy Lauper
really, thats weird
not really it what I grew up with
what Lauper songs do you prefer
of course the classic true colors
that is a good one but a little slow for my taste
of course theres Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
oh yes, that one has been redone so many times
it has indeed
it has also been in a ton of movies
yes they seem to like to use that one
