Have you seen any of Vin Diesel's movie?
Oh yes, I love the Fast and the Furious and its sequels
I really liked the first three of those movies.
The car chases were so exciting that I could not look away.
Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, is also in several of those films.
I think he's great. He can do action and he can do comedy.
He was great in San Andreas. Disaster movies are some of my favorite action films.
Did you like The Day after Tomorrow?
That movie had excellent special effects.
I've never seen it, but maybe I will check it out.
