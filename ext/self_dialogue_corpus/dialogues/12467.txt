I wonder where the Jedi *originally* came from.
Do you suppose that they'll answer that definitively in The Last Jedi?
I hope so!  As the last of the nine films oriented around the original Star Wars, there are a lot of questions I hope that they'll tie up!
What I'd like to see is some more force ghosts, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of The Empire Strikes Back!
I think that title -- The Last Jedi -- is actually a teaser: I think we'll actually see Luke *re-establish* the Jedi Order.
Huh. Will Kylo Ren re-establish the Sith too, then?
No, I think we'll really see the end of the *Sith*, not the Jedi Order. I just have a lot of faith in George Lucas' positive vision.
And where does Rey fit in?
Good question!  I think when we find out where *she* came from, it will answer many questions!
I see Luke setting up a new Jedi Order, with Rey at the head of it -- wouldn't *that* be cool!
