My favorite genre. That's hard.
Mine will always be classic rock.
That's one of my favorites too.
What is your absolute favorite?
Well, I can't commit to one genre for life like you.
Are you avoiding the question, or what?
Not at all. It’s complicated.
Let’s have it.
I like many kinds of music, or maybe all kinds. I sometimes rank them.
Ok. Whose number one on the list?
Today, it’s a four way tie. Jazz, classic rock, classical and bluegrass like Bela Fleck's earlier stuff.
That is one heck of a four way tie.
Tomorrow it might be different.
I don't know if that's avoiding your true passion, I suspect classical, so as not to appear old fashioned.
Not true. I just cannot say that any genre is bad or good.
Well, tell me how you think of music.
Every genre has its good and bad. Like usually belittled disco.
Ok. When I think of it, that's true.
I bet you like some of Willie Nelson's stuff even though you say you hate country.
You got me there. I was speaking of generally.
