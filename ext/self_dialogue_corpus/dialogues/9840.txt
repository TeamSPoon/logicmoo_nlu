Who is your favorite rap artist right now?
I would say Jay-Z. I think he is amazing.
I do love his music. I wish he made more of it though.
I heard he has a new album coming out this month.
Really? That would be fantastic.
I know! His raps are so genuine and easy to relate with.
I agree. I also really like his rap style. He keeps it somewhat slow.
He does. He definitely has his own flavor to his raps. You always can tell it is him when you hear it.
I really like that about his raps. He stays true to himself.
I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next!
