Have you seen all of the X-Men movies?
Yes I have! My favorite is Days of Future Past.
Oh I loved that one! Quicksilver made his appearance in that one and became my favorite character of the series.
My favorite of the series is Jean Grey or Phoenix. She was really the most powerful of them all.
That's true but she had trouble controlling her powers. If you could have one of their powers which would it be?
Oh definitely Professor X. I'd love to be able to see into anyone's mind.
I'd have to say Mystique for me. I'd love to be able to sneak around and blend in as I pleased.
That's true, that's a good choice. I think Jennifer Lawrence did an awesome job in that role.
I agree. She and McAvoy had good chemistry.
Right and she had good intentions in Days of Future Past but she just wasn't thinking clearly, and she didn't know what they knew about the future.
