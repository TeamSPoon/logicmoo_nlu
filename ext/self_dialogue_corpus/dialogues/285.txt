Who was the best character in Spiderman?
I liked Aunt May
What did you like about her?
She was always nice to Peter
Yeah
She also took Uncle Ben's death welll
She gave Peter her own wedding ring
It was sad since when she lost her house
Peter let the thief go
He had no idea his uncle would be shot because of that
