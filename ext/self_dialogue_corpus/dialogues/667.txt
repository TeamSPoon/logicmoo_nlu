What are some teams that you're excited about in the NFL next season?
I'm pretty excited to watch the Raiders.
That's a good answer.
They made some really strong acquisitions in the draft.
Yeah, Marshawn Lynch being one of them.
Yeah. He's going to rise that team to new levels.
They are fun to watch anyways. It's going to be fun to see them do well next season.
I agree. They have a powerful fanbase and a lot of people that support them.
I'm excited to watch Russel Wilson and the Seahawks.
I really like watching Russel play. He's a good decision maker.
Yeah, and their defense is just plain scary.
That's definitely the strong point of their team.
Opposing teams are scared to pass against them.
It's easy to see why. They make so many defensive plays.
It's rare to see that, too. Usually teams are built around an explosive offense.
I agree. It's cool to see some new strategy in play.
I agree. I'm also excited to watch Cam Newton.
Definitely. I've always supported him as a top ten quarterback.
I agree. He stays really calm under pressure.
That's what allowed him to get very close to first place as a quarterback last year.
