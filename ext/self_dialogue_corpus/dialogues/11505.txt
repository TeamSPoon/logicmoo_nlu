Hey,the song day in the life from the Beatles wasn't played in England until like 1985!
Really? Why is that.
The line,"I'd love to turn you on" was considered a reference to drugs and that didn't go over to well in England.
Can you imagine? The crap that's allowed on radio now is rediculous compared to that.
I know. Stuffed shirts in England.
Boy isn't that the truth.
In fact,the song took awhile in America to be accepted because it was different and so long.
Yes,I've read that too.
Hard to believe because it's an iconic song now.
It sure is and always will be
