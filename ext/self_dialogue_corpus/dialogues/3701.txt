Do you like thriller movies that are based on novels.
I do not read much, so I do not really know?
There are some really well known ones.
Like what movies?
Well, Gone Girl and Jaws are some that come to mind.
Jaws, with the shark, was based on a book?
Yep and it is one of the most well known thrillers.
I loved when they said the line, " We are going to need a bigger boat".
I liked how I never really knew what was going to happen.
The show kept you on your toes.
