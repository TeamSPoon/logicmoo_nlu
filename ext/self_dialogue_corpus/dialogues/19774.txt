Hey there.
Hi.
We're chatting about music is that right?
Yep that is correct.
Okay.
What kind of bands do you like?
Well, not really a lot of bands more solo acts?
Oh yeah, like who?
I like Adelle.  I like Carrie Underwood.
Oh so female singers?
Yeah pretty much, but I do like other stuff as well.
What else do you like?
Well it's a bit different but I like classical music quite a bit.
Oh okay.
It helps me relax.

You should.
I will.
