How do you feel about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
I think it was pretty good.
For a horror movie I thought it was campy
Some of them always are.
I just thought it leaned on generic stuff.
Not really, it was alright on its own
Did you see the one with Matthew McConaghey?
Yeah that was terrible.
Sometimes reprises can be boring
He just didnt do a good job with it
