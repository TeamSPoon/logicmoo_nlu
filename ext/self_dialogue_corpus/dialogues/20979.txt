Dredd from 2012 is the best comic book movie.
Really? I thought you hated comic book movies.
I'm tired of them, yes.
We all are. Reboots too.
This one was actually a decent movie and true to the source material.
It has to be better than the Stallone version from the nineties.
Yes. They sort of do a Die Hard thing, all in one building.
But with Judge Dredd?
Yeah.
That's cool. It has the Star Trek guy right?
Yeah, but he wears a mask.
Good.
It also has Judge Anderson and a bunch of refs. The Villian is good too.
That's the best part of Judge Dredd.
It didn't make any money, though.
Isn't that how it always is?
Yeah, a movie has to sell a million tickets in China or it's not worth having made it.
Like Warcraft.
Exactly. Total garbage.
Unfortunate.
