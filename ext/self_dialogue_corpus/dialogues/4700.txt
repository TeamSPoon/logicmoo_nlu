Did you hear that MLB has an agreement with Facebook to allow Facebook to broadcast a game ever Friday, with no blackouts?
Yup I did. Not a bad deal at all. Even though you may not be able to watch your favorite team each week, it's still cool.
MLB.tv already has a free game of the day but it has blackout restrictions.
I wonder if the Facebook game will be different from the MLB one.
I'm sure it will be the same. Yahoo has a free game every day and it's always the same as the MLB's free game.
Sounds like the MLB is desperate.
Why do you say that?
Just like any sale, the MLB is trying to get people "in the door" to sample the product by giving it away for free.Most Americans have lost interest in baseball.
I doubt they're giving it away for free.
I think it is very telling that no source I can find discloses how much MLB was paid for this deal, just that it was deal.
MLB is more popular than ever. It's still America's game. The ratings are through the roof.
Do you have a source on that?
Yup, a source on Forbes.com says ratings were up 1% last year.
Were television ratings up for certain games or what?
9 clubs had number 1 rankings across all television networks and 16 out of 29 clubs ranked in the top 3 across television networks.
So are these ratings only taking into account primetime games?
Yes, the ratings are for regular season primetime games.
I guess that's pretty believable data since many fans watch throughout the summer months.
I agree and now with more free games streaming on Facebook you can expect ratings to go up even more.
That's true, I wish the NFL would do something like this. HA just kidding that'll never happen.
