You know who I find to be kind of a funny artist?
Who is that?
Taylor Swift.
Why Taylor Swift?
Well, she herself is not that funny. The fact that she started out as a country singer and has transitioned to the pop star she is today.
I hardly remember her as a country singer.
I know, it is easy to forget considering all the pop success she has had.
Right, I mean I can't name one country song she did.
It is hard to listen to her music today and find even a tiny hint of country style in there.
I would never have known she had country roots if I was not a country fan anyways.
Yes, I think anyone who doesn't listen to country music would have no idea.
Didn't Miley Cyrus sing some country as well?
I think she dabbled in it, but she has kind of always been a pop person.
Speaking of Miley, I really like her new song "Malibu".
Oh me too. I feel like she is going back to where she started out a little.
Yeah, she got unique there for a little bit.
She did, and it overflowed to her music.
I really like that song though. I hope she keeps making more songs like that.
I think she will given the reception it is getting.
I guess all young people have to go through a "unique" stage.
