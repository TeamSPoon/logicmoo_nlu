Charles, I just saw the trailer for It Comes at Night and I have got to see that movie.
Let me stop you right there. I have seen it and it is not what you think it is.
How have you seen it? It hasn't been released yet?
In the United States it hasn't but it has somewhere else.
Forgot about that. What's wrong with the movie?
Do you remember The Village in which alot of audiences are expecting one thing and eventually given a very different film
That movie was a total let down. It could have been so much better.
You see this is what I mean.  It Comes At Night is not a bad film, but it is not the film you are expecting.
Tell me this, is it a horror?
No, this is not a horror film. There are no monsters or creatures.
No monsters?
No. The movie doesn't even ALLUDE to there being a monster.
Then what is it about?
A family isolate themselves in abandoned house in the middle of the woods in order to survive against plague that is killing off humanity.
A plague that is killing off humanity. What kind of plague?
The full effects of the disease are not known, but basically it gives you a really bad rash and kills you.
That's why they lock up in an cabin in the woods?
It is a house and yes.  The main characters don't want this to happen to them.
I think I won't be watching It Comes At Night.
It's a cool movie. It's just not what you are expecting.
