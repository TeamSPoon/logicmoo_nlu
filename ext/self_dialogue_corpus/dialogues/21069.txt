Would you consider alien invasion movies war movies?
They're completely different. No way, man.
Think about it though, they're really similar types of films.
Just because they show two opposing forces fighting each other doesn't make them war films.
Why not?
Alien invasion movies are usually escapism. War movies are closer to horror films if anything.
Oh so, they're not similar to alien invasion, but they are similar to horror. Yet I'm all wrong?
Let me explain. Both horror films and war films are meant to disturb you and show you the dark side of humanity.
If that's the case, then we may as well throw in zombie movies.
Oh boy. Here we go.
I mean, if it's all about the darkness inside us, then zombie movies fit perfectly. After all, the real monster is man.
I see what you're saying, but war movies are about the brutality of battle. Zombie movies are about the selfishness of man.
And wars are fought over selfish reasons.
But that's not the point of war movies. War movies are meant to show the effects of fighting on the common solider.
And that's like horror films how, again?
In most horror films, we see random people hunted by an evil force. In war movies, random soldiers are hunted by an opposing force.
Hmm, I guess I see where you're coming from.
Glad we could reach an agreement.
Not so fast; in alien invasion movies, random people are hunted by an evil, opposing force. They're both war and horror movies all in one.
Shoot, you've used my own logic against me. I still disagree though.
