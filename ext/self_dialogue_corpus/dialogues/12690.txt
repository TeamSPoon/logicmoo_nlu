Did you ever like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi?
I did as a kid, but I think they're pretty lame as an adult.
Yeah, I thought they were kind of fun when I was younger
They played that annoying song at the end of the movie
Well, that was kind of fun. Besides they just destroyed the evil empire.
They also almost killed Luke, Han and Chewie
Yeah, but then Luke made C-3PO fly.
Yeah, and that freaked them out.
They thought he was a god.
Yeah, because he was all gold.
