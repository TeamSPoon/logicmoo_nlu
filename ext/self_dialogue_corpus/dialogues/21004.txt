I want to see the new Guardians of the Galaxies movie.
Oh you should! I saw it and it was great.
Did they do a good job with it?
Yes, the music was fun and the story was interesting.
Did they introduce any characters from the Avengers.
I didn't notice any.
What was your favorite part?
I don't want to give anything away.
Oh come on. Just tell me.
The dialogues are a lot of fun. Especially with Drax and Rocket.
Drax really? He seemed boring in the first movie.
Oh, he was great in this one. So blunt it is hilarious.
Do they have Baby Groot?
Yes, but he isn't stuck in his pot anymore. He is so cute.
Can he talk?
You know all Groot says is "I am Groot".
Hahah, true.
You should definitely go see it.
Thanks, I will try to plan something this weekend.
Maybe I can come along.
