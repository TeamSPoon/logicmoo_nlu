I honestly feel like Jared Leto's portrayal of Joker was one of the best and wish they had shown more of him.
I agree but the way they edited him in the movies it makes it hard for some to enjoy him as much.
I heard that he is going to be in the next Batman movie with Ben Affleck.
Oh that will be really cool to see. I hope he gets more screen time and we see how he is with The Joker even more.
I just hope it is better than Suicide Squad.
I do as well. I felt like the bad guy for suicide squad was too big of a villain for that group.
Yeah and the way they had Dead Shot portrayed was disappointing as well.
I agree. Some of his character didn't make sense for that movie.
The best part was seeing Harley Quinn on the big screen.
I know. I hope they have her in the Batman movie too.
