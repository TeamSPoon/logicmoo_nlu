Everyone has seen Finding Nemo, but have you seen the sequel called Finding Dory?
No, not yet. Is it out already?
Yes, I found it on Netflix.
Is it as good as Finding Nemo?
Oh yes, I would have to say so.
Does Dory get lost too?
Kind of, she is searching for her parents and in the meantime, gets lost from Marlin and Nemo.
Are there any characters from Finding Nemo in it?
Yes! The turtle, and it also explains some or her childhood friends.
Like who?
Remember how she can speak whale?
Oh yes, that was funny.
Well in Finding Dory, it shows how her story started and how she met her whale friend that taught her how to speak whale.
That sounds cute, does it show her story as a baby too?
Yes it starts off showing her with her parents, and throughout the movie she keeps having flashbacks.
Which means she is remembering things?
Exactly! It is quite funny.
I have heard it was good, I will need to see it soon.
The characters in this are just as funny, if not funnier than Finding Nemo.
I look forward to watching it!
