Hey what do you think about steroids in football?
The guys are tested now I do not think it is a problem any more.
You think so? Any other performance enhancing drugs legal?
They have a list guys get suspended all the time for it.
In the old days these guys got treated worse.
More things used to be overlooked.
They would put guys on the field who shouldn't have been.
Yes opiates for pain, cortisone injections anything to get on the field.
Many old players are suffering from it now.
Yes, did you hear the story of Jim McMahon the former bears quarterback?
No what happened?
He has a lot of pain issues now and has to do some special procedure to control pain.
That's a shame I'm concerned about the concussion thing as well.
It's a shame but I think they are doing more now to protect guys.
It is hard to see the damage until many years after most of the time.
Guys have killed themselves because of brain damage.
Lyle Alzado was the worse example of steroid use in the NFL.
He had cancer they blamed it on steroids but no proof that caused it.
It could have been something else?
Maybe it is hard to tell why someone gets cancer.
