I have listened to Ed Sheeran's "Divide"
Did you love it?
Yes, the tunes are really catchy.
How about the lyrics?
Those vary per song.
I think the lyrics to "Shape of you" demean women.
I don't think so. He speaks the truth as it is.
To be fair he does make up for it in other songs which have deeper lyrics.
Yes, he can be forgiven
What song did you like most ?
"Shape of you" easily.
I have that song stuck in my head!
I too have it playing on the loop.
I don't even like it but I'm always singing it.
Could you say this is his best album yet?
No. I'd say + is my favorite.
The first love is always the true love.
I know. This album is what sold me to his songs.
He is such a talented singer.
True. He can play guitar too.
