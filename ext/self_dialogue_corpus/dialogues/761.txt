Hey, who won Super Bowl IV?
That would be the Kansas City Chiefs
Oh really, I didn't realize they won a Super Bowl
Yeah, that's when Hank Stram was their coach.
Oh yeah, the coach that always wore those blazers
Yeah, that's the one.
Do you remember who they played?
Yeah, it was the Minnesota Vikings
Oh really, I didn't realize the Vikings have been to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, they've been, but never won.
Where did they play it back then?
I believe it was in New Orleans
The Super Dome?
No, they didn't have the dome back then.
Must've been an outdoor stadium then.
Yeah, I can't remember where though.
So the Chiefs haven't done much since then
Not really. Always close, but never a clincher
Yeah, tough for the fans.
At least they have one.
