By any chance, have you managed to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Yes I have, and it's a great movie!
I heard that it had a really stacked cast.
Absolutely. We're talking people like Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Kurt Russell.
My goodness, that sounds amazing just by the names alone.
They all put on a terrific show. Each character is just so unique and likeable.
Who is Dave Bautista's character again?
His character is Drax. He's a greenish alien person with a very blunt personality, and I mean blunt to the point of being nilarious.
That's exactly what I'd heard about him from the first movie.
There's also Cooper and Diesel's duo of Rocket and Groot. They are just as funny.
Isn't Rocket the only one in the group that can understand Groot?
Yes. All he knows how to say is "I am Groot", and Rocket's translations are always super funny.
And how's Chris Pratt's character?
Star-Lord? He's a pretty straightforward hero with a tragic backstory and likable personality, and this movie explores his origins a bit further.
What are some other good things about the movie?
The soundtrack!
Really? How?
Since Star-Lord is such a huge fan of music, the film constantly plays the music that the character listens to, which are a bunch of hits from the 70s and 80s.
That sounds awesome!
It IS awesome!
