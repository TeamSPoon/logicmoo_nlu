MMMMM bop!
Don't sing that again.
Don't like Hansen?
I have mixed feelings about them. They're talented but that song's annoying
You know they were all 21 and under when they wrote it, right?
Yeah, and?
Their music is really good now.
Aren't they all old and married now?
Not old, but old enough that they have to sing Mmmbop down a fourth to compensate for their voices.
Ha, I'd love to hear them sing it back in the original key.
