Hey Tim, hows your kids doing?
They are doing well.. I'm trying to find a movie for my kids to watch tonight.
What kind of movies do they like?
They like animations.
Have they seen SING?
No they havent is it any good?
Yes! Its a beautiful story, not just for child.
You mean I will not get bored as per usual?
No way! Its a beautiful story, I actually cried.
Wow, it was that powerful?!
Yes!
The voices have some relatively unknown singers also-- I thought they were professional singers.
Really? I feel curious now!
Yes, its really worth it!
Does it have songs that I know?
Yes its all popular contemporary music! Both you and your kids will be dancing!
Wow ok I will definitely rent it then
Cool!
Thanks for your suggestion
No problem! Good luck. Let me know how it goes!
