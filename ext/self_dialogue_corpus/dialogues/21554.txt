Do you want to watch Zootopia again?
Yeah, that sounds good. I love that movie.
Me too. I think that it was really well done.
I love all the characters.
Yeah, they really did a good job pairing the voice to the character.
Did you know that originally the movie was supposed to revolve around Nick Wilde?
Instead of Judy?
Yup, but it didn't do well with test audiences.
Wow, I wonder what that version would have been like.
I think if they had run with it anyway, it probably would have been a good niche film.
It definitely would not have popularity that this one did.
Still, it might have been interesting to see more of Nick's backstory.
I know you love a good bad guy backstory.
Hey, Nick wasn't all bad. He came around in the end.
You're right, you're right.
In fact, I bet kids that are bullied would have loved a version centered around him.
Yeah, I could see that.
We all knew no matter what, Judy was going to be ok, she had a family business to fall back on. But Nick, Nick had no one.
He only had himself to rely on.
Exactly. Now tell me that isn't a movie that you'd like to see!
