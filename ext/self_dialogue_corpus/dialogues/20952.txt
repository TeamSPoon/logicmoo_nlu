What is your favorite David Lynch film?
I would have to say Blue Velvet.
Really, why is that?
It has so many of the typical Lynch-isms but is also just accessible enough for anyone to enjoy.
What do you mean by Lynch-isms?
Well, it contains the wholesome American suburbs juxtaposed with some of the worst horrors imaginable.
Dennis Hopper really did play an evil villain.
Yeah, his performance was quite haunting.
Ebert criticized the treatment of Isabella Rosellini during the film, but later recanted these concerns.
I think he must have misread the film. Those scenes seemed necessary just to underscore how truly evil Hopper's character was.
I agree, those scenes were necessary. What did you think of Kyle Maclachlan's performance?
I thought he was great. He does a good job playing clean-cut all-American types of characters.
That is similar to his character on Twin Peaks.
Exactly, he is very believable in those kinds of roles.
Laura Dern is also very good.
She is always good, and she is so young in this film.
Yeah it is strange to see the young versions of these actors, but it provides them, especially Dern and Maclachlan with an air of innocence.
Yes it is very strange.
What did you think of the ending?
I think it is one of the best Lynch endings. It is clear that good wins out in this case.
