Britney Spears is the best pop artist out there.
No way. Maybe two decades ago, but not now.
Okay. Who do you think is better?
Well for starters Ariana Grande has much more range and vocal ability than Britney.
I'll give you that, but you can't deny that Britney's voice is unique. On top of that, she is a great performer.
That is true. Her Las Vegas shows were very popular.
Yes, she will always be an icon.
I wonder what made her career blossom so much more than Christina Aguilera's.
I think Britney had the southern belle thing going on which made her seem more lovable.
You may be right, but I would rather listen to Genie in a Bottle than Baby One More Time any day!
