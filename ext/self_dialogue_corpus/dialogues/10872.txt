What did you think of the new Fast & the Furious movie?
Honestly man they need to stop making them.
Why do you say that?
Dude they've already run their course, now the movies are turning into nothing but cgi and b.s. scenes with fast cars!
You have a point. Which movie is your favorite though?
The orginial one! Paul Walker in that first race scene was epic.
You're talking about the one with Ludacris right? When Paul Walker jumps the bridge in his eclipse?
Yes, that was probably one of the best racing scenes in any of the Fast movies.
Oh man I don't know about that. Tokyo Drift had some pretty epic racing scenes too!
Ehh serisouly? That's my least favorite Fast & the Furious movie.
