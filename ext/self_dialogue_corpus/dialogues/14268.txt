Lebron...JAMES
yeah man, he really turns it on in the playoffs
it's crazy to think that he's actually still playing at his peak
he does have a lot of miles on his tires
2 whole seasons of playoff basketball!
but he still keeps a little in reserve
I hope he gets to smash boston in the eastern conference finals
he will, too
then....yikes
yeah, the warriors look unstoppable
we'll see, Lebron showed last year he has another gear when it matters
and nobody on golden state, or hell, nobody ALIVE has that gear
it's fun to watch
especially when the raptors went out of their way to be disrespectful
what were they thinking?
I don't know, but they got their butts whooped for it
sure did, I was laughing at Drake
yeah, he was salty
was that a "drake cries a lot" reference?
sure was, good catch!
