Have you ever seen Jaws?
No, but I've heard a lot about it.
It's pretty scary.
Really? Just looked like some dumb shark movie to me.
Oh, I love shark movies.
Well, me too actually, but that one looks so old.
It is old, but that just means they had to rely more on story and suspense instead of computer graphics.
That's true, I never looked at it like that.
Yea, you should check it out, when that music starts playing, it really gets your blood pumping.
Ok, I think I will.
