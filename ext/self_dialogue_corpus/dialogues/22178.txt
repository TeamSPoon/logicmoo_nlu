Do you know if they are making another Anchorman?
They already made a sequel.
Yeah are they doing a third one?
God, I hope not.
I thought the sequel was good.
It did not do anything for me.
Sometimes they do wait too long to do a second film.
You're right and this is definitely one of those times.
So what would you do?
If you do not do it within 4 years then leave it alone.
All the actors in that movie sort of sold out.
Paul Rudd and David Koechner did not.
Well they never really took off.
Rudd has had alot of leading roles.
But never like Ferrell and Carrell.
Yeah because he did not sell out.
He is a really funny guy
I have liked him in all his roles
How about as Ant-Man
Jury is still out on that one
