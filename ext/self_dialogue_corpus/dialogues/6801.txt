What's your favorite Disney cartoon?
I really like Aladdin the best.  I think the story is good.
I've always been a fan of The Lion King.
Yes, that is a good one.  I think it was released after Aladdin.
I believe so, yes.
Disney was really good there for awhile, they were untouchable.
Yeah, I miss the old style of movies.
I don't really seem them making feel good family movies anymore.
Disney has definitely changed since I was a kid.
Agreed, but I'm sure this generation loves it just like we loved it back then.
