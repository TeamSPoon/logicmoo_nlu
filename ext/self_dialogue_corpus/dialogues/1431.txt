Hey what team do you support in the NFL?
I love my Redskins, I've been a fan since birth!
The Redskins?! Their front office is a total wreck.
I know, its honestly embarrassing. But I believe in Kirk!
Thats fair, Kirk Cousins is a great QB. Completely honestly though, I much prefer Matt Ryan.
Are you a falcons fan?
Yes I am a proud Falcons supporter!
That Superbowl must have been really rough, I thought you guys were going to win it all.
I know, I was really hurt. But this season I just have a good feeling about them.
They will be playing with a chip on their shoulder thats for sure.
Agreed. Plus they have a new stadium, which should give them some motivation as well.
Yeah it looks really nice! And they have the lowest beer prices in the country which is awesome.
I bought tickets to go to the new stadium when the Falcons play the Saints.
That will be a great game! Drew Brees is getting older but hes still awesome. He just needs more pieces around him.
Thats very true, he cant carry the team anymore like he used to.
Yeah, but I think the best QB in the league will be Brady again this year.
He's the ageless wonder, I don't know how he does it.
He might honestly be the greatest QB of all time.
I don't doubt that, although I'd through in an argument for Dan Marino.
The man never won a superbowl but I can see why you are saying that.
