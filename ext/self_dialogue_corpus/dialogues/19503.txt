Do,you like Charlie Daniels?
Yes I do.
Have you ever seen him live?
Yes,several times. Great show.
When he pulls that fiddle out things go up a few notches.
Wow,does it ever.
I love the song Devil went down to Georgia.
He really wails on that one.
How about the souths gonna do it again.
Another great one.
Great southern rock band.
How about the song long haired country boy.
One of his best.
Yea,that's an oldie.
Yes it is.
Isn't he getting up there in age?
I believe he's at least 80.
At least that.
He survived a stroke.
Yes,but he still plays his music
