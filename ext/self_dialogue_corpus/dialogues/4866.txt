What's your favorite thing about going to the baseball games with dad?
Probably how excited he gets.
I love watching Landon play too.
So do I. He's a great catcher.
Remember when he tried out and he caught that seemingly impossible ball?
I knew he'd make the team after that.
So did I. It was amazing.
He really is an excellent catcher.
He's not a bad pitcher either.
Yes, true, but Ron is incredible.
I think he'll get drafted in college.
Definitely.
Do you think Landon will?
I hope so. It's his dream.
I know that and it would be great if he and Ron could be together.
They'd be there to encourage each other. I can't wait to see if they both make it.
Landon has been talking about it for years.
I know and Ron has wanted it since kindergarten at least.
I remember him practicing at recess way back then.
So do I.
