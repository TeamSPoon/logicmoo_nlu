What's up?
Not much, how are you?
Pretty good. See any good movies lately?
Yeah, actually. I've been trying to watch all the Oscar nominees.
Oh nice! Lots of good ones. What did you see?
Most recently I saw Passengers.
What did you think?
It was pretty good, I was surprised!
Yeah I liked it a lot too.
What about you? Have you seen any Oscar winners or nominees?
Yeah I've seen a bunch.
What's been your favorite?
Definitely Lion.
Oh, I really wanna see that! Any others?
I liked Passengers too.
Yeah I'm not a sci-fi fan, but really liked it.
Did you see Hidden Figures?
Not yet, but it's on my watch list.
That's definitely one I do want to see!
Let me know when you do- I'd love to talka bout it!
