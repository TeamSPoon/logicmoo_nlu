HEy what do you think about the San Diego Chargers this year?
I don't think anything about the San Diego Chargers.
What do you mean?
The Charger franchise moved to L.A. The Raiders are moving too.
The Raiders are moving? To where?
They're gonna be going to Las Vegas.
That's too bad. Marshawn Lynch just signed that contract with them, and he loves Oakland.
Yeah, but he'll be long gone before they actually move.
Why is that?
Well they won't be moving for a few years I guess.
Oh ok. What was the name of the running back they had before Marshawn.
Latavius Murray.  He was pretty good, I don't know why they didn't just keep him.
Yeah he was solid, I think he ended up going to the Vikings.
Sure did, then Adrian Peterson had to figure out somewhere to go.
Yeah it's funny how these kinds of carousels just happen.
I think ADrian was done anyway.  He looked way past his prime last year.
Yeah he looked slow. Still good, but slow.
I don't think these guys know when to call it quits, they think they'll be good forever.
Yeah like Brett Favre.
Yeah, I still hear his name come up sometimes with interest of playing.
