We watched a hilarious movie last night.
Which one?
Called Heat.
Who's in it?
Mellissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock.
Two good actresses.
Yes and those two were great together.
Did you rent it?
No it was on HBO.
I'll have to check the listings. Is it new?
No, a few years old.
Anyone else good in it?
Yeah, but I don't know their names.
Was Bullock a cop?
Actually they both were.
Weird. Were they partners?
They ended up being partners.
Mellissa McCarthy is funny.
She is.
She's been in so many great movies.
