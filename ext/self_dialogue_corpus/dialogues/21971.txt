What is your favorite classic movie?
Hmm I think Casablanca?
I love that! Humphrey Bogart was such a great actor
And I loved him with Lauren Bacall
Weren't they married?
I think they were! Did they meet during Casablanca?
I'm not sure. I did love him in African Queen too
That was a great movie Katharine Hepburn, was a great co-star
We should have a classic move night! Watch Casablanca and African Queen
What other movie should we add?
Maybe Roman Holiday?
Yes and then Rear Window
I think Hitchcock movies would be fun
That would be a whole other night!
Maybe add the Birds
Vertigo too!
and don't forget Psyco!
How could I forget that's the best one!
Okay so classic movie night or Hitchcock movie night?
I think we should do both!
