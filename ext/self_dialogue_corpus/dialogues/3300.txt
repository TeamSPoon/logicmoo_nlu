Did you read Goosebumps as a kid?
Yup fun books!
Now, did you see the movie?
I did, but on my own. No way was I seeing that in theaters alone.
You'd probably get arrested.
Funny. So what's your question?
What did you think of it?
I don't know how well it stuck to the books or not, but I did enjoy it.
Is it appropriate for kids? I'm looking to show it to mine.
I'd say above 10 is fine. it's not scary as much as it is nostalgia for us.
