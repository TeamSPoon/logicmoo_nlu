Why is Katy Perry doing TV Commercials?
I know, right? Make up and credit card commercials.
I love her music. It gets better and better each new song.
For real. I love listening to her in the car when i am driving home from work.
Me too! That's funny. She makes Rush hour bearable.
Im so glad she dumped that Russel Brand guy.
Yes, he was aweful.
Hopefully she will find someone better.
She should look into more movie parts.
I'd like to see her act but i also like her music.
Timberlake seems to make the transisition back and forth from music and acting.
True. She could do the same i believe.
She's just so beautiful.
And her voice, i just love hearing her sing.
I got to go online and see when her next album is coming out.
Good idea, or at least see if she is gonna perform here in the Tampa area again anytime soon.
That would be awesome, i missed her last time she was here.
Sorry to hear that, it was a good show.
You got to go!?!
Yes, my boyfriend suprised me with tickets
