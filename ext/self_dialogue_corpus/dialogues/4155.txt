What is your favorite thriller movie?
That would have to be Silence of the Lambs.
Man, i have seen that one.  Hannible really freaked me out.
yeah, anthony hopkins did a really good job playing that character.
i think buffalo bill may have been worse though.  that character was really demented.
he definitely had some mental issues.
yeah, i can see someone wanting to be a woman, but killing women to make a suit out of their skin?  creepy.
very true.  the way he kept them down in that pit was the worst part.
it was kind of cool how hannible helped starling catch him in the end though.
yeah, and the fact that he called her after he escaped asking about her.
