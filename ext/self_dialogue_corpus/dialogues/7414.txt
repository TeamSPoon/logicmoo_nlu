I better hurry and buy my kids tickets to see Cars 3 this weekend. They are so excited.
Oh, I forgot that was coming out. I need to get tickets for my daughter too.
Is she a big fan of the movies?
She loves them! Mater is her favorite character.
I like him too, but Lightning McQueen is my favorite. How about you?
I adore Sally, but that is probably because I love Bonnie Hunt so much. She is always so good in her roles.
She really is. Did you know she is going to be in Toy Story 4?
I had heard that, but wasn't positive it was true. That's exciting.
I know! All of these great Disney movies coming out around the same time. I better start planning our trips to the movie theater.
Tell me about it. The kids are going to get spoiled going to the movies all of the time.
