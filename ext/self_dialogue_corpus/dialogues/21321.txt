Which do you like better: Star Wars or Star Trek?
Star Wars, hands down. It is so much better than Star Trek.
How is Star Wars better than Star Trek?
Star Wars has a much more entertaining story. Star Trek is just for nerds.
But Star Wars isn't even science fiction, it is a space opera.
...and Star Trek is just for nerds who like green aliens.
Star Trek is so much more than physics. It's true science fiction in that it reflects on modern society through a future lense.
George Lucas was a visionary.
George Lucas was a terrible writer. He basically turned the Wagner epic Ring Cycle into a space movie.
OK, I grant that Lucas is not THAT good of a writer, but you have to give him some credit.
I do give him credit. He managed to make a space opera movie.
Why do you not think Lucas is that good of a writer?
Aside from Episodes one two and three, I don't think he had his vision for episodes five and six until after episode 4 was such a hit.
What do you mean by that?
I mean, he wrote himself into a corner where there was a love triangle between a brother, sister and smuggler.
Well that is just because they didn't know they were brother and sister at the time Leia kissed Luke.
Let's also talk about sexism and racism. There are literally only three women characters in the entire original trilogy.
No way. There is Aunt Beru, Mon Mothma.....and Leia...What the heck?
There is also a female rebel officer who says the wholey insignificant line of "Stand by, Ion Controlâ€¦ Fire."
Speaking of which, why don't they just use Ion Cannons to destroy all star destroyers?
