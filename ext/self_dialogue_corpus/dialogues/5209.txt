Do you have a fovorite Disney movie from the Disney Renaissance?
Which movies were part of the Renaissance era again?
The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, and Tarzan.
Beauty and the Beast was probably my favorite, but they're all such good movies. No wonder it's called the Disney Renaissance!
I liked Beauty and the Beast too! I always wanted to be Bell.
My favorite thing about the movie was the songs.
Which song is your favorite?
Oh, same as everybody, Be Our Guest. How about you?
It's hard to choose a favorite but I always liked the first song Belle sings about her little town.
Yeah, all the songs are great.
