Is Tim Burton coming out with anything?
I'm not sure, but I hope so.
I know. I've been hooked on his films sice Edward Scissorhands.
Such a good movie.
He really put Johnny Depp on the map.
And Winona Ryder.
Oh, yeah!
She was so good in Betleguise.
You mean Beetlejuice?
Oh, yeah. I always want to say it like the star.
The star?
You've never heard of Bettleguise?
No.
It's one of the closest stars to Earth.
Huh? Is that where Burton got the name.
I'm not sure.
I did hear there was a sequel in the works.
No way!
That's what I heard.
That would be sooo cool!
