what upcoming movie are you excited to see?
I really want to see Wish Upon.
I don't think I have heard of that movie.
It is a horror film should be released in theaters soon.
Anyone I may know in it?
Joey king I believe is the lead, I know her mostly from season 1 of fargo tv series.
Was she also in the conjuring?
Yes. I think it may be the same director.
Leonetti was on the conjuring and insidious.
Yep same director. I think it will be very scary.
He seems to have put out some scary ones so I would think that is highly likely.
Wish upon is apparently based on a short story the monkey's paw.
That seems vaguely familiar, did thesimpsons do an episode on that story too?
I have no clue, but thought that it seems possible.
Who else if anyone is in it?
I think ryan phillipe.
Really? That surprises me. I expect him to be evil.
Maybe we shall see.
He was really great in Cruel Intentions.
I loved him in that one. Also stop-loss.
