I have been playing music since i was 4.
Really?  What do you play?
Well, I started with piano.  I played my first recital when i was 4.  Then I learned guitar and tried to learn drums.
Wow! That's impressive.
I have always loved music.  What does that song say? "We've been together for such a long time, my music and me"
The Jackson's song.
Yup.  Little Michael sure could sing his little heart out.
He was an icon, and gone too soon.
It seems that all the greats die young. Joplin, Hendrix, Michael, and most recently Chris Cornell.
I was so sad to hear of his passing.
Yes it was a shame, but he left an incredible musical legacy.
I was really impressed with his solo album Euphoria Morning.
There was one song in particular on that album called Can't Change Me.  I don't know why but I really loved that one.
He was so talented.  I also liked the group he branched into called Temple of the Dog.
Pushin Forward Back, Say Hello to Heaven, great songs.  Did that group only do one album?
I think so.  I don't remember hearing about any other releases.
I think some people just burn too bright for this world.  Music icons shine the brightest I suppose.
Yes it's a shame.
But at least we have their musical legacy to enjoy.
Yes and to introduce a whole new generation to.
