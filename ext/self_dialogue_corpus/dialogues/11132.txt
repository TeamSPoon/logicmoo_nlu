Where did you get your new hat?
Do you like it?
Yeah, it's really cool. What store did you get it from?
I got it down at the J Crew at the mall. There were some really cool belts there, too.
Really? What kind of belts did you see?
There were a bunch! Black leather, brown leather, and a really cool white one.
What's up with the white one?
It was a Jennifer Lopez belt, with white leather and silver trim.
Jennifer Lopez, huh? Did she have any other clothing there?
Yeah. I saw quite a few of her pieces. She also had some capris.
Did you buy a pair of capris?
No, but I was thinking about it. They were pretty pricey.
How much were they? Her stuff is always expensive.
They were eighty dollars each! That's too much.
How about tops? Did you see any?
I saw a really cute red top with blue trim. Don't tell anyone, but I bought that one.
Nice! Does it have a design on it?
Not really. It's just plain red with some blue trim around the collar. It's a boat neck.
I love boat necks, but I can't wear them anymore.
Yeah. I prefer crewnecks now.
