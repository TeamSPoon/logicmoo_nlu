What do you think of Stevie ray vaugn?
Oh he was great.
Great musician.
One of my favorite guitarists.
Mine too.
I heard he had cleaned up his act before he died.
What do you mean?
Stopped drinking and doing drugs.
Boy that seems to happen a lot.
Yes,like John Lennon.
He cleaned up in the seventies.
Yes,only to be gunned down by an idiot.
I'll never forget that night.
Like it just happened.
I heard it on Monday night football.
So did I.
Howard Cosell breaking in.
The worst news I've ever heard.
Giving me chills thinking about it.
God that was terrible.
