Did you like Pineapple Express?
Its my favorite James Franco movie.
I thought Seth Rogen was hilarious.
Danny McBride was a great part as well.
And Craig Robinson.
Yeah he was barely in it though.
But his scenes were hilarious.
I tell you what, they do a great job with the ensemble casts.
The plot to the movie was too funny.
It was lighthearted.
Would you call it a stoner flick?
Not really but in a way, yes.
The action scene with stuff blowing up made it a stoner flick for me.
Yeah it was a bit unbelievable, that sequence.
I still think the script was well written.
It was definitely well written for stoners.
You didnt find it hilarious?
Yeah I did but some parts I rolled my eyes at.
I loved when he was the process server as the movie started.
Yeah thats what got me into the entire thing.
