Who is your all-time favorite football player?
I loved Franco Harris.
Me too!
Are you from Pittsburgh?
Yes, how about you?
No, but I"m from Pennsylvania and we bleed black and gold.
Cool!
Have you been to any games this season?
Yeah, out in Pittsburgh.
Yeah, we went once too and even went to the science museum there as well.
Did you ever see them play the Bears?
Not in person but love to watch on TV.
I hope to get to that match-up this year.
When does the season start?
I think the first game is September 10th.
I can't wait.
Yeah, I hope they make it to the Superbowl.
Me too!
Should be another exciting season.
I hope so.
