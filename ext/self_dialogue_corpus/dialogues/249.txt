Hey, I'm thinking about watching a movie today. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I heard Wonder Woman was good.
That's the one with Gal Gadot, right?
I think so. Chris Pine is in it too.
DC movies haven't been too good recently.
What do you mean?
Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad were kind of all over the place.
Right right right. I know what you mean. Wonder Woman is way better though.
I'll check it out then.
Have fun!
