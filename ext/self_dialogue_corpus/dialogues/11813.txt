What is your favorite song from Yellow Submarine?
I think it might be Yellow Submarine
You didnt like All You Need is Love?
Thats not what you asked me.
You are right, I think the best is All You Need is Love.
I think its great too but Yellow Submarine as a song was awesome.
The album was a bit different.
It was kind of a step back but you cant keep putting out albums like that.
Sure you can especially this group wrote so many good ones
I just feel like they put out better ones.
