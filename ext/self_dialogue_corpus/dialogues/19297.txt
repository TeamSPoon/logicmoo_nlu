Do you like punk rock?
Not particularly, it doesn't sound smooth to me.
There are a lot of smooth punk rock sounds out there, they sound good.
Maybe I just haven't heard them.
There are so many I've been listening to lately.
Which one is your favorite?
Well a lot of my songs cross genres.
Ok that is interesting.
Yes but you have probably heard my favorites.
Which one do you like the most, right now?
I like Get Free by the Vines, that song is such a jam.
Oh I remember that.
This track is amazing.
I think I remember it, that is a great song.
Yes it is smooth and hard at the same time.
That is great for punk rock.
Yes to have that polished smooth sound as well as super hard powerful music.
Yes that is quite the combo.
That is why I like it.
I will listen to it tonight.
