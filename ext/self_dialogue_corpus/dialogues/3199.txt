Hank Williams is singing the intro to NFL Monday night football again!
That's cool, he did a great job before.
Just a few more months and football is back.  I'm so excited!
Me too!
Are you going to any Vikings games this year?
I might, but I have to work a lot of the time on Sundays.
Maybe they will have a Monday night game.
That would be great.
I'll be heading to Seattle in October to watch the Seahawks.
That's awesome.  Their stadium looks so cool.
Yes they are the loudes venue in the NFL.
The 12th man!
That giant Viking horn at the Vikings Stadium gets the crowd going.
I know it is so loud in their new stadium.
Do you think Bridgewater will be back this season?
I hope so, but his injury sounded pretty serious last year.
I heard that it was bad, but he at least has the best doctors around him.
Yes they should be able to either get him healthy or tell him his career is over.
Let's hope he gets to play he was looking good the season before he got hurt.
I know, and if not I think Sam Bradford is still there.
