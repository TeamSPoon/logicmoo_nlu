What is your favorite nostalgic movie?
Definitely The Princess Bride.
Why? You love Star Wars more than living.
Because it's just a ton of ridiculous fun, and Robin Wright is phenomenal.
You had a thing for her.
Of course. And this was one of Carey Elwes' first roles before he got big.
So, it's half hipster reasons, half attraction?
Okay let me try again.
Go ahead.
It's crazy campy and low-budget, but it's so well-made.
How can it be campy and well-made?
Well, take the fight scenes. Indigo vs Westley, for instance.
What was campy about it?
Well, the dialogue was ridiculous, and you can see the mats when they land their big jumps.
Okay, so what's so good about it?
The actual choreography is outstanding, with a long fight scene.
For me, the music is super campy.
Yeah, it sounds like it was all 1980s MIDI, like they couldn't afford an orchestral recording.
That and the ROUSs, who are insanely stupid and impractical.
Yeah, they're there for looks. There's no way they'd survive and sustain their height and weight.
