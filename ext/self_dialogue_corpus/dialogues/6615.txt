What's your least favorite Disney Pixar movie?
Most of them are really great, but the Cars series, 1 and 2, haven't done much for me.
Yeah, I am mainly perplexed by the premise of the movie.
Same. Kids like cars I guess?
That's true.
I wonder how well Cars 2 did at the box office.
Google says 562 million dollars.
Wow! A half billion dollars from a movie.
It's super impressive.
Yes, although, it's also super impressive how much they spent making it. 200 million!
