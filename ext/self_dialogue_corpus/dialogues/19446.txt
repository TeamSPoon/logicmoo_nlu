have you yet?
Yes I have checked it out.
Are you speaking of something just like this?
Yes, that is the album I am talking ofbout.
I really like their rhythmic sounds.
yes their rhythmic sounds are good.
Is that all you have to think about it?
No, I just realized the album is just remixes of the same song.
What?
Yeah I had no Idea until I just looked it up on google.
Wow, I don't know why they would release an album of the same song five times.
Wow, how can someone charge for that?
The year 2017 and we have something like this.
What a shame.
I agree.
I don't actually like the chainsmokers anymore.
Neither do I.
Okay goodbye.
