You've seen the Star Wars movies right?
Of course I have, who hasn't?
Who is your favorite character of the original three?
I would have to say Lea.
Interesting, why is that?
To this day I still remember seeing that hologram say "Help me, Obi-Won Kanobi.  You're my only hope.
That was an exciting moment in the series.
Who was your favorite.
Yoda, when he said "Do or do not, there is no try".  Was my favorite moment.
People still use that today.
