Have you seen all of the Cars movies?
I saw the first one and the second one but I don't think I will see the third.
Why don't you think you will see it?
I really wasn't that impressed with the second one.  I didn't like it at all.
The first one was pretty good.  The spy storyline in the second one was a little bit far fetched for me.
The trailer for the third movie looked pretty intense though.  I heard it scared a bunch of kids.
Yeah it only shows Lightning McQueen crashing and that's it.
I think they are bringing back most of the characters from the first one  though.
I know they are bringing back Doc, which should be interesting.
I heard that it will be about Lightning getting older and trying to compete with younger cars.
