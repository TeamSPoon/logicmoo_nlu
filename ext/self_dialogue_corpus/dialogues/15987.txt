I am wanting to start making music again
Why did you stop
Because i got sick for a bit
Oh thats awful
Yeah i was just feeling awful
Well i am glad you are feeling better
So am i
What do you want to make
I want to make something moving and ambient
That sounds different
Yeah  i do not want something commercial
But that makes money
I do not want money
What do you want
To just make something i enjoy
Well i can relate to that
To me music is a passion and should be done for that not money
I understand i guess its just nice to do what you like and make money
I mean it would be nice but not the motive
I agree
