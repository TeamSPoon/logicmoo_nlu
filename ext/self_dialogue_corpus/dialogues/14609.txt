Did you watch the game?
Which game? The rockets and the spurs?
Yeah, the spurs won in overtime! And James Hardens final shot got blocked.
Wow I missed it! So Harden missed a three point shot?
Yes! Genobly blocked it and the Rockets were not able to score again.
Oh the deception. The Rockets are my favorite team!
Ew I hate James Harden, he is so cocky and he is not an mvp.
Who is your favorite player, then if you don't think that James Harden is an MVP?
Klay Thompson #11, duh! He is so cute I call him my boyfriend.
Wow that is so neat, I met him once before in Oakland at a fundraiser.
NO WAY! Why am I just now hearing about this? Who else was there?
Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Ian Clark and Javale Mcgee! Half of the Warriors team.
What was the fundraiser for? How is the Warriors score right now?
The fundraiser was for children with cancer all proceeds went to St. Judges hospital. The Warriors are doing great!
Basketball is such an exciting sport watching the players go back and forth with the clock counting down.
Do you go to live basketball games ever?
Sometimes, once I got to view an NCAA tournament live!
I bet that was exciting! How many rebounds? What was the winning score?
98-40! There were 16 rebounds throughout the game.
It was great catching up with you, maybe we can catch a game together sometime?
