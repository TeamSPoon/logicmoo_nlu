Have you seen La La Land?
I have! How did you like it?
I thought it was pretty good. I am a big musical person though.
So am I. I thought it was interesting how the singing in the movie was actually pretty average.
Oh that is true. I hadn't really noticed that.
Yeah, Ryan Gosling is a great actor but maybe not the most talented singer!
Have you seen Manchester by the Sea?
No I haven't. Have you?
Yes, it is incredibly sad. I'm not sure I can recommend it.
That is what I've heard as well. Did it come out in 2016?
It did. So did Moonlight. Did you see Moonlight?
Yep! It was fantastic.
I thought so too.
Do you think it should have beat La La Land for Best Picture?
Absolutely! That was really crazy.
I know. Both are great movies though.
Definitely. Are you going to see the new Baywatch movie?
Probably not, I never saw the original show. Did you?
Nope, I think I might go see Baywatch later this week though.
Let me know how it is!
