I wonder why you don't hear too much rock music on the radio these days.
Well you do hear Coldplay and Imagine Dragons sometimes.
That's true, but I'm really more into alternative stuff.
You mean like Pearl Jam or Kaiser Chiefs?
I really liked the last Fleet Foxes album, but I don't hear that on the radio.
Well they're a bit indie, aren't they?
That's true. I guess you have to be on a big label.
Pretty much. But there are good rock bands on the radio.
Like who, though?
The Killers and the Red Hot Chili Peppers still get airplay.
