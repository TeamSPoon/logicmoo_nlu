I really like Lady Gaga's new song, do you?
Yes, I love it!  I really like Lady Gaga.
Me too.  I just saw her on an episode of Rupaul's Drag Race. Did you see it?
No!  I'll have to go back and watch that.
She was so nice and helpful on it, she seems like a nice person.
Oh, that's awesome!  What's your favorite song of hers?
I really like Paparazzi. How about you?
I like Alejandro.
Oh yeah that's a good one too.
It's my favorite!
