Whose music do you like better, Katy Perry or Taylor Swift?
Personally I'd have to say Katy Perry. Although I do like quite a few of Taylor Swift's songs.
Yea I feel like I'm too old to be super into Taylor Swift. Her music is more for like young teens.
Yea, it's harder to relate to her songs when you're not like 22 years old.
Katy Perry I feel like is more relatable though, even though a lot of her songs aren't like super meaningful or deep.
Yea, but they're just like really fun pop songs, they don't necessarily have to be super inspiring or deep.
True, I guess it's more important for them to be catchy and easy for people to sing along to.
Exactly. Like her songs California Gurls and Teenage Dream.
Yea, even my boyfriend knows the lyrics to those songs.
Haha! Well just goes to show how catchy they are.
