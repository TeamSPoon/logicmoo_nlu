There are better movies, though.
Like what?
The Magnificent Seven
Oh yeah, that movie was pretty good!
Though it was a little depressing, though.
How, so?
It felt like these guys were really hateful in the "Hateful Eight".
Yup, any other good ones?
Yeh, the Fantastic Four!
What's with the numbers now?
Ummm, too bad no movies with the number Five or Six?
I heard of possibly the Sinister Six could come out?
Dude, Spider-Man's just getting started with his movies.
HE ALREADY HAS LIKE 5-6 movies!
True, he has the Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2, the two original spider man movies, and now this one.
What about the Flash, or Martian Manhunter? They need to get some movies.
You know who really needs a movie? Hawkgirl!
Or, maybe
How about the Justice League? This one might be interesting!
I'm down to watch that one.
