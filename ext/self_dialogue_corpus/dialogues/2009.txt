Hey, man. About a month left before football starts.
More like about a month left before Brady get shis sixth.
Oh, man, here we go. They won't even take the AFC this year.
Man, you're crazy. Who's gonna beat them?
I don't know... Just potentially the Chiefs, Ravens, Raiders, Steelers, or Bengals.
So the team they beat to go to the Super Bowl last year is somehow going to beat them?
It's a new season, man. Anyone can win!
Yeah, besides the Bills!
That much is true. That's a universal truth: the Bills are terrible.
But seriously, the Pats have the best team. How can you deny this?
I'm not denying it. But there are some other great teams in the NFL this year.
The Cowboys look great too, I will admit.
Them. Also, I think the Falcons are gonna stay consistent.
Blah, blah, blah. They can never recover from that last Super Bowl embarrassment.
We'll see! They will definitely be in the playoffs.
Where they'll fizzle out! I wonder if they can even beat the Panthers this year!?
Oh, come on. Cam is done.
How is Cam done? He was MVP two seasons ago!
Well, he peaked, if you ask me!
Well, I guess we will see in about a month!
