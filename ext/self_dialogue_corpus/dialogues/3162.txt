What is your biggest fear when it comes to LeVeon Bell getting a new deal?
I am like coach Tomlin and I don't live in my fears, man
I'd be willing to pay that much for what he brings to the table.
I think they work something out...
God I hope so
Only thing is that he's shown a lack of discipline twice and hurt the team with drug-related suspensions.
Yup.That will always make me worry about a guy's professionalism and commitment after he's paid big money.
Yes...Leveon is the most important player on our offense aside from Ben.
I think Bell will get 11 million a year
But whether it is with us or another team next year is the question.
I have no fear that Bell will perform as an elite back when healthy and available.
Future injuries are what I worry about.
He willll still do better than most rbs, but it's a tough job.
They usually burn out at 30.
I think he will last longer than that though
RB is a position that takes a lot of abuse.
True. Guys don't last very long there and Bell has a history of injuries.
Yeah...I think one more injury and he is done.
Please do not say that...lol
Sorry, just the cynic in me.
