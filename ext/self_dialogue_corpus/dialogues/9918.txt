Remember that Mos Def jam Ms Fat Booty?
Good song. Can you believe that came out almost 20 years ago?
Don't remind me. I still play that album all the time.
Yeah, but that song was definitely the stand out song on the album.
It's one of my favorites, but I still like UMI Says best.
That song is really uplifting and sweet. Makes me miss my grandmother.
No doubt. I think of that song as a gift.
Everything Mos Def does is a gift to the world.
It's hard to argue with that. Artists like him are way too rare.
That's why we're still listening all these years later.
