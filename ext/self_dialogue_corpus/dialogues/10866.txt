Do you know which character I feel was underused in 'Fate of the Furious?'
Which character?
Ramsey.
She was the character portrayed by Nathalie Emmanuel from 'Game of Thrones' right?
Yea that's her.  She barely did anything in the last movie.
I did notice that too.  She was almost just there for Tyrese and Tej to fight over.
Also, the fact that she is a super hacker is almost redundant.
Yea.  I mean why does the group need another hacker when Tej has already been doing everything else for them?
I understood Ramsey's role in Furious 7, but they sort of shoehorned her in.
I hope they utilize her character more in the next movie, as she is a phenomenal actress.
