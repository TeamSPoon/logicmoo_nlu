Did you like what Gaga did at the Super Bowl?
I think she picked out great songs to perform.
Bad Romance was a little stale.
I mean its older but people like that.
She was able to mix in the old and the new
I think performing slower songs would be a determent to her.
I dont think thats accurate at all
Why not?
You need to slow down the pace sometimes
I guess it could make a bigger audience happy
