Are you excited about the season starting in less than two months?
I am very excited. It's going to be an interesting year, especially for quarterbacks.
People are saying that Eli Manning doesn't have much left in his tank, and that Drew Brees won't be playing much.
I heard the same thing. Tom Brady is getting older, too - though he says he feels better than he did 15 years ago.
What about Aaron Rodgers? I read somewhere where he is expected to have a pretty good year, which is good news for the Packers..
Their season is really back-loaded with the easy teams, so they could very well make the playoffs.
My team (Carolina Panthers) won't be going with them. Predictions are they won't even win 10 games this year. So much for Cam Newton being one of the best quarterbacks of all times, huh?
Yeah, he really has been disappointing since that breakout season in 2015. I wonder what happened. Too many expectations?
Maybe - that or the Panthers just aren't that well-coached.
Newton just doesn't get a lot of protection from his offensive line. That might be the biggest problem.
Who do you think will have the worst season?
I dunno. Probably the San Francisco 49'ers. Maybe they need to bring Joe Montana out of retirement.
Ha! He could probably do better!
You talked about Aaron Rodgers. Why has he held up better than Brady?
I'm not really sure. Maybe Brady has been injured more than Rodgers. They're about the same age, aren't they?
Yeah, I think they are both in their late 30s.
You would think that Rodgers would have a tougher time physically from all those games he plays in Green Bay.
Well, it's not that much warmer at home games for the Patriots!
That's true.
Too bad they all can't be played in Miami!
