Hello.  How do you like the music of Justin Bieber?
Hi there.  I used to really dislike him.  His music sounded very babyish.
Yea, I kind of of agree.  I wasn't too crazy about it myself.
I felt like he reallly didn't even deserve to be famous as he was only on Youtube.
That's true.  Lots of people nowadays get famous that way.
True.  But over the years, his music has gotten better.
I agree.  At first just my kids liked him.
I can see why they would like him.  I think now he appeals to more adults.
I really like him now.  I guess his voice has changed.
Yea, he doesn't sound like a baby anymore.
No, he doesn't.  His sound is more mature.
Yea it is.  I like the collaborations he does too.
I really his like song Despacito.
I agree.  He can really sing with anyone.  His song with DJ Khaled is cool too.
I'm the One, right?
Yes, that's it.  I love that song.  That song puts me in a good mood.
Me too.  It feels like summer to me.
True.  If I had a convertible, I would drive around town with the top down blasting that song.
Ha, ha.  I can't wait to hear some more of his music.  He should do a collaboration with Selena.
I agree.  I wish they would get back together.
