What kind of music do you like?
I actually listen to a lot of pop.
Hey, me too. Do you like Britney Spears?
Yeah! But I prefer her older stuff.
So do I. "Baby One More Time" and "Oops! I Did It Again" are probably my favorites.
Mine too! I also like "Toxic" a lot.
Did you ever see her movie Crossroads?
Yeah, but what I'd really like is to see her in concert.
I'd love to see her in Las Vegas!
Me too! That would be so awesome!
