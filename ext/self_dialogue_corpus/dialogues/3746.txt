Did you see the movies the fugitive?
I did!, Harrison Ford is great in it.
I agree, the whole part about the one armed man was really interesting.
Right? not to mention the twist at the end.
Yea that was a really good twist.
I agree, did you see Enemy of state?
Is that the one with Will Smith?
Yeah, it also had Gene Hackman.
Oh, right. Yeah, I saw that. It was pretty good.
I thought it was great, maybe the most underrated Will Smith movie.
