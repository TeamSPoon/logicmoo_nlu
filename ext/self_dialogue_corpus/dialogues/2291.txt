Did you hear about Jarvis Landry?
No what happened to him?
He has hopes to land a new deal with the Miami Dolphins soon.
So what is the problem?
He doesn't want to be engaged in contract negotiations once the season starts.
What? Thats silly. Why would he say that?
He says he wants to focus completely on the game and not have to multi task.
I can understand that to a degree but I still think it's a bad idea.
I hope he makes a good deal with the team.
Why do you say that?
Well he's one of ths most underpaid players in the league?
Underpaid? How much is he making?
He's making $900,000.
Thats underpaid!?
Well compared to others in his position.
There has to be some reason for the low pay. Is he a bad player?
No. Actually the very opposite.
Oh so he is basically asking for a raise.
Yeah actually you could say that.
I'm sure he will get some kind of increase in pay but just under a million a year is good in my opinion.
