I want to see guardians of the galaxy 2
Me too, I'm hoping to go see it this weekend
Same, I have the first one recorded so I can rewatch it first
That's a good idea, I wish I thought of that
I also want to see the new baywatch movie, it looks interesting
It does, doesn't it have Zach Efron in it
Yes I believe so
I think it will be a good movie
Me too, the previews look good.
They do.
Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw the boss a few days ago
That movie was so funny
It was, Melissa mccarthy is great
Shes so vulgar she's funny
Exactly, she doesn't care what anyone thinks
Definitely not
It what makes her movies so funny though
Yea, I liked identity thief
I liked tammy
