Do you like movies with Fred Astaire?
I love Fred Astaire!  I think he is a lot better than Gene Kelly.
Oh, I don't agree.  I think they are both great but Kelly is more masculine.
Fred is elegant and still manly while Kelly is like a truck driver.
Oh no. Kelly is athletic and can do different kinds of dancing besides tap dancing.
But I don't anything can touch Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth together.
Now I've never seen them in a flim together.
Try You Were Never Lovelier.
I will.  My favorite Gene Kelly move is Invitation to the Dance.
Oh, I don't like that one. I like movies with plots.
Like Singin' in the Rain?
I like Singin' in the Rain.  But I don't like On the Town.
Have you seen the Pirate?
That movie is AWFUL.
But the dancing is great.
I don't agree.
But have you seen Yolanda and the Thief?
Yes.  It's not THAT terrible.
Yes it is, oh yes it is. But I will give you his movies with Ginger Rogers.
Thank you.
