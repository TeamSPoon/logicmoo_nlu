So the 8 is then what?
It's currently out in the theaters. We should go watch it
What's it about, though
I guess the same stuff. Except Dom gets seduced by this girl. Or something.
But he's married?
Yep. And he goes off and gets Hobbs arrested while stealing some EMP thing for the girl, so they can go steal the God's eye
God's eye again. That's kinda getting old.
Well, that's the premise anyway. Anyway this Cipher girl blackmails Dom to doing more jobs for her.
And the English guy joins the team? Deckard guy from Furious 7?
Looks that way, Maybe he wanted in the action. i don't know. Anyway, we should go see it.
