Have you seen furious 7?
Yes, I think so.
Do you remember the air plane scene?
You mean the one where they drive the cars out of the plane?
That's the one.
What about it?
Do you remember Roman Pierce being terrified?
I do that was hilarious.
That had to be my favorite part of the whole franchise.
Yeah that made me laugh for awhile.
