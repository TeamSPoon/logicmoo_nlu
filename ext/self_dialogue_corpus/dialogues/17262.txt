What were you listening to this afternoon?
I was listening to some Metallica. I used to like them when I was young and haven't heard their music for a while.
Their new album that came out last year, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct?
No, I pretty much only listen to their older music. In my mind, they stopped making music after 1989.
So And Justice For All was the last album by them that you liked?
There were a couple of good Black Album songs but they really lost their edge after that. Enter Sandman was okay but not that heavy really.
Yeah if someone had never heard of Metallica before and you played them Ride the Lightning and then Load they would think they were two completely different bands.
James Hetfield seems like a completely different person in his older years.
I heard that their new album is sounding much more like their original stuff.
There's something that sound like For Whom the Bell Tolls?
Not exactly like that but maybe more along the lines of the song Hit the Lights from their first album
Interesting, I'll have to give that a list. What's a good song from Hardwired... to Self-Destruct?
Well the song named Hardwired is good. Also a song called Moth to Flame isn't bad either.
What's your favor Metallica album?
I like Mastr Of Puppets like most people but I also really like the Garage Days albums. Those are aways pretty cool.
Yeah I like their cover versions of Misfits songs. It's interesting to hear a metal band's version of punk rock songs.
What are some good Metallica videos to watch on YouTube?
My favorites are the live in Seattle from 1989 videos. That concert looked amazing and I wish I could have been there.
I think I've seen some of those clips, that was Metallica at the peak. What's the best song from that concert?
I really liked the live version of Blackened that they did. It sounded very tight and heavy.
