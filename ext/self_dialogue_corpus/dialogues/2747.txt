What do you think of the NFL?
It's incredible.
I think they are the top sport out there in America.
Others might say baseball, but football has the wow factor.
Where else can you sit in front of your tv and feel like you are at the game?
I can't think of anywhere else.
It's such a unifying sport.
The action and excitement just radiate throughout my body when I watch it.
I think a lot of people feel that way.
Watching the NFL players tackle each other brings a rush to me.
I love seeing them race across the field to the goal line.
The kick-off excites me as well.
I can't believe how far those guys can kick the ball.
They have feet of steel.
They have bodies of steel.
They are solid.
What I like best is cheering them on in my favorite jersey.
You are one dedicated fan.
Yes, I have my own Eagles room in my house.
Recliner and all?
