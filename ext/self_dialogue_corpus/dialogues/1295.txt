Hey! Football season is coming up!
Yeah, I'm stoked. Preseason starts in August, I think.
What do you think of the rookies?
I don't really know. We'll have to wait and see if there's another Dak Prescott this year.
Speaking of which, do you think the Cowboys will be as good?
Honestly, I think they'll be better than last year.
Oh yeah? Why?
They've still got the best O-Line in the game.
That's true.
Their offense will probably only get better with more chemistry.
Defense is still an issue for them though.
Yeah, I think they meant to address that in free agency and the draft this year though.
It's crazy that Dak and Zeke were in MVP talks as rookies though.
Seriously. Dallas really lucked out in drafting both of those guys.
I think Tony Romo will be a good broadcaster though.
Probably. Why?
He's a charismatic guy, and he's gotta be used to being in front of a camera by now.
Makes sense. I'll be sure to watch.
Looking like a good season.
For sure.
