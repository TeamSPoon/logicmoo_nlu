I am so excited to go to the Kanye West concert next weekend.
Wow, you got tickets?
Yes, I got the last weekend on Seatgeek.
You must have spent a fortune!
Yes, i did but it is worth it.
Do you think he is going to play any songs from Graduation?
I sure hope so, those are his best songs.
I know, Yeezus is a close second but it doesn't beat Graduation.
What do you think of The Life of Pablo?
it has great songs such as Fade, Waves and Wolves.
Wolves featuring Sia is simply jaw dropping.
I remember the first time i heard it on Saturday Night Life.
That was the song of the night.
I am so glad he added that version to the album.
I remember the outcry from fans when he changed the song completely.
I know, i was one of the upset ones.
Sia brings the song to a whole new level.
Her voice is one of a kind.
I wish she was on tour with him, I can't wit to hear Wolves live.
Maybe next time!
