I would love to watch a good movie right now!
I have a really good thriller called High Crimes.
I have seen that I think, Micheal Douglas movie, right?
No this movie stars Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.
They were in another movie together as well, right?
Yes they both also played in Kiss The Girls.
Is High Crimes similar to Kiss The Girls?
Well, they are both thrillers; but the plots are very different.
I think I will give it a try then!
Great, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
