Who will win the American League East this year?
Yankees or Red Sox like usual.
The Yankees play well at home, but who knows how it'll play out over the course of a season.
Baltimore isn't terrible either. Don't know if the pitching is up to par.
That's why I don't discount the Red Sox, they have quality starting pitching.
True. And the SP available at the trade deadline this season looks pretty underwhelming.
What happened to Toronto? They are under-performing.
They're a little banged up so they got out of the starting block slow.
If they can turn it around and have Stroman carry the rotation they could be back in it.
Yeah, but they could easily slide back and have an uphill climb just to play catch up.
I hate to say it, but the Yankees made really good moves-not just throwing money around.
They did get younger really quick. Their prospects like Bird, Judge, and Sanchez have really flourished.
It's not murderer's row, but you're right. They traded Chapman then re-signed him, now they have the prospects and Chapman back
They built a lot of those deals with the Cubs.
The Chapman deal plus the Castro one, too. Cubs spreading the wealth.
Who has a better young core? The Yankees or Red Sox?
Tough to say, but Bogaerts, Betts, Benitendi are a solid counter.
Yeah, I think that group with Sale throwing is trouble for everyone else.
They'll be battling for years to come carrying on the rivalry.
Absolutely. It never ends.
