How would you rate Billy Joel as a performer?
I would give him a 10.
Do you think hes better than Elton John
Thats tough.
Yeah I think they are on the same plane.
They both entered in at almost the same time.
Does John even tour anymore?
Not sure, but Joel still does.
Yeah he still sells out wherever he goes.
He has so much material he could tour on.
He could do his first 3 albums for 4 hours and still have more for enough shows.
He should do a tour of each album.
And then loop it back around?
Yeah play a different album in each state.
I dont think people would appreciate the newer stuff.
I think you could always end the shows on one of his classics.
I think having the mix of songs is different and needed.
He wouldnt get bored of performing the same songs.
I cant believe his voice has held up for so long.
It really is a modern day miracle.
