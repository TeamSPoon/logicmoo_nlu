Have you heard Bon Iver's new album, 22, A Million?
No, I haven't listened to him in a while.
It's really different, I'm not sure how I feel about it.
Different how?
It sounds a bit like he's been doing drugs.
A lot of music sounds like that now.
Yeah, it's just really different from his first two. The lyrics also make no sense.
They probably make sense to him somehow though.
That's true, and he's always been a "read between the lines" type artist.
Yeah, the lyrics have gotten progressively more vague album after album.
They have, absolutely. The new album is worth a listen though.
Maybe I'll check it out.
It's really good background music to just relax into.
Does it still have that way of making you emotional without knowing why?
Yes, a lot of tracks do. It's no For Emma, but it's pretty good.
I'll take a look into it then. Do you prefer any specific songs?
#29 Strafford Apts is probably my favorite right now, it's also one of the most normal titles you'll see.
I'll check it out. Normal titles?
Yeah, a lot of them are very cryptic and make no real sense.
Oh, that sounds pretty interesting.
