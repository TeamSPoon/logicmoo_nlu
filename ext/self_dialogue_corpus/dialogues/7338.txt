Have you seen Tangled?
Yes, I have, it is one of my favorite recent Disney movies!
I think it is as good as Frozen, really.
Frozen has a few more good songs than Tangled, but I like the story and characters better in Tangled.
I agree with that. "I See the Light" is a really good song, though.
I love the way it looks when they are under all of the lanterns on the water!
I also like how the girls in the village braid Rapunzel's hair shortly before that.
That is a cute scene, with Flynn and Rapunzel dancing with the villagers.
I'm glad Rapunzel ended up getting away from Mother Gothel.
Yes, it's a good thing she left her tower!
