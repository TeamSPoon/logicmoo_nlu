Hi Thelma Lou, what are you doing?
Well, hello Barney, I am just going through my old record collection.
Cool, can I look through them with you?
Of course you can!
I didn't know you had Elvis records!
Oh sure, Barn, I love Elvis!
Me too.  Which is your favorite song?
That's a hard question, but I think I will go with Devil in Disguise.  What about you?
Oooh, that's a good one.  I think I will pick Heartbreak Hotel.
Another good choice there Barn, did you know that he sold an estimated 600 million albums world wide?
600 million, that's incredible!  Wow!
He also holds the record for top ten hits with 38!
That is so impressive, didn't he sing more than just rock and roll?
Yes, he also sang country and gospel as well.
He was very talented.
He sure was, he was loved by millions and millions.
It's too bad that he died, I bet he still had some great music left in him.
I know.  It is sad.  His estate occassionally allows a new song or remix of his to be released, but it isn't the same.
Yeah, like "A Little More Conversation" that came out a few years ago, it was pretty catchy!
Yes it was, I have that on CD over here, let's go listen to it!
