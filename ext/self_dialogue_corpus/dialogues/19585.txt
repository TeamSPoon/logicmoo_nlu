I won some concert tickets.
That's nice. I've never been to a concert.
This will only be my second one, but I don't have anyone to go with. I don't suppose you're free?
I am actually. I'll go with you.
Awesome. It's a classical concert.
I love classical.
So do I. This features a famous violinist.
Violin is probably my favorite instrument.
I remembered that. That's why I thought of you.
I appreciate that. I definitely want to go.
We've got good seats too.
Does that make a difference?
Yes, kind of. You can hear everywhere but it can be nice seeing people play the instruments.
I guess that makes sense.
We'll be able to see them from our seat.
That's great. This is going to be awesome.
Have you heard of Jenny Oaks Baker? That's our violinist.
I have actually. She's really good.
I haven't but I bet she is.
She has some albums out that I own.
