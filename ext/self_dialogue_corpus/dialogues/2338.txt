I'm so disappointed in Donovan Metts.
Why?
He keeps fumbling!
Dang.
Every time he goes for the ball, he slips.
What's his problem?
He has legal issues at home.
And?
They say it's affecting his game.
That's messed up.
He's gotta shape up soon.
Do you think he will?
Maybe if he solves his legal woes.
Or maybe he's just a bad player!
I'm trying to avoid that notion.
Why?
He used to be on my top list.
Oh ok.
Now he's in a sunken place.
Unfortunately.
