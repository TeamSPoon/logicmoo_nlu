What do you think country music?
I think it is great! Johnny Cash is one of my all time favorites.
Yea, he is. George Strait is another. I hear his concert tickets sell out in literally two minutes.
That is quick  but I can see why. He is really loved as a country artist.
SOme of the new ones are really good as well.
I like Jason Aldean, Lady Antebellum, Luke Bryan and others as well.
There are a lot of new ones hitting the country music scene.
You are right. Did you watch the Country Music Awards?
Yes, I did.
Keith Urban won a lot of awards.
I can see why, he is excellent.
He has had a lot of number one hits.
He sure has.
I would love to see some of these people in concert. Especially George Strait, I love his PURE COUNTRY CD.
I would too, that would be fun.
I would love to see Carrie Underwood.
She has a lot of good songs, I love the song Jesus Take the Wheel.
That is a good one.
I am going to ask for tickets for Christmas to see a concert.
That sounds like a great idea!
