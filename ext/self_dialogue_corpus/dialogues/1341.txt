I'm ready for Manning to come back.
Yea, it was a long season for the Broncos without him.
How about we get Elway back.
He's getting a little old don't you think?
Is Elvis Grbac available?
That's funny, maybe we can pick up Neil O'Donnell in free agency!
I'd wanna get Bill Romanowski.
He is an animal.
I think he is scary.
He could sure play defense!
i like him in "The Longest Yard."
I miss the old orange crush uniforms.
Yes, I never was a fan of these new ones.
They started winning with those though.
Yea, I doubt they'll go back.
They whip out old ones once in awhile.
Do you know who they open against?
I don't know yet.
We need to get a schedule.
I'm going to opening day.
