So do you think Rey is related to Luke Skywalker?
I doubt it. Wouldn't Luke remember her?
We only saw Luke for one scene. Maybe he did recognize her.
Who would her mother be? We never heard word of Luke marrying or anything like that.
In the books, he married Mara Jade.
That's not in the movie, though. I doubt they're related.
I guess so. Luke Skywalker isn't the only Jedi in the world.
I think Luke might have trained her, though.
Maybe she was hidden away when Kylo Ren massacred the Jedi trainees.
That would explain why she was abandoned on Jakku.
