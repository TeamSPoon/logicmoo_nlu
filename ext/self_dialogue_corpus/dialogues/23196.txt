What's your favorite violent movie?
Violent movie, let me see. Are we including horror movies or just action?
Everything included, all genres. What do you like the most?
If I'm counting horror movies I have to say The Hills Have Eyes Two. That movie was just great.
That wasn't a bad one. I actually really enjoyed all of the Saw movies.
Now we're talking nostalgia. When it comes to horror I'll take gore over ghost movies any day.
Yeah that was an annoying trend that was going around for a while. Nothing but ghost movies as far as the eye can see.
And those Paranormal Activity movies. They just won't stop making them!
I did see a horror movie recently that I thought was very original and cool. It was called Don't Breathe.
That sounds like a really familiar title. What was that about again?
It was a really interesting take on horror. The antagonist was an old, blind veteran.
That sounds interesting. He was the bad guy?
It's this blind guy that gets robbed, and the robbers are actually who you feel bad for. He does insane things to them.
Wow I am absolutely going to have to see that now. That kind of reminds me of a full length movie I saw on Netflix recently.
Oh was it good? What was it?
It was called Hush. It's about a deaf girl and this criminal who torments her.
Sounds very interesting! I'll look that one up for sure.
It was very well executed. I thought it was going to be awful, but it turned out really great.
I like that they're starting to come up with some more original ideas for these movies now. Keeps the genre fresh.
You've got that right. I'm a big fan of new things and switching it up.
