Who's your favorite folk/pop rock artist?
I think mine would have to be Colbie Caillat!
Oh she is fantastic. I really like Ingrid Michaelson.
Ingrid is also on my list! What's your favorite Colbie song.
'Bubbly' all the way for me!
I think that song was like a summer hit back then.
It's so breezy and gentle. Like a Hawaiian song.
She is from Hawaii after all!
Really? That makes sense.
I like her collaboration with Jason Mraz.
Which song is that?
The title was 'Lucky' and it was so perfect.
Oh I can't believe I forgot the title. Their harmonies were perfect there.
And the lyrics are so awesome. I can totally relate.
Me too, they're both so talented.
What song do you like by Ingrid?
I really like 'The Way I Am' because it's so catchy yet true.
That song will never get old.
I know! The lyrics really speak to me and it's so real.
Me too, it's so darling and sweet.
