Hey! Did you get around to seeing La La Land?
I haven't seen it actually!
You heard about the Oscars fiasco, I assume?
I did! I feel sorry for the filmmakers, but I think Moonlight deserved it.
I think so, too. But I did really like La La Land.
Someone told me they thought it was a little silly. What do you think?
I did have some trouble with the tone changes. Parts are very happy, and parts are very depressing.
So it didn't flow well?
I didn't think so at all. It's simultaneously partly realistic and partly in another universe.
How did Ryan Gosling do?
Charming as always. Hey girl, he really could play the piano!
Wait, he actually learned to play the piano?
He did! The film never shows someone else's hands. He actually learned to play. In three months!
That's incredible! I couldn't master anything in three months.
I'm no expert, but I thought he played very well!
I heard some controversy about Ryan Gosling's character co-opting jazz for white people.
There's definitely that angle. White people aren't going to save jazz.
But John Legend was in it, too?
He was! I really loved their band. Okay, now it's time for you to see it! I want your opinion!
Would you want to see it again? Let's find a copy!
