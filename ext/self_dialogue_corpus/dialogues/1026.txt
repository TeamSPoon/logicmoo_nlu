Man, I used to love the Minnesota Vikings.
You don't anymore?
I still do. But I did more as a kid.
What's changed?
Well, I don't live in Minnesota anymore. So there's that.
Right. It's harder to see games.
There are a couple bars that play them, but not many people to watch with.
That's too bad.
And then I feel like I should root for the Giants, since I live here in New York now.
It might be more fun, but I don't see any reason you'd need to.
Well, I can't just secretly root for the Vikings. I like to go all out when I'm cheering.
What sorts of things do you do?
Well, I like to wear a jersey.
And a purple one would really stand out when everyone else is wearing blue.
Exactly. And I like to get loud and cheer.
So does everyone!
I guess that's true.
Yeah. Have more confidence, come in a jersey and root for the Vikings.
Maybe I will.
You should!
