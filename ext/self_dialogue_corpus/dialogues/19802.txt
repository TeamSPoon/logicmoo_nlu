Does anyone still listen to the radio anymore?
Like Sirius?
No the one where you have to tune it in your car.
Oh OK no they definitely dont.
I remember listening to music on my radio player almost every minute of the day.
It used to be huge but now people dont want to hear commercials or they can hear the song on youtube much quicker.
So how are radio stations still around?
Running contests, alot of people listen at work still.
I just dont see how they have a business model that can succeed.
They have to feature more artists in studio and such.
That sounds like alot of work.
Sure is especially for a station that is losing money.
So how do artists make money on radio plays?
I think more and more services are paying them a flat fee to run their music.
So who gets screwed in the end?
Depends on how great the song is.
So a huge song hurts the artist.
Almost always in this scenario.
But more recognition means more sales somewhere right?
Usually in merchandise for the band or singer.
