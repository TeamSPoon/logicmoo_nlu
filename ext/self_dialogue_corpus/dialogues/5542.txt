I saw the new Cars 3 movie this weekend.
Where did you see it?
I saw it at the drive-in.
Did you like it?
Yeah, I thought it was really cute.
Were all the same characters in it?
Pretty much.  John Ratzenberger was, of course.
That's funny.  Was he Mack again?
Yep, of course.
Cool.  Maybe I'll take the kids this weekend.
