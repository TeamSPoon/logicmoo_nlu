What's your opinion on the Broncos?
They are a good team, I like them.
Yeah, but do you think that they have been slipping since Peyton left?
Well yeah, Siemmeins might not have been on his caliber but just give him a year or two.
That's true, it can be little hard for a rookie to be good on the spot.
That's correct, just look at Jameis Winston, he's doing good, but he can be better.
Haha, but the Dallas Cowboy got the best of both work, no?
Oh yeah, their Quarterback and Running Back are doing great.
Yeah Ezekiel and Prescott carried that team.
They sure did.
Yeah but I think that the Broncos can become every good in a few years.
Yeah no question about that.
They have a good defense, just need to make some play on the run and the throw.
You are talking my mind man.
It's not like they have never made it into the playoffs.
Haha, that reminds me of the Chief.
Why?
They always make it into the Playoff but the can't never win a title.
Really? That's very surprising.
Yeah and they were in the first Super Bowl!
