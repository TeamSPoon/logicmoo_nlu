Have you had a chance to listen to Lady Gaga's new album yet?
I just listened to it all last night.
What did you think?
It wasn't what I expected.
How so?
It just seems really different, but I'm loving it, especially Million Reasons.
That's my favorite too.
She's just such an amazing artist. Always changing it up.
That's what I love most about her.
I love how inclusive she is to all types of people. Really positive.
