OK, so who would you list as the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time.
That is tough. So many factors go into the rankings, and it can be hard to compare QBs of different eras.
Well, I guess the most important question is: do Super Bowl wins matter?
I don't think they do. Winning a Super Bowl is a team accomplishment; many great QBs had to carry their teams.
So you're saying someone like Dan Marino shouldn't be left out just because the rest of the Dolphins couldn't get it together enough to pull off the big win?
Exactly. Marino had some amazing stats and even held the touchdown record at one point.
Still, if you HAD to make a list, where would you start?
I suppose the current obvious choice for a top pick is Tom Brady.
That man is a machine. Hardly feels like he's been aging atl.
Right? He's been in the league going on 18 seasons now and has only missed the post-season ONCE.
His win percentage is something ridiculous too, isn't it?
It was over 75% (.773) last I looked. Just incredible.
OK, so who else? Can't forget Joe Montana.
Definitely not. Montana is a legend. Brett Favre, too. Peyton Manning. Dan Marino.
Here's a good one: Joe Montana or Steve Young?
Oh, easy. Montana all the way. He has a higher win percentage.
I bet the 49ers would kill to have either of them playing for them now, eh?
Yeah, that 2-14 regular season record in 2016 was painful to watch.
Who even is their current QB?
Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley. I don't think either has been named starter for the new season yet.
