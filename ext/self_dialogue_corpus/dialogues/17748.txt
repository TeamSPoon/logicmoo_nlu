Do you like the Beach Boys?
Sometimes I like to listen to that kind of music when I'm in a certain mood.
It can be uplifting can't it ?
Yes it is kind of simple feel good music.
Are they still playing?
A couple of the original members died.
Oh so they quit after that?
No, I think they had a couple of front members step in.
I don't think they tour much anymore even with the front members.
Brian Wilson was the lead singer right?
Yes, along with the other original members who were Brian's brothers Dennis and Carl, Mike Love, and Al Jardine.
Didn't know they were brothers in the band.
They are a top selling band of all time believe it or not?
Really?
They had 36 Top 40 hits in their time.
That's really impressive.
I still like Good Vibrations and California Girls.
Good Vibrations was actually inspired by their encounter with Eastern Mysticism.
Really? Didn't know that.
They went to see the same guru the Beetles did in India.
