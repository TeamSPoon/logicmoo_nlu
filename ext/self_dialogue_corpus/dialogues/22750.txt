Have you seen Dr Strange?
Yes just recently.
What did you think?
I was pleasantly surprised.
I thought it was good.
Me too.
Do you think they did a good job making it into a movie?
I do actually and that was one of my concerns.
Can you elaborate?
I wasn't sure how they were going to turn such a complex comic character into movie form.
That's true.
I think they did a wonderful job though, it was better than I thought it would be.
Do you think the guy who played Dr Strange did a good job?
I do actually and I love him.
Does he play in anything else?
The show Sherlock.
That's him?
Yes you couldn't tell?
Not really but now that you mention it he does look very similar.
Same guy.
