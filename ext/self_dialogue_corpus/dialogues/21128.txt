Have you seen that movie, Split?
Yeah, I watched it last night with my husband.  I liked it.
Do you believe that people can have that affliction?
What? Split personalities?  Yeah, why not?
I don't know.  I do know that he was pretty good at making me think he was Patricia or Hedwig.
Yeah, but he didn't have to do much changing of wardrobe, now did he?
Yeah, that was kinda stupid but then I guess those kind of people wouldn't change their outfits, or would they?
I don't know but that therapist or psychiatrist was freaking dumb.
Yeah, that's true.  The therapist should have seen it coming but she was blind.
I don't understand, though, how anyone could be kidnapped in broad daylight!
Those girls were stupid, especially the one sitting in the front seat!
I know, right! Why didn't she move faster, I know I would have!
Have you seen any of the other M. Night movies?
Practically all of them.  I liked most of them.
Did you catch the tie-in at the end, with Bruce Willis??
Is that who that was!  I thought he looked familiar!
I think Willis was referring back to that movie, Shattered.
That would make sense.  That's the one with Sam Jackson in it.  That was good.
I just don't get what Shattered has to do with M. Night.  I don't think he had anything to do with that movie.
I"m not sure, but I'm going to have to re-watch it now!
