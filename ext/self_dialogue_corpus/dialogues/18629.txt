You know I must be the only one to say this but I really did not like Pink FLoyd.
Really??
Yea, I found their music to be really annoying.
I do not know anyone who thinks that , they had some great songs.
Well I don't think so. Dark Side of the moon got on my ever last nerve.
Ha ha, that is really funny.
Did you like them?
I loved them!
What songs did you like?
Brick in the Wall was great.
That was ok.
Did you know that they were inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame?
I heard that.
And also the British rock and roll hall of fame.
I know everyone thinks they are great, I do not care for them.
They sold over 250 million records.
That adds up to a lot of money.
Absolutely.
Well I still do not care for the music.
To each his own I say.
