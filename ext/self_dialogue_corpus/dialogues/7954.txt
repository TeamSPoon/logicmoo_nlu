I just saw a movie on an old pop music star who was living off fame he gathered in his youth.
Oh, yeah! The movie with Drew Barrymore...
And Hugh Grant!
That's right!
But doesn't that always happen? Some group, like the Boyz II Men, gets famous on teeny bopper music, and then make a career out of being former teen idols?
Yeah. I was a former teen idol.
You were? No way!
Well maybe not me personally, but I had a few teen girls fall in love with me because my first name is Barry...
I don't get it. In the movies, the guy named "Barry" is always the weirdo...
Yeah, but when I was young, there was this Pop music star named Barry Manilow, who the girls couldn't resist. I even had one girl aks to marrty me so that she could say she was "Mrs. Barry..."
