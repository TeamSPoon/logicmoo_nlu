I was thinking about he STAR WARS Death Star.
That thing must have been big.
Remember when Luke and them first saw it.
Yes. They thought it was a planet.
Then I think someone said, "That's no planet."
That tractor beam pulled them right in.
It was crazy how Luke and them went all over the ship without being found.
They used those Storm Trooper outfits.
I don't think that would work in reality.
But it worked in the movie!
