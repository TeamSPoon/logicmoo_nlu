What's a movie from Disney that's underrated?
I think about Beauty and the Beast.
Oh yeah, that was a good movie.
Disney really likes implementing magic in their movies.
Yeah, the prince got what he deserved though.
He was very ugly on the inside and became that way on the outside.
It also shows acceptance by appearance.
Yes, people can still be beautiful on the inside.
It's a very touching movie.
I know I always enjoyed the whole thing.
