Did you see Lady GaGa at the Superbowl?
Yup, and I'm so glad she did Poke Face as an opener.
Me, too. It's one of my favorite songs by her.
What did you think of that Bad Romance performance?
I thought it was great, but Telephone was the stand-out.
I was so impressed with how she sang and danced at the same time.
It's crazy. I couldn't even hear any backing track.
It was there, but it was very faint.
You know she's not even the best dancer, but she killed it that night.
I agree. She totally blew me away.
