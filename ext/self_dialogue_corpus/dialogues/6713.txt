Did you see Cars 2 yet?
No not yet, but I heard good things about it.
Yes, it has gotten some good reviews.
I heard that it is better than the last film they made.
Yes that one was ridiculous with the spy theme.
This one is supposed to stick to car racing like the original.
That sounds good. I will probably see it tomorrow.
It is nice that Disney put out a movie that is not just princess themed.
I know. It sometimes seems unfair to boys with all these princess themed movies.
So true. Well let me know what you think about it after you see it.
