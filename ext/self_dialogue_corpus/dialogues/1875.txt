Who is your prediction to win it all this year?
Sadly, I say the patriots
Really? how come?
The improved so much this offseason. Plus they have the best QB of all time.
I know they got Stephon Gilmore and Brandin Cooks, but they lost their best RB
Legarette Blount was good, but it seems like anyone can be a RB in that offense.
Brandin Cooks was a huge addition.
I agree, Brady hasn't had a top WR threat since Randy Moss
Oh well we all know how that went we he played for them!
Undeafeated until the super bowl if I remember correctly.
Darn Eli Manning wasn't having none of that undefeated juice
Yeah that was a tough break for them, Brady has won many more since then
He may get one more now that he has Edelman, Gronk, and Cooks to throw too.
I am eager to see how their running game works.
Blount had 18 touchdowns so it is going to be hard to replace that much production
I agree, I do not think they got a certain guy to replace him with
Perhaps runningback by committe is what they will use
A lot of teams have turned to that, sucks for fantasy football
Cooks to the patriots is good for fantasy football
Not for the dolphins, bills and jets though
