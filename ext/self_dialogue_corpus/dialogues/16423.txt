How many concerts have you been to?
I've been to....gee, I don't know. 5?
5? That's not that many, actually.
Yeah normally I just stay at home.
Well what was your last one?
I saw the Weeknd a couple weeks ago, actually.
Who are they?
It's one person, he's a singer.
Gotcha, well how was it?
It was amazing!
Yeah?
Yeah, he sounds just like he does on his albums.
That's awesome! He sounds like a great artist.
Yeah, what was your last concert?
Hmm, honestly I don't remember.
Oh come on, yes you do!
I saw One Direction a couple years ago.
Well how were they?
How do you think?
Amazing!
