What are your thoughts on disney films?
I am big animated disney fan.
What you don't like the other films they put out?
I find some of them too mushy. Like McFarland, USA I hated.
Really? It is based on a true story.
I just feel that at times those type of disney film are to sentimental in a way.
Well in their defense it was only co-produced by Disney Pictures. Done with  Mayhem Pictures.
Mayhem Pictures may be slightly to blame then.
I don't think every film is going to appeal to every person. So you hated it someone else loved it.
I am sure they did, many even. I just find disney films  I do enjoy most are the animated features.
