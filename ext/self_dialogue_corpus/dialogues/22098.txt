Why was Samuel L. Jackson in the new Kong movie?
I don't know.  Maybe because he's Samuel L. Jackson!
He is in almost every movie.
Like Snakes on a Plane.
And, Unbreakable.
Oh yeah.  He played Mr.  Glass!
That was a great movie.
Bruce Willis was awesome in that movie.
He was an interesting take on a super hero.
His weakness was swimming pools!!
Well, large bodies of water in general.
That's a terrible weakness.
It is.
At least he was really strong and never got sick.
But, he can never go swimming.
Well, maybe he can go swimming just as long as he can stand up in the water.
Good point.
He must have been able to take a bath.
That's true.
Yup.  They should make a sequel about it.
