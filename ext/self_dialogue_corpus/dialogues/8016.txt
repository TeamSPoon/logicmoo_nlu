Lady Gaga seems to have declined in recent years with her hits.
She definitely hasn't been churning out hits like she used to.
She's still on the scene, I suppose. She did the super bowl halftime show last year.
Was surprising there wasn't a controversy surrounding her during that show.
For sure. She sometimes does things to get attention.
Her music videos sure screamed attention and look at me.
She's definitely a great artist. A little bit out of left field some times.
For sure. She was always compared to Madonna, who also did some racy things as well.
Some say she doesn't sound like Madonna at all. But I see the music and antic comparisons clearly.
Very true. Madonna was ahead of her times. Lady Gaga seems to fit in with the society today.
