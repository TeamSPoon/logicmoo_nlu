Are you a Beatles fan?
I like some of their stuff.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I like "Hey Jude" and some of the later stuff.
I really like the early stuff, like "If I Fell" and "In My Life".
Yes, those are good songs, too, but I feel the later stuff has more of a rock n roll sound to it.
Yes they did get heavier as the years went on for sure.
I do like the "Rubber Soul" album, though. That had a lot of good music on it.
That's one of my favorites, too! As well as The White Album.
Yes, there were many good songs from The White Album, too.
