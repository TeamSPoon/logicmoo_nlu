Apparently not every town is a big supporter of their NFL football team.
Why's that?
The New York Jets want to build a helicopter pad at their training facility, and a nearby town is protesting it.
What are they complaining about, the helicopter noise?
That, and it's a safety risk if there's an accident.
Why do the Jets need the helicopter pad?
They want to use it for executive's travel, and for injured athletes to be quickly flown out.
Well, I'm sure no one cares about fat cat executives, but injured players is a good excuse for one.
There's an airport a couple of miles from there, so locals say there isn't that big a need.
Maybe so, but if a player has a really bad injury, transporting them by ambulance to the airport could be painful.
They already tried to propose it a couple years ago, but people objected a lot them.
So why are they bringing it up again?
They said they don't need permission from the locals because it is on state property owned by the Sports Authority.
So whose decision is it?
The state's Department of Transportation has to approve it.
What do you think the chances are with that?
Somebody from the state said they were considering the proposal.
Protestors have a way of stopping things though.
The Department of Transportation said the time limit for the public to appeal was over, but they were reading the comments.
Well, I personally hope they get it, because athletes need to have the best medical care available, and that includes medical transport.
