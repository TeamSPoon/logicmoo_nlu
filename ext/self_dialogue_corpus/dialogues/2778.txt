Are you ready for the season?
You mean the NFL season?
Yeah, do you have a team?
Actually I'm from St. Louis
Oh, that SUCKS man.
I know. I'm trying to figure it out.
Why don't you become a Chiefs fan?
I'm not gonna go over there just because it's Missouri
Just a suggestion.
Yeah, I was a Packers fan growing up.
You mean before the Rams came?
Yeah.
So are you gonna go back to the pack?
Eh. I think so. They are pretty good though.
Isn't that a good thing?
Not really. I want to buy low.
Buy low?
Yeah I don't want to look like a bandwagoner.
Well that's tough man.
I'll figure it out before the start of the season.
