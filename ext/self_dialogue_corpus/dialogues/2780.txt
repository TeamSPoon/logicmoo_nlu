What is your opinion on deflategate?
What's deflategate?
The whole cheating scandal with the Patriots?
I've never heard about this.
Oh, it's an interesting story though.
Tell me about it?
So, I guess during a championship game against the Colts, the Patriots were using deflated balls.
Deflated how?
So, normally balls have to be inflated to a particular pressure, to be used in an NFL game.
That makes sense.
So they, or someone on the Patriots, was deflating the balls.
What does that do, game-wise?
It's softer. So it's easier to both throw and catch.
That sounds like a huge advantage!
It was a big deal. The Ravens claimed that the same thing happened to them in a game with the patriots, too.
So what ended up happening?
The patriots were given a million dollar fine and Tom Brady had to sit out four games as a penalty.
Wow, that doesn't seem like enough for cheating.
I don't think so either!
They should be careful down the road.
