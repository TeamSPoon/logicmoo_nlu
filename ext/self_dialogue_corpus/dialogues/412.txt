What's your favorite villain from X-Men: First Class?
I'd have to say Erik Lensherr
The tortured soul?
Yeah - he had so much to overcome from his childhood. I don't know if I would have turned out different in his shoes.
Right - tortured, and seeing his mother killed right in front of him. Gut wrenching.
And then there's his powers - controlling iron!
Even iron in blood!
It's crazy. And last - but not least, I love his alter ego "Magneto".
The nickname?
Yeah, it just grabs me. Way too classic.
