If you could only watch one movie for the rest of your life what would it be ?
The same one over and over ?
Yes.
I would have to pick Castway.
With Tom Hanks?
Yes, where he is on the island.
Why is that?
They did a lot of research how one could survive.
Wow, that is why it seems so real.
What would you pick ?
The Searchers.
Who is in that ?
John Wayne.
Is it a western?
It is but it is also a drama.
He actually did dramas well.
His other drama, The Quiet Man is on of my top five.
Maureen O'Hara was just amazing in that.
I loved the way the supporting roles were showed so vibrants.
I liked the beautiful scenery.
