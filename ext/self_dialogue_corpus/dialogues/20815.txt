Wonder woman was great.
I know, I was surprised.
Do you think it lived up to the hype?
Well, I don't think there was tons of hype around it, but it sure was good.
Yeah, I think the lack of hype was because no one knew how the first girl super hero movie would be.
I was even hesitant to go until I read the reviews.
I waited too. The actress who played wonder woman was amazing.
I never even heard of her!
Apparently she was in the Israeli army.
So she's a bit of wonder woman in real life as well.
What do you think of the costume?
I love it. You?
It's one of my least favorite super hero ones.
Well, it stays true to the comic book.
That's true. It didn't take away from the movie, either.
Of course not.
Do you think we'll see a sequel.
Oh, definitely. It got like 500 million or something crazy like that.
Id count on a 2019 release.
Most likely.
