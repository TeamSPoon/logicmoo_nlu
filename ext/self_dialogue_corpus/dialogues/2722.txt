The NFL is the best sport around!
I agree with you, nothing else really compares in my book.
Who will have the best rookie season this year in your opinion?
That is a tough question!
No doubt about it, it was a really deep draft class this year.
I think Deshaun Watson is going to have a great career.
He could very well be your rookie of the year actually.
Maybe, I watched him tear up a great Alabama defense to win a championship.
He reminds me a lot of Vince Young to be honest with you.
I can see that, but I think he will be a much better NFL quarterback than Young was.
John Ross is another guy I could see having an instant impact.
He is really fast, and he will have a good quarterback throwing to him.
Exactly, and I think with AJ Green lining up next to him, things will be a lot easier early on his career.
That is a really good point. He will get a lot of one on one opportunities.
Leonard Fournette is who I think will end up being rookie of the year.
That is an excellent pick actually. I could see him going over a thousand yards in his first year.
He is just so hard to tackle! He will be great in the passing game as well.
If I had to pick a rookie of the year, I would say either Watson or O.J Howard.
Yea Howard looks like a really good prospect. Did he play at Alabama?
He sure did. I watched him over the years and I really like his game.
