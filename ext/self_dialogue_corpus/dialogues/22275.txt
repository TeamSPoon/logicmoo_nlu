Hi Jimmy, Sonya here.  I am calling to find out if you have seen that latest movie on John Wick, Chapter two.
Ah yes, I did see that one.
How was it?
It was very action packed.  I liked it better than the first movie John Wick.
Keanu Reeves is in it, and usually I like his movies.  I saw that it was out, wanted to check with you first on how it was.
I think you will enjoy it, it is high energy and Keanu does a great job with the character.
Did you want to come with us? A group of us are going to the movies tomorrow.
Well, I would but I have seen it already, so I will go next time.
Or we can pick one that you haven't seen yet.
Yes, that's a thought What did you think of?
Logan, that looks great too.
That's the one with Hugh Jackman in it?
Yes, that would be it.  What do you think?
I think that I would like to see that one.
Richard Grant and Patrick Stewart are also in this movie.
Yes, I think they are going to be great.
How about that then, we will pick you up at 6pm tomorrow evening after work?
Sounds great.
Awesome, have a great night!
You too, see you all tomorrow!
