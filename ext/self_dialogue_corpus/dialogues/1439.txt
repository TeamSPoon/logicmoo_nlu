Are you excited about the NFL season this year?
Absolutely, just one more month until pre-season.starts.
i don't really watch pre-season but I am excited that the regular season is on two months away.
I never cared about the pre-season either until last year when Tony Romo got hurt.
It was a magical season for the Cowboys last year.
It sure was and if it had not been for pre-season, Dak Prescott may have never received his chance to play.
The only thing that would have made it better would have been making it to the Superbowl.
It definitely would have been great to make the Superbowl but I think winning the Superbowl would have been inspirinng.
Yes, I would have loved to have seen the Cowboys beat the Patriots.
I was really hoping that New England would have lost last years Superbowl.
I had hoped the same but the Falcons really gave them a run for their money.
I was pretty certain too that Atlanta was going to win but then Brady woke up in the 3rd quarter.
It was a crazy and fabulous game and it was so exciting to watch.
It is not very often that a Superbowl game is close in the score.
Did you think Atlanta was going to win?
I truly did think they were going to win as they were playing good ball and had a huge lead going into the second half.
What do you predict to happen this season?
I actually believe the Arizona Cardinals are on a mission this coming season.
I would love to see Larry Fitzgerald get a Superbowl ring.
Me too.  Is it September yet?
