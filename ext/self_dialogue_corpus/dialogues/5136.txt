Did you see the game between the Yankees and Red Sox?
I did! It was intense!
Sure was! How about that double play in the 2nd inning!
Oh man, I couldn't believe they almost let him score!
I guess that's what happens when you forget there is a runner on 3rd!
I guess, but how can you not remember there is a runner in scoring position.
I know, right! They almost had the game tied.
Good thing they got him out, the yankees don't do well when they get behind.
No they don't. Remember the last time they got behind in the 4th inning, spent the last 5 innings playing erratically.
So true, it's like they can't figure out where to throw the ball! The center fielder tries to make a play at home and doesn't use their cut-off man.
I know! It's like all fundamentals go out the window!
It's a good thing they beat the Red Sox this time, it will put them in the playoffs!
Playoffs are already coming around? Wow, that's crazy!
I know, I wish the season could last longer.
The guys need some rest though, they are getting up there in age.
Yeah, that makes me think of Derek Jeter, man I miss him!
Oh I know, he was the best 2nd baseman of all time!
That, and he was in general just a good guy.
I'm glad he mentored new players to be role models for today's youth.
Me too, my son has always looked up to him, and tries to act just like him. That is one pro athlete I am okay with him acting like.
