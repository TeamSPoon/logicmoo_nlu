Across The Universe is a great song
yeah, i guess. i don't really get the message
it's just about taking it easy and letting the universe do it's thing, man
i guess that's a cool message
but more importantly? it's just a pretty song
yeah, the arrangement is really nice
the guitar is soothing!
and john's voice is on point. you have a good point, it's a really good song...i don't know about their best, though
which do you think is their best, then?
i'm so tired. it's just...relatable
