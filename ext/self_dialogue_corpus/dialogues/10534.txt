Hey, I haven't seen you in ages, how have you been?
Not too bad, just got back from my vacation.
Awesome, did you do anything fun?
I did, yes.  I spent a lot of time at the movie theater.
Did you see anything good?
Yes, I did.  I absolutely loved the new Guardians Of Galaxy movie.
Oh cool.  I've heard really good things about it.
It was really good, I saw it twice.
It's a sequel, right?
Yes, the first one came out a couple of years ago.
I remember watching that one, I think I liked it.
You should check this one one, I think you'll like it.
Oh, why's that?
It has more of an emotional story line.  It's easier to get involoved with the plot.
Hmm... I might have to go see it this weekend.
You should, I was actually thinking about seeing it again.
Wow, that good, huh?
Yes!  You should see it in IMAX 3D, it is so much better that way.
Ok.  Is there anywhere around here that shows that?
Yes, there are a few theaters the next town over that do.
