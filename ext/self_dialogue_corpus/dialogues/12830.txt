Who was the guy who voiced Darth Vader?
Oh man, I think you mean James Earl Jones.
Yes, that's who I was thinking of.  Did he come back for Rogue One?
I believe he did.  He'll always be the voice of Darth Vader.
You can't fake him.  He'll never be replicated.
It is possible they could just recreate his voice from computers.
If they had to, sure, but hopefully nothing ever happens to James Earl Jones.
Darth Vader might be done anyway.
Yeah, they will probably move on from the character anyway.
That's what I'm thinking as well.
