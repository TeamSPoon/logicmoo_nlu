Hey you know any good songs I can play on my wedding
It depends what kind of songs are you looking for
You know typical slow songs for the husband-wife dance
What about for like when everybody else dance don't you want like regular music
Of course I want that too but mostly slow songs
But it's a few good so songs that you can use for weddings and Boyz to Men who doesn't love them
Yeah I don't really like Boys to Men that much I was looking for something more like you know Bruno Mars or Ed Sheridan a little up-to-date
Well you know Ed Sheeran and has a nice song you know the shape of you
Is it pretty nice song what about you know any good Bruno Mars songs
Yeah Bruno Mars not really a fan of mine so I don't really listen to his music
That's totally understandable everybody has their preferences
So what type of music did you want for everybody to dance
Probably like pop or R&B
You can get that girl that sings that song the pill what's her name
Pink I love some of her songs
Yeah that song about the pill was a pretty good song
So what else do you recommend
Well if you want R&B can't go wrong with some Michael Jackson
You right about that is some are good in R&B
Or the R&B King R.Kelly
