I been looking into some movies wondering if they are scary or not
let me know what they are called
Well they are made by some little company and were straight to VHS
Okay then
They were called puppet master
Oh those movies those are cult classics
So they are good
Yeah they are good horror but not really scary
Oh why not
Just the theme is scary but never hits the mark but they are good
