I was watching this show that showcased an Italian man carving a cameo.
What was he making?
He was making a jewelry set. He said it takes him three days to carve one piece.
Really? What gemstone was using?
I think it was called agate.
I have quite a few cameos myself. Would you like to see them sometime?
I would love to see them.
You do know that cameos are back in style? Right?
No. This was my first time hearing of such a thing.
Well. Jewelry designers are making more and more cameos today.
It looked like hard work and tedious work.
It is. Ancient and Renaissance cameos were made from semi-precious gemstones.
It's been said that  glass cameo vessels were also developed by the Romans.
Sounds to me like you have been doing your homework.
I find cameos interesting. They can be made into rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.
Yes. Many women love to wear them as jewelry.
In ancient times were mainly used for signet rings and large earrings.
But did you know that many modern cameos are carved into layered agates?  The layers are dyed to create strong color contrasts.
I need to add some cameos to my wardrobe.
They are a fascinating piece of jewelry.
