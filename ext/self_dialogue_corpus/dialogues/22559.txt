I was looking through some movies on line wondering what to watch when I came across Killer Klown from  Outer Space.
Oh that really sounds like it would oustanding!
Absolutely! Who wouldn't love and enjoy aliens that invade Earth that look like clowns.
Why would any body make something so stupid!
I have heard of fusion  cooking but that is just as about as dumb Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
Yeah but at least it was them making fun of stupid "b" rate movies. They weren't taking themselves seriously.
Oh wait here's another one that was super cheesy  goodness. Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.
Holy cow you really pulled one out of nowhere.
Yes I did. 1958  an alien turns a woman into a giantess.
I remember seeing the cover of that movie when i worked at a video store but I never bothered to read it because it looked so bad.
Hey it's cult classic shot in black and white.
That is something I have been meaning to do.
What? Shoot a movie in black and white?
No. Make a list of cult science fiction classics and watch them.
But there are cult classics in that genre that are really good and some that aren't.
I would have a list for the cheesy ones and then the good ones to make it easier on myself.
I will see if  I can help you out and come up with a few you may not think of.
That would be great!
Until later my friend.
Happy hunting!
