Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
Luke Skywalker.
How come he is your favorite?
Because he is a Jedi Master.
But aren't there other Jedi Masters in the prequels?
Yes, but in the original movies, we got to see Luke grow in the force.
Do you think Rey can also become a Jedi Master?
Of course because the force is strong in her.
Do you think she is related to Luke?
I sure hope so because that would make the next sequels very interesting.
