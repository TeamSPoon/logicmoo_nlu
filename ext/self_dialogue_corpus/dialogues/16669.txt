What songs do you like of Madonna's work?
Madonna, wow she played so much over the years.
Yes, can you tell me which songs you enjoy the most?
Well, I like Like a Virgin, Take a Bow, Open Your Heart, those are great songs.
I love her songs like this one : Lucky Star and Beautiful Stranger.
Great ones, she is so rich I am sure .  Millions have listened to her songs.
Yes! Multi-millionaire, and she looks fantastic.
When you are that rich, you can look how you want to.
I think she is not touring this year, but may show in different places briefly.
I see, I loved her concerts.
I have gone to some of her concerts as well, she was the best.
Michael Jackson put on great shows too.
Yes, Michael Jackson had some serious hits.
Beat It, Billie Jean, are some of my favorites.
I have some of his best records from the past as well, saved them as collector's items.
I bought his collection on CD's.
How much did they cost?
I have several of his, so it cost hundreds.
Maybe we can go sometime to a concert together.
That would be great.
