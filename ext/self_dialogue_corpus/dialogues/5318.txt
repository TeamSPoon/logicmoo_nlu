Hey what was that movie with the that man that was raised by monkeys ?
I think that was that Disney movie Tarzan .
Was Tarzan the name of the main character or just the name of the movie?
I think that was his actual name.
Did the hunter guy kill Tarzan?
No I don't think so it is a Disney movie after all.
Can you even think of a Disney movie in which anyone dies in?
The Lion King, Bambi those are the two main Disney movies I can think of that has someone die.
Wait who in Bambi dies?
Bambi's mother dies by a hunter it happens in like the first few minutes of the movie.
