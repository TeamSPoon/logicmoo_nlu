Do you think they will find some on to replace Carrie Fisher in the Star Wars movies.
Maybe, or they will use old footage.
Like they did in Rogue One?
Yes, showing a young Fisher.
I think they should replace the guy who played the young Anakin.
Hayden Christianson?Why?
I mean, they need to have Vader show up some how, in a flash back maybe.
I do not think they will.
Maybe in a Jedi ghost form, as they did in the Empire Strikes back.
I think the new films are trying to distance themselves from the first three episodes.
