Do you know that the first movie came out in the 1800's?
No I did not know that, that is really long ago.
Yea, it was in 1888 called Roundhay Garden Scene.
What was it about?
Well  it was only 2.11 seconds long but is still today considered a movie.
Really ??
Yes, it is considered the oldest film in existence.
Wow that is amazing.
But prior to that in 1878 there was a short film of a horse in motion.
How long was that one?
Not sure really but I think about 15 seconds.
When was the first film made that was long?
Well in 1896 the Luminere Brothers made one about a train pulling into a station.
How long was that one?
59 seconds!
Haha, I wonder when the first full length film was made.
I do not know, probably early 1900's.
Yea when they had the silent movies.
Yes probably.
I think I will try to learn more about early movies.
