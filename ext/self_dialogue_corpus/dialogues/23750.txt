Jake Gylenhall is a good actor.
I like him as well, he has been in some great movies!
Ever seen End of Watch?
No, is he in that?
Yes! He plays a cop.
I think I have heard of that.
It's the movie where the two cops record their day and what they go through.
Oh yes, I have heard of that. Been told I need to watch it too.
Yes you do, it is such a great movie, but warning the ending is a little hard.
Don't say anymore!
Seen him in Donnie Darko?
Yes, that was such a weird movie!
I agree, the bunny was creepy.
Yes it was, he played that part really well.
End of Watch is a action movie, and even some funny parts.
Do you have it?
Yes I do, it is worth buying too.
How many times have you watched it
I honestly have seen it a handful of times, going to watch it later too.
I will come over and we can watch it together.
