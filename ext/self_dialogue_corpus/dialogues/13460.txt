Do you think Poe or Finn are force-sensitive?
No.
Finn, for sure, I don't think is. But Poe has to be.
Why?
He took down something like ten clone troopers in a super short time in the battle.
That was pretty sweet, but I don't think that a humanoid can survive the G-force of those turns.
That's why he's a force-sensitive. He CAN survive what others can't.
Maybe, but maybe he's just good.
He also survived in a desert and relocated his entire fleet somehow without detection and without dehydrating.
Maybe. Looks like he can survive some crazy things.
