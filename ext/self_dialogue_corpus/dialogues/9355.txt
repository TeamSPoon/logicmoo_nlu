I'm such a big fan of J. Cole.
I've heard that he's one of the best rappers out there.
He is. He has such a great ability to combine thoughtful lyrics that tell a story with catchy beats.
Would you recommend any songs?
Sure thing. "A Tale of 2 Citiez" and "Deja Vu" are two great places to start.
I'll definitely check him out on YouTube.
He's also collaborated with Kendrick Lamar quite a bit.
Oh, really? On what.
They both freestyled over one of each other's songs. It's a great listen.
I'll look that up too.
