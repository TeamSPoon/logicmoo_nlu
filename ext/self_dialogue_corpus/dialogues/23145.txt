What is the last movie you saw in the theater?
Oh it was that disney movie Moana.
Did you like it.
Yea it was good, I have seen better.
What was it about?
Well a girl named Moana and her quest to save her island.
Oh sounds cute.
It was but the refreshments were super expensive.
I know they always are!
Yup almost 40 dollars for popcorn and drinks.
Wow, how many people did you buy for.
My four grandchildren.
The popcorn was around seven dollars each and then they HAD to get ICEES to wash the popcorn down.
Ugg,movie prices are getting really expensive too.
They sure are. Unless you go in the morning.
How much were the tickets.
It cost almost 50 for four kids and me.
That is too much.
Way too much.
No wonder people wait until movies come out on dvd.
