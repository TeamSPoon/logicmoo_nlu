What is your favorite movie of all time?
Without question, the answer is Titanic!
Oh yah that is an amazing movie.
It was so well done!
The characters in the movie really looked like the real people.
Yes, I had watched a documentary about that and noticed that they made sure to closely match the characters to the real people.
I do not go to the theaters very often but I made sure to watch that one in the theater.
I love going to the big screen.  I really love watching movies in 3D.
I had wanted to go see Titanic in 3D but did not have a chance to do that.  I sure wish that I had.
It was amazing to see that in 3D on the big screen.  You missed out on that for sure.
I sit down an watch Titanic at least once a year.
I do that as well.  When I want to just relax and get comfortable I usually pick that one.
What was your favorite scene in that movie?
I liked the scene where Jack pulls Rose back over the rail.  What was yours?
I loved it when Jack taught Rose how to spit and he had spit all over his face when he met her mom.
That was hilarious!
I also liked when Rose found the heart of the ocean in her jacket pocket.
I would have never thrown that into the ocean like Rose did.
Talking about Titanic makes me want to watch it, do you want to come over and pop it in?
Sure!  I'll be right over.
