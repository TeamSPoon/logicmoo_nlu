Do you like Lady Gaga?
I am not sure. I only know she is very famous.
Have you heard of her music?
Actually no. I didn't even know about her until a cousin of mine mentioned her.
Maybe it's a generation thing.
Maybe. My cousin is much younger than I am.
Did your cousin mention her music?
No, she likes the fashion and things that Lady Gaga represents, you know.
Well, pop music culture is never just about the music.
That's right.
