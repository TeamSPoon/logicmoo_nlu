My kids loved Disney movies when they were growing up. And I'd sit down and watch them over and over with them.
Mine too. I would think that I would just sit down for a second and then an hour later I was still watching.
Yes. Especially Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.
I loved those. I also loved the really old ones like Lady and the Tramp.
We still have VHS tapes of those movies.
We do too. I don't know what to do with them.
Yes. I can't get rid of them for some reason and nobody watches VHS anymore.
The Disney VHS are the only ones I have kept.
We have some DVDs too but most of ours are VHS.
We'll have to pass them on to our kids and let them worry about getting rid of them.
