Do you remember the name of those two guys that were caught lip syncing and they had won a Grammy?
Are you talking about Milli Vanilli?
Yeah, those guys, they were super cute.
Let me think what were their names. Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus I am pretty sure that's their names.
Rob and Fab, yeah do you know what ever happened to them?
I am not sure I remember reading Fab Morvan was in Los Angeles still working on music but that was a few years back.
Oh, that's good he is still in music.
I think Rob Pilatus was found dead at 32 in a Frankfurt hotel room.
What did he die of.
I am not sure, I think a combination of alcohol and prescription pills.
Wow, that's a shame because they really could sing couldn't they.
I think they tried to prove to the world they could really sing.
I heard there were different singers for different song. The manager didn't just use two different voices but several people.
I think it was a scam that Rob and Fab got caught up in and it just went too far.
Well, the good thing is back then a lot of people were lip syncing there songs.
I know I would hate to pay for a concert ticket and the singer wasn't really singing.
What kind of name is Fab?
His name was Fabrice he was training to be a trampoline athlete until a neck injury .
He was a model too, right?
Yeah, and then he became a musician that was one half of Milli Vanilli.
