Do you enjoy NFL football?
Yes I do.  Have always watched.
Do you have an all time favorite team?
Yes.  I have always been a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.
Are you happy or bummed that Tony Romo retired?
I guess you can say happy.  We now have Dax and he is awesome.
So do you think Prescott will have a good year?  Or one year wonder?
He has a lot of potential.  He is great under pressure.  Do you like him?
Yes I think he is good.  And with Elliott there,  there is no stopping them.
Yes they make a good duo.
So you think Dallas cowboys in Super Bowl?
More thanlikely.  Not sure against who.  What do you think?
Maybe a repeat New England Patriots.  They are always contenders.
Maybe.
What do you think of the Tennessee Titan?
They made some good moves in the off season.
Yes. They picked up Eric Decker,  if he stays healthy he can do some damage.
Yes,  if he stays healthy.  And they also have Murray who was a few good years left.
Yes I think so.  Who is their quarterback?
Not sure.
