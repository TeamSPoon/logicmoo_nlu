My favorate Pixar movie has to be Up.
Up was a great movie.
I remember seeing it in 3D in the theaters and crying , laughing and just loving the entire movie.
They built the characters so well.
It was impossible not to feel for the couple as they grew from the kids in the abandoned house.
The love they showed eachother was so touching.
It was so sad when they lost their baby.
The little kids watching do not know what that is about but the adults all cry.
When the developers come and build all around the house and begin to push him out it is sad but his strength and determination was inspiring.
Then there was Russle.
Who did not love Russle the boy scout?
And the dogs that talk!
Squirel
So funny
It was nice that he went to pursue the dream that they never got to live together.
The falls of Paradise
It seemed like he would die their.
Definately that did seem like how it would end.
I was glad that they returned home safely
eating icecream on the curb was  great ending.
