Do you remember Biggee?
Of course who could forget one of the founders of hip hop.
Why do you say that?
He was one of the original gods of rap if you will that paved the way for the rest.
He did set the stage up quite well for the rest of the rappers.
Do you think he was a great rapper though?
I do.
I still remember people screaming his name and everyone listening to his music.
What's your favorite song of his?
Big Poppa was a good one.
You know that was a great one, I listened to that song for weeks.
There was something about that one, can't quite pinpoint it though.
I think it was hypnotizing.
Wasn't that another of his songs?
I believe so yes.
Also didn't Big Papa get talked about a lot in the movie Hardball?
Wasn't that the movie with Keena Reeves and the kid baseball team?
That's the one.
Then yes it was all about one of the pitchers needing to hear it to pitch.
That's right.
