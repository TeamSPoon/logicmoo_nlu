Will Marshawn Lynch have a good season with the Raiders?
Yes, he's super motivated
Don't you worry about him being rusty after retirement?
No. Marshawn Lynch is in great shape.
The Seahawks will never find another like Marshawn Lynch.
Agree, they really miss him
Still, I think the Seahawks will make the playoffs
I don't. Pete Carroll had his good run.
Maybe, but new guys will still respond to his unique ways
Yeah, Always compete!
Will Russell Wilson have a good year?
Yes, he has lost weight and is healthy
He played hurt last year
I hope his offensive line protects better
Agree. That was a real problem last year
It's gotta get better
Can't get any worse, it was awful
Will the Seahawks new kicker succeed?
Blair Walsh?
Yes, he was a Minnesota Viking before
