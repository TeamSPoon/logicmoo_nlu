I am a huge fan of Disney movies.  How about yourself?
Yes me too!  The new movies are good, but I am fond of the classics.
What is your favorite classic Disney movie?
I really love Bambi.  It is a great movie.
Oh yes that is a classic. Thumper was a great character!
Do you have a favorite Disney movie of any era?
That is a tough question there are so many good ones. I'd say Lion King is my favorite.
Great choice, one of the best for sure!
It really was a great movie, like many that Disney has made.
They sure do make good ones.  I can't wait for the next Frozen!
