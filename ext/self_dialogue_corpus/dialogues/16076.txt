Have you ever listened to Perry Como?
Believe it or not,yes I have.
He was my favorite singer growing up.
I thought the Beatles were.
Well yes,when they came along. But Perry was still a favorite.
He had many many hits.
Yes he did.
Hot Diggity Dog?
Wow,the very first one I ever heard.
Really? I didn't know that.
Oh yeah. My father owned a bar with his brothers and they had a juke box in the ballroom.
Every bar had a jukebox back then.
Yes they did.
So,was that always played?
Yes,by me.
You had to be young.
Yes,I was very young. I used to beg my grandfather for nickels to play that song over and over.
Wow,no,kidding.
Apparently I used to dance to it.
Oh god,I,would have loved to have seen that.
