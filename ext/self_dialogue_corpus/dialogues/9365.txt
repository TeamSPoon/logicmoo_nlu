Who's your favorite current rapper?
I'm not sure, I've been listening to a lot of different artists lately.
That's cool. My fave's definitely Lil Uzi Vert.
I've heard XO TOUR Llif 3, it's dope.
It is! Have you heard anything from Lil Yachty?
Yes! I love Harley and iSpy with Kyle.
They're both pretty good. Do you like Playboi Carti?
I haven't heard anything from him besides Magnolia.
I like that song alright. Did you know he did a collaboration with Lil Uzi Vert on wokeuplikethis*?
No, I didn't. I'll have to give it a listen, thanks!
