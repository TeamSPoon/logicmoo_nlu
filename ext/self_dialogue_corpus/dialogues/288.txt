Have you ever seen the movie called the super it came out in 2010 the movie was great.
yes I believe i did see that movie was it based on a man being depressed and turning himself into a super hero after his wife leaves him for a drug dealer.
Yes where did you go to see the movie I saw the movie on cable it was on a stars channel.
I didn't see it on cable i went to the movie theater and saw it with my fiance.
The movie was a really great encouragement on people having to be strong after going through such an awful breakup experience.
Yes it also turned out to be so sad when the Super Hero's friend got shot in the head.
Yes she was a young girl and was so funny and full of life.
She was a daredevil and sometimes egged the super on to do some of his fantastic feats.
She was kind of young for him but she had a major crush on him and seduced him one time.  He was a little mortified but he loved her as well.
that is why it was so sad, they went to do in the drug dealers but she was caught by heavy gunfire and killed instantly.  The super was only left with a rabbit for company.
