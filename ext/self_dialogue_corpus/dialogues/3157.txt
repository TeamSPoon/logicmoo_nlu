I wonder if the Redskins and Kirk Cousins will agree on a long-term deal.
Washington can't afford to keep going with this year-by-year franchise tag, can they?
They can get away with it this year, but it will cost a fortune - at least $35 million, I believe - to use a tag for the third consecutive year.
So what do the Redskins do, then?
Cousins seems set on testing free agency in 2018, and it seems there is mutual interest between him and the 49ers.
Well, Cousins obviously has the previous connection with San Francisco's new coach, Kyle Shanahan.
Right, and it's not like the 49ers have a franchise quarterback on the current roster.
So it seems like a natural fit.
Nothing is that easy, though, because the Redskins could still use the transition tag on Cousins.
How does that work?
For around $29 million, which would easily be enough to make Cousins the NFL's highest paid player, they can use the tag to keep the option to match any other team's offer.
That's a ton of money though, why would the Redskins use this tag but not just come to terms on a normal long-term deal?
I read an article that the owner, Dan Snyder, would rather overpay for Cousins then to see him leave for the 49ers.
So it's personal, then?
Pretty much, it goes back a few years when Shanahan and his father Mike, then the head coach, had a falling out with Snyder.
Well, if I'm the 49ers, I don't know that I'd want to overpay for Cousins anyway.
That's a good point because he's a good quarterback but is he really elite?
He hasn't won a playoff game yet and he's 28 years old.
Besides, the 2018 draft is apparently loaded with promising quarterbacks.
I would prefer that route for San Francisco, especially since the team is clearly in rebuilding mode at this point.
