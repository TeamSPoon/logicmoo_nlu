What do you think of Bon Iver?
I think he's kinda overrrated, to be honest.
I gotta say I disagree.
Have you heard his most recent album? It's literally just noises.
Seriously? I love it. It's so original.
I guess that's one way to put it!
What kind of stuff do you like?
I like a lot of indie stuff, just not so... hipstery.
That's funny.
alt-J is one of my current faves.
OOh, yeah me too.
Have you seen them live?
No, I don't think they've toured in the US anytime recently.
I wish they would!
You and me both!
I haven't been able to see them live either, unfortunately.
Have you caught any good shows.
Not recently, to be honest.
What about the festival this weekend?
Nah, tickets are too pricey! I'll stick to my vinyl for the weekend.
