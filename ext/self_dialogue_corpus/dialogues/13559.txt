You know what the main theme of Star Wars is, when all films are taken as a whole?
I don't, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
It's about the change. The rise and fall of governments and power.
Alright, I'm listening. Go on.
In the prequel trilogy, we have the Galactic Republic fighting against the Separatist Alliance. Who are the Separatists but proto-rebels?
But the Separatists are the bad guys?
Are they? The Republic becomes the Empire, and the Separatists are fighting what they see to be a corrupt institution.
So you're saying they become the Rebel Alliance just as the Republic becomes the Empire?
Exactly, those remnants form into part of the Rebel Alliance, just as the Imperial Remnants later become The First Order.
And the Rebellion becomes the New Republic. I guess it is all about the rise and fall of different organizations, and how one leads to another.
