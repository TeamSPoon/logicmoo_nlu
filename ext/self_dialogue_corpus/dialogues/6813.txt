We will have to plan to see the new Frozen when it is out.
Definitely. We should take our kids.
You know mine loved the first one. They watched it so many times.
Ya so did mine.
I think they loved the music from the movie a lot.
I loved the music so I may have encouraged mine.
Ya I thought compared to some of the other songs they liked it was better.
I bet I could see Let It Go from memory.
I know that I could. Also the song Olaf sings.
Ya that is another one they really liked.
