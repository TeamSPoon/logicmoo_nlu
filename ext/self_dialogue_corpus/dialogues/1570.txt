Hey bud, who you got this year, Pats or Seahawks.
Seahawks, what are you smoking, they wont even make it past the wild card game.
Wow, ok so who do you think is going to make the superbowl then
Its going to be atlanta again.  Matt ryan has a chip on his shoulder after last years game.
You may be right.  If they do make i back i at least hope that they get a rematch with the patriots so they can avenge that horrible loss.
I don't care so much about that, id rather not take the chance of the pats getting another ring.
Do you hate the Pats that much?
I don't really hate them i guess, but i like it better when there aren't dynasties in sports.  Spread the wins around a bit.
That can be boring though, i like when you have a team that you know is just dominant.
As long as it isnt the Pats im good.  I dont mind when a team from a certain division wins the division several years in a row.
Yeah like the packers, ill always root for them since im not a bears or lions fan.
What about the vikings?
I do like the vikings, and their stadium is AWESOME, have you seen pictures of it?
Yeah its almost a rival of jerry world.  Just incredible how opulent they are making them now.
Anything to get the people to come watch the games i guess.
Do you think that fans arent supporting the NFL for some reason?
Not necessariliy, i just know that it costs a TON to go to the stadium to watch a game, so you have to do something to make it worth the amount you have to pay.
Thats true, i guess its not really something that the average family could afford.  Easier to just watch it on TV too.
Yeah, they are making a lot of money on TV deals since so many people are choosing to watch that way now.
Its crazy the revenue that is generated.
