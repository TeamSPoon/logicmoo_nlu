I want to watch one of the Harry Potter movies.
Great. Which one do you want to watch?
I am not sure, which one has lot's of action?
I would check out the first one.
Why is that?
The first one has action just like all the others.
Do I need to watch them all in order?
I would. It will give you all the backstories that help you understand it better.
Great. I will do that. Thanks for your help. You are like a wizard.
Thanks a lot for that compliment, muggle.
