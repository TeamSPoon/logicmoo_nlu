What are your predictions for the Steelers in this year's NFL season?
I think they have a pretty good chance this season.
Why do you think so?
The injury situation seems to have cleared up and we don't have major players with suspensions.
Was that an issue last season?
Yes. Not having LeVeon Bell for the first four games probably made a difference down the stretch.
How so?
Well had we won more of the first four games we would not have been in the Wild Card and would have more time to rest in the playoffs.
DO you sense the mood of the team is better?
I do especially for Antonio Brown now that they gave him a generous contract.
What do you think of the rule changes with the goal posts?
It is really going to make the game interesting.
How so?
With a goal post not so wide, I guess windy day kicking could make or break a game more often
Do you think that rule will stay?
It depends on the relative skill of the kickers.
What did you think of the comments that kickers are not really a part of the team?
I found the comments totally ridiculous.
Okay....who are you predicting to meet in the Superbowl?
Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It will be epic!
