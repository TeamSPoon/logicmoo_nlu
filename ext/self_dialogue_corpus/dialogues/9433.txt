How much do you like Outkast?
I think they were very innovative
Did you like Speakerboxxx?
I thought it was OK.
I think the vocal harmonies on the album were top notch
Yeah Outkast always does a good job sounding clean.
My favorite though is Bombs over Baghdad.
That song alone is one of the best rap songs of all time.
Yeah I loved the chorus
It made you latch onto the track
