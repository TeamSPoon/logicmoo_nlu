Do you think old people are too nostalgic for old hip-hop?
I get where they're coming from. A lot of the stuff from the past had way more substance than the newer stuff.
Is that right? I think we tend to remember only the really great stuff from the past and to forget a lot of the fluff.
I guess that's sort of true, I mean, we're not thinking about Vanilla Ice and the Fresh Prince when we think about the Golden Era of hip hop.
Yeah, I think if you filtered out all of the mediocre current stuff and only highlighted the great stuff, it'd be competitive with the supposed "Golden Era" of hip-hop.
True, there are so many great records coming out that are bending genres and doing really cool things. From Chance 3 to The Life of Pablo.
So I'll ask again, are old people too nostalgic for old hip-hop?
I don't know what would constitute "too nostalgic" but they definitely dismiss current stuff too easily and forget about a lot of the mediocre stuff from their own time.
Agreed. I do really miss nineties hip hop though.
I know, I would explode if I got another Illmatic.
