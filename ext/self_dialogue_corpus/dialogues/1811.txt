Damn, man.
What's up?
Uhhhh, my car broke down.
How so?
My engine got torn apart, and now I can't drive the rest of the way to Georgia to see the Falcons take on the Saints!
Hey, I'm also headed in the same direction, wanna call a tow truck to tow your vehicle, and then we head to Atlanta?
Uhhhh, sure, yeah!
Okay, I'll call the tow truck now, then!
Well, I guess you're a lifesaver today, then!
Hey, I'm here to call about a broken down car in the middle of Interstate 237, towards Georgia. Yeah, can ya pick it up? Thanks. Okay. Bye. Alright, we good to go to Georgia?
Yeah, l guess.
Don't worry, brotha. We're gonna see those Falcons destroy the Saints. You can hang out at my crib while your car's getting repaired.
I guess I owe you one, eh?
Nahhh, it's fine.
Dude, if it weren't for you, I would have just given up on going to the Falcons game.
Dude, I think it's better to watch it on tv, honestly.
Well, I like the experience of being out there in the stadium. You know, it's sort of like a bonding thing.
Hmmm... I can deal with that.
Really?
Yeah, I also do it. Just not as often as you do, though.
