Have you seen any good thriller movies lately?
Yes!  I saw recently saw that movie "Annabelle".
Ooooh!  That's the one about the doll right?
Yes!  It was really creepy and kept me on the edge of my seat.
The scene at the beginning with the crayons in the hallway totally freaked me out.
Yeah and when the doll kept coming back after they tried to get rid of it...scared me so much!
Did you see that they are making a prequel to that movie?
No way!  Really?
Yes, it's called Annabelle: Creation.  I cannot wait.
Oh wow!  I'm excited for that one too.  I hope it's just as good!
