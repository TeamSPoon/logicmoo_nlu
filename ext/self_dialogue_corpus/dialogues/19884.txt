Do you listen to Joy Division?
No. Tell me about them.
They are a post-punk band that was formed in Manchester, England in 1976.
What does post-punk mean?
It means literally "after punk". It is music that is inspired by punk, but doesn't necessarily sound like punk. It is more experimental and open.
Is Joy Division a loud, aggressive band?
No. Only a few of their sounds have a loud, aggressive style. For the most part, they are neither loud nor aggressive. It is not loud, but it is still intense, just in a different way.
Do they have any famous songs?
The song you are most likely to have heard is called "Love Will Tear Us Apart".
Are they still around?
No. Sadly, the singer committed suicide when he was still quite young. The remaining members went on to form a band called New Order.
What albums did they put out?
Unknown Pleasures and Closer.
What label were they on?
Factory Records.
How can I learn more about Joy Division?
I would recommend watching a movie called 24 Hour Party People. It's not specifically about Joy Division, but about Factory Records. It's pretty interesting and entertaining.
Anything else?
There's also a film called Control and I am certain there are books and at least one documentary out there.
I will check them out. Thanks.
