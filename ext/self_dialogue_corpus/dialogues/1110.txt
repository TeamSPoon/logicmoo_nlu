ARE YOU AN NFL FAN?
YES I AM.  NOT A HUGH FAN BUT I ENJOY IT.
HOW IS YOUR FAVORITE TEAM?
I LIKE THE CAROLINA PANTHERS
WHY DO YOU LIKE THEM.
I AM FROM AND LIVE IN NC SO PULL FOR THE HOME TEAM.
I AM A BIG COLTS FAN.
MY WIFE IS FROM INDIANAPOLIS SO WE PULL FOR THEM ALSO.
I THINK ANDREW LUCK WILL HAVE A GOOD SEASON
LAST TIME WE WERE IN INDIANAPOLIS, WE COULD SEE THE STADIUM RIGHT OUT OUR HOTEL WINDOW.
I WENT TO ONE GAME LAST YEAR WHEN THEY PLAYED THE SAINTS.
I DIN'T GET TO A PANTHERS GAME THIS YEAR.  I WATCHED MOST OF THEM ON TV.
DO YOU FOLLOW ANY OTHERS TEAMS?
NOT REALLY, BUT I LIKE OTHER PLAYERS.
WHICH PLAYERS ARE THOSE?
I LIKE RUSSELL WILSON AND PHILLIP RIVES BECAUSE THEY WENT TO MY ALMA MATER.
BOTH OF THOSE GUYS ARE GREAT QUARTERBACKS.
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE GREAT YEARS.
I JUST HOPE THE COWBOYS STINK.
I HOPE THE FALCONS HAVE A TERRIBLE YEAR.
