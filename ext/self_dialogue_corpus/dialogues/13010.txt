Dude, did you see the latest Star Wars movie
I know. It was sad. No Luke Skywalker or Han Solo or anything!
Um, well, yes, it's a prequel. Rogue One is actually about the events that led up to the very first Star Wars film.
Couldn't it have had Han Solo though? I mean, he existed in that time period, right?
Well, maybe, but I don't think it would have made sense. He wasn't doing anything related to the storyline at that time.
Even better! We could have seen him in his early days.
OK, but Harrison Ford is pretty old now. I mean, it probably would have been a younger actor to play young Han Solo
Nah man, CGI! We could have had a badass Han Solo.
What is your obsession with Han Solo?
Han Solo...
