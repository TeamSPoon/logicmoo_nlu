What were some of your favorite looks at the Met gala this year?
I loved Rhianna's dress, she really followed the theme this year.
Oh, that's right, the theme was about the fashion of Comme des Garçons.
Caroline Kennedy wore Comme des Garçons and looked amazing.
I thought Madonna looked interesting, I think Jeremy Scott designed her dress.
I remember her dress, it was a military theme, and she wore gloves.
Who else wore Comme des Garçons to the Met gala?
I'm not sure, I think Anna Wintour actually wore Chanel.
Lena Dunham wore a really pretty dress to the gala.
I recall her outfit, it was really elegant and had a very long train.
The men didn't really stand out at the gala, fashion wise.
No, but Roger Federer wore a Gucci jacket that was interesting.
A lot of ladies wore gloves this year, maybe that's a new trend.
It could be, I like long gloves as an accessory to bring out the colors in an ensemble.
I'm not sure if I would have followed the theme either this year, Rei Karakubo's clothes are very eccentric.
Yes, her runway shows are far out, but her ready to wear is far more down to earth.
I just remembered that the girlfriend of someone famous wore a nice Comme des Garçons dress, it was oddly shaped.
I think odd shapes are a nice signature of Rei Karakubo's work for Comme des Garçons, it's hard to pull that off, but she does.
Shoes did not really seem to garner much attention at the gala this year.
No, but I saw a rapper wearing Louboutins, I didn't know they made those for men!
