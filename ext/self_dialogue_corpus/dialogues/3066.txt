What happened to Romo anyway?
He retired
He has the 4th highest passer ratings. It's kinda sad that he didn't have any superbowl wins
Like we talked about, winning the Superbowl isn't all skills, but also depend a lot on luck.
Even going to the Superbowl depends on luck. Who's healthy, playing well, etc
And each game depends on the play calls too.
Yep.
Romo's going to be a color analysts for the CBS anyway. He's getting 1.5 mill talking about the sports he loves
That's a great job.
How do they calculate that paser rating anyway?
Huh. No idea. I reckon there's division involved
Ya think? Let me see here. Oh it's a weighted average
What does that mean?
That means a certain nunmbers are averaged andthen weighted by multiplying a factor.
But there are 4 categories, completion/attepmts, yards/attempts, TDs/attepmts, and interceptions/attempts
yeas, and each categoriy is mutiplied by a factor, albeit each by different factors.
Where did they get the factors?
You know, I have no idea on that one. But the goal is to get each number to be, at maximum, 2.375 and then those categories are then added and weighted again
This is too confusing. I think QBR from ESPN is much better
But you don't even know how they calculate it. You just like it because it's from ESPN. They've never made the details public, until they do, i trust the passer rating from NFL
