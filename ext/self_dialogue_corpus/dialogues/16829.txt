Hey, so I listened to that band you recommended the other day.
You mean Periphery?
Yeah, that's the one.
So did you like it?
Yeah man, I listened to a few of their songs and they were pretty good.
Awesome man!
They are really technical though!
Yeah they do a lot of intricate guitar work in their songs.  And I don't know much about drums but even I can tell it's hard.
But they are really good.
Yeah I love them.
I also started listening to August Burns Red again.
Really?  What songs are you listening to?
I downloaded their newest album and I'm hooked on the song Martyr.
Oh, that's a good one.
Yeah, I've already listened to it like four times today.
Yeah I do the same thing where I listen to a song like crazy when I first hear it.
And that song is so good!  I love the guitar as it fades out at the end.
Yeah, I really like that too.
Not as many bands do that anymore.  I like it because the song hangs around a little longer and you don't have to say goodbye right away.
Yeah, it is kind of like that.
