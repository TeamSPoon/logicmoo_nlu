Hey, what do you think about Katy Perry's new album?
Witness? I love most of it.
Me too! I especially love Witness and Chained to the Rhythm.
Yes, but my favorite is "Miss You More".
I liked that one a lot too.
It's such a good ballad.
It reminds me of songs from the 90's when we had a lot of really good ballads.
Yeah, it feels like something we could get from Celine Dion.
It really does. I could see her singing it in her Vegas show too.
Exactly. Katy should be really proud to be honest.
She should.
I really hope she makes it a single off the album.
Yeah, she's only had upbeat ones so far. It would be nice to mix it up a little.
Yep, especially with the fall coming up. I like slower songs in fall.
Me too. I like upbeat in summer and to slow down for the later half of the year.
It would be perfect for radio too.
I wouldn't mind driving home from work and hearing it.
I would be turning that radio all the way up if I did.
You and me both.
Our love for Katy Perry is just unmatched.
