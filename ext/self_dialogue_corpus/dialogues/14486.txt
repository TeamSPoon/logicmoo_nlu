Did you see the Clippers game the other day?
Yeah. Blake Griffin is looking hot!
You're funny. You never want to talk about the actual game.
What do you mean? I love the game!
Well, they were tied until the last minute. Wasn't that exciting?
Yeah, and Blake Griffin made the winning shot.
Again with that.
I just really enjoy his shooting skills.
He did make a bunch of baskets that game.
I know. I enjoyed the replays.
Because of the athleticism, right?
See, you get me.
I'm just really happy the Clippers are doing well this season.
Me too. They've only had a couple losses.
Do you want to get tickets to their next game?
I'd love that!
I thought you would.
I'll get to see Blake Griffin up close.
We'll get to cheer for our team up close!
That too.
