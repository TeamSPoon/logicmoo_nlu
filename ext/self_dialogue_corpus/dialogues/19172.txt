Can you find a station that plays pop or rock? I don't really like country music, which is what is playing right now.
Oh, sure. I'm the same way, I do not care for country music, usually makes me feel sad.
Me too! That's the main reason I don't really want to listen to it.
Here we go. What about this band, The Eagles? Is that too old-school for you?
Of course not! I love The Eagles!
Me too. My favorite song is Hotel California, it really makes me want to sing along.
I'm the same way. If I hear a great song, you better believe I am going to be singing along with it.
I bet people in the other cars think I'm crazy when they look over and see me singing, "Welcome to the Hotel California!"
That's okay, let them. Music is suppose to get you into a good mood.
That's true, it's soothes the savage beast, right?
I think so, especially The Eagles. Oh, they must be playing a lineup of The Eagles because Best of My Love is playing now.
Yeah, I bet they are. Well, good, now we know we will have some good tunes to listen to until we get to work.
I will feel more upbeat today at work because of it too. We should go to a concert?
Do you think they are still touring? I would love to go!
Yes, I know they are. I heard it on the radio the other day.
Do you think they will have any near us?
Sure, we may have to drive about an hour or so, but that's no big deal.
You're right, it would be worth it. Who knows how much longer they will be touring.
Exactly! They are getting a bit older so we better go while we can.
I will find us some tickets tonight girl! It will be a blast!
