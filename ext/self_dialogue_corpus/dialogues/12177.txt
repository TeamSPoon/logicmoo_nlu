Who was your favorite Star Wars villain?
I think Darth Maul was probably my favorite.
His character design was awesome. I didn't like the movie he was in that much, though.
Yeah, Episode One isn't very well-liked.
You don't think Darth Vader was a better villain?
Vader is more legendary for sure. However, he didn't feel as evil as Darth Maul to me.
I could see that. Vader's lore is very dark but his character doesn't do much to show it.
Plus Darth Maul had that awesome double bladed lightsaber.
That's true. That thing was really cool.
Too bad he ended up getting sliced in half.
