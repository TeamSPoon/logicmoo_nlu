Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?
Yes! It was incredible!
I know. I loved Emma Watson in it.
Yes, so did I. She really made it special.
Yeah she did. I have heard a lot of people complain about the computer-generated animation though.
Really? I thought it was great.
Yeah. Mainly in the scene with the wolves.
Oh okay. I do remember then looking fake but I didn't really mind.
Yeah. I think it was still such a good story line.
I'm glad they came out with it. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite.
