Have you ever heard of the movie Southland Tales?
No I haven't, what is it?
It's one of my favorite movies, the guy who directed Donnie Darko made it.
Very cool, I'm a big fan of that movie. Is it like it?
Well, not really but both do involve the end of the world.
Interesting, who's in it?
Lots of big names, like The Rock, Amy Poehler, Sean William Scott, and Will Sasso.
Will Sasso from Mad TV?
Yep, there's lots of comedic actors in it.
So it's a comedy?
No, far from it.
So drama?
Yeah, a mix of drama and science fiction. Kind of like Donnie Darko.
I see, and I'm going to guess it's super weird too.
Yeah, that would be a good way to describe it.
Can you tell me anything about the story?
Oh yeah, it involves an alternate Earth where the US was attacked by a nuke and it shows the aftermath.
Such as?
The government controlling everything.
Oh, that sounds intriguing, I'll check it out.
