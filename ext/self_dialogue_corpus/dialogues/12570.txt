Are you excited to see the New Star Wars?
I was not a fan of the last one.
The Force Awakens?
No, Rogue One.
Why?
I did not like the story.
Well, it showed how the good guys got the plans.
Right, but we already knew what happen to them.
You mean in the older movies when they say the brave people all died to protect the plans.
Right, it was pointless.
