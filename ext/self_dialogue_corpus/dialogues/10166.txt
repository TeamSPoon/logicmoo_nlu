Did you see the advert for the new Transformer movie?
It was just action packed. Do you think the film will be as well?
I think so.
The last ones were not so good.
They had too much going one in them.
The plot was just too confusing.
The new one, some of the good guys go bad.
Optimus Prime goes bad right?
Yes, he wants to kill all humans so the autobots can have the earth.
I wonder if in the movie he will go good again?
