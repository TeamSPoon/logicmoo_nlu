Hey have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes it was great!
Where did you see it at?
THe movies.
Oh, I watched it at home on DVR but I can image it was much better on the big screen.
Yes it was very entertaining.
Did you know that Disney World has a Beast castle you can eat at that looks just like the one in the movies?
No, have you been.
Yes. Its awesome.
I think i will buy the Beauty and the Beast movie when it comes out on DVD.
