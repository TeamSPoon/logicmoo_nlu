Did you see the original Star Wars in the theater?
no, I wasn't even born yet.
which Star Wars character is your favorite?
especially with today's technology and artificial intelligence C-3PO is my favorite.
outside of acting and cinematography what film trait do you think has most added to the success of the franchise?
without a doubt that would have to be sound editing and music.
Which character do you think has evolved the most?
The obvious choice is Luke Skywalker but Darth Vader would come a close second.
Which character do you think would serve to be the central figure in the next sequel.
I think a woman like Princess Leia is ripe for the central figure.
