Hey have you heard David Bowies album Black Star?
You mean the one he released before he died?
Yeah that one.
I had it on replay for about 2 weeks after it came out.
Me too!  David Bowie was a musical genius.
What was your favorite song of his?
Its hard to choose a favorite song.
I love the song Lazarus from Black star.  The music video is also really creepy.
Yeah it was like a love letter to his fans.  I think he knew it was his swan song.
The other song I really like from Black Star was the one that uses the language from A clockwork Orange.
I think that song is called "Girl Loves Me."
Yeah that's the one!  It's so creative.
David Bowie was always creative with all of his music. Did you know he created a character for every album he ever wrote?
Like Ziggy Stardust?
Yeah, or When he wrote the album "Outside" as a detective.
It always made his music really interesting because each album was different.
Lets listen to some Bowie now.
What song should we play?
How about "Life on Mars"
Sounds good.  I'll grab that from my Vinyl collection now.
