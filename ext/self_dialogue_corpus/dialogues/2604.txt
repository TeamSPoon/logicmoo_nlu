So, who do you think will meet in the Super Bowl this year?
I think this is the Raider's year to finally breakthrough.
I just don't see how to Patriots lose in the playoffs as long as Brady is their quarterback.
I agree he is a special player, but the Raiders are just too young and talented. This is their year to breakthrough.
In terms of the NFC, I think the Cowboys are a team that can make a deep playoff run.
I like watching the Cowboys play, but they are just a little young for me to get behind.
I agree, their prime may be a few years out.
I think the Packers will end up winning the NFC.
That is not a bad choice.
Aaron Rodgers is my primary motivation for that pick.
So then, who wins a Packers/Raiders Super Bowl?
If I had to put money on it, I would say the Packers.
I agree with you. Aaron Rodgers is too talented to lose on that stage.
He also has experience that a lot of Raiders don't have.
Yeah, you're right. That is crucial in games like the Super Bowl.
Now that the Super Bowl is settled, what teams do you think will take a big step forward?
I think the Panthers will rebound from last year and have a great year.
They definitely have all the tools and pieces needed to rebound.
I am looking forward to this year to see who all can challenge the Raiders and the Packers.
So am I. This should be an exciting year to be an NFL fan.
