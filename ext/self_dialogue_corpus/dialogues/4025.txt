Did you ever watch Apocalypto?
Is that the one by Mel Brooks?
Yes, he can make some amazing movies.
I have not seen that one.
It is starring real Mayan and ethnic people from central Mexico.
Wow that is authentic.
Yes some of the actors had never acted before.
It is a good movie.
It is one of the greatest movies of all time.
Ok thank you for telling me.
