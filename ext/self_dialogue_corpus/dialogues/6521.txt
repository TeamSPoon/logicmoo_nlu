What did you think of Frozen?
To be honest, I thought it was average.
Me too! A lot of my friends who have children are raving about it.
Yeah, it was advertised as "the first movie that really features female empowerment" and I didn't like that.
I agree! Mulan was years before Frozen and she was the most empowered Disney character ever!
That is exactly how I feel! I don't like how the newer movies are overshadowing the classics.
I completely agree with you, even though the songs from Frozen are pretty catchy.
Oh I know, I went to Kareoke last week with my friends and at least 3 groups sang "Let it Go," and by the end of the night it was stuck in my head!
My sister's daughter has been wearing her Elsa costume for a week straight, so I guess it is pretty popular with the kids!
I'm gonna stick to watching the classics, Mulan for life!
