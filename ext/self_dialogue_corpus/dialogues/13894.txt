Do you like Lady Gaga?
I think she's weird.
Of course, that's why she's Lady Gaga.
I mean what kind of name is that any way?
It fits her. So you don't like her?
I think she's okay. I like the song Paparrazzi.
I like that song, too.
I'm not really a big fan of pop music, though. Why do you ask?
I was just wondering. She's coming to town I hear.
I think I'll pass on that!
