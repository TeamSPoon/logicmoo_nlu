Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?
The original one or the Lindsay Lohan one?
The Lindsay Lohan one. There was another one?
Yeah, it was made in the 60s.
I'd never heard of it before now.
I liked the newer version too, but it was a bit after my time.
I loved the Lindsay Lohan version as a child. Thought she had real potential as an actress.
Yeah, it's a shame her career never went anywhere. She plateaued as a child.
It's still a great kid's movie to this day.
I agree, but most kids today want to watch what's new instead of what's good.
