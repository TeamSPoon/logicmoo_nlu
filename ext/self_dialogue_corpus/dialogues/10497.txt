Hello.
Hi there.
What have you been doing lately?
Nothing much. Just been watching movies.
What movies?
Last one I watched was Dredd.
Good choice. I love that movie.
So do I. It's criminal that they're not making a sequel.
Blame the advertising department.
Yeah, I heard it didn't do well in theatres.
They totally failed to market the movie correctly.
It did really well in DVD sales, though.
I heard that too, but I guess it still wasn't enough.
Nope. Execs don't know what's good for them.
At least it's getting a TV show.
Wait, really?
What's what I heard.
Well at leats something is happening!
I'd still prefer a new movie though.
Yeah, me too.
