Where do you think music is headed in the future?
That's an interesting question, since music has changed so much lately.
Yeah, with the digital age we've gone through a lot of weird music.
I bet there's a lot of parallels with art. Rapid onset of musical genres. Jazz to hip hop to R&B to rap to elecronic, to trap.
to dubstep, to EDM, to progressive, to house.
You think there's always been this many genres?
No way. Before There was more of a normalization. Everyone listened to rock. Everyone listened to disco.
Makes sense, since everybody had to listen to the radio for music.
Then there were ipods, then there were free music streaming sites.
So I guess this burst of music is a reflection of the tastes of different people.
Blends of different cultures too, as the world becomes more multicultural.
So it's safe to say that this explosion is still happening and will only expand?
Yeah, I wonder what other kind of genres there will be.
Yeah, it's like art. There is so many different kinds of historical art. In the modern movement it just exploded.
How so?
Well the movement just broke, to the point that that art became just about challenging previous movements.
I wonder if that'll happen to music
Maybe when there stops being new genres for music, and music will be forced to reinvent previous genres.
Dada music?
Yeah dada music .
