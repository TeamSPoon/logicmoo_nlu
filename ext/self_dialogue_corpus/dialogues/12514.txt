Did you see Rogue one?
Yeah it's not one of my favorites from the Franchise.
I know what you mean, it was good though.
Well that's a given, anything is better than episode 2.
True, I just didn't like how it ended.
Well who ends a movie by killing everyone to set up a movie from 40 years ago?
I was so sad when that happened.
Though it was great to see the Princess again.
That made me cry even more. I can't believe she died.
The number of people that cried after hearing that; I'm pretty sure it raised the sea level more than global warming did.
