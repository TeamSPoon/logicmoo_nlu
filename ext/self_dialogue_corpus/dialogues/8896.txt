Do you like rock?
I do. What should I listen to.
Have you ever heard of The Mars Volta?
No, who are they?
They are a couple of guys from Texas that make great music.
It is just two guys?
Well, there are actually a bunch, but there are two leaders.
That sounds really cool. What kind of music is it?
It's progressive rock. Check it out.
I will do this very soon.
