Have you noticed they really don't make westerns anymore?
I can't even think of any newer movies that are westerns.
They probably don't make enough money.
Well, with so many other movies to choose from that have great special effects, it makes sense people wouldn't want to spend their money to see a western.
The last western I saw was The Lone Ranger.
You mean the Disney movie?
Yes, the one starring Johnny Depp.
I heard that didn't do very well.
It didn't.
I also heard the ratings were bad.
A few years back I saw one called Cowboys versus Aliens.
Who was in it?
Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig.
If it has aliens it sounds more like science fiction to me.
It was a combination of both.
Did it do well at the box office?
It made around a hundred and seventy five million.
Not that much, then.
But it cost about a hundred million to make.
Looks like making western movies just isn't worth it anymore.
