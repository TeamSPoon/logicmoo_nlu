I can't wait to see how Jamal Adams does on the Jets
I don't think that he will do too much. He is a rookie.
He is more than a rookie, he is a monster.
I don't think so. He seems alright.
I've been following since he started at LSU; trust me on this.
I do, but don't forget that this is not college football anymore.
That is true, but his dad played in the NFL.
Yeah, but his dad was a running back.
That is correct but his dad has the ability to share his experiences and give him tips.
Yeah, but only to an extent.
You're right but we will have to wait and see how he applies everything when he plays.
I think that he is promising, but I am more interested in watching Richard Sherman this season.
I did not use to like him; I have recently begun to respect him.
He is very smart and is able to create plays that may have not been plays at all.
How does he do that?
By watching football film and knowing the patterns of specific players.
Oh, okay. I wish he were faster.
Same. I have seeing him get beat on deep routes by extremely fast receivers.
That is the name of the game; you can't be good at everything.
That is true, but if I were in that position, I would be embarrassed
