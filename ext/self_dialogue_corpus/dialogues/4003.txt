Did you see the Dark Knight?
Yes I did.  Awesome Joker.
Yeah Health Ledger was amazing.
A different take.  He was kind of scary.
Yeah, plus him and Bale had a good back and fourth.
Don't forget two Face.
Yeah a little overlooked due to Ledger and his Joker.
I know.  Unfairly so because he was awesome too.
I like how Batman at the end took the blame for Dent dying too.
Right, with that closing line about him being tough enough to take it as Gotham's Dark Knight.
