Hey, do you like rap or hip-hop?
Yeah, definitely. I'm not as in to more modern artists, but I love rap/hip-hop.
Oh cool, what artists do you like?
Like I said, I'm into older rap. I think Tupac, Biggie, Eminem, and Jay-Z are probably the best rappers of all time.
Oh yeah, I think pretty much everyone who likes rap respects those guys. They're incredibly talented.
Yeah, it's fun to debate who's the best, but I think they're all the best at what they do for different reasons.
How do you mean?
I think Tupac is the best lyricist and Notorious BIG has the best flow. I think Eminem is the best at rhyming.
Yeah, I can see that. It's hard to choose a best, especially since Tupac and Biggie died so tragically and so young.
Yeah, I've often wondered what music they would've put out if they were still alive. They were young and probably could've come out with a lot more material.
Yeah, it sucks.
Definitely. What artists do you like?
I definitely like older rap, like the artists you listed, but I also like more modern rap.
Oh cool, I'm not as informed about more modern rap. I like some more modern rap, but I don't know a lot of artists.
Yeah, there are a lot of unique rap acts out there these days. Some are even pretty eccentric, but in a cool way.
What artists do you like?
In terms of more modern rap acts, I like Migos, Flatbush Zombies, Lil Uzi Vert, Future, and Logic. I'm sure there's more, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head at the moment.
Cool, I think I've heard of Migos, but I'm not familiar with the other artists.
They're all really talented. You should hop on Youtube and check them out.
Maybe I'll do that. I've been meaning to expand my rap music library and knowledge.
