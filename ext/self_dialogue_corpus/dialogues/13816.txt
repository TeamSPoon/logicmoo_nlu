Did you see Lady Gaga's oscar performance?
Which one?
The one where she was introduced by Joe Biden.
Oh, was that the one with the survivors of sexual assault?
Yes!
That was really moving.
I agree. Do you remember which song she sung?
I think it was called "til it happens to you".
It's so amazing that she has made herself an advocate for sexual assult.
I agree. It is inspirational.
