We're going to watch She Wore a Yellow Ribbon tonight. Want to join us?
Oh, no thanks. I'm not into John Wayne movies.
No? They're the best!
I mean I like some of the trademarks of him as an actor, I just can't seem to enjoy the movies.
Well that's too bad. I love how his characters always get the bad guy and his no nonsense approach to justice.
That's one of my issues with it. Some of the ideals about what makes a bad guy bad and the inflated view of manmade laws.
I just see them as good clean fun.
Oh, don't get me wrong, there are some aspects of westerns I really like, such as all the beautiful scenery, the deserts and streams and such, but they get a lot wrong, too.
Such as?
The Native Americans are typically played in a very stereotypical way and aren't even portrayed by Native actors for example.
Oh, I've seen that. I think it just shows the time period.
Yeah, it's just nice to not have to be reminded that history was so terrible. There's also a lot of pro-war messages in westerns and you always see people on "cattle drives" and other ventures to exploit animals.
I don't think people in that time really knew better.
Whether they did or not, it's still not something I really enjoy. I'll watch them with family who's into them, and enjoy the things like the scenery and music and take the rest with a grain of salt.
Tell me about the music.
Well I remember one John Wayne movie in particular where Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson sang a song together. I thought that was pretty cool.
Oh yeah, that was Rio Bravo. I like that one.
Rio Bravo! That's the one, I remember thinking how funny Dean Martin's character was.
He can be pretty funny.
So those are some things I enjoy about them.
