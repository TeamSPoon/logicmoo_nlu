What is the deal with midiclorians, or whatever they're called?
I'm not sure. I thought that was a pretty weird explination.
Why did they even need to explain?
Guess it just put some "science" behind it.
Rather odd though....
How else would they test Anikan?
Fair enough, but I think they could have come up with something better.
Been no mention of it in the new one.
True. Hopefully it remains that way.
You said it, brother!
