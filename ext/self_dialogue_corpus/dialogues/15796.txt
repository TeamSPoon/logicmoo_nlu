Do you ever listen to soul music?
Yeah, all the time!  I love the Delegation.
Oh gosh, me too.  That song Oh Honey is amazing.
Yeah, it really is.  And pretty much anything by Teddy Pendergrass or Al Green is my jam.
I know, me too!  I love Marvin Gaye as well.
Yes, I do too.  Al Green has some real classics, though.
I'm So Tired of Being Alone?  That's definitely my favorite.
Yeah, I never get sick of that one.
What about the Flamingos, do you like them?
I love them!  I think that music is underrated.
They need to have a radio station that plays it nonstop.
They do, on satellite.  I don't know about a local one, though.
Oh, okay.  I'll check that out.
Yeah, I can listen to soul all day.  I love I wanna Get Next To You, too.
That was in the movie Friday, right?
Yep!  That's the one.
Yeah, that one really makes you want to slow dance.
All soul music does!
Do you like George Clinton?
No, can't say I do.  He is a little too strange for me.
