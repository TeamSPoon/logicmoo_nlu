Romo had a nice game against the bears.
Tell me about it. How badly do you have to suck to make Cutler look good?
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
Sanchez is starting soon. I think he can turn the team around
That could be, but I've learned not to hold my breath after Roethlisberger.
You really thought Ben was that bad?
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
Yeah, I guess that's true. I don't see Roethlisberger getting them any closer to the Super Bowl.
For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick.
I can see that. He was better as a rookie, but not too consistent.
That's true, but teams would kill for his trade.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did.
Yes, but Cam had much better coaching.
Yeah, Roethlisberger had his best coaching in college.
Exactly, if he got drafted I can see him excelling past Brady.
