Do you have a favourite Disney movie?
Probably the animate Beauty & the Beast. I loved that one!
That was a great movie. I think Moana has become my favourite though.
I loved Moana.
The animated tattoos on Maui were hilarious!
They were. And Dwayne Johnson did such a great job voicing that character.
I was thrilled when they announced that casting, he is so great.
Did you hear how they cast the voice for Moana?
No I haven't.
They did a search for a unknown native pacific young woman to do the voice.
That's amazing. I love when big studios try to do good things.
I know, I mean it's Disney. They could have cast Selena Gomez and called it a day.
Yeah. Also wasn't Lin Manuel-Miranda involved with Moana?
He was, he worked on the music!
He is such a talent, I love everything he does.
Absolutely. Moana was just a fun movie all around with a great powerful girl character.
And great music.
Really great music. I don't think I have anything bad to say about that movie.
I know they are making a lot of live action remakes, but I just really enjoy their animated movies.
I doubt Disney will ever stop making animated movies, don't worry.
