Name a female singer who put her heart, soul and guts into her music.
Well if you are talking Old School that would be Aretha Franklin. Her version of "Ain't No Way" is angelic.
What about someone who is younger but just as good.
Beyonce shows her vocal strength on the song "Me, Myself and I."
What about a group of females who all can sing lead?
That's easy. Blackstreet. Have you heard their song "If You Love Me?" Magic!
No that one must have got by me. Name a female who went solo from a group.
Patti LaBelle comes to mind and I think she can give Celine Dion a run for her money any day.
You know of any male singers who can blow the roof off?
Yeah one, but he's deceased. You ever heard of Luther Vandross? He made "Never Too Much."
I remember that song. Man he was the ultimate entertainer too.
On the Pop side what male can you think of?
Paul McCarthy and Justin Timberlake are two that come to mind.
What about Usher?
He's right up there with Paul, Justin and Luther. Well maybe not Luther.
You know a male  who could sing and write music in the Rnb category?
Smokey Robinson comes to mind if you are talking about Old School.
Bruno Mars was who I thought you were going to say.
I like Lionel Ritchie too. "Penny Lover" is one of my all time favorite songs.
I like his original version of the song "Zoom." Classic!
