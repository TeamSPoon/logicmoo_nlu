What is your favorite super hero movie?
I really, really, like all the X-men movies.
I do as well. Its crazy seeing the comics come to life.
The characters are so spot on and Patrick Stewart is an amazing Professor X!
I really like Ian McKellen as Magneto. Watching him and Patrick Stewart together is great.
I think its really neat how X-men basically paved the way for all the Marvel movies we have now.
I know. All of the characters from our childhood are coming to life.
I can't wait to see Logan, I think it is going to be awesome.
Me too. I hope after that though, they start doing individual movies on the other Xmen.
That would be the best. I hope they do too!
