Do you want to watch The Little Mermaid with me later tonight?
Wow, I havent thought about that movie in ages! Yes, lets watch!
Ariel was always my favorite, she is a strong female character.
Really? I liked Prince Eric more!
Thats because he was handsome and kind!
Exactly! Most young girls love seeing a dreamy prince that can save them!
Dont forget she had the help of her friends, Sebastian and Flounder to beat Ursula.
You're right! They did make quite a team!
The songs were all amazing too! Especially "Part of your world"
That was my favorite too!! Lets go watch it!
