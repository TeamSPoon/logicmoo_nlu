Did you see that movie last fall about the Beatles called "8 Days A Week?"
No, I missed that one.
It was about what it was like being on tour in the early sixties.
The sixties were supposed to be crazy.
What was crazy was they had footage in the film of their last live performance they found under some old lady's bed.
Wow, that's like those old cars they find in barns, or famous paintings at a Savation Army.
She heard they were making a movie and called them, and asked if they wanted some films she took of the concert.
She had some great films she was just hanging onto?
Actually, she never even developed them. The movie people had to restore them and found all this great stuff.
What better way to really hear songs than watch them actually being played by the band?
