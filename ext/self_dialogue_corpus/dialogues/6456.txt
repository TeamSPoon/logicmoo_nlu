Did you see the Moana movie yet?
Yes, I did.
It was really awesome, right?
Yes, it was. I loved that it was not like a regular Disney movie where a prince and princess meets.
I know it was different.
I think it was awesome because the Moana movie was about family.
I loved how the movie really blended the culture right in.
Yeah, the songs were catchy.
I wish they would make a second Moana.
I hope so. It would be a hit.
