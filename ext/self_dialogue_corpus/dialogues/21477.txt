Have you watched any Wes Anderson movies recently?
Yea, I finally watched Fantastic Mr Fox.
How did you like it?
I did not like it that much.
Why not?  I thought it was wonderful.
It was pretty much a kid's movie.
There were some moments for the adults as well.
I guess, the only part I enjoyed was him devouring the chicken.
When he is at the dining table?
Yea, the motion and actions he made were hilarious.
How would you rank it in the Anderson lineup?
I would probably say it is at the bottom for me, but I have not seen many.
What is on top?
I would probably say The Royal Tenenbaums.
That is a great movie, one of the best.
Yea, I feel like I can re watch that anytime.
I have probably seen it 7 times or more.
Wow, that is a lot.
Yea, I really like his movies.
What is your favorite?
