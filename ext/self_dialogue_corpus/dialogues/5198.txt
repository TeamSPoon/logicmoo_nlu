You know what I always thought was a really cool movie?
No what was that?
The Sword in the Stone. The Disney movie, do you remember it?
Yes I remember it. It's Arthur when he was a kid.
Yes and he befriends Merlin. Who comes off as a strange magician really.
In his weird way Merlin taught Arthur a lot of important life lessons that he used one he became king.
That's true. Hey do you remember the scene where Merlin fought with that other witch, Madam Mim?
Yeah, do you remember how he defeated her by turning into a bacteria?
Yes! Another lesson for Arthur! Brain over brawn.
Merlin had to think his way out of the situation while Mim just tried to use her strength!
