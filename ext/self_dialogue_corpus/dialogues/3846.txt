What did you think of the movie "Signs"?
I actually didn't think it was bad. Not the best I've ever seen, though.
I always thought it was really slow to start.
Yeah, but the plot does get pretty interesting after while.
I thought the concept of the aliens and the crop circles were scary.
I agree. The movie made me want to lock my doors when it picked up.
M. Night Shyamalan always has pretty interesting ideas.
He does. I thought the baby monitor scene was a great choice.
That part freaked me out.
Me too. That, and the fact that crop circles are a real life occurrence.
