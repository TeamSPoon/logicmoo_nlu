Mom, I just saw The Beguiled. It's set in the South during the Civil War. It's Gothic and funny, and all about sex, really.
You mean with Clint Eastwood? Did you see it on TCM?
No, mom, in the theater last Friday night. You're thinking of the old version. This one is Sofia Coppola's version.
The Eastwood one was sexy, but morbid. This soldier hides at a girl's school, and the women all fight over him. Kind of depraved.
Yes. This one's depraved too. But it doesn't take itself so seriously. It's like it knows it's a B movie.
So it's not Eastwood, obviously. Who plays the man?
Colin Farrell. He's not as creepy as Estwood was, I bet. And he's sexy, too. And there are good women's parts.
So it's not so much about how they all want him, and they turn bitter and strange about it?
It is, and they turn strange, but in a more modern and self-aware way. They have agency; they're not passive.
I don't remember them as real passive in the old one. There was a surgery scene that was rather hard to watch.
Yeah, they've still got that.  Plenty of sex too, and an unhappy ending.
Oh, the old one was plenty sexy. Maybe not so graphic, though.
This one has sex. But it has love too, although that part doesn't really work out.
I remember the women, they were so innocent. Yet they fought so viciously over him, I think.
These women are collegial. They support one another. And yet--
Yet they still compete, don't they?
Well, he's the only man. And he's a scarce commodity. And it's Colin Farrell.
Do you think women still compete for men? Do you think it's a mistake?
.Yes. Life's about cooperating, mom, like you always said.
I know. But this was just a movie.
