So, what's your opinion on the NFL as a company?
I think they have a good track record for the most part.
I was thinking the same thing the other day. They avoid controversy well.
They really do. It seems like they try to do the right thing in most cases.
There might be a little bit of money corruption but that's to be expected.
Yeah, every now and then you'll hear players complaining about money issues.
I think you'll have that in any big organization.
It's a little crazy for them to complain considering how much they make per year.
Their contracts do vary a great deal, though.
That is true. Who is your favorite team?
I'm a huge Saints fan. Who is your favorite team?
I'm pretty partial to the Green Bay Packers.
Nice. Do you think they'll make the playoffs this year?
Definitely. I'm hoping they take the Super Bowl.
I could see it happening. I've always admired their offense.
I agree. They have good coordination.
Who do you think poses the biggest challenge to them?
Ultimately, Tom Brady has proven to be a pretty scary adversary.
I think the Seahawks are going to be hard to beat, also.
I agree. They'll remain to be a tough team to play around.
