Will the Rams do better in Los Angeles this year?
They probably cannot do any worse!
How will things improve.
Well, first there is new coach Sean McVay.
Really?     What happened to Jeff Fisher.
He was fired.    A couple of seasons too late in my opinion
OK.     What about Todd Gurley?
An unimpressive year last year, but expect better.
What about the defensive side?
There are a couple of bright spots.
Which positions are you thinking of?
Well, first Alec Ogletree had a Pro Bowl class season.
True.    Any others?
I see a bright future for Robert Quinn.
Any thoughts on attendance?
I think Los Angeles may warm to having a team back.
What about competition from the Chargers?
Los Angeles covers a huge populace.
I suppose you are correct.
There are two MLB and NBA teams in the area with good support.
