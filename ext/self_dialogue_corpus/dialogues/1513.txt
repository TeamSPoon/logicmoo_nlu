What would be your prediction for the Bears this year?
16-0, baby! Da Bears!
Very funny.
Honestly, I'm expecting another rough year. Maybe 5-11.
Think John Fox gets fired?
It's a definite possibility.
I think if they aren't at least 7-9, maybe 8-8, he's gone.
I can't really argue that.
The problem I see with the team is that on offense, they don't really have established receivers.
Cam Meredith had a breakout year last year.
He showed he could make some plays, but I don't trust him as a #1 receiver.
Yeah, for all his inconsistencies, you still had Alshon Jeffry last year.
And I just am not buying Kevin White at this point.
Poor guy can't stay on the field.
Yeah, I do feel bad for him, but injuries are a part of the NFL.
True. I think the Bears might actually have a solid defense this year.
Only if they can fix the safety position.
The whole secondary is a little bit unsettled.
'Unsettled' is a nice way to put it.
Haha, it's kinder than 'terrible'!
