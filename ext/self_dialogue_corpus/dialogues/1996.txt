Football season is starting back up soon.
Oh joy.
I take it you don't like football.
Let's put it this way.  The Superbowl could be played in our backyard and I would still not watch it.
Ouch.  It's a cool sport.
Cool??  A bunch of guys running around and tackling each other just to get a ball.
And they get touchdowns, fans cheer and they win games and if they're really good they can make millions.
That's another thing.  How are they paid so much?  It's ridiculous.
They bring in the money.
So??  They make more in one year than a lot of more deserving people combined
It's not about who deserves what.  It's the excitement of the game.
Isn't it all the same after awhile??  Get the ball, run, tackle, touchdown, kick..repeat
Oh and I suppose baseball is better.
I didn't say that.  I just find football really boring.
It's so unpredictable though.  Who will win, who will get hurt, will there be a fight?
You can watch Survivor if you want that.
Some of these players are amazing though.  Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Joe Montana AKA The Comeback Kid
At least you didn't say OJ Simpson.
Well he was a hell of a player.
Not convinced, sorry.
