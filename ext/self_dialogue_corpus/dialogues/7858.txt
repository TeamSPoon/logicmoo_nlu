What Harry Potter book was the best? and which movie was the
The forth book and seventh books were the best.
What about the movies?
The first, second and third movies were good I've always seen bit and pieces of the rest.
I thought you were such a big HP fan?
I am. Of the books.
So what do you have against the movies?
Some of them didn't make sense and they left out a lot of important stuff.
They're movies. They're only two hours. YOu can't put in everything.
They could have put in more. They didn't try.
