What are the top three worst ever movies you've seen, and why?
Oh dear, that's a hard one. First off, is Star Dust.
What made it so horrible?
Well, it was long and cheesy and long . . .
So it was too long?
Yeah, but it also just didn't make sense and didn't have a lot of good plot and everything.
What's the second one?
I really didn't like the Goonies.
Are you kidding? That's like - a cult classic!
I know. I feel really weird admitting that I don't like it but I didn't like the attitude the kids had.
Attitudes?
Yeah - the older kids were just bullies and rude and disgusting. I had a lot of none pleasant emotions watching that one.
Okay, I guess whatever goes for you. What's the third worst movie you've watched?
Well, I've watched part of Gone With the Wind, and I realize it's supposed to make you feel appalled, but I didn't like it.
What is with you, all these cult classics!
I know. It's just that there is so much at stake during the war time and so many things hung in the balance.
It opened a window for people to see and understand what was going on.
Oh, entirely, and that's good. The main character, what's her face, just drove me up the wall.
Scarlett O'Hare?
Yes. She's so immature and selfish!
