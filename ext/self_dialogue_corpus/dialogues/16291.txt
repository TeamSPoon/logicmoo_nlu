If you could see any band that isn't around anymore, who would you see?
I would love to see My Chemical Romance.
I was lucky enough to see them once in 2007.
Yes, you are very lucky. I never got to unfortunately.
I believe they may come back at some point. I at least hope so.
I don't know about that. The last thing I saw Gerard say, it seems like they are gone for good.
They were actually spotted together at a Frank Iero show a few months ago.
Really? Maybe they will get back together then.
At least we know they are still close friends.
That is true. What is your favorite song from them?
I really loved their older stuff. My favorite was certainly Cubicles.
I love that song too, but I was a bigger fan of the newer stuff.
I respect that, but I wasn't a big fan of the change of sound. They got a little too poppy for me.
I understand that. I just felt like Welcome To The Black Parade was such a solid album.
I will agree that it was. There was a few songs that really stood out, but the rest was just okay to me.
Which songs did you really like?
Dead was definitely my favorite. The beginning guitar solo was insane.
I absolutely love their guitars. I bet it was amazing seeing that live.
Yes it was. Their lead guitarist absolutely rips on guitar.
I am so jealous of you.
