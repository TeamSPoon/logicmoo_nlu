What band did you like when you were in college?
I went through a few different phases.
What were the phases?
When I started school I loved Radiohead.
Why did you like them?
OK Computer was the first album I really latched onto in a "this changed my life" way. Now I think that's super juvenile, though.
How long did you like them?
Until a little after Kid A came out. I didn't like it very much.
What other bands did you like?
I went through a heavy Neil Young phase.
That's an interesting choice.
Yeah, I was really into biographies and read that book about him, Shakey by Jimmy McDonough.
You read the book before you liked the music?
Correct. I got into his work with Crazy Horse and got really into it. I bought a ton of his CDs in a couple of year span.
What did you like about him?
His stuff is just really... real, for lack of a better word.
What was his best period?
The timeframe from 1969's "Everybody Knows This is Nowhere" to 1978's "Rust Never Sleeps" is, to me, unparallelled in music history. His early 1990s resurgence is good work, too, but if you want the best stuff it's the '60s and '70s you want.
Cool, I'll check it out!
His stuff was removed from Spotify for a while but it was back the last time I checked.
