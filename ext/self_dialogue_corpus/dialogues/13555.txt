Do you like Star Wars movies?
Eh, the newest ones are okay, but I don't really like the older ones.
Same here, the newer ones are much more entertaining. I don't care much for older movies.
My main problem with the older ones is that the special effects look silly and I can't follow the story easily.
I could follow the story, I just don't like how they look. The newer ones are much more attention grabbing.
Yeah, and aside from that the characters are way better now.
I agree, Rey was a good addition to the last movie. She was a good role model for young girls, I believe.
True, she exhibited a lot of strength and independence and I liked that about her.
I agree. The ending was crazy though, the Luke Skywalker thing had me so confused.
Same here, on the last scene my jaw hit the floor!
