Have you enjoyed any recent superhero films?deadpool?
I have seen and enjoyed many recent superhero movies including deadpool.
What are your thoughts on deadpool?
I think it is hilarious. It is a really different take on your superhero film.
Agreed, but how much is that just due to deadpool /wade character.
Well to a large degree because the deadpool comic and character is such a wit and kind of different as well.
so I guess I am wondering who really deserves the credit, the director, the actor, the writers, or say the original comic writers?
Tim Miller the films director deserves a lot of it I would say he is like the chief.
But don't you think maybe the success is more on the original concept/writing.
I think reynolds took what was there and brought it to life in a great playful performance that was no easy task and he deserves praise still.
