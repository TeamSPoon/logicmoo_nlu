Have you seen any of the new movies?
I saw Pirates of the Caribbean.
Did you like it?
It was kind of bad.
Did you think you'd like it?
I really liked the first one, but some of the others were not good.
Have you seen them all?
Yes, my boyfriend love this genre.
I hope he goes to you choice of movies too!
He does, and I do think that Jonny Depp is always fun.
Did you see him is the Alice movie.
I didn't see it in the theater but have caught it since.
I loved him in a movie I think was called Benny and June.
He was good in that one. Did you see the one with the really fat Mom?
"What's eating Gilbert Grape". I think.
Leanardo decaprio was a special needs kid in that one.
Both those actors were good in that one.
I didn't see it when it was out, only years later. They both look so young.
Did you see "Edward scissor hands" of "Sweeney Todd"?
Depp was good in both of those.
