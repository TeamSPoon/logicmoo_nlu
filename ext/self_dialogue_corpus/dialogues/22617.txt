So I watched a Robin Williams movie the other day.
Aw I miss him! Can't believe he is gone! What movie?
I know, don't remind me. I teared up the entire time.  I saw 'Good Will Hunting.'
Is that with the young Matt Damon?
Yes! It's one of the best movies of all time.
I agree, I think it was one of Robin's best.
You can't forget about 'Mrs. Doubtfire!'
Oh yea! That movie is hilarious!
It really shows the versatility of Robin!
I agree and the film was so family oriented.
I agree, I saw that with my entire family.
Haha me too! What about 'Jumanji'?
I loved 'Jumanji' as a kid! It was filled with so much adventure.
Confession: I pretended to be him when I was younger.
Haha, who didn't? Well you can't forget Robin's voiceovers.
That's right! He did amazing in 'Aladdin' as the Genie.
I think that they couldn't have picked a better voice actor for that part.
Robin Williams definitely put his best foot out there.
I will always remember him.
He left such a great legacy.
