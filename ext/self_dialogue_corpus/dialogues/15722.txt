Do you like Brittney or Christina better?
They are really apples and oranges.
How so?
Brittney is all pop music. Christina is more diva-esque.
Yeah, Brittney is more about dancing and being slightly shocking.
And Christina has that deep voice with a lot of range.
I like Christina's ballads.
Yeah, and Britney doesn't really do ballads.
Then why do people compare them?
Because they were both Disney kid stars who become singers.
I consider Brittney more like a Iggy Azela or Kesha.
Yeah, and Christina is more like a Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey.
What about Gwen Stefani?
She's more pop.
And Jessica Simpson?
Ha! Pop singer I guess.
More of a personality.
Yeah.  I did like the Newlyweds.
Is it fish or is it chicken? Chicken of the Sea?
That's funny.
