Have you seen Casino Royale?
Yes I have.  Craig was an awesome Bond.
Yeah, they brought a gritty realism to it.
Yeah, and that running scene at the start was great.
Yeah, he's a very athletic Bond.
I also like how he's not head to toe in gadgets.
Me too.  Makes it a little more thrilling and less comical.
It was a good genius movie too.  Every other Bond movie Bond was already Bond.
Yeah I know, like when he ordered the Martini.
Also really good final scene.  "Names Bond, James Bond"
