Have you heard of Eric Church?
No, who is that?
He's a country artist.  My friend dragged me to a concert last weekend, and suprisingly,  I love him.
I can say that I have heard anything of his, but I don't really enjoy country that much.
I can't say that I like it that much, either, but I do like him.
Why is he different?
I really enjoy his lyrics.  They tell more of a story than a lot of others do.
That's cool!  Any suggestions for something I should listen to?
I really like the song "Record Year."
I'll have to check it out.  I'm just not really all that into country.
I'd say the same about myself, I'm usually more into rock music. Coutry sounds very repetitive to me.
I just don't like that its so twangy.  I feel like sometimes it's way too exaggerated.
I can totally understand that.  Personally, I mostly listen to rock and pop.
I do too, but I have a weakness for 90's r&b and hip hop.
That's awesome.  I usually throw a couple of those on my work out play lists.
They are great for cool downs,  and anything that requires a steady rhythm.
Yes!  I always think of those old Jock Jams CDS when I work out.
Fast hip hop like that is great, especially when I'm on a long run.
Agreed.  I don't think I could workout if i didn't have he headphones.
I am the exact same way!
