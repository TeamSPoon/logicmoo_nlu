How was your road trip?
Awful. My friends played The Beatles' Greatest Hits on repeat for the entire five hour drive!
How can you hate The Beatles? That's like hating American history.
The Beatles are from Liverpool.
You know what I mean. They became American Icons with the British Invasion.
That's because they marked the beginning of Rock N' Roll. There weren't as many popular groups as there are now.
So you have to admit they are one of the greatest bands in history.
No I don't. They are one of the most overrated bands in history. They're songs are so simple, just like children's songs or like someone singing in the shower.
They're alot better than today's modern day pop bands like The Backstreet Boys!
Please, my friend, they were the original Backstreet Boys!
