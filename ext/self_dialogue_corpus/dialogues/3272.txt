Out of all The Shining remakes out there, none has out done the original.
They really can't. Everyone knows what's going to happen in that story.
True, but they could try to find an actor that matched or surpassed Jack Nicholson's performance.
I don't think there are that many actors that can. That guy is good at what he does.
I know, right. He really made The Shining the classic it is.
Can you imagine a different actor sticking his face through a hole in the door he had just made with an ax and looking as psycho?
Not today. I think that's my favorite scene in the movie.
That's everyone's favorite. I remember being scared out of my mine watching that for the first time.
That wasn't as scary as the naked, decomposing woman in room 237.
I used to avoid staying in hotel rooms with that number for a long time just because of that one scene.
