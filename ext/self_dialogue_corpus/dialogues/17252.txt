Do you like rap music?
I think there are some good artists out there.
Who do you think is the best?
Right now or all time?
Lets start out with right now.
Kendrick Lamar is the best hands down.
What is the album called he just put out?
DAMN.
Oh yeah, that was tight, the beats on DNA were insane.
Yeah I absolutely loved it all around.
OK so who do you think is the best all time?
Eminem takes the cake.
I think he only put out 3 solid albums.
Even 3 is more than some.
Jay Z would beg to dffer.
Oh yeah, thats true I forgot about him.
So are you going to change it
No, because Eminem was on top of the game with his lyrics
He could write an excellent diss track
He could but what he put on albums had you captivated for a while
