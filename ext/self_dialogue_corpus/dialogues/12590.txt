What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I'd have to say "A New Hope". It's the first that was produced by George Lucas.
Why do you like it so much?
It's not for the acting, except for Sir Alec Guinness;  but for the whole romance of it.
Romance?! You mean between Luke and Leia?
No, no, I mean - look at it! It's set on desert planet orbiting two suns, there's atmosphere there!
What, like air?
No, I mean the kind of feeling you get when you watch "Lawrence of Arabia". Desert romance.
I didn't get that. Can you give me an example?
Of course. The best moment is the sunset on Tatooine, as Luke watches the twin suns go down the shadows deepen in the desert, the music swells, and you feel like you're right there on Tatooine with him.
