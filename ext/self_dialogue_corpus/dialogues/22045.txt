So what movies do you plan to see this Summer.
Well, I know that I'm seeing the Transformers.
I've already seen Guardians 2.
I haven't seen it yet.
I'm looking forward to  Pirates.
Meh. That series is okay.
The Baywatch things looks interesting.
I can't tell if it is serious or a spoof!
My girlfriend is excited about Wonder Woman.
Girl power, right.  Though seriously it looks good.
The Tom Cruise Mummy movie isn't getting much hype.
Is that good or bad?
I like Brendan Fraser in that role.
Yeah, not sure if I'll see it or not.
Another Spiderman reboot.
Just kill me.... sick of reboots.
I hear that Jumanji is being remade.
Ah, I miss Robin Williams
Overall, seems like a decent Summer movie scene.
Decent, but nothing great.
