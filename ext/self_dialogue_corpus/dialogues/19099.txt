I want to listen to some chill music.
Have you ever heard of dubstep?
No, what is that?
It is a type of music that originated in the United Kingdom.
They always have good music.
Yes they do, do you want to know more?
Yes, tell me what this even is.
Dubstep is a type of slow music that you can dance to.
That is my type of music. Are you talking about the music people go to raves to see?
Yes I am. There are plenty of raves where dubstep DJ's play music.
So it is one of those types of music where people play records together.
Yes. They mix records together.
That sounds pretty cool. So it's just one big song?
Yes that is a good way to put it.
Where would I start if I wanted to get into this?
I would check out Caspa.
What is a good song by Caspa?
Check out My Pet Monster.
That is a cool name. I will check this out.
You definitely should. It is my favorite music.
