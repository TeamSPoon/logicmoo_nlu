Do you like any music that they play in churches?
Hmm, sometimes I do, but I don't really go to church a lot.
I like some of the music, but I mainly like the organ.
I like what the organ plays in what I've heard.
I like the sound of it probably more than the notes.
It definitely has a strong and powerful sound.
I have to say that I like a lot of the melodies in the church music I've heard.
What are they like?
They're pretty easy to remember and easy to sing, so everyone joins in.
That's pretty cool actually.
Yeah, and most of the people that regularly go have memorized the songs so they don't have to read along.
Does your church's music have a choir?
Yes they do, they're pretty good. Most of the music you hear though is from the audience and the organ.
I do like all the church music I've heard during the holidays.
Most people  know those, since Christmas is pretty much a religious holiday.
I guess that's true, that's why I know those songs anyways.
You should come to church with me sometime and I'm sure you'd at least enjoy the songs.
I'm not really interested, but thank you anyways.
I'll have to gather up some recordings of the better ones and show you people online singing them then.
Sure, as long as they're good I wouldn't mind listening.
