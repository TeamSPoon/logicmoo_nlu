Did you know they're coming out with another Ring movie?
What do you mean, another Ring movie?
It's another sequel to the Ring!  I think this will be the third one.
Oh yeah, that scary movie!  Yeah, I loved the first one.
Yeah but the second one was really lame.  I'm hoping the third will be better.
What's it called?  The Ring 3?
No, it's called Rings.
Well I wonder what this one will be about.  So often it seems like horror movies just decline in quality with each sequel they make.
Isn't that the truth!  I don't know, I hope it's as scary as the first one.
I think the first one was just downright creepy!  I got nightmares after watching it.
Yeah, I had to sleep with a light on for several weeks.
That's funny, me too!  I do love a good horror movie.
Yeah, even the old Jason and Freddy movies were great.
I know!  I was watching a Nightmare on Elm Street marathon just the other week.
Yeah, those are always fun to re-watch.  I love it when they play them around Halloween.
Me too!  I always try to binge watch them then.
Well it seems like they keep making those too, and they do kinda decline in quality over time.
Well yeah, but I guess they just run out of ideas maybe.
I don't know.  I think it's just like everything else in life.
They don't make them like they used to.
