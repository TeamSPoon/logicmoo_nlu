What album is better? U2's Pop or Lady Gaga's ARTPOP?
Aren't they both supposed to be satirical of pop music?
Yup, and they were both hated.
Lady Gaga for sure.
Why not U2?
Well, she didn't really change her character for it. U2 did an entire disaster of a tour.
U2 is better for me. Their music is much more sophisticated.
Lady Gaga was only crazy for two albums. She's "normal" now.
True, but U2 transcends all culture.
That's their problem. They're super snobby.
