Let's talk music, who is your favorite popstar/band?
Taylor swift is definitely my favorite as I like her energy and style.
I did Enjoy her 1989 album.
That is a great album, and my favorite song of hers is from that album (Shake it off).
It is a good album, but my favorite is wildest dreams.
Also a good song, in truth I like every song on that album.
Sometimes, I still think it is funny she started out as a country music artist.
I still enjoy her earlier work despite it being of another genre.
I agree it is still good music, i just believe she grew as an artist when she transitioned to pop.
She definitely branched out but most of her music still retains that sole that makes it unique to her.
