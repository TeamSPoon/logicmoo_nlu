What do you think of Brittany Spears.
I have so much to say about here.
Well do you like her music?
I never really liked it but I thought she did an alright job back when she was big.
So what don't you like then?
What I don't like is she kind of crumbled under the pressure and had a meltdown.
yeah she had a lot of bad publicity for years.
Finally seems like she finally found a place though.
Seems to have turned her life around.
I agree and applaud her for that.
