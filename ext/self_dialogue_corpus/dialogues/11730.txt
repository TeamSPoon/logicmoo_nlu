Who's your favorite Beatle?
I would say John.
Paul is my favorite.
The songs he wrote had great melodies, sure.
Yes. I like The long and Winding Road
Me too, but the non orchestral cut.
I agree. I fell in love with that version since I bought the anthology.
That's the best version.
George Martin was sometimes heavy handed on the orchestral bits.
There was less of that on John's song.
