Every Halloween I watch the Disney movie, Hocus Pocus.
I remember that film it came-out in 1993.
Bette Midler was very good at playing the head witch.
There were three witches, weren’t there?
Yes, the youngest witch was blonde, and lovely, but very crule.
I remember, and the middle witch was short, and had black hair.
I thought the children’s acting was very good as well.
Yes, Thora Birch was so young but she was very good playing the role of Dani Dennison.
I absolutely loved Thackery Binx, the boy changed into a talking black cat.
Yes, I was so glad at the end when he got to return to his family.
