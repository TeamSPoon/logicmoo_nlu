Oh! The one with the paint it black song?
Yeah, for some reason the name of the movie is escaping me.
Well the guy in that movie, his name is Kevin Bacon
Yeah that's him! Kevin Bacon.
Do you think I would like Mystic River?
Oh I think you would for sure!
I really liked Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption
Yes his acting is incredible.
What is the storyline for Mystic River?
It's about a girl who goes missing and one friend blames another.
Is it sad?
It is sad, but not in the typical way.
I don't mind sad but my wife doesn't handle sad well.
Well the teenage girl being killed may upset her.
Well thanks for telling me about it, I can't believe I have never seen it!
No problem at all, I definitely think you would enjoy it.
