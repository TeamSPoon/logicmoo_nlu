Who do you think is the worst NFL team in the league right now?
The Cleavland Browns easily.
Really? Not the Jets?
The Jets are bad but The Browns are absolute trash right now.
You think the Jets would beat the Browns if they played right now?
Yes. It wouldn't be a stomp but the Browns would lose.
What factors makes you think the Browns are the worst?
In my opinion they need a serious roster change.
Who would you get rid of first?
Their quarterback would be the first to go. He is a detriment to the team's performance.
Ouch, thats pretty harsh.
I'm only going off of what I've seen and his statistics. The guy is just bad.
I have seen his stats so I can't argue there.
I don't think anyone really can. However he's not the only one at fault.
So you'd change out the whole roster?
I think I would if I was the owner. I would want a fresh start.
I think I'd cut half the team and not the entire roster.
Why?
Well I see potential in a lot of the players, I just think they aren't enabled to succeed.
I sort of agree with you, but I'm the kind of guy that wants to start fresh.
