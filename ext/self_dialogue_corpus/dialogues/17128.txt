Who is your favorite classic rock band?
I think thats a hard question to ask
Why do you say that?
No one goes out with the intention of being classic rock.
So you think they just end up in the genre?
No I am saying they get shifted to that once they get older and stop making music.
OK so who in the classic rock rotation right now was the best of all times.
Can I say The Beatles?
You can! But it would lead to an argument from me.
You didnt think they were that good?
I think they had some great singles but most of their albums were filler.
I have never heard that hot take before.
I would also say Led Zepplin if we are being honest.
I can see where you would come with that.
What about Pink Floyd?
I never understood their love they get from fans.
I think they just know what they were doing
I feel like you needed to be on drugs to listen to them
I am sure when people listen to dark side of the moon they were on them
But they did write some incredible long tracks
