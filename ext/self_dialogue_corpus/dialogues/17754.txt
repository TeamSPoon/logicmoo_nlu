Do you like the band Krokus?
Who?
Krokus. A metal band from the 80's.
Do I even know who they are?
You should, they did have a lot of good songs.
Really. Like what?
Screaming In The Night.
That was them, I didn't know who sang it.
That was them.
Anything else I would know?
Probably not, unless you listened to their album.
Did you have the album?
Yes, well actually the cassette.
They didn't have any other popular songs?
They did some covers of other bands.
So I guess they split up.
Well every so many years they get together for reunion tours.
Did you ever see them?
No.
I'll have to watch the video.
