I finally seen The shinning.
Ah, what did you think of the creepy twins?
They were so scary!
The whole thing was, what scared you the most?
Maybe Nichloson's son in the movie, when he kept saying "Red Rum".
Murder, backwards. I freaked out at the axe scene.
He said "Here's Johnny!".
That was added in by the actor. Not in the script.
Wow, he really took that character on, head on didn't he?
Yes, I heard he stayed in character the whole time during filming.
