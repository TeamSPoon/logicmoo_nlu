Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?
If you asked me this question when I was 11 than Luke. If now Han Solo.
Really?Why the change?
Luke at 11 years old because I could relate to the innocence,now Han as an adult because of his defiance against the system.
Same with me. Luke is really the pefect hero for children,while Han is a hero for adults.
This is why Star Wars is so popular because many different age ranges can relate.
Luke is so pure and good at the beginning that most children can relate to him.
Yeah,sort of like a Peter Pan in away,while Han is more the scoundrel.
Han is like this rebel who is trying to do anything he can to get ahead.
That is why Han is relatable for most adults and usually becomes the adult's favorite character.
