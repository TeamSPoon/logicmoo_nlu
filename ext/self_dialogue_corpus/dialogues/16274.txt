Do you follow the Billboard charts.
Kind of, why?
Do you know who is on the top of the Billboard charts now?
The album charts or the single charts?
The album charts.
I don't know, let me look that up.
OK, thank you.
I think it's Witness by Katy Perry.
Was the album well-received?
It's had mixed reviews, I heard it's out of tone.
What do you mean?
She tries to push the boundaries but it sounds off.
I know what you mean.
I'm glad you do.
It's also reached the top of the charts in Canada too.
How closely do they follow each other?
The US and Canada music charts?
Yes.
I don't know, that's a good question. Witness reached the top of both charts.
That's nice, I hope it does well.
