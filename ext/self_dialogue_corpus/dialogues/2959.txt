I hate this down time we are in for sports right now!
I know what you mean,unless you are a baseball fan it really stinks at the moment.
At least we don't have to wait to much longer and the NFL will be here.
That is what I keep telling myself!
Who do you think we will be the best teams this year?
I feel that the Patriots and Cowboys will be the teams to beat this year.
The Cowboys? They have not sniffed the Superbowl in years.
That does not mean they can't get to it this year!
So is that your Superbowl prediction then?
Yes, It will be the Dallas Cowboys vs the New England Patriots.
I am going to record you saying that so you can not deny it later on in the season.
I am pretty confident in that pick actually.
The patriots I can understand; but not the Cowboys!
I do not see why, they are actually a very talented team.
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith are not walking through that door!
Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this season?
I think it will be the Pitsburgh Steelers taking on the Green Bay Packers.
I like that prediction; although I do not think the Steelers will be all that great this year.
They are a consistent franchise and I respect that.
I guess we will see which one of us has the better predictions when the season rolls around!
