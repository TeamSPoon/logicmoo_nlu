Who is your favorite female singer?
I kike Adele a lot, but I have to say Lady Gaga is my alltime favorite.
Oh really?  Which songs of hers do you like?
I like her duo piece with Tony Bennett, It Don't Mean a Thing.
Hadn't heard that one.
Yeah its nice.  Some others are Fashion and Bad Romance.
Those are good.
They did a cute video on Glee of Bad Romance.
I saw it, it was funny.  Loved the costumes.
Yep.  She has the chops and the angst to pull those songs off, like Sinead O'Connor.
