Do you like Britney Spears?
Not anymore.
I agree. Her live shows are pretty bad now.
She doesn't have much energy.
She used to be amazing!
Well of course her first album is iconic!
What song is your favorite?
I like Toxic. It always makes me want to dance.
I loved the music video for that one.
That song is really good.
