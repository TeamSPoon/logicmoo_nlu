So, do you listen to any Japanese metal?
I don't think I've heard of any metal bands not from America or Europe.
Well, you should definitely look up some Japanese bands. They're insane compared to some you've heard of.
I imagine they'd be very different. Japan are a very inventive country after all.
That's an understatement. Have you heard of Babymetal?
I've heard of them, yes. I haven't listened to their music, though.
They're basically the epitome of the uniqueness of Japanese metal.
What do they sound like?
They blend the instrumentals and imagery of different styles of metal with vocals and lyrics you'd hear in J-Pop.
Wow. That sounds interesting.
And would you like to know something else?
What? Does it get crazier?
Yes. They dance to the music.
Okay, now that just sounds plain silly.
I know it does, but it's so good.
I have to check them out just to see and hear this in action. Any suggestions?
Yes. Try out Karate.
They named a song after a martial art?
Yes, and it's awesome. The music video perfectly captures what Babymetal are all about.
I'm about to look them up right now.
