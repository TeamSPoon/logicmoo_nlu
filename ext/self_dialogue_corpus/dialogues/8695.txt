ERIC Clapton is the best rock,guitarist ever.
You know,I have to agree.
Loved the stuff cream did. Classic rock.
They were great. Ginger baker was the best drummer out their in my opinion.
I agree but Keith moon was no slouch.
No,he was just a mess.
That he was. To bad that happens to a lot of rockers.
It is a shame.
Clapton solo career has been outstanding!!
He's had a lot of solo hits.
