You know, I've never been into Star Wars.
You're kidding.
No. It's just... I've tried, but they feel so pandering. They pick and choose and appropriate so many things, then blend them together and pretend they're new.
Well. I mean. They're not high art, but they're not really trying to be. You got to admit that Empire is kind of ambitious, at least.
I guess, for what it is. I thought the turn to an out-and-out serial format was kind of cynical. Hey, we're onto a successful franchise! Let's just assume you're going to tune in next time!
But, it was successful. I mean, it's a pretty good gamble to take that people will want to see the next movie. Even if it was Jedi.
That's just it, though. It's cynical. It's a gamble. It's a product contrived to suit a perceived consumer market. I guess most film has been, but this is really gratuitous about it. Though... uh. Jedi was clearly the best one, anyway.
What.
Seriously, it's the only one I kind of enjoyed. Most of that is down to the Ewoks.
What is wrong with you?
