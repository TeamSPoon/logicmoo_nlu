Would you rate Dark Knight as the best action movie of all time?
No because it was an action movie but it wasnt at the same time.
In what respect?
You didnt NEED blowing up and fighting for that movie to be good.
So it was more of a thriller?
It did a good job of combinging the two.
That makes it all the more fun.
Ledger acted the heck out of his role.
Bale was a great complementary piece in that one.
Its a shame they couldnt do another one since we dont know if The Joker died.
