Did you ever see the Eagles in concert?
No, I always wanted to.
I think their music is timeless.
I agree, but with Glen Fry gone, it is probably over for them.
I just saw that Glen's son is going to be playing with them for a few concerts.
That is great! He should sound pretty much like Glen did.
I really hope so. If they get anywhere near me, I am going.
Me too. I won't miss the opportunity again.
Hotel California is probably my all time favorite song.
I agree, it is a good one, but I always think of Tequila Sunrise when I think of the Eagles.
They had so many hits.
It seems like every song they put out was a hit!
Don Henley has been pretty successful on his own.
Yeah, I saw him in concert near here. He sounded great.
His voice is so distinctive, I honestly think as long as he stays with the Eagles, they can still tour.
I agree, his voice really makes many of those hits.
Their harmonies simply aren't matched by today's artists.
I agree, although I do like many of the younger artists today.
I do too, but when asked my favorite all time group, I always say the Eagles.
I do too! They are something very special.
