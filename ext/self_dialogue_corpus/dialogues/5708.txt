Did you watch Disney movies when you were growing up?
Just a few. Not all of them.
Which ones have you seen?
I've seen 101 Dalmatians, Bambi, and the Lion King. Toy Story is my favorite.
Do you like the Disney/Pixar movies better than the Disney classics?
Probably. I think they are more modern.
So you don't like the Disney movies that retell old fairy tales?
No, not really.
That's crazy. I like them all. I can't think of one Disney movie I don't like.
Well, I can think of a lot!
