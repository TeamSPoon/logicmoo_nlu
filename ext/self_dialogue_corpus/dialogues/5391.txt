Cinderella is probably my favorite Disney movie, what do you think?
I love that movie, I like when the pumpkin was turned into a carriage.
I liked the part when the yugly stepsisters could not fit their big ugly feet into the little glass slipper.
what about when the birds helped make the dress?
I know that part was amazing, I wish birds would help me sew some clothes!
How did her father die, I saw that he drove off but I wondered how he died.
I think he had a heart attack and that is how she ended up with her evil stepmother.
I wish she could have stayed longer than midnight, I hated it when the spell broke
I know, she looked so pretty and then had to go back to her sad life
I hated how they treated her and loved that she lost that slipper, he found her !
