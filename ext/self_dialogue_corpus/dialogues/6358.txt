What is your favorite Disney movie?
Lilo and Stitch
Why is Lilo and Stitch your favorite movie?
I love the part when Lilo uses kitchen spoons to make voodoo images of her friends.
Oh yeah! Then she places them in a pickle jar.
...and shakes it up.
Yes! Because her friends needed to be punished for making fun of her.
Lilo makes me laugh.
I can see why Lilo and Stitch is your favorite movie.
Don't get me started on Stitch.  I can talk about him all day.
