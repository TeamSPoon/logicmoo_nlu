Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Well I can't say that I am not a fan but also know some people who are obsessed and I am not at that level but a fan for the most part.
Have you seen all of the films?
Yes I have I think I saw them in theaters when the where released. Have you seen them all?
I have as well, but have never seen them all in one sitting, it's sort of something I want to do.
That is like 24 hours of movie watching, That is a big commitment, Would you watch them in the way they where release or a different way?
I think I would want to watch them in the order George Lucas intended them.
Did you know the first star wars was the first film to use THX surround sound
No but isn't THX owned by Jerge Lucas.
It think it is but didn't they sell to Dolby or something like that.
