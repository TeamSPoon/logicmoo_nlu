Who do you think will win the Stanley Cup this year? Is your team still in the playoffs?
Absolutely!  My Penguins are going to take the whole thing!
As long as it is an Original Six team, I don't care who wins now that my Canadiens are out! I'm so mad that they choked again.
Well, I think Carey Price is overrated. He's not that great of a goalie.
But have you seen all of the trophies he's won? He's also a finalist for the Venza again this year.
Kind of ridiculous, because he gets hurt all of the time. He's not that consistent.
Yeah, but that's also because he has no defensive line to help him out.  He lost PK when they traded him to the Predators and now look what's happened!
The Predators are STILL alive! And against the Ducks who are really strong this year.
I can't stand the West Coast teams though.
Agree. My dad always said that they should never have an NHL team where they don't have ice outside.
The only Original 6 team left are the Pens.  And that makes me nervous!
Well, don't be. Crosby is hot and Fleury is amazing in the net.
At least there's still a Canadian team left in the final four.
That's funny. Most of the players here in the States ARE Canadian.
Yeah, it always bothered me when I saw players from Quebec playing for teams like Boston or Detroit. I feel like they are being traitors to the Candiens.
The Canadiens are washed up. They're not consistent enough to win like they did in the early days.
We STILL have the most cups, though.  24 is a long way from the second place Maple Leafs at 13.
Yeah but the game has changed since the old days.  The Canadiens haven't figured that out yet.
Well maybe with Claude Julien that will change. He always hired thugs for Boston.
Not this year, though. Too little, too late. Go Pens!
