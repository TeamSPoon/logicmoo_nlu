Can you name all the robots in the Star Wars series?
No. But C3PO was my favorite Star Wars robot character.
I thought C3PO was a droid not a robot.
You probably thought R2D2 was beer keg and a bottle opener on wheels didn't you?
No but C3PO sounded alot like Dr. Smith on the television series "Lost In Space."
Dr. Smith was a man not a robot like C3PO, R2D2 and what's other one named?
You mean BB8, the robot that looked like an orange and white soccer ball.
I wonder what George Lucas was thinking when he added these robots to his screenplay?
I'm sure Lucas thought the robots were made for good visual entertainment.
Are there any gay characters or gaybots in Star Wars?
