What's the last song you heard in your car?
Why do you want to know?
It's just a question, honestly, what was it?
I don't really want to say.
Well now I have to know, spill it.
Fine it was We Are Family by sister Sledge.
Wow that was not was I was expecting.
Well I like it ok, it's the reason I've seen Birdcage so many times.
You watched a movie just for a song? You know they came out with things that will play music right?
Yes, I am aware, but I never had the tape or CD to listen to so I had to watch the movie.
Well anyway, why wouldn't you want to say you like listening to that?
Because, I sing along to it, and it's a little embarrassing.
Like you're the first person to sing along to that song.
No, but it's not something I like people knowing.
Well how about this, I'll tell you what song I'm embarrassed to sing.
Like it's any worse than mine?
You tell me, it's Macho Man.
Fare enough, so are we talking lip sync or full on dance routine?
Oh I never lip sync, full volume with dancing. Like I said you are not alone.
I guess a catchy song is a catchy song, so Karaoke tonight then?
