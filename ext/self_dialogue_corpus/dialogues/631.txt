Are you an Eagles fan?
I am. They're my favorite team.
Mine too.
That's awesome. What did you think of their draft?
I thought it was okay. I thought some picks were weak.
I agree. I felt they kind of wasted their 14th overall pick.
Yeah, and that was the biggest deciding factor of their draft.
Derek Barnett is a good player but I don't feel it was the best choice.
I agree there. They could have picked a player that would make a bigger difference.
I think they were probably just looking at the fact that he has a knack for getting to opposing quarterbacks.
He does get a lot of sacks. That's a bit too situational to justify that pick, though.
I totally agree. I thought Sidney Jones was a good pick, though.
I agree. He's probably the number one cornerback right now as far as I'm concerned.
I almost couldn't believe they landed him as a second round pick.
I think the only reason they did was because of his achilles injury.
Yeah, I suppose that does make it a risky pick.
We've seen players come back from injuries like that before, though.
Yeah, if he returns at one-hundred percent then they lucked out with that pick.
True, but that's what makes it a risk. He may not return at full health.
True. Injuries like that have a tendency to get in your head.
