Did you see the cool movie Zootopia?
The one about fox and rabbit?
It's about an utopia for animals.
Yeah, sort of a reflection of humans.
What do you think? Did you like it?
Sure, it was very interesting. It reminds me of New York City.
Is that where you're from? New York?
Yeah, just like Zootopia.
I am from San Francisco. That's another Zootopia.
Sure. Do you remember the sloth? I think that's the best part.
