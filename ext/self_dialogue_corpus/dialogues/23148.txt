Let's discuss Sir Ridley Scott!
The legendary Ridley Scott is worthy of discussion for sure.
Haha you're so funny. Have you seen his latest movie, 'Alien: Covenant'?
Yes! It was incredibly good!
I really liked it a lot.  The actors were also a great choice.
Katherine Waterston is by far my favorite.
Scott just gives the best all the time! Do you have any favorites by him?
My all time favorite is 'Gladiator.' It has his signature cinematic style.
So true, I loved Russel Crowe too for the main role.
The story line was so memorable and touching.  Crowe was the perfect lead for that role.
What do you think of 'Black Hawk Down'?
That movie is by far the best in terms of how much action Scott really put.
It was so fast paced! You didn't know where to look first.
It won so much awards, including the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.
I bet! Pietro Scalia did such a fantastic job.
Ridley Scott couldn't have selected anyone better.
Last favorite by Ridley Scott??
'Robin Hood' needs to make the list!
I knew you were going to say that! That film is such a classic and Crowe knocked it out of the ball park.
Right, along with Cate Blanchett! Definitely my top favorite.
