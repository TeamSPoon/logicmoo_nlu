When was the country music band Little Big Town formed?
The group was formed in 2000.
What was their first record label?
Their first record label was Mercury Nashville Records.
I heard that they didn't have any success at all with this label.
Yes the band didn't do well with this label and they had no songs and no albums to speak of.
That was very hard to believe with the currest status of the band. Their albums have been awesome as well as their songs.
I love their albums and songs.
Which song do you like in particular?
I love listening to "Pontoon" a lot.
That is such a great song. Do you remeber by any chance when it came out?
It came out I believe in 2012.
I remember that year and it was great one for them.
They won an award for this particular song.
Do you know what the award was?
It was for Music Video of the Year: Group or Collaboration at the American Country Awards
Awesome. It was very good song and it was well deserved.
I was really impressed as well.
Do you know who their current record label is?
Yes. Their current record label is Capitol Nashville.
