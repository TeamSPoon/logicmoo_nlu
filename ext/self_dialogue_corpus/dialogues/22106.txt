I saw the greatest movie on HBO yesterday. It was called Empire Records, have you ever seen it?
No, is it a new movie?
No it came out in 1995 and had Liv Tyler in it.
I maybe saw that when I was in middle school. Was Renee Zellwegger in it also?
Yes! It was about a man who owned a record store, and needed to raise a ton of money quickly.
Who was the owner?
His name is Joe and he is played by Anthony Lapaglia.
Who else was in that movie?
Brenden Sexton Jr and Ethan Embry and Robin Tunney was in the movie too, she played Deb and had her head shaved.
That name is familiar, what else was she in?
Robin Tunney was also in The Craft! What a great movie that was.
I loved The Craft, it made me want to be a witch and cast spells.
No way that is so scary. Speaking of scary witch movies, do you remember The Blair Witch movie?
Yes! I went to the theater and saw that and I was so young.
I was too, it took months for people to convince me that was a movie and not a real documentary.
Can you imagine if The Blair Witch was a real documentary? That would be crazy.
They came out with a second Blair Witch movie in 2016, did you know that?
I did, but I never went and saw it.
It wasn't as good, but it continued on from the 1994 Blair Witch movie with the character in the new movie being related to Heather.
I am glad I didn't see it then.
