Have you seen any movies that portray the Jane Austen books?
Of course I have, they are all classical!
Which is your favorite?
I´m going to sound very cliche but it´s Pride and Prejudice.
Why is that?
Because it´s so romantic, Mr. Darcy the whole scenario, it´s just like a farytale.
Did you know there is a movie with Keri Russell called Austenland?
No I did not, what is it about?
This girl is obsessed with Jane Austen so she goes to a place called Austenland where they pretend to live in the era of the books.
What! No kidding, I would like to go there. What else happens?
Well she gets somewhat disappointed that reality is not as magical as the books.
Oh it figures, did anything else interesting happened in the movie.
Well she did get her happy ending. She met someone spectacular.
Oh I envy her so much. I love those kind of movies.
Is just that Jane Austen gives you so much, there is also an Indian movie version of Pride and Prejudice.
No kidding, what is it called? I want to see it.
It´s called Bride and Prejudice. It´s so cool, it´s the same story but with Indian theme. Would you like to see it?
Of course! I would not miss it for the world.
Well in that case I will add one more to the queue it´s called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
Oh yeah! I did heard about this one, crazy right! Same story but they are surrounded by zombies. Sounds good!.
