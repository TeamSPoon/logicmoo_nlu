We watched Brave the other night with the kids.
Oh, I love that movie!  What was your favorite part?
I loved when Merida shot all the targets that her "suitors" shot, and did better than them.
Yeah, that was so great.  I love seeing strong girl characters in movies.
Oh, and when she climbed to the top of the mountain, that was fantastic!
I know, right?  Do you think they'll make a sequel?
I don't know, it's been what, five years?  If they were going to, they'd probably have announced it by now.
Yeah, you're probably right.  It's too bad, the movie was a lot of fun.
Yeah, like the triplet brothers becoming bear cubs?
They were hilarious!
