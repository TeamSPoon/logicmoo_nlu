Do you like pop music?
I like it sometimes.
What songs have you been listening  to lately?
I'm enjoying "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran.
Oh, I don't usually like him, but I like that song.
Yes, it is different from some of his other songs, but I do like the others, too.
What other songs would you recommend?
I love "Thinking Out Loud".
I've heard that one. I don't like it.
I guess we will have to agree to disagree.
