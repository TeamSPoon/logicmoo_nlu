Have you seen the movie, Captain Phillips?
No I haven't, but I would like to.
I wanted to see a dramatic, kick me in my chest, action movie and this was suggested.
...and so, how was it.
It did it all. It was an edge of your seat movie.
Wow!, sounds good.
Oh it was. Tom Hanks was main character, how could you go wrong.
Yeah, you're right there.
I won't say anything to spoil it for you other than it is a must see.
OK, cool. Where did you see it.
We found it on cable as a rental.
Where was it?
It was in "On Demand"
OK, yeah I can go there and check.
Yeah, do that. It's not expensive at all and way worth it.
Great, I think I'll do that this weekend.
Cool, let me know what you think.
Yes, I will.
OK, have a great weekend.
Oh, I will if that movie is a good as you say it is.
