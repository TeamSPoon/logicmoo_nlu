You like the Seahawks?
Can't stand them.
Why?
They beat up on my Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII
Oh yeah, that's right. That was brutal.
Yeah, Broncos were thoroughly outplayed, but I couldn't stand watching them.
They have some good players though.
Yeah, Russell Wilson is a great QB.
Yeah, but they blew it in the Super Bowl the following year.
Oh yeah, that was really bad. Should've run the ball.
That's what everyone said.
I wonder if Pete Carroll is still having nightmares about that play?
Yeah, probably. Helped the Patriots win yet another Super Bowl.
I also can't stand Richard Sherman
Yeah, he has a pretty big mouth.
Did you know that he went to Stanford?
Really, I had no idea.
Yeah, it came out when he was in the Super Bowl.
Where's he from originally?
I think Compton, California.
