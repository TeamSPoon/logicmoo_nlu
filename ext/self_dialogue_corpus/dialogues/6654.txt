So I finally saw Milan today.
For the first time in forever!
Wrong movie, dude.
I know, I was joking around.
Anyway, it was okay.  I think it's the last time I remember Eddie Murphy in anything.
Yeah, he hasn't exactly done much lately, has he?
I thought the movie was pretty good, a bit violent in parts.
Oh, I disagree.  It wasn't violent at all.
We just have different tastes, I guess.
Or you're just over-reacting to a cartoon.
