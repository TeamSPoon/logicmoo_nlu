I just heard Yuja Wang in concert.
I wanted to go to that! How was she?
She's incredible. She sounds like someone 20 years older.
Yeah, she can play anything, and learn anything super fast.
Why didn't you go?
Her concerts are expensive like crazy. And for piano recitals, the seats to the left of the stage sell out instantly
Why the left and not the center, with the best acoustics?
For piano recitals, you sit on the left to watch the performer's hands go crazy.
That makes sense.
So, uncomfortable question.
Go ahead.
What was Yuja wearing?
You're asking what a classically-trained pianist was wearing to a concert? That's kind of rude.
I'm only asking because she actually gets heavily criticized for it.
Why?
Well, she's gorgeous and shows it. She typically wears low-cut dresses with high slits in the thigh.
Yeah, I see what you mean. She wore a black skirt. I think I heard people wondering how she was able to sit and play the pedals the way she did.
I feel bad for her that people actually bring that up, but they do.
Either way, I had a blast.
I subscribe to her YouTube channel. I actually know someone who met her!
