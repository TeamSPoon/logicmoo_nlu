Seen any Disney movies lately?
I saw the incredibles.
Oh will Holly Hunter?
Yeah.
That is one of my favorite disney movies!
Mine too. I love the superhero aspect.
I also love the short film before the actual movie.
Oh the one with the rabbit?
Me too, I always laugh so hard.
I have to see that again.
