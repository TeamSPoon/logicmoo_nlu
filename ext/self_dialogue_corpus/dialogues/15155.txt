The melody is very catchy.
So, what is the name of the song?
A Sky Full Of Stars.
That song is not new... It's from at least 2 or 3 years ago.
Really? I just heard it recently.
Yes. It is very good but now it's kind of old.
It is amazing how music goes out of date so quickly now a days.
Yes. But I mean, that song is still great.
