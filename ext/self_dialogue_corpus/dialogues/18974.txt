What is your favorite kind of music?
I mostly like pop, but lately I have been enjoying techno.
I really like country music
Really, I didn't think too many people listen to that anymore.
Sure, country is a bit different now than it used to be.
I used to listen to it when I was a kid because my dad did, I do like some country songs.
Which artists do you remember listening to?
I liked Shania Twain and Diamond Rio, Kenney Chesney and Alan Jackson.
I like some pop songs too, but still prefer country. I like all the artists you mentioned too.
It is a wonder that artists can still make a living, considering that no too many people buy cd's anymore.
Yes, but they probably make most of their money in concert tickets and going on tour.
Yeah you are probably right.
Have you ever been to a music concert?
No, I think they would be much too loud for me, I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.
I have been to a few and enjoyed them, as long as you are not too close and sometimes you can even meet the band.
I always think that people sound so much better when they are not live too.
Yes you are right about that, artists rarely ever sound the same in person as they do on the radio or on an album.
It is like you don't even really have to have a good voice to be a singer these days with all the editing.
Yes most artist are probably famous because they are good looking.
Quite a few of them start out as actors too.
