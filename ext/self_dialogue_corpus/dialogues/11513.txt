Do you believe it's been fifty years since Sgt Pepper
It was twenty years ago plus thirty I guess.
Unbelievable. I guess it's my favorite Beatle's album.
I like Revolver. Or Rubber Soul. Depends which week it is.
They're my number two and three. Where's Pepper on your list?
Probably three or four. I have a soft spot for Help.
Good album. I watched the movie the other week. Great music videos.
So what's your favorite song on Pepper.
Iguess Day in a Life. Maybe Fixing a Hole? You?
For the Benefit of Mr Kite there will be a show tonight...
