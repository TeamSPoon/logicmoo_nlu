What did you think about the new Star Wars movie?
You mean Rogue One?
Yeah, I loved that it had less of a focus on Jedi and more on normal people.
I thought it was pretty good. Seemed to kind of have an Ocean's Eleven feel.
Yep. I thought the same thing. I wish that they would show more of the real world in Star Wars instead of just the big events.
I had heard that at one point there was a plan to do a tv. show for Star Wars that was kind of like Band of Brothers but takes place during the Clone Wars.
That would be awesome. Rogue one introduced tons of character that could be used for something like that.
I hope the upcoming Han Solo movie has more of a Rogue One vibe than a prequel vibe.
It has to, man. Han is after all the original Rogue!
I have heard some bad rumors about it, but I am willing to reserve judgment.
