Have you dug into the Expanded Universe at all?
Yes, although Disney ret-conned most of it.
I know, now it's just Legends!
It's a shame they lost so many great storylines.
Right? How about Timothy Zahns trilogy?
Actually their bringing a piece of that into canon now!
Oh yeah? Like what?
Well, Grand Admiral Thrawn is a character in Rebels now
That's great! He's such an awesome character!
Hopefully they can eventually canonize some other things as well!
