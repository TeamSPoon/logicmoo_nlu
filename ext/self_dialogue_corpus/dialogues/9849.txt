Can you believe Snoop Dogg is still touring?
I know, it's crazy. He's getting old.
It's even crazier that he still has so much support.
Yeah, but he's a legend. Those types of people will always have fan support.
That's true. He's been doing it for a very long time.
Didn't he try to change his name to Snoop Lion?
I think he actually did, but everyone still calls him Snoop Dogg.
It's hard to get a change like that to stick.
For sure. "Gin and Juice" is stuck in my head now.
That song is a classic.
