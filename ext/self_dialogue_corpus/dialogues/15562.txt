Is there anything you miss about the pre-Internet, pre-MP3 era of music.
Oh sure, there's tons! I think we devalue music now.
Are you making an economic argument. That when there is an unlimited supply you might value each product less.
Sort of, but it's more nuanced than that.
Well what is it?
I think that back in the day, when the costs to getting an album were higher, it was a different experience.
Yeah, sure, but how is that relevant.
Well, you were making a commitment when you bought an album. You'd go to a store, look around for a while, buy one cd, say Radiohead OK Computer for 19 dollars, drive, bike, or walk back home and sit with that record.
Ah, I see what you're saying. We don't have to sit with stuff anymore.
Exactly my point. It's all kind of disposable if you don't like it right away.
I miss growing with an album and an album growing with me.
That experience certainly is still possible, I recently did it with Pinegrove's latest album, but it's a conscious decision to do so rather than being built in.
I also miss the social experience of the music store. Bumping into people, striking up conversations, talking to the staff, et cetera.
You can do all of that online now though!
Yeah, but it's not the same as human connection. We have Facebook, but it hasn't supplanted our need to see each other in person.
Point taken. Did you ever get any great recommendations in store?
Yes, a clerk once referred me to check out The Modern Lovers. That was an epic day in the development of my music taste.
I had a similar experience with someone recommending David Bowie at the record store after seeing that I picked out Modest Mouse. His passion was contagious.
Yeah, that's lost these days. You only really see it at shows.
I know, I'm feeling nostalgic for CDs right now, but I also don't wanna give up my access to the majority of everything ever recorded being at my fingertips.
