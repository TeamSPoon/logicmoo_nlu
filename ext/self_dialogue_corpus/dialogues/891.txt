Did you see that story about The Raiders?
No?
They are changing cities.
Again?
Yeah, they are going to Vegas.
Wow!  Vegas?  Thats crazy.
I read that they are hoping to capitalize on all of the tourism in Vegas.
That makes sense but how many times have the Raiders moved?
At least three times.
Dang.  I wonder why they move so much.
Who knows?
They seem to have a decent fan base .
Yeah - they had a decent season with a 12-4 record.
Not bad.
But they haven't won a super bowl since 1983.
Thats a long time.
Yeah.  Probably won't change by changing cities.
You are probably right.
I wonder if tickets will be cheap in Vegas.
Maybe.
