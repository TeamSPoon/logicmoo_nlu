Hey man, what's up with Kaeparnick?
I don't know man, you think he's gonna get picked up by anyone
I don't think so, I just don't think he's a great player.
Yeah he had a few great years when Harbough was the coach, but has been really bad since then.
I think he just lost his weapons and coach, anybody would be bad after that.
who did he lose?
Well he had Crabtree, he had that Florida State Receiver, Boldin.  Plus Vernon Davis was always hurt.
Yeah that's true, I think we're finding out that Crabtree is pretty good.
Yep.  Where did Vernon Davis end up? I think he left the Niners.
He went to the Redskins.
Ooh they've got a pretty good stable of Tight ends now.
What do you mean.
Well that other really good tight end is still there right? Jordan Reed?
Yeah, but he is always getting hurt. That guy can't stay on the field.
True, but at least they still have Desean Jackson, Kirk has some guys to throw to.
Don't think so man, Jackson took off to go to the Bucs.
Great, we paid Kirk all that money for one year, now they're gonna be terrible, and he's just gonna up and leave next year.
That's certainly a possibility, where do you think he'll go?
I don't know, someone that needs a qb.
Yeah, maybe the Broncos, Texans, maybe the Browns. Somewhere with a decent team that just needs a quarterback.
