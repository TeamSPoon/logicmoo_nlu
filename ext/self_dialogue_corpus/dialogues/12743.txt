Darth maul or darth vader?
Dude, what kind of question is that.
No getting around this, answer the question.
Darth vader any day.
Oh come now, you think vader can beat a double edge lightsaber?
I think he can just force choke anyone who gets in his way.
Whatever, vaders old and weak, maul would cut him down to size.
Old maybe, but weak? Clearly you are short sighted in the ways of the force.
Don't get me riled up over this, you know I'm right.
Get angry, let the anger flow through you!
