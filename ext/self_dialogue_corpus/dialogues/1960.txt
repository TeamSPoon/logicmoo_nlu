Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this season?
I don't know. That's a good question. I can definitely say that it won't be the Patriots again!
Why not? They still have Tom Brady as quarterback.
I think there are a lot of other good up and coming teams this season.
I guess you are right. I think the Cowboys look promising.
I agree! I think Dak Prescott is going to have a great season this year.
I'm more excited about watching Ezekiel Elliot. I think he might break the all time rushing record one day.
I agree, he is a great player. But one thing about the Cowboys is that their defense isn't very good.
You're right about that too. What team do you think will have a good defense this season?
The Steelers, of course, but they always have a good defense.
They drafted TJ Watt. Do you think he will be anything like his brother?
I heard he was even better, but only time will tell I suppose. I'm not sure about the Steelers offense though.
Don't you think Roethlisberger can win again this season?
He has won some pretty impossible games, but overall he is inconsistent.
Do you think the Steelers can win their division again?
I think they can as long as they can beat the Ravens, and as long as they can still get two free wins with the Browns.
I think this is the year for the Browns. They made a great draft choice with Myles Garrett.
I'm actually surprised they went with a defensive end and not another quarterback.
Well, that's probably because they already have a locker room of quarterbacks.
That is really funny, but I think you're right. But I agree, I think they will definitely win more than one game this season.
