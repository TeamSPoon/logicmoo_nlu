What does the NFL miss from its storied past?
Players who truly care about playing hard, performing well and winning.
Players like...?
Earl Campbell is a great example. He gave absolutely everything he had all the time. And to this day he's glad he did.
Players like him built the NFL we know today.
There was a lot of entertainment value in watching players like Campbell, or Walter Payton, or Mike Singletary, or Ron Jaworski.
Could today's declining interest in NFL football be attributed to such a comparison?
Many people see much less entertainment value in watching players pull up short on tackles and jogging to the ball during plays.
Will Amazon be a good broadcast partner for the NFL?
Hard to say. The NFL's internet-based broadcast experiments of the last few years have been ephemeral and have produced underwhelming results.
Which teams are lost causes at this point?
The 49ers are one. Their ownership has taken a resuscitated perennial title contender and reduced it to a semi-professional outfit. The new hires have their work cut out for them, but Lynch and Shanahan give them hope.
What about the Bears?
Chicago has the same problem as San Francisco. No one seems to know what he is doing and the team lurches into the new season like a twitching, plodding zombie.
Do the Dolphins belong in this group?
No, Miami is a mid-level team with some promise, but ownership and management do hurt the Dolphins regularly.
What about Cleveland?
The Browns are still the same. New ownership is needed I'm afraid. Bad uniforms don't help.
The Lions might be good, or bad...
Detroit could go a few different directions, but they are still easy to predict: they are a mediocre team that produces mediocre results.
