Do you remember the first Ninja Turtles movie?
Oh, that was so popular when I was a kid.
Me too!  I loved it.
I had everything Ninja Turtles.
Did you know the movie was based on a comic book?
No, was it?
Yeah, and the comic book was a lot darker.
Wow, that's crazy.
Yeah, it definately didn't start out for kids.
I might look into that.
