How do you like the last Disney Movie?
I really liked it.
Did you find something that you didn't like at all.
To be honest, it was pretty good.  I really enjoyed the picture of it.
Well, I thought it was kind of boring at the beginning but it turned out out to be good.  Especially the music.
That's true, the songs were very pretty and the characters's voice were amazing.  I really like that guy as the male actor.
I do want to see it again, I may watch it tonight.
Oh yes, it is already in Netflix.
Why don't you come to my place tonight, I'll order some pizza.
That's a great idea, we can watch it together.
