Have you seen that trailer for the upcoming Disney movie Coco?
I think so. Is that the Mexican one?
Yes! I think that's a new category for Disney.
I'm glad to see Disney making more diverse films.
Yeah, even if I don't understand everything about the Mexican culture, I find it interesting to watch.
So do I. It's always interesting to get a different perspective on things.
Do you know who the actors will be?
You mean the voice actors?
Of course, I know it's an animated film!
I don't remember most of the names, but I know Benjamin Bratt is one of them.
