Why do you think that Alternative rock music rose to prominence in the 1990s?
You mean the "Seattle Sound"?
Yes, music artists like Pearl Jam and Nirvana.
It is kind of strange, isn't it? It was really just a local rock music scene. Then, it exploded!
I have a theory about it.
What's that theory?
People got burned out on the the Glam Metal bands of the 1980s. They were tired of the spandex and makeup.
I can see that. The Grunge style of the rock music genre is relatively simple.
Yes, I think that simplicity made it come across as more "real".
Yes, authenticity is the key to success in the rock music genre.
