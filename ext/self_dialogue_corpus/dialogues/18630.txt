Remember that song "Hung Up" by Madonna?
Yeah, it's so catchy!
Didn't she sample an ABBA song?
Yes, I think it's called "A Man After Midnight".
Have you listened to any of Stacey Q's old stuff?
No. That's pretty random though.
Not really! I feel like they're pretty similar artists.
Stacey Q and Madonna?
Yeah, Stacey Q's band SSQ had a debut album called Playback.
And you're saying it reminds you of Madonna?
Yes, you should listen to it since I know you like synth-pop.
I will. Although, I'm not even that big of a Madonna fan.
Aren't you the one who showed me "Hung Up?"
Yes, but that's about the only song I know from her!
What kind of music do you listen to, then?
I am more of a metal fan.
Who's your favorite band?
Megadeth. My first show was one of their concerts.
I'm surprised. That's not what I expected you to listen to.
It's definitely a big step from Madonna.
