Want to go see wonder woman with me tonight?
Sure, have you seen the trailer?
I havent, can you bring it up on youtube?
Sure, here you go
That looks so good, I cant wait
it looks full of action, I love the actress they chose for her
I used to love the tv series when I was a kid
Graphics sure have come a long way
Remember how amazed everyone was with Jurassic park, when the skin was realistic and the muscles moved
I still think its amazing, but compare it with todays movies and its incredible the difference
I know, I watched kong and could not believe the graphics
Kong was a great movie, I went with my Husband
That reminds me of planet of the apes, the graphics on that one is amazing
The way the apes look so real
and they talk and its creepy
imagine if that was real
I would die of a heart attack
thank goodness its just a movie
I agree with that, ready to go
yes I am
