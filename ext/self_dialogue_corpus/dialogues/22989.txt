Do you remember American Beauty?
The film with Kevin Spacey?
Yes
Kind of. I haven't seen it in years.
I watched it the other day. It still holds up.
Really? I'll have to check it out.
Yeah, really good acting at story.
Did it win any awards?
Yes, it won best picture, best actor, best director and others
What year was that?
I think 2000 if I'm not mistaken
Who else was nominated back then?
That was the time of The Green Mile and The Sixth Sense.
Oh The Sixth Sense. What a crazy twist that was.
Yeah, remember everyone tried to keep quiet with that one?
Yeah, but hardly any of my friends did.
I figured out the twist very early on in the movie.
Sure you did.
Whatever happened to Bruce Willis?
He's still around, but not doing too much work these days.
