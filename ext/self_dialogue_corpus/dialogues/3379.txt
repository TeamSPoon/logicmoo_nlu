Have you ever seen The Ring?
Yes I have and it was terrifying!
I couldn't even look at a vhs tape after watching that movie.
Same here! I was afraid that watching the video within the movie might put me in danger too.
That movie freaked a lot of people out. The sequel wasn't all that great.
That's true, even with Naomi Watts in it again it still fell short.
Have you seen the new version?
I have and I wish I could get the time back that I spent on it.
Me too, it was pretty bad. I love when the girl Samara steps out of the tv screen though.
That never gets old to me. I always wonder though, why don't they just pull the plug?
