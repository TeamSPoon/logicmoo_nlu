Hey what do you think about the Patriots?
Well, you can either love them or hate them.
And which group do you belong in?
Well, they have been doing really well. That come back was insane.
Yes! It was! I thought that game was the Falcon's.
It was unprecedented.
No matter what people say. Tom Brady is the best.
Well, I will have to argue you about that.
Oh, are you one of those people who hate him because of the deflation thing?
No. I just don't think Tom Brady is the best.
So who then?
Have you seen the arms of Aaron Rodger?
Yep, all of that Hail Mary play.
What about Drew Brees and his leadership.
One of the best.
Can't count Peyton Manning out? Come back after a year and win the Super Bowl to end his career.
You are right, he was great while he last.
See. Tom Brady is not the best player.
Well have any of those players ever win 5 super bowls and come back from a 28-3 deficit?
You got me there.
