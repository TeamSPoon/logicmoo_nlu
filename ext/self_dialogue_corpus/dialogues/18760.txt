Do you like Phish?
Do you mean that Grateful Dead band?
Sort of. I mean, they're a cult band like that, and their music is kind of similar.
I've never heard them. What do they play?
All kinds of stuff really, psychedelic rock, bluegrass, funk, it's hard to say. What they're really famous for is their improv.
What's your favorite song?
Run Like an Antelope.
Haha. I like that name.
They have a lot of song titles with animals in them.
Really? Like what?
Possum, Vultures, The Horse, Llama, The Sloth, Wombat... I could go on if you want.
That's okay, I get the idea. Are all their songs about animals?
No. They have hundreds of songs. Tweezer, AC/DC bag, and Fluffhead are not about animals, and they are really popular.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
Yeah, I go every time they come here. They have the best concerts.
Why do you say that?
Phish is a Jam band. Performing live is their specialty.
Oh. I think I get it.
So what do you listen to?
A little of everything. I guess you'd say my taste is eclectic.
