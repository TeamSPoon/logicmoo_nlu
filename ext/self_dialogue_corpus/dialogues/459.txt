So who's going to the Super Bowl this year?
Patriots for sure, nobody can stop them in the AFC.  Maybe the Cowbows in NFC?
Cowboys?  Seriously?  Come on, Seahawks in the NFC!
Yeah right.  Their defense is getting old, and Russell Wilson is one sack away from their offense being a bust.
No way.  Yes, the defense is getting older, but come on, they're still one of the top defenses.
Ok, but I still think it's the Cowboys.
Dak Prescott over Russell Wilson? You must be kidding.
Nope, Dak Prescott is the man!
Russell Wilson, any day.  Dude might be shorter, but he has more heart and can do crazy things with the football.
Now if only he could play defense too...
Stop with the defense thing!
But it's true, they are getting old.
Richard Sherman is still a shutdown corner.
But wasn't he almost traded?
But he wasn't, he's still there.
True.  But I bet he doesn't play as well this year, knowing he's probably done with the Seahawks.
And don't forget the rest of the Legion of Boom...Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas?
Aren't they both brittle with injuries?
Whatever dude, we'll see who's laughing at the end of the season.
Yes, we will.
