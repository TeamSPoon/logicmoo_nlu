I want to see the movie, Wonder Woman.
Yeah, I forgot that movie was coming out soon.
I hope they don't make it all over the top and so far away from what I remember it being.
Its the movie theater so it may be a bit over the top.
Yes, maybe you are right.
But the sounds and the effects will be good.
Yes, certain lky they will not let Wonder Woman be bad.
When you go let me know
I will. I don't know anyone in the movie.
I believe it is not the usual A list of actors, but I am not certain either.
Or, should I just wait until I can see it online?
No, definitely go to the movies. That's where the experience is had.
This is true, but they charge so much for movies.
Treat yourself and go - there is nothing like the movie experience.
I guess when you say it that way, its true
At the movies you can leave the mess to someone else to clean up and fix the sound for you
I agree.
At the movies there are different flavors of butter gfor your popcorn too
OK, I am going to the movies!
Great! Let me know when
