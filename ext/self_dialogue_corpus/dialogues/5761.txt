Did you ever watch 'Lilo & Stitch?'
Yes I did.  I really liked that movie.
It was, in my opinion, one of Disney's more underrated movies.
It was definitely under-appreciated.  Though I'm glad they managed to make a TV series out of it.
I loved the setting in Hawaii.  I also loved that Lilo was raised by her sister, who played the role of a single parent.
That really brought a new sort of complexity into the Disney world that we did not see in prior movies.
Exactly.  Disney is always so good at inclusion.
I also loved the friendship and family themes.
What was the word for 'family' that Lilo kept saying to Stitch?
Lilo would tell Stitch that "Ohana" meant family, and that family meant no one was left behind or forgotten.
