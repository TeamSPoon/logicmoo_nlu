Boy I really disappointed in the Toronto Bluejays!
You know, I think I'm going to just give up on that team
I agree. Every year I think that this is the season where they put it all together and I'm always wrong!
It's like watching Charlie Brown trying to kick the football when Lucy is holding it!
Exactly! I can't keep falling for this team time and time again.
It's like they have so many problems. Sometimes they hit well, but their pitching is atrocious. They pitch well, but can't hit!
This team is so lost! I think they need to blow this squad up and start over
The culture in this organization is so bad right now. It's time for a change.
It may be necessary to get rid of the GM and the manager. Just to shake things up!
Yeah it's time. This organization needs a makeover.
Starting with Jose Batista. Ever since he had that big Home run year, he's been declining.
If he's not hitting a home run, he is worthless!
This guy has no plate discipline whatsoever.
I swear he goes up to the plate and all he seems to care about is trying to hit a home run.
Then surprise! He strikes out again!
Yeah, it would be a miracle if he got that batting average over 200
He's definitely not Tony Gwynn at the plate!
I would even take him being a serviceable hitter. He's not even a major league quality hitter right now
Yeah, but it's not all on him either. His teammates have not been stepping up as well.
Your're right! It feels like this hole team has been infected with a loser's mentality.
