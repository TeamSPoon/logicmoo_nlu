Hey do you like baseball?
Sure it's ok.
Do you follow any teams?
Not really during the season, it's too long.
Yeah true, ever been to a game?
Once or twice.
What team did you go see?
The Texas Rangers.
Cool, I hear their ballpark is nice.
It's pretty nice but not near the tradition of someone like the Red Sox or Cubs.
Yea, they're a pretty young franchise all things considered.
Agreed, did you see the world series they played against the Cardinals?
Yeah that was a good one, went all 7 games.
Yes I couldn't believe the Rangers lost game 6.
I know right?! They were within 1 strike of winning the whole series and the Cardinals came back and won.
I was stunned, and my dad was pretty upset.
Is he a Rangers fan?
Yeah he's been a fan for a while.
I've only been watching for 5 years.
I followed it off and on but my dad's been watching it since way back in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcerâ€™s table.
