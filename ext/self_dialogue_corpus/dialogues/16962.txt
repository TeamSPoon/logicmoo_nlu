Do you like classical music?
Yes
Do you like Mozzart?
Of course
I like the very old music. It relaxes me
I agree. It is very pleasant
There are some pretty cool arrangements
I like Beethoven myself
He is one of the greats
There are many amazing composers
I think that a lot of the great music of the 70's had a classical feel to it
I see what you mean. Carry That Weight by The Beatles is a good example
Yeah, it was epic. It sounded like a classical song at some parts
What is your favorite instrument?
The guitar
Cool
I actually like the acoustic guitar
I have one if you want to play it
I do
Let me go get it and you can play me some classical song on it
