Yo you stoked for the next NFL season!
Yeah dude! Who you think will do good?
I'm feeling the Bucs
Why them?
Man Jamis Winston is freakin up and coming.
True and that O-line though
That and they are surrounding him with talent.
How's the defense?
They are ok I guess but nothing special
Huh that's true
Who you think will break out?
I think Cam and the Panthers are coming back
Why you say that?
Cam was injured a nice chunk of last year
That's true
And they have some good talent around him.
What you think of the Browns?
Man you kidding right?
Yeah everyone knows they'll be terrible
Got that right!
