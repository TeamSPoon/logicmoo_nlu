The question is, classic rock or contemporary rock?
Oh, classic rock, all the way.
Like the Eagles?
Yes - the Rolling Stones, U2 . . .
Though some may not call them rock music.
Well, even if some folks don't call them rock, they have influenced a lot of rock music.
That's true. Speaking of who influenced rock and roll . . .
Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and Roll!
I wish I could have been to one of his concerts, back in the day.
He had such an awesome voice!
