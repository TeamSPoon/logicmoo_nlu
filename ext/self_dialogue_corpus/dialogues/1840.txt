Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
Are we talking current players or of all time?
All time is fine.
I'd go for John Elway personally.
Thats a good choice but I think Peyton Manning is better.
No disrespect to Manning but I don't think he holds a candel to Elway.
Why do you say that?
He set records and was a trail blazer for future generations.
Yeah I get that buy Manning has long since beat Elway's records.
Yes but Elway was a fan favorite. Manning is as well but people will tell you Elway had much more charisma.
For me it's down to statistics. I don't rally care too much about character.
I feel the opposite. I think character means almost everything in terms of being the greatest.
We would have two completely different lists then.
I don't think so. It might be more similar than you think.
Alright lets see then. Name two more quarterbacks that you feel are on Elway's level.
Dan Marino  and Brett Farve.
I'd agree with both of those actually.
See I told you.
Yeah you win this arguement.
I always do.
