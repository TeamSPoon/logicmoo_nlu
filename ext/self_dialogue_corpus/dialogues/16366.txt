Hey, have you heard anything from Toad the Wet Sprocket lately?
No, but I was just listening to their newest album.
New Constellation?  That's a really good one.
I was afraid it would be terrible, since they hadn't recorded anything in years.
I know. But it was great.
I really enjoyed it too..  I would have worn it out if it was on cd or vinyl.
Do you really listen to albums on vinyl?
Not too much.  Only when I am at a friend's house who listens to vinyl.
Do you think they will put out another album soon?
I sure hope so!  I love their music.
Me too.  My favorite song is "All I Want".
I  played that one over and over!  Such a great song, with great vocals.
They are a really cool band.  Their lead singer, Glen, has done some solo concerts too!
I would love to see that.  It would be so cool.
I would like to see him or the band, but in lieu of that, maybe another album?
That would be great.  I will have to see if they are working on anything.
Don't forget to look up Glen Phillips, too.
Oh, that's right.  Who knows if he's putting anything out?
Not me.  For now, I am going to go listen to their other album that I have.
The album called Fear?  Enjoy!
