I went to the movies last weekend and saw Gardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
I really loved the first one, so what did you think about Vol. 2?
I thought it was better than the first one.
Really? How so?
It seemed to flesh out the stories of some of the other chracters and made you understand what was going on in the first one a bit better.
Oh I got it so it actually made volume one more enjoyable as well?
Yes, that is exactly it.
How so?
I went back and watched the first guardians movie after seeing volume two.
Could you tell more about the story sequence?
Actually understood more about Starlord's father.
He plays a pretty big part of his life right?
Yes, in vol two it goes into more detail about his father's relationship with his mother.
This sounds great.
It really was and I also thought that this one had more humor.
I had heard it was funny.
I hadn't heard much about it before going to the movies.
I will have to go and check this out.
I left wanting to go back and watch it again.
Well, I know I will need to go see it then.
