What's the best action movie ever made?
Die hard without a doubt.
Why die hard? I mean I enjoy it, but best of all time?
John McClane is such a great action character and Bruce Willis is great in the role.
I'll give you that, but better than some of Jackie Chan's early stuff? Better than The Terminator?
It's absolutely better than both, don't get me wrong I love Arnold's classic Terminator role as much as the next guy.
I would take any of The Terminator films over any of The Die Hard Films.
Even the one that didn't include Arnold Schwarzenegger in the cast at all?
Absolutely, Die Hard just never really did it for me in a major way.
You're missing out, John McClane would totally terminate the Terminator
