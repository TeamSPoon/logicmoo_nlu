What city do you think will be the next to get an NFL team?
Well obviously Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
I meant other than those.
Yeah I know.  St. Louis might get one.
Yeah, the Rams were a big loss for them.
Toronto might get one too in the future.
Yeah, but Buffalo might try to block it since it encroaches on their area.
True.  Sacramento may be an option.
They have a big media market.
It is much bigger than most people think.
I think it is like the 19th biggest media market or something.
I think that the NFL wants a team in London.
They want the global market.
They sure do!
Another city might be Mexico City.
It is the largest city in North America.
It has something like 20 million people.
They have a lot of NFL fans down there.
The Raiders, 49ers and Cowboys are all popular.
Their Azteca Stadium is pretty cool too.
