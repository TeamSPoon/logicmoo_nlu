Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
No, but I want to. Did you know Robin Wright plays a general in it?
No, I did not know that! She was in Princess Bride, right?
Yes! She looks very strong in the trailers.
All of the Amazons were athletes, I heard. It makes a difference!
What kind of difference?
When they train and fight, it feels real. Not like models posing.
How was Gal Godot's fighting?
It was great! There is an amazing scene where she begins a fight alone.
Do not spoil it! What about Chris Pine's character?
He is really cool.
I was worried he might be kind of a jerk because Diana is a female soldier.
No, he isn't. They make a good team and they challenge each other.
That sounds like a relief.
Also, I think you will like one of the villains.
Why do you say that?
She is creepy and has a really cool character design.
That sounds like someone I would cosplay.
I can't wait for Halloween costumes based on this movie!
I will watch it and let you know what I think.
