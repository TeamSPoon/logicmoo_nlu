Yesterday I went to the movies in the theater for the first time in ages.
That is so fun, what movie did you see?
I saw the new Wonder Woman.
I have heard great things about that movie did you like it?
I thought it was amazing you should definitely go see it.
I really want to where did you see it?
I saw it at the Fenway theater.
That is really close to me I'll go see it this weekend.
Make sure to reserve one of those reclining seats, they are so comfortable!
I love sitting in those seats.
It really makes going to the movies a treat.
I'm going to reserve my seats now.
The cast was really amazing.
Have you seen anything else lately?
Not in the theaters but I've rented a few movies from Red Box, nothing that I really enjoyed.
When I'm bored I really like to watch Bridesmaids, that movie is hilarious.
I agree I actually bought that movie because I watch it so much.
It really cracks me up.
Me too, and I feel like it was really the start of Melissa McCarthy's awesome career
She is so great, I love everything she is in.
