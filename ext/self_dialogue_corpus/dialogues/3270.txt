How did you feel about the original Paranormal Activity?
That was a fantastic concept.  It was one of the first crowd-funded movies.
I completely forgot about that.  My name is in the credits for contributing on the DVD.
Mine too!  The movie started a bit slower, but definitely got more intense.
Yes, I found I would think about the movie when trying to go to sleep.
I would get scared that my husband would start screaming in the kitchen or something.
At the end, when she popped up really close to the camera, I screamed.
Oh, I did too.  I was so embarrassed in the theater.
I will admit, I thought that maybe this was a real found footage movie by the end.
I did look up the characters and actors too to make sure it was just a movie.
