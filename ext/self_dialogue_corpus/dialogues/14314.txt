The Bulls organization seems really lost
I agree. The Dwayne Wade signing was a bad decision.
He didn't fit with this offense
No he didn't. Matter of fact this whole roster didn't fit
I have no idea what this organization is trying to do
And what do they do with Rajon Rondo.
I mean he played like garbage the majority of the year, but look good in the playoffs.
That is until he got hurt.
Bingo. Can they build this team around Jimmy Butler
I don't know if Jimmy Butler is a bonafied superstar. I mean he is a good player
Yes good, but not great
And that's the dilemma. They went from thinking Derrick Rose was their franchise player to now Jimmy
I think he needs a superstar to play with for this to work out
He is not the type of guy that can lead a team to the promise land
But you have to pay him max money because you can't lose him.
I see what you are saying. Can they get big name free agents to go there?
I think they could especially if Wade decides to opt out
He would be leaving a lot of money on the table though
Yeah he would, but you would think it's not about the money for him at this point
Yeah, but it's always about the money
