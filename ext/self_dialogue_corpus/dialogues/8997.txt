How good of a band do you think Taking Back Sunday is?
Probably one of the better bands in todays music.
They wrote an album that no one will forget.
The problem is thats the only thing they did.
Would you consider them a one hit wonder
No the follow up to Tell All Your Friends was good
I dont remember any tracks from that
Because you wanted it to be a redux of Tell All Your Friends
No, I just think it wasnt that good
Well thats not really a fair point then.
