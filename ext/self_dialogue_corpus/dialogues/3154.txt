What do you think about NFL teams moving cities?
I think it is kind of strange.
Me too.
I can't imagine leaving a local fan base.
I wonder if they lose some fans by moving.
I'm sure they do.
There have been a few moves recently.
I remember the LA Rams.  Who else?
Well the Raiders have been approved to move.
They have?
Yup, they will be playing out of Vegas.
Vegas?  Really?
NFL approved it.
That is pretty cool.
Yeah.  I think they will gain a good following.
It would be fun to go to a game in Vegas.
Yes, it would.
You could watch the game and then gamble afterword.
It is a party town too.
Very true.
