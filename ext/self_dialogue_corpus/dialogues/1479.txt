Who's your team for the upcoming football season?
You know I'm 49ers all day, man!
Well, that's a shame. Their offseason looked terrible!
Not as bad as the Jets, however.
That is true. Their offseason was probably the worst in history, and that's in a world where the 49ers still exist!
At least the 49ers have an established team, however. The Jets can't seem to ever get it together.
That is true. What do you think of the division this year?
Seahawks are our biggest threat, I think. Cardinals and Rams are worst than they were last year, I hope.
You don't think David Johnson is a threat!? You're crazy!
He is, but Palmer is so old.
But still great. He just needs some better offensive weapons to throw to.
And don't even get me started on the Rams.
Where are they now anyway? Los Angeles.
Yes, unfortunately. LA didn't even truly want a team!
I did hear that. But yeah, I think that the Seahawks are the biggest threat in that division.
I'm glad you agree. If we can get one up on them, we can make a move for the one-seed.
That's a lofty goal, however. They picked up Lacy.
You mean Feast Mode? He can't run anymore!
You won't be saying that when the 49ers play the 'Hawks!
We'll see soon enough. Preseason is very close!
