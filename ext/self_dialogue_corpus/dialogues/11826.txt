What is your favorite Beatles album?
It's so difficult to pick just one album!
I know, I feel like they spanned so many genres that there is something for everyone.
Agreed.  That said, I would probably say that the White Album is my favorite.
The album most people tend to choose?
Yes, but I think it truly deserves the praise.
Could you explain what you mean?
Of course!  It marked a real departure from the rest of their catalog and an evolution in their sound.
It doesn't hurt that there are multiple popular songs on that album.
Of course not.  I'd say it's almost like The Wall of the Beatles catalog because it has so many popular songs and is so iconic.
