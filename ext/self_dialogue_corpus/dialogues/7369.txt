What is your favorite Disney movie?
My favorite of all time is The Little Mermaid.
I like that one, too! Sebastian is my favorite character!
I like him, too. And Scuttle.
Scuttle was a little annoying to me.
Really? I think he wasn't the brightest, but had the best intentions when helping Ariel.
King Triton was really strict, but he had to be with Ursula lurking around.
She was a creepy villain. When she grew to a huge size and stirred the sea, that was scary.
I agree. I liked the ending when King Triton let Ariel and Eric be together.
That was nice. I know there's a sequel the The Little Mermaid, but I haven't ever seen it.
