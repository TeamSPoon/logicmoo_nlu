How much Fantasy Football are you doing this year?
I'm going with 4 different leagues, what about you?
I'm down to one right now. I'm working on some other NFL projects instead.
I know - it's hard to keep track of all the teams and the players
I'm starting to research the salary cap more and which teams are most affected.
Are a lot of teams up against the cap?
I'd say more half the teams including the Cowboys and Patriots
What about the Giants?  Are they going to have room to resign Eli to one more contract?
They have the room, but I doubt they with that young kid in the wings
I thought the same about Brady, with Garrapolo still on the roster
Jimmy G will have to be paid one way or another.
Well, Brady has said he's playing till he's 45
I know he is good now but at some point father time will catch up
I agree, it's just hard to imagine given how well he's playing.
I know - the drop off will be quick. Remember Peyton?
I do - but he had all of those neck issues.
True, but all it takes is one wrong move, and there goes the know
Brady takes care of himself, so I think it have to be some sort of freak injury
That's why they are keeping Jimmy G around
I think its a good idea to be planning ahead like that
