Does anyone want to go see the Mummy this weekend?
I do, but I wasn't sure when it came out in theaters.
I think Tom Cruise plays in it with Sofia Boutella, who plays the Mummy.
Are you going to bring anyone along with us?
Yes, I think my brother wants to see it with us if we go.
How about Friday, we can go around 5pm?
Sounds great, I will call him to let him know. He will be thrilled.
I saw that some of the reviews do not look very good.
Critics can be pretty rough on actors and films.
Yes, but I still am excited about watching the movie.
