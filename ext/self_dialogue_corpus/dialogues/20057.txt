You know my least favorite question?  What is your favorite movie?
I know right?  I mean how can you pick just one?
And then everybody always answers Citizen Kane.  People that have never even seen Citizen Kane say "Citizen Kane is my favorite movie."
Rosebud.  I know, it bothers me too, like Orson Welles was the only talented person ever in the film business.  So what are some movies that you like?
Such a better question.  Thanks for that.
You are welcome.  Much easier to think about movies that way isn't it?
It is.  I like many different genres but lately I have been on a gangster kick so Godfather comes to mind.
Ok.  And the Untouchables or Pulp Fiction.
Or Goodfellas, The Departed, Donnie Brasco.
Casino, Carlito's Way.
See what I mean?  I could have considered almost all of those movies as my favorite at one time or another.
I understand, and that is just one limited genre and a thirty second conversation.  Just think how many great movies we could come up with in an hour.
Thousands and thousands.  I wonder how much time I have spent watching movies?
Probably a lot, but probably not as much as you think.
I think I will watch Godfather 3 tonight.
Sequels!
I love sequels.  So what is your favorite sequel?
You did not just say that, did you really just say that?
I was kidding.
Not funny.
