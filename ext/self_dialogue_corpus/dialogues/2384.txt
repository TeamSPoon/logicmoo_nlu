It seems like many of the executives for the NFL are former players.
That makes sense, though.
How so?
Who can better understand the game than someone who has played it?
True, but they often don't have business experience.
They seem to learn on the job.
Can you think of some success stories?
Sure, consider the career of John Elway.
What did he do?
As a player, he won two Super Bowls as an all-star quarterback.
And, what did he do as an executive?
As a general manager, he put together a team that won Super Bowl 50.
Both of these feats were done with the Broncos?
Yes, that's correct.
Can you think of someone with similar accomplishments?
Definitely! Jim Thorpe was an amazing football player and one of the founders of the NFL.
Yes, and George Halas took a similar path.
You're correct. In fact, George Halas played and coached at the same time!
Wow!
And, it wasn't just that he played and coached. He was also the owner and ticket seller!
