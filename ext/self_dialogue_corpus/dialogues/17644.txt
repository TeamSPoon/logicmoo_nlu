I saw some old videos with Lady Gaga on youTube when she was normal.
Yes, she started as just a piano player and songwriter.
That is true.     She was still using her real name, Stefani Germanotta.
I can see why she changed it!
Definitely a mouthful.
It amazes me how popular she is.
Yes, after Joanna and the Super Bowl show, there is no doubting her popularity.
I thought she would never live down that Meat Dress.
The outfits Lady Gaga wears definitely inspire opinions.
Remember that metal outfit from the Bad Romance video?
Definitely.    Another big of weirdness.
Believe it or not, both those are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame these days.
What other albums of hers are your favorites?
I personally prefer the earlier stuff a bit more.     The album The Fame.
Definitely.     Poker Face and Just Dance.
The next record too, which had Bad Romance on it.
The recent record with Tony Bennett is also pretty good.
What is it called?    Cheek to Cheek.
That is the name of it.
Not my type of music, but it is enjoyable.
