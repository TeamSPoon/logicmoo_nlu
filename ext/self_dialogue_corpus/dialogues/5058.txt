The cubs have lost 7 out of their last 10 games
I know it has been really frustrating as a Cubs fan
Right now their starting pitching has been awful
Not only that, but their once heralded defense has been abysmal too
They need to turn this ship around while they still have time
No doubt. Thanks God they are in a weak division
Exactly. They still have time to right the ship
We are only roughly 40 games in and they are hovering at the .500 mark
Yeah, I think they can turn this thing around still
I would hate for them to win last year and not even make the postseason this year
Yeah that would suck really bad
I just hope they turn it on here soon
I think when you win a championship, it's natural to have a letdown
I agree, but they gotta fight through it at this point
Some timely hitting would also do them so good
You are so right on that. The bats have been dead
Dead! more like they've been sitting with the grim reaper
Yeah for sure! They're not hitting anything right now
I'm just happy no one has run away with the division yet
Yeah me too. We still have time.
