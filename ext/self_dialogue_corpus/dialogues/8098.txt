Have you heard any good new songs lately?
I like pretty much anything by the Chainsmokers right now.
I do kind of like the song they have with Coldplay. I think it's called Something Just Like This.
I like that one too! They play it a lot though on the radio.
I agree!  They play the same songs over and over on the radio.
I got tired of hearing Closer, the one featuring Halsey.
Me too!  It was played like every other song on the radio.
I kind of think that all of the songs by the Chainsmokers sound a lot alike.
I never noticed that before but I guess you are kind of right.
I might start listening to more Adele or something just to get something different.
