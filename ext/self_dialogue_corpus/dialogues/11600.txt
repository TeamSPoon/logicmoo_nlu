One of my favorite bands is the Beatles. Do you like them?
I absolutely love the Beatles. What's your favorite song?
I really love Good Vibrations. Have you heard it?
Yes, thatâ€™s one of my favorites! Did you see the movie about Brian?
Yes, he was brilliant and I loved seeing how he wrote it and created the whole thing.
It was amazing to get a glimpse of his genius, for sure. What other songs of theirs do you like?
Hey Jude is a great one.
I agree. I love Hey Jude! Come Together is another one I really like.
Yeah, that's a great song. I really love everything I've heard of theirs though.
Me too, it's hard to even pick a favorite.
