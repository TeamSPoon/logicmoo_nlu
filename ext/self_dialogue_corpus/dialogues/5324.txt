What is your son going to be for halloween?
He's despicable really! Get it?
No?
He's going to be a Minion from Despicable Me.
I'm not sure I remember them, my son has been watching Cars non-stop lately.
You definitely know, they're the little yellow people with one eye in overalls.
Oh, I remember them! That was a great movie.
They have a Minions movie too, maybe your son would like it!
Anything to get a break from Cars!
You might like having a son better than one of those Minions! wish me luck on Halloween!
