Zootopia was such a good movie!
One of Disney's best original animated movies!
It was a lot more serious then I thought it was going to be.
You mean the content of the story?
Yeah the story content was really adult but surrounded by cute cuddly animals.
I was really surprised by that but in a good way.
Disney presented Zootopia in a way where parents could enjoy the movie while their kids could too.
I know, I thought some of the themes were a little too much for children, but I think the overall look of the movie really appealed to them.
It definitely appealed to me as a parent and I know my kids loved Disney's Zootopia. It was our favorite Disney movie and maybe even favorite movie overall movie of 2016!
That's really high praise! I really liked Zootopia too.
