Hon Solo is like Lord Vader.
What are you talking about?
Well think about it, they both dress mostly with black clothing.
Along with half the cast, so what?
Ok, well they both did illegal things for power.
Hon Solo followed a code of honor at least, Vader is just evil.
Fine, last and most important. They were both killed by their sons.
Holy cow, you may actually be on to something.
If Kylo Ren ends up having a sister, then say hello to Lord Solo.
This is starting to get weird, I think we need a marathon to research this issue.
