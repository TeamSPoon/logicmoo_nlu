Do you still buy movies on DVD?
Not at all.
How about Blu-Ray
I dont even own a player.
So why are movies still released in physical format?
Beats the heck out of me.
Would you ever consider an alternative method to watching movies?
Besides streaming through my cable box?
Oh I guess you already do.
Yeah I mean Hollywood needs to really start releasing blockbuster films onto the boxes.
What about the physical theaters?
They will suffer a loss but they need to entice the viewer to come to the place.
I see my local one has a bar installed.
Thats not enough though.
So what else do they need to do?
Nothing really, but millenials will stop paying to go.
So the business model needs to change but theres no method.
Well putting reclining chairs and bars isnt the solution.
They have data that says otherwise
Well the movie industry is smarter than me
