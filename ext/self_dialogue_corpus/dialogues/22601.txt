Have you ever seen the Back to the Future series?
Believe or not I never have.
Are you kidding?! They're classics!
I know! I just never happened to watch them.
You need to watch them!
I know I will the next time I get the chance.
They're not too long either. I think each one is about an hour and a half.
That's not too bad.
You can finish the whole series in a day!
I've heard the third one isn't great.
It's the worst one out of all of them.
That's such a shame.
It's not too bad though. Worth watching at least once.
Where does the last one take place.
In the old western times!
This is already confusing.
It's not too bad. It makes sense if you watch them all.
Well I guess I need to watch them then.
I think you can get the trilogy for pretty cheap.
Maybe I should go grab it then!
