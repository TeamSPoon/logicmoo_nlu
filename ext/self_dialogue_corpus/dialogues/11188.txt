So I signed up with a company that sends me clothing by mail once a month. I try it on and keep what i want, am billed for it, and send back what I don't.
Oh I've heard about that. I keep seeing ads for them on facebook, but I wasn't sure if the clothes would be all that special.
I usually keep about 3 out of 5 of the items they send me. Do you want to see what i got last month?
Yes I would, that way I can see if it is something I would do or not.
Alright, look at this striped shirt. I normally would never choose horizontal stripes but the cut of the blouse is very flattering.
Oh I like it. It looks like a summer top that I would pair with high waisted pants.
This top reminds me of old Hollywood for some reason. It is very high quality as well.
Nice! I am begining to like this company now.
Now, let me show you the next item, which is a longer tunic with large cutouts in the back.
It looks kind of boring.
The tunic is very plain in front but look as I turn around and you will see why I love it so much.
Oh I see, the large cutouts in the back. It is very sexy and pretty much shows your bare back.
This is something I would wear to go out in.I haven't decided what to pair it with though.
If it were me, I would just wear either black or white denim shorts.
Now I am going to show you the cutest pants in the world. These are almost like leggings but they have real pockets.
I can see why you love them.
I honestly don't see maroon pants every day. I like the color but the fit is a little off.
Yeah, they are a little short and loose around the bottom.
Well, those are the three items I kept from last months fashion box. What do you think?
They are nice but I don't think the service is for me. I enjoy shopping and picking clothes out to match my own personal style.
