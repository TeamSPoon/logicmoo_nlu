Do you like any rap artists?
I do like some rap, but don't know who it is i'm hearing most of the time, i just know i like it
Yeah, i get that. Tupac's one of my favorites.
Yeah, he was a cool dude. It was sad when he got killed.
For sure. I also like DMX
I've heard the name but i know so little rap music i couldn't identify him by song or picture!
That's cool. It's not a contest, I was just wondering
haha. I do like it though, i've just never made a habit of listening so i don't get to know the artists
Right.
I think partially cause it wasn't a big thing when i was growing up so i never got in the habit. Probably if i grew up in a younger generation I would know more.
