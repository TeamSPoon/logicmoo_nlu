What are your favorite music videos?
I actually haven't watched a music in a while.
Why not?
Well, I think they're too shallow.
I guess they can be.
Like, every single video has half naked girls and beautiful people.
I see what you mean. But maybe those are only the mainstream videos.
What music videos do you watch?
Just the ones of my favorite bands. Those tend to be a little bit more artsy.
Can you give me an example?
Well like in Tame Impala's videos, there are collages and paintings that move to the music.
That sounds pretty trippy
Exactly! It's pretty cool in my opinion.
Maybe I should check out some music videos of some indie bands I like
Definitely.
Where do I watch them?
You could see them for free on youtube.
Oh right.
Yep, just search the song and it should pop up.
Will do.
