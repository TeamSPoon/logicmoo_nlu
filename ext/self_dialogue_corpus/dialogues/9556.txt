What do you think about Memphis Bleek.
He was a great rapper in the late 90s.
What was your favorite song.
My favorite song was 'Is that your chick'
I think he was one of the best rappers line for line of his era.
I agree, he was very good at his time.
I forgot, which group was he apart of.
He was part of the Rocafella team with Jay-z.
Oh yea that is right, those were the good days.
Hip hop was amazing in the late 90s.
