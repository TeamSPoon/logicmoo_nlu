Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No I haven't, is it any good?
Yes, it is amazing! It has Vin Disel in it, and I am a big fan.
I was never a big fan of his movies.
How could you say that? The Pacifier was amazing!
To each his own I suppose.
I can agree. Do you like anyone from the Fast and Furious franchise?
I like Dwayne Johnson, is he in those movies.
Yes I believe so.
I may need to watch the series then.
