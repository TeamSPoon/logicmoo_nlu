What do you know about 90s rap?
I think it was a lot better than the rap from 2017
Why do you say that?
Rapper used to be gangster and their lyrics were gangster too
But nowdays they arent?
No way. They used to wear clothes that were literally baggy but now they all wear Gucci and stuff
That's true, I never saw Tupac wearing Louis Vuitton. He rapped about the streets
I dont miss the east coast and west coast fighting though
Yeah, all the good rappers got caught up in that and some of them got killed
Biggie and Tupac should still be alive, but their raps were dissing each other and they got shot
