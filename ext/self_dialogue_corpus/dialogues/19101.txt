Have you heard of H.E.R.?
Yes, I've heard vol. 1, but not vol. 2.
Oh, nice. What'd you think about vol. 1?
I loved it. Her voice is amazing.
Yes! Her remix to Jungle was better than Drake's.
I'm glad you said it. How was vol. 2?
I thought it was great.
I heard that Still Down was well produced. Was it?
Yes, of course. To me, the whole album was produced very well.
Ah, what were your other favorites.
Everything was great to me. Avenue should be a favorite of yours if you listen to it.
Ah, why so?
You love PND and she sounds like PND there.
Okay, I see. I have to give it a listen.
Yep, and I heard that people know her identity.
Oh really, who is she?
She's Gabi Wilson?
Gabi Who?
Gabi Wilson... she was on Star Search a few years ago.
Ah, makes sense!
