I am so excited! I just got a new shipment of vinyl records in.
Any great finds?
I think the best one is the mint edition of the White Album.
Wow, that's great! I love the Beatles, and I think that record is pretty rare.
I can't wait to hear how "Hey Jude" sounds. That's my favorite Beatles song.
It is really beautiful. So you like Paul's vocals?
Actually, I just like the song structure and lyrics. Vocally, I tend to like the songs where they all sing together.
So, their earlier stuff, like "She Loves You"?
Yes - those early songs are just so upbeat, they seem like they're having so much fun.
Their sound definitely evolved over the years.
