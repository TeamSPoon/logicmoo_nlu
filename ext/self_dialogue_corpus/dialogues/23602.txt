Do you like Hitchcock movies?
Yes.
Have you seen Frenzy?
No, I ahven't.
It is one of his later movies. It even has some creepy nudity.
Nasty. What is about.
Typical Hitchcock, Wrong man gets suspected of being a rapist murderer.
Oh. Is it graphic?
Not really. The rape scene is uncomfortable but not graphic. The murder is with a necktie.
A necktie?
Yeah, he strangles them with it.
I don;t know about that. Are there other better movies by Hitchcock.
Oh yeah, most of them are a little better except maybe Topaz.
Topaz?
Yeah, it just was not very good.
OH, what is his best?
Some say Vertigo?
Oh, I have seen that one. it is great.
Yes it is.
I need to see it again.
