Do you have any Beatles CDs?
I have a number 1 album.
Is it good?
Yeah, it's not bad for someone getting into the Beatles.
Does it have all the good songs?
It has a lot of them, but not all.
Which ones are missing?
Well, they had tons of good music, but not all their songs were number ones.
Oh, and these are just number ones?
Yeah, so there's some songs not on it.
