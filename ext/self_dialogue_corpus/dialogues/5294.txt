Which Disney movie is your favorite?
wow, that's a tough question. There are so many Disney movies.
That's true, what do you think about Pirates of Carribean?
Oh, right. I almost thought Disney only makes animations
that would be a mistake, Disney make all sorts of movies in fact. So do you like Pirates of Carribean?
Oh yea, I remember seeing Jack Sparrow fighting for the cursed coin on TV, I was so exciting that I jumped around
haha, that's pretty dramatic
yea, that was in fact the first time I seeing any pirates of carribean movie, since then I was addicted to it
