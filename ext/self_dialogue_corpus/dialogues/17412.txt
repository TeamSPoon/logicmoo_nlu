Do you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
Sure I do.
Have you listened to their older stuff recently?
Not recently, No I have not.
You really should.
Why is that?
Songs like Californication are so harmonious yet energizing.
They are great.
Yes they really need to be listened to regularly to be fully enjoyed.
Why is that?
Their music really changes the atmosphere and environment of all who listen to them.
That is an interesting idea.
Yes their music really has an effect on people's moods.
That is a good point.
They are truly a complete band.
I do like some of their songs.
It is great music for any time also.
What do you mean?
You can play them at any moment and their music can fit in and be enjoyed, it can be the soundtrack to your life.
I like that, thanks.
