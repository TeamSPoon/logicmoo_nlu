I just rented the new Power Rangers movie from Redbox last night.
Was it good?
It was pretty good. They tried to keep it fun like the cartoons but it actually was a little bit darker.
I've heard that fans are pretty disappointed with it.
At least it didn't flop as bad as Jem and the Holograms.  That was based off a kids show.
I actually liked Jem and the Holograms but I've never seen the cartoons so I didn't know what I was looking for.  I thought Aubrey Peeples did really well.
She sang her own parts right?
Yeah she did.  They seem to be making lots of new movies off of shows or kids shows.
They made a Max Steel movie recently too.
That was just awful.  I saw it in the theater and wanted to ask for my money back.
Who was in that movie?
Ben Winchell was the main character.
I don't even know who that is.
He's not been in anything big, just tv movies.
You know what they should make a movie out of?  Thundercats.  Remember that show?
That could be good.  Could be bad.  If I remember that cartoon is was really campy.
It was, they'd have to cut out some stuff I think.
We need some good fantasy and action movies out. The Lord of the Rings were the last ones that I really enjoyed
You didn't like the Hobbit?
It drug on too long I thought.  The Hobbit cartoon was better.
