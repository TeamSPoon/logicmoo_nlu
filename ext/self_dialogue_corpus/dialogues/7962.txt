So are you a fan of pop music?
I understand the appeal, but I don't really like it.
Are you a music snob?
Not at all, pop music just sounds the same to me.
It is popular though, so go with what works right?
I guess, but you just don't see much creativity any more.
Is there any new pop that you do like?
I do like that new "Sound of the Times" song.
And why is that?
It has complexity and actually feels like a throwback song to me.
