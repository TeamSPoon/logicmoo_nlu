When these kind of movies are too scary, I have to hide my eyes behind my hands..
I love the scary kind the best. Some of my favorites this year are The Mummy or Alien: Covenant. I may jump in my seat during scary parts but I love them.
I prefer the type of thriller like Hell or High Water. It had amazing action and great suspense.
Wasn't that movie up for Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards?
Yes, although it did not win, it still was amazing.
I agree.  I like that kind of thriller. Some of my favorites has been the Bourne series.
I loved Matt Damon in those movies. He plays an extremely convincing Bourne.
How about Nocturnal Animals? Did you see it last year? It also was up for an Academy Award.
No  but I read reviews on Amy Adams' performance. All the critics raved about it.
She was so good that I really got caught up in the plot. Once again, I jumped in my seat when it was scary.
