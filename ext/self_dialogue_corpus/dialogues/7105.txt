What do you think about Disney's evil movie characters?
I think most of them are brilliant!
How so? What makes them brilliant?
It seems like Disney has a way of devoloping these characters so you literally hate them and root for the good guys.
That's true. What specific characters come to mind when you think of Disney villains?
Cruella De Vil, Ursula, Gaston, Captain Hook, not to mention all of the evil queens!
Did any specific villains scare you when you were little?
The Big Bad Wolf was pretty creepy to be honest. Captain Hook was pretty scary too.
Any other Disney villains you can think of?
I think Randall Boggs from Monsters was pretty awesome, honestly! Reminds me of someone I know!
