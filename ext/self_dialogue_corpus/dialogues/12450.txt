WHat is it you like best about the Star Wars films
I think they transport you to another world
yes somewhere far beyond anything you can imagine
who are the characters you like the most
well, Luke of course, but Obie Won
who do you think is the best villin
Darth Maul
he was great and had great fighting skills
I agree, he was really professional looking
especially when half of his body was falling down the shaft
