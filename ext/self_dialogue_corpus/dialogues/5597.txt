Did you ever see Mulan?
I've seen parts of it.
Oh, it's such a good movie for little girls.
I guess I could see how she could be a role model.
Yeah, she was such a strong character.
Was this based on a true story?
I don't know.  Maybe loosely.
Well, when Disney takes things and bases movies on them, it's usually pretty loose.
Yeah, but they only do it to make a good movie.
As long as kids don't believe inaccuracies.
