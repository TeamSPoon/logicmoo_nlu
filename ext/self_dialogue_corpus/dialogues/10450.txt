Hey so it's summer time.
Yes?
You know what that means?
Um, not really
Movies!!!
Oh, well yeah. If you like crap movies.
No way man. The Alien convent movies looks awesome.
Yeah no. They sucked after the 2nd one.
Ah man, I didn't think so.
Well I do.
You didn't like the one where they resurrected Ripley from the dead
I never saw that one
Oh, it's great man. You have to check it out.
I watched Alien 3 and was thoroughly disappointed.
Well yeah that one is pretty bad, but this new one is supposed to be really good.
I don't know. I don't like wasting money on bad movies.
I think you'd like this one.
Well, maybe. What time?
10 pm and the valley cinema.
Okay, I'll join you for this one.
