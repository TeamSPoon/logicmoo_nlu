So Lady Gaga is a great pianist.
She does seem to have many talents.
I like her singing too but only sometimes.
What do you mean?
Sometimes she has a more manly voice. It's deeper.
Oh, I see. Yes, that is true.
Like the voice she uses on Poker Face is deeper.
Right, and she sings better on You and I.
Yes, exactly.
I prefer the You and I voice.
