Have you seen the Fast and the Furious movies?
Yep, I've seen them all.
Do you like them?
Mostly, yeah. They're a lot of fun, with some crazily inventive car chases.
Which would you say is your favorite?
Good question. I'd maybe say number five, Fast 5.
Really? Not the first one?
The first one didn't quite have the formula figured out. It took them a few movies to get it down pat.
What do you mean?
The ensemble cast, mostly. Diesel, Walker, The Rock, Ludacris, Michelle Rodriquez, Tyrese Gibson.
Was that the first one Dwayne Johnson was in?
Yep. And to me, he was kind of the last element needed to make the ensemble perfect.
But Paul Walker was still alive during the filming of that one?
He was in all but the most recent one. It's not quite the same without him.
I actually never watched any of them after Tokyo Drift.
What made you stop watching them?
I guess it started to seem kind of like they were doing the same thing over and over.
It's a winning formula, why mess with it?
It just got a little stale, for me.
Give Fast 5 a shot - I think you'lll like it.
