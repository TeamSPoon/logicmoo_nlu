Did you hear that Taylor Swift is putting her music back on Spotify and other streaming services?
Yeah, I am excited.
I don't really listen to Taylor Swift a lot but a lot of my friends like her.
I went to a party this weekend and the host was playing a bunch of Taylor Swift to celebrate her being back on Spotify.
That sounds like a strange party. Most of the parties I go to play pop or hip hop.
Yeah, some of her music is more upbeat but her older stuff is sad country songs.
I like some of her older stuff like 'Tim McGraw' and 'Back to December'. I just don't want to listen to it at a party though.
Yeah, I agree, but I wasn't in control of the music.
What would you have played if you got to pick?
Maybe a summer anthems playlist with some Calvin Harris, Nicki Minaj, Chance the Rapper, stuff like that.
Have you heard the new Lorde song, "Green Light"?
No I haven't yet, but I liked "Tennis Courts" and "Royals" so maybe I should look into it.
Yeah, you should definitely check it out. She released a whole new album this year called Melodrama.
I haven't heard of it yet. Is that the only single so far?
I think she released a second single from the album, but I don't know the name.
Oh. Is she from Ireland?
No, she's from New Zealand. Her real name is Ella.
That's a pretty name.
She's really young too. Only 20.
Wow. Does that mean she was born in 96?
