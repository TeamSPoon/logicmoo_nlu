What do you think of the trend towards bell bottoms?
My mother said she used to wear them in the 70s and they were very comfortable.
Did she keep any of them?
No, but she said all the high school girls were wearing them.  She said the style made your legs look long.
I heard the trend started in England and the model named Twiggy made them popular.
Yeah, Twiggy was one of the first super models.
Twiggy was also known for making the 'mode' dress popular.
Yes, and also for big big fake eyelashes.
I'm not keen on all 'flower power' designs though on the clothes from the 70s.
Me neither.  The current style bell bottoms don't have crazy flower patterns on them.
Yes, that makes them more versatile.  I saw Goldie Hawn wearing bell bottoms in a magazine.  She looked great.
Her daughter Kate Hudson has a fashion brand called Fabletics.
I have seen the commercials.  Talk about crazy patterns!  But the patterns look good on the exercise leggings.
True.  And the patterns are strategically placed so they make the wearer look slimmer.
The fabric is comfortable.  I have a pair and love them.
Do they wash well?
Very well.  They retain their shape.
Can you put them in the drier?
Yes but I don't like to.
I think it is better to hang dry most clothes so they don't fade.
