Have you seen 'Wonder Woman?'
Yes.  How about yourself?
I did.  I absolutely loved it.
Me too.  Finally, we got a good DC movie.
I was going to say the exact same.  Both 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' were so underwhelming to me.
Don't forget 'Suicide Squad.'  DC is my favorite, and I love the heroes, but until this latest movie, all were bad.
I think that this will set DC on the right path.  They now know what works.
What was your favorite scene in the movie?
I think when all the men in the trenches were backing away, but Diana moved onto No Man's Land to the battle.
That scene gave me such chills.
It was so empowering too, to watch a woman superhero.
I agree.  I think it helped that the brilliant director Patty Jenkins is a woman.
We need more women directors to helm these movies.
We totally do.  I mean this movie was the highest-grossing live action film directed by a woman.
Yea, I had heard that they broke records.
Also we should give credit where it's due.  The actors were terrific.
Gal Gadot was an awesome lead.
She was great as Wonder Woman, though Chris Pine stole the show as Steve.
He has grown into such a terrific actor ever since his Star Trek days.
You're right.  He keeps on improving with each role.
