Star Wars has created so much memorable things in pop culture.
I agree. And not just characters.
That's why I said so much memorable things. There's things like worlds, races, weapons, spacecraft, and so much more.
Don't forget about the robots!
Right. The robots are just as memorable as some of the other characters.
R2-D2 is my younger cousin's favorite character in the entire film series.
Really? I get that they're young, but why R2?
That's just it. They're still young, and they find R2 to be funny.
I guess I need to be a little more open minded.
Don't worry about it. You're fine.
