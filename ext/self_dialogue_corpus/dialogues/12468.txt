When does The Last Jedi come out anyway?
I think around Christmas time. Lots of people go to the movies during the holiday season.
It's kind of sad that Han Solo is gone. I just got used to him as a character again and then boom, he's dead.
I hope Ben aka Kylo Ren gets what he deserves.
I bet Luke serves up some serious payback in this one.
Do you think Luke still has what it takes? He looked a little rough in The Force Awakens.
He has to. Han was his boy. You can't let Kylo get away with killing your best friend.
And it was patricide also. Man that was dark.
Do you think Finn and Rey are going to get together?
Actually I do. Star Wars needs a new love affair.
