Did the Cats play basketball last night?
Yeah, the played Louisville?
Oh, the big rivalry game?  I missed it, how'd they do?
Well, Kentucky started slow shooting poorly from the perimeter
I though Fox was supposed to be their hot hand this year.
He is, but they had to look inside the paint more.  The first half both teams looked bad
So what did Calipari have to do after halftime?
He made a few adjustments.  Monk played a lot more minutes
What was the final score?
89-68 but it was a lot close than that.
Yeah?
