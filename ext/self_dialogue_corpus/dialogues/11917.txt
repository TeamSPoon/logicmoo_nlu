If you had to have a Beatles song played at your funeral what would it be?
My first, non-reflective answer is to say "In My Life." It's a retrospective of an entire life.
Yeah, it's really a great song of love and memory. So poignant for a pop song.
Mmm-hmm, it also has the right tempo and mood for a service like that. What would you go with?
"You Won't See Me." Ha! Ha! Ha!
You're kidding, right?
Yes, of course. That'd be a little cruel.
Okay, so what's your actual choice?
I think Let It Be would be my pick. It's also a really good retrospective and the lyrics are about dealing with pain and loss and depression.
Yeah, that's a really good one. "Have a number of great songs ready to play at your funeral" isn't a standard form of praise for a band, but it's so true in the case of The Beatles!
