Did you hear about the new Star Wars spin-off?
Which one?
The one that's all about Han Solo.
That scoundrel.  Cool.
Yeah.  It takes place before he met Luke and Leia in the original trilogy.
That should be interesting!  Is Chewbacca going to be in it?
Of course!  What is a Han Solo movie without Chewie?
Cool.  Who's directing the film?
I heard it was Ron Howard!
Oh my God!  He's a great director!
