What is your favorite NFL team?
I love the Green Bay Packers.
Why do you like them? You can't even see them in their stadium.
Well, if I live to be 200 years old, maybe!
Don't you like any other teams?
Well, I like the New England Patriots.
They win a lot, but are they fair?
Well, I think deflategate was overrated.
Do you like Tom Brady?
I think he's one of the best athletes the NFL has ever had.
But don't you think that he and the patriots are choking out other teams?
No, I don't think so. They're just good.
What about a team out west?
Well, I think the Denver Broncos are good.
Do you think they will have a chance after Manning?
I think they're still a good team in spite of him leaving.
Which teams will go to the Super Bowl next year?
Probably the Patriots and some team we don't know about.
Are you sure the Patriots will make it?
Not completely, but they're the first team that comes up in my mind.
