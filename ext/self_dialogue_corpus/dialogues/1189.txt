I can't wait for the nfl season to start.
Yeah me too, so exciting.
Who's your favorite team?
The packers!
Oh nice, they did really good last year.
Yeah they did. Hope no injuries like last year though.
Yeah, I saw that.
I was so mad that both our corners were injured during the playoffs.
Matt Ryan really lit up your secondary.
Don't even remind me, I was so bummed.
Well this is a new season.
Yeah, I hope those new draft picks on defense pan out.
Same here, I'm a niners fan.
Oh really?
Yeah have been for a long time.
Niners had a good draft.
Yeah they did, so excited about John Lynch's moves.
I saw that, you guys fleeced the bears.
I couldn't believe it too.
Who gives up so much to trade up one spot?
