Do you have a favorite character in the Fast & Furious series?
If I'm being honest, it's just got to be Dom.
Really? Care to explain?
I just find him to be the coolest character is all.
Cool how, though?
His tone of voice, his facial expressions, his fashion, his overall demeanor, it all just screams cool guy to me.
But is there any bigger reasons why?
I think he has a decent amount of depth to his character.
Do you mean emotionally.
Of course. He's more softhearted than most will say he is.
