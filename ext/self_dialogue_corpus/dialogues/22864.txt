Have you seen the Power Rangers movie?
No I haven't. Have you?
Yes, it was awesome!
Really? I didn't even know that they made a new one.
Yea it came out this past March.
I need to check it out. Who is in it?
It has Becky G and Elizabeth Banks, amongst some other familiar faces.
Okay that sounds interesting. What was good about it?
Pretty much everything. It was action packed and it had a few comedic scenes that I wasn't expecting.
It's not cheesy right?
No! The director Dean Israelite did a good job with the movie!
Hey didn't he direct Project Almanac?
Yeah he did!
That was a good movie. I feel like I am going to like the Power Rangers movie as well.
You wont be disappointed. Its about two hours long but well worth it.
Hey that's fine by me as long as you promise that it's good.
Oh it is! The story line is similar to the tv show plots.
Good, I like when movies stay true to their roots.
Yeah it is similar in every way. It even has the same character names.
Thats great I am going to go see it soon.
