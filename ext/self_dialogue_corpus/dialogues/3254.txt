I just saw The Shining.
The movie or the tv movie?
The movie, 1980.
Who directed it?
Stanley Kubrick?
I remember Jack Nicholson, but not the wife.
Shelley Duval.
Right.  What happens in the end?
Nicholson gets lost in the maze and freezes to death. He ends up in the old photo of the place.
Wow, neat.
