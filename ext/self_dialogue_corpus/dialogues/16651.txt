Do you listen to nerd rock?
You mean like They Might Be Giants and Nerf Herder?
Yeah, those are great!  I've been getting into a lot of Kirby Krackle and No More Kings recently.
Kirby Krackle?  Like the comics graphics?
Yeah.  They both do a lot pop culture based music.
Have you tried Chameleon Circuit?  They're more specifically Doctor Who based.......
No, I'll have to check them out.
Yeah, they did that Exterminated Regenerate song on the internet a few years ago.
Have you heard the new Jonathan Coulton album?
I didn't know there was one!
Yeah, It's called Solid State.  It's a concept album about the internet.  Has a graphic novel tie in.
Cool.  Is it any good?
I dig the album.
What about the comic?
Haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Ah.  Wasn't his last song a novel tie in?
Yeah, Red Shirts from John Scalzi.
Guess he had to come up with something while waiting to do another song for Portal 3.....
Man, I want that,  Why'd you have to remind me?  And now Still Alive is stuck in my head
I'm making a note here: Huge Success
