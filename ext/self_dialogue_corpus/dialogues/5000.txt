Does Minor League baseball provide as much excitement as the Major Leagues?
It depends on the type of baseball you like to watch.
I like to watch a game with a lot of real characters in it. It's great to root for a player with real personality.
I'm not sure that there are many great personalities playing in the Minor League.
But perhaps I will some rising stars?
Absolutely. There have been many Rookie of the Year winners that have come up through the Minors.
Are the tickets cheaper?
The tickets are significantly cheaper.
But then does that mean the players are paid less?
The players are paid much less than in the Majors.
Perhaps I should try out and get a contract myself.
Do you think you are good enough to play professionally?
I'm not sure. I might not be fit enough for it.
Even in the Minor Leagues you have to be physically fit.
So are there any good games coming up that we can go to?
I believe the Cyclones are playing the Renegades next week.
Will that be a good game?
It could be. The Cyclones are one of the best teams out there.
Do you think they'll beat the Renegades?
Perhaps. But then the Renegades are great too.
