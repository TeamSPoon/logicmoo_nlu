Have you seen Get Out?
Yea, that was creepy!
I thought it was good. It didn't really scare me though.
Even at the end?
Yea, I saw the ending coming, you could tell his girlfriend was in on it the whole time.
Not me, I was shocked.
It took me a while to figure out what exactly was happening though.
Yea me too, I couldn't figure out why the staff at the house was acting so weird towards the main character.
Yea, but it all made sense in the end.
Well, kind of. It was pretty crazy.
