So, what are some of your favorite funny lines in Star Wars?
Well, I like that line in The Force Awakens when BB8 gives Finn a thumbs up.  I thought that was cute.
Haha.. that was a good.  Here's one of mine, it's from the first film.
Okay, lay it on me.
When they're in that control station and Han's talking on the radio to the empire guards and he's all, "We're fine here!  Everything's fine!  Situation normal!  Uh... how are you guys?"
That's is pretty funny!
What's crazy to me is I didn't even remember that line until I re-saw the film in theaters several years back.
You saw it in the theaters?
Yeah, not the original though... it was special edition.
Ahh.. we they added all those effects for no real reason.
