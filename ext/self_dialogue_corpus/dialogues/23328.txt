Hey! Are you excited to see Everything, Everything? It's based on a book by Nicola Yoon.
I read the book a while back. I didn't know there was going to be a movie though.
I can't wait for It to come out in September.
Yea I saw the first edition years ago. It was good, hope this one is good too.
Did you see Beauty and the Beast? I thought it was really good!
Yes! I loved it! I heard they're doing a Lion King too.
I didn't really like Jungle Book.
Really?! I thought it was awesome!
I can't wait until Girl's Trip comes out!
Me too! I'm going with my sister!
I wish Disney would make a Peter Pan live action.
Well, let's see how they do with Mulan first.
I have a confession. I have never seen a Harry Potter movie.
Don't worry, neither have I!
Idris Elba's new movie, The Mountain Between Us looks good!
Yes! And I love Kate Winslet!
I wonder if they ever made One Flew Over The Coo Coo's Nest into a movie?
Yes. It's a classic.
Have you seen the previews for Berlin Syndrome?!
Yes! I hope it plays here in the states!
