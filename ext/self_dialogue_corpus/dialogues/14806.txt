The Other Woman is such a funny movie.
That's the one with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, right?
That's right. Do you enjoy their movies?
Oh yes. Leslie Mann plays neurotic characters very well.
You're right. She was great in Knocked Up as Debbie.
I liked her in Big Daddy, too. That was the first movie I ever saw her in.
Really? It's been awhile since I watched an Adam Sandler movie.
I love his movies. They always make me laugh.
They are pretty funny. Happy Gilmore is my favorite Adam Sandler movie.
That's a good one. The cameo by Bob Barker always cracks me up.
