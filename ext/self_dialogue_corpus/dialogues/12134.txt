Who was your favorite Star Wars movie director?
JJ Abrams.
Why did you like him?
Because I think the movies he directs are very well done.
What did you think of George Lucas?
He was okay, but I'm not a fan of the prequels.
I agree.  I hated the actor that played the young Anakin Skywalker.
Yeah, I think everyone did.  It's interesting that Anakin became Darth Vader.
Yes.  Darth Vader is one of my favorite characters.
So dark.
