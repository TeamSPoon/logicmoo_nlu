Hey how's it going? How was your weekend?
It was amazing I went and saw the new Alien movie.
I have been wanting to see Alien Covenant! How was it?!
The movie was absolutely great. I don't want to give anything away but Ridley Scott did not let us down with this movie.
I am totally going to go see it today after work then. I have to go see it in theaters to get the best effect.
That is a great idea. Did you know that James Franco is it?
What, no way. Does he have a good part.
Well actually, since it doesn't give anything important away, he dies in the first 5 minutes.
What!? No!
I know. But it is okay. He pops back up for a second and the movie is great with or without him.
Well do they answer all of the questions every Alien fan has had?
Yes! They finally answer everything but I will say, if you haven't seen Prometheus in a long time, you may want a refresher.
Well lucky for me I watched it last week because I was so excited about Covenant coming out.
Awesome well if you are really going to the movies tonight I'll go with you. I'd love to watch it again.
Sounds great! Looks like there is a show at seven thirty tonight at the iMax theather.
Great. Hope you are ready to watch some scary aliens trying to take over.
I have been waiting for a new Alien movie to come out for too long. I am ready. Plus I love Danny McBride.
Well you are in for a real treat because he did such a good job. I hope the cast him in more serious rolls.
Yes you are making me so much excited about this movie!
See you tonight at 7! Ill save us some good seats and get snacks. I am not getting up for anything. Don't want to miss out.
