I bet I know more about superbowl championships than you do.
You're on. Go ahead, ask me any year and I'll tell you the champions.
Ok, who won in 1994?
Easy, Dallas.
And where did they play?
Tempe. My turn,  who were the champs in 1987?
The Giants.
Who did they play against?
Buffalo.
And where did they play?
Tampa.
Wpw, ok you're pretty good. Go ahead, your turn.
Thanks, but now let's see how good you really are. 1972.
Hmmm, that's a really long time ago.
Can't do it?
I didn't say that. Dallas beat Miami in New Orleans.
Ok that's really impressive.
Give up?
No, but I think it's fair to say this is a draw.
Ok, fair enough. Draw.
