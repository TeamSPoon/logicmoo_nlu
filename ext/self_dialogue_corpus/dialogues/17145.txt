Have you ever heard of the Arcadian Wild?
Uh... is that like a wilderness camp or something?
Definitely not; they're a band.
Huh, I don't think I have. What type of music do they play?
They're a folk band. The lead singer's got a really nice twang.
Oh, so like Fleet Foxes?
Yes, definitely! They have a very similar style.
Well, I like Fleet Foxes. What songs do you recommend from this Wild band?
Personally, I really like Rain Clouds. It's soft and smooth and a little sad, but in a good way.
I get that feel. Are most of their songs slow?
No, in fact I'd say most aren't. You can dance to 'em.
I'm surprised I haven't heard of them. When did they start?
Around 2013, if memory serves. So they're not super young, but not super old either.
Hm, okay. Are they on Spotify?
Yep, that and YouTube and Google Play.
Okay, cool. Do they have more than one album?
Just their first, and an EP.
Okay. And what did you say their name was again--Arcade or something?
It's the Arcadian Wild.
Perfect, thanks! I'll pull a few songs up right now.
