Who shot first?  Han, or Greedo?
Han!  One hundred percent.
Didn't George Lucas edit the later versions to show Greedo shooting first?
He did, which is why it was so controversial.
Why was that controversial?
Well, Han shooting first is significant because it shows what a scoundrel he was in the beginning of the series.
I see.  So the importance stems from demonstrating his evolution as a person?
Correct.
Why did Lucas change it in the revamped editions of the movie?
The world may never know, to be honest.
