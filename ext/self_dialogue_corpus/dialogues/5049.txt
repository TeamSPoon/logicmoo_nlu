Have you recently viewed the NCAA Baseball Standings?
No, but last time I looked Mississippi State was ranked 11th.
Well, they are ranked 7th now, and TCU is ranked 6th.
I want to see Oregon State and Florida play, Oregon has a top pitching program, and Florida can really swing the bat.
Texas Tech has been a real turn out this year, getting help from the most unlikely of places.
I know, there line up is always full of surprises.
Did you see where Coach Casey of OSU got his 1,000th career win?
I did, against Oregon, for a moment there I thought Oregon was going to pull it out.
It is still unbelievable that Brent Rooker is hitting .885.
Yeah the pitching in college baseball is not as competitive at as the pros.
I guess not, because right behind that .885 average, Niko Hulszer is hitting .805 on the year.
I am sure the road Omaha is going to be a long journey for some teams.
There is always a major upset, I am curious to see who is going bust
It would not surprise me if LSU makes a late run and gets to Omaha this year.
That would surprise me.
What about Kentucky I know they have fallen in the polls, but all it takes is one good game to turn things around.
You know who has been out of the baseball talk for awhile, is Texas, back in the day they could really play some ball.
I Have not heard to much about them as of late, they are not even ranked in the top 25.
I guess it was time to pass the torch, and Texas Tech has taken full advantage.
This year will be interesting when regionals come to town.
