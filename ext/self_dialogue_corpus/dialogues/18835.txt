Coldplay, yes or no?
Yes. Definitely yes!
Yeah, I used to like them, but not so much anymore.
Are you kidding me. They still hold up really well.
Well I really liked some of there early work.
Like Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head?
Yes, those were some great albums. A lot of good hits.
Yes, agree, but what about Viva La Vida?
Yeah, that was a good album as well.
I confess it was a bit overplayed.
Well that's a good sign that they're not that great.
No, it means they have mass appeal.
Yeah I see your point.
Some of their songs fall flat, but it's hard to always have hits.
True. Very hard to maintain.
Did you ever see them in concert.
No, how about you.
Yes, it's a great show.
I guess I'll have to try and go to one. Put it on the bucket list.
Yes, for sure.
