Hey have you seen that King Arthur movie yet?
Yeah. I saw it last night and I thought it was not good.
Why do you say that?
It's definitely a mish mash of elements from other much better medieval fantasies and historical epics.
They just took bits and pieces from other similar movies and combined into this one? Is that what you are saying?
Do you remember those giant elephants in the Lord of The Rings movies?
How could I forget them? Especially when Legolas was riding one.
Eric Bana is the same fatherly face of love and heroism he was in Troy. Jude Law has that same calm evil vibe as Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus in Gladiator.
I thought it was actually an okay movie.
The whole film played like a montage.
Yeah, I felt that too.
Some of it wasn't bad, like how it showed Arthur growing up on the streets.
I find amazing how you and I saw the same movie but...
We both walked away with two different opinions about it?
Yeah.
I'm not. We all can't be the same or see the world through one set of eyes.
I guess you're right.
What did you think of the final fight?
I thought the final confrontation is basically a round of Mortal Kombat but they buggered up the fatality finisher.
Harsh.
