I'm struggling who to pick for my fantasy team.
At which position?
TE.  I don't know what to do.
How could you not go with Gronk?
Don't get me wrong, I want to choose him.
Okay, so what's the dilemma?
Even though he's the obvious best TE, I can't rely on him.
You mean health-wise?
Exactly.  He's the most imposing tight end in history, but can't stay on the field.
His injuries do scare me a bit.
If not for that, I would arguably take him in the first round as he piles up catches and TD's.
Are there any good alternatives?
Travis Kelce had a sneaky good year last year.
For the Chiefs, right?
Yep, he was a favorite target there.
The advantage to him is that he's not injury plagued.
Exactly.  That's what I need.
It would be a shame to draft Gronk and have his backup handle all the starts.
Yeah, I'm just conflicted.  I'll need to sleep on it to make a decision.
When in doubt, trust your heart.
