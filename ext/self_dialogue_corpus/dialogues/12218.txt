Are Star Wars movies just science fiction?
No, they have fantasy elements too. The Force is basically just magic.
That's what I thought, too. Yoda might as well be an elf.
Yoda's not an elf, though.
He's a pointy-eared wise, mystical person who lives in harmony with nature. If this were Lord of the Rings, he'd be an elf.
I never thought about it that way.
Obi-Wan Kenobi was originally inspired by a ronin samurai, too.
Jedi own their lightsabers like fantasy knights own swords.
So Star Wars seems like it's just as much a fantasy as a science-fiction movie.
I never thought about it that way. But you're right.
