What do you think of the campus radio station?
They're okay, but some of the music they play is pretty weird.
Weird how?
Like, it's so indie and obscure I've never heard of it. Or else it's really folk-pop.
Folk-pop? Give me an example.
You know what I mean. Like, Mumford and Sons.
I kind of like them.
They aren't bad, it's just a strange choice for the radio station.
Well, if you were the DJ here, what would you play.
Lots of classic rock! Led Zeppelin, that sort of thing.
I feel like people might also think that was a weird choice.
Why would they?
Well, this is a college radio station. I think they expect it to be a little fresh.
Fresh as in indie?
Fresh as in contemporary. You might be better off throwing in some pop.
Then I'm not sure that this is a job I want.
Luckily it's not one you have to do!
I guess I could be more flexible.
Let them play whatever they want, so long as people are enjoying it.
That seems like a nice philosophy.
