What did you think about that new Sampha album?
Process, right?
That's the one, man.
It's really good. But I'm not sure I like it as much as his work with SBTRKT.
I completely understand. SBTRKT and Sampha were made for eachother.
I wish they'd keep working together. Everything they do is gold.
Yeah, but at least we still have Sampha's voice. Nobody matches it.
Too true. Did you hear that collaboration with Solange? Cranes in the sky?
Perfect song. I didn't think I'd ever be into Solange, but I was wrong. I actually bought her album after hearing that song.
I have it, too. I would never tell anyone else this, but I like Solange better than Beyonce.
