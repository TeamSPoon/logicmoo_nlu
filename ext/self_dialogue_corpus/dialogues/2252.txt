Any teams you expect to surprise us this year?
The LA Rams. They will have a new coach this year.
Whoa, a new coach? What happened to Jeff Fisher?
He was fired, They were 31-45 in his time with them.
So who is his replacement, then?
Sean McVay, Hes only 30, making him youngest head coach in NFL history.
That is great. The Rams could benefit from the energy a young guy like him could bring.
That's what I'm hoping. Would be nice to see the Rams take their division.
They showed flashes of promise last year; hopefully this is the year they can get it all together.
I'd love to see Detroit do well, too.
As a Packers fan, I disagree, haha!
Ha! Seriously though, they've got a good team.
They do, and they've been a threat in that division at times over the years.
Yes. So it would be nice to see them pull it off.
It's such a tough division. Packers, Bears, Vikings, Lions.
Yeah, the Vikings are another team I'd love to see go all the way.
They deserve it. I really thought the first season they had with Favre they would pull it off.
That was a heartbreaking season to watch.
Painful that it ended on a Favre interception. He had been so amazing that year.
Yeah, funny how one of the best seasons of his career came with the Vikings and not the Packers!
