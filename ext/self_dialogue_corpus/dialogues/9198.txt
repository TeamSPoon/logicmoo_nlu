Who do you think created the rock music genre?
Most people feel like that Elvis created rock. But, I don't.
Why not?
I think that he represents the person who made rock popular. But, he definitely didn't invent it.
Well, who did then?
That's difficult to say. It has many influences.
Like what?
It's a combination of Rhythm & Blues and Country.
I see, but what person most represents that culmination?
I would say it's Fats Domino. He's an amazing pioneer for rock music.
