What do you think is the worst Star Wars movie?
The worst Star Wars movie, in my opinion, was Revenge of the Sith.
I would have to agree. Although that whole set of three Star Wars movies from that time was bad too.
Yea, I wasn't a fan of who they cast as the young Annakin and the teenage Annakin.
Yes! Hayden Christensen's acting was so bad, it was unbearable to watch sometimes.
And Jar Jar Binks...I mean come on. Seriously?
Such a stupid character right?!
I don't understand what they were thinking when they decided to create that character.
Probably wanted him as comedic relief...but that didn't really work.
Fail on their part.
