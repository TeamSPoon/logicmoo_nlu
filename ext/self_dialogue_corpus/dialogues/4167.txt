There was a thriller movie called Split that came out last year.  Did you get to see it?
No, I didn't get to see it yet.  I never seemed to have the time while it was out.
I haven't seen it yet either.  I wanted to go see it too. Who plays in it?
James McAvoy and Betty Buckley star in this thriller.
Also, I think the director is  M. Night Shyamalan.
He always does a beautiful job with his films.
I am a big fan of that director as well.
That one came out in what month?
January I believe is when it came out.
That one looks great.  I will rent it soon.
