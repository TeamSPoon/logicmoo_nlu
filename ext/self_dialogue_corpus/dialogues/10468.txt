I got 2 tickets to see Hello Dolly on June 21st for my birthday.
Really? Who gave them to you?
A former student of mine who's in the cast.
It's so nice when students remember us after all these years.
Yeah, he was a talented hard working kid.
Are they good seats?
Oh yeah, 7th row center orchestra.
Nice. Those are worth a fortune
For sure, but he gets comps.
Either way, what a great gift.
He knows Bette Midler is my favorite singer/actor of all time.
Everyone knows that.
David Hyde Pierce is playing Horace.
I remember him from the tv show Fraser.
Me too, but he's been a Broadway actor, singer for a long time.
What theatre is Hello Dolly playing in?
The Shubert, such a great theatre.
Agreed. The last musical we saw there was Matilda.
So, do we have a date to see Dolly?
Definitely. I can't wait.
