Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Princess Lea for sure.
As a person, she is hot, as a character, I'm not a fan.
Well who is yours then?
Jar Jar Binks.
Haha, you picked the most annoying character as your favorite?
Yea, that's exactly why I like him.
At least I chose a major character.
Who all she has going for her is her body!
And the fact she's been in the rebellion since she was born.
