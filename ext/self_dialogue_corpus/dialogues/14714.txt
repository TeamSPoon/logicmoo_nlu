i think, of all the genres, comedy changes the most, if you ask me.
Um, I don't think so. Sci Fi changes the most.
Oh, yeah, you're right. With all the effects and CGI and everything.
Yep, we can still laugh at comedies from the 70s. Sci fi from the 70s look silly.
Tell that to all the start trek fans.
Star trek is not merely a sci fi. It's a part of Americana.
Whatever. anyway. I think humor in the 70s were different from now. Look at Woody Allen's movies.
Well, that's not really representative of 70s comedy. That's just Woody Allen. And he's the one who set the standards for the romatic comedy genre
And I don't like romatic comedies. it's usually acted badly, even with famous comedians. Look at Billy Crystal movies. He has a weird awkward cadence.
And that will be the charm of Billy Crystal. he just acts that way. He talks that way in real life too. So it becomes believable.
