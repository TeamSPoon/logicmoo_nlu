Do you like fantasy movies?
Ehhh sometimes. Fantasy has different meanings to different people. What kind are you referring?
Sure sure i can see the confusion with the question. Let's see. How about Legend with Tom Cruise.
Okay now I feel your fantasy.
I loved Legend. How it was filmed,the story line and the best was Tim Curry as the Darkness.
Yes that costume was fabulous! The makeup superb and his whole everything brought it to life.
Oh I've got one. David Bowie in Labyrinth with Jennifer Connelly
That movie was so flippin' weird! Just like Bowie.
Yes his castle was so M.C. Escher I loved it.
That was pretty fun and trippy at the same time.
Those two movies came out within 1 yr of each other  around 1985 and 1986 i believe.
Hey I have another one. Willow with Val Kilmer.
Good call . Great movie. Val Kilmer is one of my favorite actors.
I agree. The Saint was definitely one of his best.
I loved all his disguises. That one character he played kind of reminded me of  Jerry lewis as the Nutty Professor
Ha Ha I know which one you mean. Elizabeth Shue was really good in that.
This so funny The movies we have been talking about could be a part of 6 degrees of separation game.
Hey I have got to go I just got a call from my husband. He needs a ride
Okay it was fun!
Catch you later.
