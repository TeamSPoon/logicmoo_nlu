You have to go see La La Land.
Been there, saw it.  It was great.
Yeah I've been a little in la la land since I saw it.
Ha ha. You liked it that much.
Its like a musical genre unto itself.  It amazes me frankly.
Well the director did a really good job I understand.  Young guy.
The music is what stands out to me best.  Really top notch.
What songs did you like?
That little opening number on the crowded freeway.  Plus the theme song.
I didn't know Ryan Gosling was a singer?
And he played piano in the film.  John Legend taught him.
You don't say?  That's something.
Ryan did his own stunts - dancing and piano.
Funny.  Emma Stone's a dancer?
Well she danced in the film.
But her acting made you cry.
Yep.  Like the scene when she went for an audition and they cut her off.
So sad.  But it must happen all the time.
Tough business.
Yeah but Emma won out in the end.
