Hey, did you see Get Out yet?
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
Me too, but it was kind of unexpected.
What do you mean?
Jordan Peele directed it, and all I know from him is the Key and Peele stuff.
Alright, but what was unexpected about it?
Well, I was expecting it to be a comedy.
Didn't you read any of the reviews about it or watch the trailer?
Yeah, but I still expected it to be a comedy haha.
I guess I can see why it caught you off guard then.
Haha, yeah it did but, it was definitely a good movie.
I really liked it.  What was your favorite part?
I think the whole reveal at the end.  I could really feel his pain when he realized what was happening.
I know for a fact I wouldn't get hypnotized by that crazy lady.
Right?  I guess he kind of got tricked into it though.
Yeah he did. Thinking about Jordan Peele, I really can't believe how well he portrayed all of the emotions the characters were feeling.
I think that was more on the actors, but I know what you mean.
Ok, it was both of them.
Does Peele have any more movies coming out?
I'm not sure, if I hear of any, I'll let you know.
