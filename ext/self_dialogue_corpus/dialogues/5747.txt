What's a good Disney movie to watch with my great nephew?
How about Cars?
That's a possibility. I think we have that one.
I like Lightning McQueen.
Me too. I don't remember it much either.
Yeah, it's been a while since I saw it.
Me too. My sons are in their twenties.
He will love Tow Mater too.
I know I liked him.
Me too.
