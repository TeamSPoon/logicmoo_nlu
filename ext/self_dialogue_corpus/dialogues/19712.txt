What do you think of 80s music?
You mean popular music of the 1980.?
Yes.
I don't really to it. Did that decade produce anything good?
I think music took a turn for the worse in the 80s, but there were a couple good bands.
Which ones were good?
Well, in the 80s you had The Police and U2. Those are two of the greatest rock bands of all time.
That's true. Those two bands are really great.
I was a fan of The Police in particular, but I couldn't get into the other music in the 80s. It was pretty much garbage.
Yeah, all that synth-rock and new wave stuff was kind of bad.
Right, but even worse was all the super corny hair bands.
Which ones do you mean in particular?
I'm talking about garbage like Van Halen, Motley Crew and Bon Jovi.
Oh right. That stuff is pretty aweful.
Sometimes it's fun to hear some New Wave punk like Devo or Flock of Seagulls, but only in small quantities.
I don't ever listen to 80s stations, so I don't really know.
You also had some super corny solo artists like Madonna, Boy George and such.
Right. I can't believe how popular that stuff became.
It boggles my mind at times.
No doubt.
