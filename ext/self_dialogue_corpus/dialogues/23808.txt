I watched this movie last night that was so bad, it was truly entertaining!
Really? Sounds interesting.
It was about a small group of high school kids. Well, mostly about to guys, but it included their other friends in it too.
Sounds like alot of other teen movies.
Yeah, but this one includes their search for alcohol.
There's something new. Teens and alcohol...how novel!
Hey, cut the sarcasm. This one was different!
You haven't convinced me yet.
Well, these two guys are interested in scoring points with a couple of girls...
Teen boys interested in teen girls...another first. What will they think f next, breaking the law?
Snot.
I was right wasn't I? They broke the law too?
Yes. They did.
Right. And they probably went to a big party where they embarrassed them selves in fron of the girls, too!
How do you know this stuff?
I am just brilliant.
Well, I am impressed. And I guess those things are common teen movie themes.
Yup.
Ok. I genuflect before you and acknowledge your awesomeness.
As you should. And your apartment mate told me you watched the movie "Superbad" last night!
