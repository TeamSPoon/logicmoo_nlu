What do you think is the Beatles best song?
I'd have to go with Come Together.
Great pick! Why do you think Come Together is their best song?
It has uniting message and a positive, upbeat tune. What are some of your favorite Beatles tunes?
Definitely Hello, Goodbye. I've loved it since I was a kid.
Oh yeah, Hello, Goodbye is great. Isn't it from a Beatles movie?
Yep, it is from the Beatles' magical Mystery Tour! Have you seen it?
I haven't. Is it good?
It is pretty good. It has other songs on it too like I Am the Walrus.
