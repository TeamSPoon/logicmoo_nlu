Do you think the Patriots will win the superbowl again this year?
I am not sure.
The Atlanta Falcons will want to win.
I can't believe they lost a 25 point lead.
Tom Brady is just a great quarterback.
Will Atlanta want revenge against New England?
They will want to win regardless of who they play.
We will have to see what happens.
Good point we don't know who will play in the Superbowl next year.
For all we know it could be two different teams.
How many more years do you think Tom Brady will play?
If it were up to him he would play forever.
Do you like him?
I think he is a good guy.
He is a nice guy and talented.
I just don't know if they will win it again next year.
We have to wait a long time to find out.
Well at least we can enjoy the summer air for now.
I agree the weather is to nice to stay inside watching sports.
Yeah let's go play football outside!
