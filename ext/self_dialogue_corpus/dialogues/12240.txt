Hey, do you want to see that upcoming Star Wars film?
The Last Jedi? Yeah, I'm quite excited about it, I am going to see it on opening day.
Me too. It looks do dark and interesting like the Empire Strikes Back. Do you feel the same way?
Yes, but I'm more interested in what they'll do with Luke Skywalker. We haven't seen him in over 20 years.
Yeah, I wish they had kept Han Solo alive long enough for him and Luke to meet again.
I agree, it would have been great to see Luke, Han, and Leia be with each other one more time.
I like the new characters too, though. I am quite partial to Kylo Ren.
I like Kylo also, and I like Finn as well. My favorite character is probably Rey though.
I thought they did a lot of good with Rey in The Force Awakens. I hope they continue with her in the new movie.
I can't wait to see all of our favorite characters together again in The Last Jedi.
