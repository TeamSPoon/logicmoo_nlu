I saw on Facebook that you watched Inside Out last night.
Oh yea. I loved it.
Yea me too. I think the message is so great. It's telling kids it's okay to be sad sometimes.
Yea definitely. It's going to be one of the first movies I watch with my kids for sure.
Yea. I just hope they don't confuse me with Bing Bong. We have the same taste in clothes.
I loved Bing Bong! You definitely dress like him.
I don't smell like cotton candy like him.
There's probably perfume that smells like that.
I loved Riley in the movie too.
Yea I wish I could play hockey like her. She was really cool.
