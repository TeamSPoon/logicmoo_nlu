I kind of feel bad for Johnny Depp.
Huh, why?
Because his movies haven't been doing so well lately.
What, the new Pirates movie? So what, it's just one film.
You know, that movie was supposed to come out in 2015, I think. It kept getting delayed.
Yeah, I heard about that. Production seemed pretty troubled.
That doesn't help, but it's not just that. His other movies have all seemed to do bad, too.
I can't think of any he's been in recently.
Besides the new Pirates movie, there was that Alice in Wonderland sequel. Huge bomb.
Oh man, I forgot that even existed!
There was also The Lone Ranger. Another huge bomb, even though it actually is a pretty good movie if I do say so.
Oh, you liked it? Maybe I'll check it out sometime.
Goodness were the critics ever to hard on that. It is a real joy.
That's high praise. I'll have to look into it.
Funny though, those are all Disney films. I wonder when Disney will cut Depp loose.
So he made a few bad movies. He'll bounce back.
Maybe, but even before this there was Transcendence and Dark Shadows. Not to mention that controversy regarding his personal life.
I see what you're saying. I'm still not convinced Disney will abandon him.
You're right, it'll probably come down to how well Pirates 5 does overseas.
Hehe. Yep, the foreign box office saves a lot of careers.
