What are you listening to?
I'm listening to one of my favorite bands, Faith No More
I remember those guys, they had that one song, Epic, right?
Yeah, but they had quite a few songs that sounded so different than that one. You should check out the rest of their stuff.
I honestly didn't recognize the band, they sound so different!
Their lead guitarist on the Real Thing left during the recording of Angel Dust, and Mike Patton is one of the most versatile singers out there.
He sounds a bit like Chris Cornell on this song.
Guys like Patton and Cornell have such a range, you never know what you're going to get out of them.
I bet, I don't hear too much variety on the radio nowadays.
You gotta know where to look, some stuff on the radio is fine but there's just a lot of packaged pop out there.
Yeah, even the dance music doesn't get my feet moving.
It seemed like that music's been in a decline since it fell out of favor in the late 90s.
It's made a comeback in recent years but just isn't as appealing.
I blame autotune, personally.
Autotune can make any one sound like they can sing.
Some of those rap artists use it, but they just way over do it. I imagine it can be helpful in some cases, but they should tune it down.
A lot of the rappers we grew up with didn't need it.
Yeah, they could rap and sing, they could have easily branched out into R&B.
I can sure go for some good old fashioned soul music right about now.
I can put on a good R&B station if you want me to.
