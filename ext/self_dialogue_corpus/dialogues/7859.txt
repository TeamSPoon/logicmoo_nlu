How did you get into watching the Harry Potter movies?
I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the ones that were out at the time and I was hooked!
Me too!  At the time, I think it was just the first two that were already out on dvd.  Of course when the others came to theaters, I went and saw them on day one!
Me too!  I now have them all on blu-ray which makes them even better!
Me too!  I'm actually sad that they have ended!  I loved how it ended though!  Lord Voldemort got his behind handed to him!
Yes he did!  The Deathly Hallows part two was definitely my all time favorite movie of the series!
Mine too!  They ended those movies so good!  Have you read any of the books?
I have!  Believe it or not, the books are even better!
I've heard that!  They say that about a lot of your book made movies.  They always say the books are better.
They really are especially in the case of the Harry Potter books.  There is so much more going on in them.
