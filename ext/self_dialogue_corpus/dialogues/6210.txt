Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes, I saw it in the theater.
I thought it was very good.  What about you?
I really like Emma Watson and Josh Gad.  I also thought the singing was pretty good.
I read one review where he said Emma Watson wasn't a strong enough singer.  That didn't bother me at all.
I think her singing was just fine.  She is a very good actor.
I thought the Beast looked really cool.
They did a great job of making him look real.
Overall, I give it 7 out of 10.
That sounds about right.  I thought it was really good, but nothing great.
