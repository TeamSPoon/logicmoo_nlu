You know what's really messed up?
What's that?
In Revenge of the Sith where Anakin kills the children.
Oh yeah!  That was super messed up.
It was a pretty shocking scene to even film.
Right.  Even though it doesn't show it, that was his true scene to show he was evil.
I remember the theater freaked out about it.  Some people walked out.
No one did in mind, they were just stunned.
Just thinking about it makes me feel that Anakin got what he deserved.
He most certainly did.
