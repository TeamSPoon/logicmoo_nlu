Do you have a favorite Harry Potter character?
Ginny Weasley, definitely.
Really? I didn't feel like she did anything at all in the movies!
Maybe not in the movies, but in the books she's a hilarious character.
I can't picture that at all.
She's also a great Quidditch player, but they don't show her playing Quidditch at all in the movies.
I didn't even know that she played Quidditch!
Absolutely she did! After Hogwarts, she even went on to play Quidditch professionally!
Wow, what position did she play?
Ginny was a Chaser, I believe.
