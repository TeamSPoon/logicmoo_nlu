How did you like dipset in the early 2000s?
I think they were great, that was the time of hiphop groups.
Yes, that is when dblock, gunit, and dipset was the best out.
Those were the days of pure hip hop.
Right now unfortunately we do not have any hip-hop groups that I can think of.
True, we have individual rappers on the same label that is about it.
I really liked the nice beats that dipset had.
I did too, they were some of the best instrumentals of all time.
I think that DJ's name was Kanye West, he made a lot of good beats
Kanye West has been great for a long time I guess.
