So you know, Greedo shot first.
Um, says you?
Come on.
No really. The original Star Wars trilogy, without the new special edition, is what counts. And Han Solo clearly shot first
The THX remastered version?
Yes, that is the definitive account of Star Wars. Nothing else matters. No CGI'd aliens, not Jar Jar Binks, none of it.
OK, but doesn't that make Han kind of a scoundrel?`
Of course it does. That's what Han is. That's why it's significant that he later finds the good inside and helps the rebellion.
Man, you really take this stuff seriously.
What can I say? I'm a Star Wars purist.
