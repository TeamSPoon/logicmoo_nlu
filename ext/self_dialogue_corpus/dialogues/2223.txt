I'm really excited about the upcoming season for the Detroit Lions?
Really, why is that?
Well, the polls show that 64% of the people think that the Lions will win the North this season!
So, who came in second?
Well, the Packers came in second and then the Vikings were third.
That doesn't really mean that the Lions will win, though
That is true, but they have had a losing streak for so long that it COULD happen.
Could and should aren't necessarily the same.
The Lions nearly beat the Packers last year, so that's a good sign.
Well, "Almost" and "Nearly" are only good in horse shoes and hand grenades.
Oh, I don't know about that.  Practice and the will to win factor in, too.
Well, if you look at their past, the Packers have at least had 3 championships in the last 60 years
True, but Drew Stanton seems to have a good head on his shoulders
Yes, but one person can't hold up the whole team.
Well, let's hope that the coaching and the team finally have a chance to gel. 60 years is a huge drought.  We need some rain.
Well, even a sprinkle will help.
In the meantime, I'll continue to go to the games.
Yes, at least the food and drink are good at Ford Field.
So, let's get some tickets for next fall?
Sure, but you're buying!
