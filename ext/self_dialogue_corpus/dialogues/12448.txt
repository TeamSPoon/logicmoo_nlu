What do you think the theme is of Star Wars?
Its theme? I guess it would be a morality tale - you know, do the right thing.
But Anakin attempts to do the right thing, and it leads to his downfall.
He does it in a selfish way, and he gives in to anger.
So you're saying its theme is telling you how to be a good person?
I guess so. Yoda tells Luke, for example, not to give in to anger and hatred.
He says the same thing in the prequels. He says anger leads to hate, which leads to suffering.
The prequels weren't nearly as well written, though.
Do you think the new trilogy, starting with The Force Awakens, will follow up with that?
It might, but I think it might be better if it finds something new to say.
