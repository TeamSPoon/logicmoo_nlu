Have you heard the new Radiohead?
I have seen videos for some of the songs.
Oh, what videos?
I just watched Man of War about an hour ago.
Well, was it any good?
The song and the video were really cool.
I think their sound is a lot more mellow than it used to be.
Yeah, there is a kind of dreamy ambience of you compare Daydreaming to Paranoid Android.
At least no one is saying Muse sounds like them anymore.
No, now Muse sounds like Queen!
