Hey do you like rap or hip-hop music? Who do you like?
Actually there are no particular artists, I kinda listen to whatever comes on the radio, but back in the 80s and 90s I like folks like Bel Biv Devoe, Snoop Doggy Dog.
Oh cool. I listen to various artists too. I like 50 Cent myself.
Oh yeah, 50 Cent! I particularly like his HIT song. I don't remember the title but the lyric was something like go shorty it's your birthday, something something.
I think it was called In Da Club.
That's right! It was a really nice dance rap song.
I remember during a party I went to, the moment that song went on, literally people jumped out of their seats and started going to the dance floor!
If I'm not mistaken Fiddy was managed or at least frieends with Eminem or something.
Yeah that could be. I think Eminem helped with one of his songs.
Cool. I like it to see different singers and rappers actually collaborating with eath other.
