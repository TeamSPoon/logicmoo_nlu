Do you like Maroon 5?
Yes I love them.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
Moves like Jagger.
I remember when I first heard that song I was at a party and man did that make people dance.
Yep it does that well people go wild.
The whistling at the start really set's the stage for the rest of the song.
It's an instrumental song that is just out of this world.
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right was the moment I loved the song.
That's right off the bat.
Yes it is.
The beat of the song is great too, it's so catchy.
I must have sung that song for a month.
Me too.
My co-workers would always just bust out dancing in the middle of our work.
Mine just would sing along.
I wonder if they'll have a song that beats this one some day.
Hard to beat but they have some good ones, like any others?
Don't wanna move was good too.
I agree.
