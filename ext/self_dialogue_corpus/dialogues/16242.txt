My friend played me this crazy tuba piece today!
They're all crazy. That or just transcriptions of vocal music.
Really?
Yeah, original tuba music didn't come out until the 1950s or so.
Interesting.
Yeah, it wasn't respected as a solo instrument. So what was the piece?
I don't know what it's called, but he could sing and play at the same time.
Cool! Multiphonics!
Can you do it?
Yes, but not very well. You learn to vibrate your vocal chords and lips at the same time.
This was like a beatboxing tuba.
Fnugg?
That sounds right, I think.
Yeah, Fnugg is what you're thinking of. The tuba player is from Scandanavia.
Is he famous?
I'm not sure if he's famous for being a tubist, or for being a multiphonics-beatboxing tuba.
He should be on America's got talent.
I'll let him know!
You know him?
Of course not, silly. Good thought, though.
