Did you see the Dirty Dancing remake on tv last night?
Yes, I watched it with my mom. She said the original was much better.
You never saw the original movie with Patrick Swayze?
No, I never watched it.
Well, you should check it out sometime. It's a great movie.
Does it have a lot of singing? I wasn't crazy about all the singing in the new version.
There is music, but it's not a musical like the tv version. It was more just music throughout the movie and dancing scenes.
Well that makes sense. I kind of liked the dancing scenes. The choreography was pretty good.
The choreography in the original version was pretty good too. I guess it was more risky for that time period.
Oh, like really dirty dancing?
It wasn't that dirty to me. Looking back on it now, it's more dirty because of the age difference.
Well Baby was still in high school right?
I think she was supposed to be about 16.
That does make it kind of dirty. She should have fallen for someone closer to her age.
It's a love story. He taught her to dance and helped her grow up.
Girls in these types of movies always fall for the bad boys.
He wasn't really a bad boy. He wasn't the one who got the girl pregnant.
Yeah, he was kind of a good guy. Anyway, how did you like the movie?
I didn't really like the changes they made. Why do people have to do so many remakes and ruin them?
I don't know. Stop messing with the classics, right?
