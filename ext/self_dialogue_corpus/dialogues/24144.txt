Did you watch the Assasins Creed movie?
I didnt catch that one, I used to play que video game though.
I used to play it as well and I think the movie wasnt as good.
Yeah I can imagine, its a long game and its hard to summarize it in a few hours.
Yeah it is, I had high hopes for the movie but still, you should watch it.
I think I might, so what other movies can you recommend me?
Well I just watched Lego Batman and thought it was pretty good.
Yeah? I never liked those lego movies but I think I can give it a try.
You should, and what about you is there a movie you an recomend me?
Did you happen to watch Logan?
No, I didnt was it good?
Yes I liked it and think its a must see.
I wanted to watch it I think its going to be interesting the combination with Deadpool.
I know I want to watch them together as well.
Do you know when this is happening?
Im not sure although I hope to see Logan in the second part of Deadpool.
I liked the first part a lot but think its still going to be a while before we see them together.
Yeah I think so too, but its going to be worth the wait.
Yeah, it will be, well you let me know if you watch any of those movies.
Ok I will and you should really watch Logan.
