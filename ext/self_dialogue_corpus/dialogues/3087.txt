What do you think is the hardest position in the NFL?
I think field goal kicking would be hard.
That is true.
The skill is not the hardest.
No it is not.
But the pressure they face would be overwhelming.
Agreed.
What do you think is the hardest position.
I think quarter back.
That is a typical pick.
Think about the quarter backs in the league.  They have to be smart and athletic.
Yeah.  The Rogers and Brady's of the world are both.
Think about Russel Wilson.  Very smart and very athletic.
That is true.
It takes a special type of person to play that position.
It does.
Probably why they are paid so well.
It is a little outrageous what they make.
But it is fun to watch them compete.
Best sport in the world to watch.
