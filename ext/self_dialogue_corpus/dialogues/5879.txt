I think it's so strange that Star Wars movies are considered Disney movies now.
I agree. I think Star Wars should be its own thing.
I know! I just associate Disney movies with kids.
Yeah, Star Wars movies are more for adults. I guess kids like them too though.
Most of the Star Wars movies these days are rated PG-13.
I think they're geared more towards teenagers and adults then with that rating.
Yeah, I never associated Disney movies with movies for teenagers and adults.
Maybe Disney is going in a new direction.
Maybe they are. I guess the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies are geared towards teens and adults.
True, but I'm still not quite sure what to think.
