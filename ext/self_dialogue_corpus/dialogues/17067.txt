Can you give me a good Demis Roussos song to listen to?
From Aphrodite's Child, or solo?
Solo
Forever and Ever
Is that a love song?
Yes. He mostly did love songs
What is another one>
We Shall Dance
I wanna hear it.
I don't blame you. He has a good voice
Does he still perform?
No, sadly
I heard Rain and Tears online once. It was very good.
That was an Aphrodite's Child song
Really?
Yes, but he performed it solo too
Cool. I love the classical feel it has.
A lot of his stuff feels like classical music
Can you name me another good song of his?
Yes there is one called "Before" that is great.
