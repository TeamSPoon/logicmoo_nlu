Have you heard of Kenny G?
Yes. He is very popular and famous!
I have been listening to his music since I was a little girl in the 1980s.
He started playing the saxophone when he was ten years old.
Wow! He went to college to major in accounting.
I am glad he is not doing accounting. He is an awesome saxophonist!
He has worked with Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle.
I like the song called songbird.
Me too. That's one of my favorites.
His album called breathless was the bestselling instrumental album ever. I bought a copy.
Me too! I love it!
He is in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest note with a saxophone!
I saw him play that long note in a concert he did that was on television last week. It felt like forever for him to stop playing that note!
I saw that too! It was quite long.
I really love his holiday album. It's called Faith.
Yeah. I like the Auld Lang Syne song.
Me too! It sounds great when he plays it.
He had the bestselling holiday album in 1999.
I believe it. He is awesome!
We must see him in concert. I will look for the next show!
