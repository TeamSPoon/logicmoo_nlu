Hey man, what's up?
Not too much, what are you up to?
Just looking at all the new movies coming out, these next few years are going to be awesome!
I haven't really looked, what good ones are coming out?
Well, to start, Justice League is going to be out this year and it's going to be amazing.
Who's all going to be in that one?
Wonder woman, the guy who played Khal Drogo is playing aquaman, the flash, and a few others.
That does sound awesome.  Anything else?
Black panther, man, it looks so good.
I saw the trailer for that one, it does look awesome.
Yeah it does.  Besides super hero movies, Valerian looks good.
Is that the one with Cara Delevingne?
Yeah, I think it has the most potential besides Marvel or DC movies.
I'll have to watch the trailer for it, I don't know too much about it.
Do it. But back to movies coming out, not only is aquaman going to be in Justice League, he's got his own movie coming out in 2018!
Really? That's awesome
Yeah man, so many good ones coming out in 2018, Tomb Raider, a new avengers, a new Deadpool, I'm going to be broke.
Haha, they should have a pass you can buy to go to a new movie every week.
I think they do have something like that actually.
You'll have to get it!
