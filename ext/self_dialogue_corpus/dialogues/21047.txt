Do you think moonlight should have won best picture?
I do and I don't.I really liked LA LA LAND, I was so horrified by the mix up. It took away from Moonlight's win.
Yes it was unfortunate for sure. But did you think moonlight was the better film?
Like I said I am torn, they are so different.  I thought moonlight had some strong performances and was great to see a small movie get recognition.
I also liked a smaller budget film getting credit. but am not sure it was truly a better film overall. Much more serious / darker subject matter.
Moonlight definitely showcased a more taboo subject matter. So maybe to me wins over the lighter la la land.
Interesting. I felt la la land, had funny moments, but I was also in tears in the theater. I think the academy tends to award drama more.
Probably true, more drama winners than comedies. Both were great films win or loose. Or even if they never got nominated.
Agreed. You know what film got snubbed in my mind?
What? So hard to guess..
Arrival.  I think it was deserving of many more nominations. did you see it?
Yes I did see it. I liked it a lot. Amy Adams was snubbed for sure, she deserved at least a nomination.
For sure. her performance was so believable. She stole the movie. I can't believe she was not recognized.
I suppose they can't nominate everyone.
But Adams really was overlooked big time, she deserved it.
More than Viola Davis or Emma stone?
No I am not saying that they did both also deserve their nominations. Just felt Amy was overlooked for Arrival.
Fair enough. She has been great in a lot of movies. Did you see doubt or the fighter?
Yes, loved her performance in both .
She is a strong actress.
