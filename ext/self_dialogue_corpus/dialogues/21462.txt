What movies are you looking forward to this year?
I'm really excited about that new Spider-Man movie.
I thought you hated the Spider-Man movies.
Yes, I did because of all the constant reboots.
Yea that was getting pretty annoying.
Seriously, I don't need a new actor playing Spiderman every year.
I can see how that would upset you, so what's different now?
It seems like they are actually trying to tie Spiderman into the Marvel Universe now.
What does that mean?
Well, before the movie-studio owned the rights to Spiderman.
Why does that matter.
Because you had all the Marvel characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Thor and whatnot in a completely different box than Spiderman, even though they weren't supposed to be.
So what's changed?
Now Marvel has the rights to Spiderman back so he can be put in all the Marvel Movies.
Oh, you mean like how he was in Captain America Civil War?
Exactly, now he's part of the entire cast.
So that makes you more likely to see it?
Absolutely, knowing that's my spiderman from here on out makes it much more enjoyable.
I guess that makes sense.
All I want is a little continuity, that isn't such a huge request.
