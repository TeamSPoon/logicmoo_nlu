Have you seen the newest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie yet?
No, not yet. Have You?
Yeah, I did and I was a little disappointed.
Why? Was it the acting?
No the acting was fine.  Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were great, as usual.
Why didn't you like it then?
I just thought the story line was a little dry. Maybe there are just too many Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
Yeah, I can understand that. I read a review that said it was a waste of time and money.
I wouldn't go that far, but it is definitely not as good as the previous movies in the series.
How is the cinematography?
The scenes are a little dark, but it is not bad.
Well that's good then. What is the story line for this movie?
It's really similar to the first one.  A young couple is looking for a valuable object, Capt. Jack helps, and they encounter enemies, like the British Navy and Barbossa.
Yeah that sounds really similar to the first one.
Yeah and there's a secret ending after the credits, so there is probably going to be another one.
What is the secret ending?
It's a couple lying on sheets.
Who is the couple?
I won't tell you so I don't spoil it, but you can go see for yourself.
Yeah I might do that.
