What do you think of the new Foo Fighters song?
Do you mean Run?
Yes that's the one, it's been on the radio a bit.
It is great, it's such a powerful rock song.
I agree, I think they really went back to their earlier sound.
I know, I was kind of tired of their softer sound from the last couple of albums.
Have you seen the video for it?
No, is it good?
It's fantastic, it takes place in a old folks home and they're all dressed as old men.
Haha, that sounds hilarious, I will definitely check it out.
You should, it is funny and really well produced.
Do you know when the new album is coming out?
It should be this fall I beleive.
Do you know what it is called?
Concrete and Gold. They have a tour starting too to promote it.
Really, we should go see them!
I agree, have you ever seen the foo fighters in concert?
Just once, when the opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers
Oh yeah I remember that.
It was a great show, one of the best!
