What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?
Well, they were OK.  Not great, but they are better when you watch them a second time.
They're better when you watch them at home for free and not having to wait in line to be disasppointed.
Totally!  I liked Revenge of the Sith!
I did too. I also really liked Natalie Portman.
I agree.  I feel like the female charcters in the movies are some of the best.
Yeah, it was kinda awesome for Princes Leia to grow up to be a general.
And not just following around Hans Solo.
Are you looking forward to the new movie?
Yes.  I hope there will be ewoks.
