Did you read the news about Michael Vick?
No, what happened to him this time?
He actually has been entered into Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.
I forgot that he helped Virginia Tech to the 2000 national title game.
Yes, he was brought good public attention to Virginia Tech for the years that he was there.
He finished 3rd in the 1999 Heisman Trophy voting.
And... was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft as he left Virginia Tech after the 2000 season.
Yes, he was doing really well until it was determined that he was heavy into betting on dog fighting.
That was so disappointing to learn about.  Just tragic for everyone involved.
A lot of those dogs he abused have been rehabilitated and adopted out.
I think he did pay for a lot of that or was required to pay for it.
Did he serve time in prison for his involvement?
Yes, he did -- deservedly so.  It was awful what he did to those dogs, let alone how illegal it all was.
It is a shame, because before that he was really having a great football career.
I know he holds NFL records for rushing yards for a quarterback.
Did you realize he played 13 seasons in the NFL with four different teams.
It might seem that that is a lot of moving around, but I guess it is quite common place for a talented quarterback.
I remember him with the Steelers, Jets, and Falcons.
He announced his retirement officially this past February 2017.
I read where he retired as an Atlanta Falcon.  We'll see what happens next for him.
