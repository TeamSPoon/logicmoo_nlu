I am excited for the next Star Wars movie. Do you think Luke is the last Jedi from the title?
Jedi could also be plural and could be referring to several characters.
True, I hadn't thought of that. I hope we will find out who Snoke is.
I think it would be funny if it turned out Snoke was really tiny in real life and his giant hologram was just him compensating for that.
Yeah, we'll see. I do have a lot of faith in the director Rian Johnson that he made a good movie.
I liked The Force Awakens but I felt it stuck a little too close to the old Star Wars formulas. I hope the next one has more surprises and fewer Death Stars.
It will also be sad to see Carrie Fisher on screen after her death.
Apparently she wanted Princess Leia to be featured in the 9th movie so it's a shame she didn't get to see that happen.
It is amazing we will be getting new Star Wars movies each year for the foreseeable future.
You said it. I never would have imagined this a few years ago when George Lucas was in charge.
