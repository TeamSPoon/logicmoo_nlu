injury, trash talking, the usual.
have you played basketball lately?
yes, I went to the court the other day.
were you with anyone else?

I was thinking of setting up pick up games
that sounds like a good idea
when are you free?
I am free most nights
what about weekends?
I am free on the weekends too
so then let's set up weekend pick up games.
like five on five?
yeah, that works.
