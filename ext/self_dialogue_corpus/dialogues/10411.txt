Hello, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
Yes, I am new here--I just got in yesterday.
How cool! Where from?
Oh, just about everywhere. I'm an army brat, so.
Ah, I see. So've you done anything fun yet?
I got tickets to an Ed Sheeran concert, so that is exciting!
No kidding, I love him!
You do? Me too!
I mean, I figured you did since you got tickets for it.
That is true, that is true.
So how long have you been a fan?
Ever since his first album, +
Is that really what it's called? I know the second one was x.
Yes, and his most recent album is a Divide symbol. They are all math.
That's a curious method.
I don't actually know why he does it like that.
Well, I can't help you there, I mostly know him from his singles.
Which one is your favourite?
I really love Castle on the Hill personally.
That one is great! My favourite is Photograph.
