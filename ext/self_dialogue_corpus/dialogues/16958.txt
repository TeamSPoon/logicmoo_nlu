How many concerts have you been to?
One. My older brother took me to one while we were in Arizona.
Only one concert your entire life?
I know. It's embarrassing.
Who did you see? Yanni?
No. I'm proud to say, the one Concert I saw was a good one.
Oh. This should be good. Who was it?
Clapton.
Seriously?
Yep.
Gotta admit, if you're gonna see only one concert, that was a good choice. So who would you like to see in concert?
There are a bunch of them. Toby Keith, Garth Brooks.
Country sucks!
I'd like to see Fleetwood Mac but with Stevie and Lindsey.
Picky much?
Hey, that's the music I like.
Who else?
I'm beginning to think I'll never get the chance but I'd like to see Billy Joel and Elton John.
They are getting older.
All the great ones are.
