did you see pokemon 4
the one with celebi right?
yeah, from like 2006 or something
its been over 10 years.
thats a crazy thing.
i liked the movie though.
celebi is such a cute little pokemon
but it has such a powerful power
it can travel through time
celebi is considered a fairy type
makes some sense to be honest
remember that villain in the movie
that masked marauder guy?
yeah, he was an annaoying character
yeah i liked team rocket better
the movie got bad reviews though
really? i thought it was okay
the animation was pretty good
the landscapes were nice
they were
