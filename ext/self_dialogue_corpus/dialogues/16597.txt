Have you heard the new album from Tech N9ne?
Which one? The album from December?
No. He relased a new one last month.
I haven't heard it. Hopefully it is better than The Storm.
It is. There are a lot of featured artists on the album.
Great. I'll listen to it tonight.
What album is your favorite?
I usually listen to Absolute Power, and more of his old music.
I agree, the tune has changed a lot with his more recent work.
The Storm was not a great album. That is probably why I did not know a new one was out.
Yep, I only made it through one listen of that album.
Do you prefer his old music as well?
Yes, although my favorite album has to be All 6's and 7's.
Wow, I forgot about that one.
The featured artists on that album were amazing.
I know. And the album had at least 20 songs!
I hope he goes back to his roots in some of his future work.
I hope so too. I am not sure which direction he is taking his music.
I'll keep an eye out for the next release.
Me too! Fingers crossed!
