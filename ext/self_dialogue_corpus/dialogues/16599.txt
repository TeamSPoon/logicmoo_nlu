I love her song stay. It's so powerful
It has a great message.  I like the stuck like glue song, it's so upbeat and cheerful.
I like that one too
I just listened to Celine dione song, how does a moment last forever, that she recorded for Beauty and the Beast.
Oh I bet that was pretty.
It was a beautiful, you should Google it, if you like that like that.
I do, and I love Celine dion .
Shes great.
She is, she's such a powerful singer and her voice is amazing.
I guess that's why all the movies want her to record for them.
They see her talent.  The titanic song was absolutely amazing.
It was she's just a beautiful singer, every thing she sings is great.
Another great female voice I love is Christina Aguilera
