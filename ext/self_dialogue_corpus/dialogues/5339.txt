Oh my god the first 15 minutes of UP is the most emotional I've ever been watching a Disney movie.
Yeah Ellie and Carl's relationship was just the best.
You know they should make a prequel to up that showcased Ellie and Carl's adventures when they were growing up.
I mean they kind of alluded to that and they actually did show a little bit.
Yeah but I could watch a whole movie about it!
Wouldn't it change your perspective now that you know that Charles Muntz is the bad guy?
Hmmm, maybe it would a little but I bet that Disney could find a way around that.
I think I'd like to see a sequel but with Russell as the father and he has a child of his own now.
They should make the child a little girl!
Yeah that'd be cool! And they could flashback to lessons and memories that he had with Carl.
