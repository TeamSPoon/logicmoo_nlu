Do you listen to the radio anymore?
Sort of.
What do you mean by that?
I listen to satellite radio.
Do they have a better selection of music?
There are no ads played.
Do they have diverse stations?
Yeah I mean you can find whatever genre you like.
What about a mix?
They have some stations that concentrate strictly on top 40.
So music is going more the satellite route?
I wouldnt say that I would say its going that way because of the lack of ads.
Do you ever listen to terrestrial radio?
Not for music.
Music used to be the one thing I loved about radio.
Same here for the most part.
Not it seems like you can just shazaam something at it will come up.
That helps with music.
How so?
It can help you discover the artists that youve never heard
