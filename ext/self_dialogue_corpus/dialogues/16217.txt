What are your thoughts on newer artists producing songs that pull of of older one?
What do you mean?
For example, the song Bad Things is clearly inspired by Out of My Head from the 80s.
Oh, like that. You mean how Ghetto Superstar was basically Islands in the Stream.
Right.
I don't know. I guess I don't dislike it, but I hate when I can't figure out what the older song is.
That's true. It drives me crazy.
It seems to be a working formula though.
How so?
Well, it seems like all the songs that pull off of older ones end up doing really well.
Why do you think that is?
I think people like the new twist on older classics.
At least it isn't a complete remake.
You don't like remakes?
I don't know, I guess they are okay.
Well some remakes end up bigger than the original?
Like what?
I Will Always Love You for example.
Who remade it that's bigger than Whitney?
See you proved my point! Dolly Parton was actually the original singer.
