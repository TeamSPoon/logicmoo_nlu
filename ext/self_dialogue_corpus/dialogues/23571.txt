Did you see Suicide Squad?
I didn't think I would, but I did.
Yeah I saw it too, but on dvd.  What did you think?
First of all I don't like the title.
I know what you mean.  But its about superheroes.
More like anti-heroes.
Totally.
Some of those characters freaked me out.
Which?
The fire guy? And the crocodile guy.
Kind of strange I grant you.
Overall it was a fun movie.
Not as bad as they were saying.
I enjoyed it.
Who were your favorites then?
The Joker and Harley Quinn were a little bit funny together.
Jared Leto and Margot Robbie?
Right. They did a good job.
All those DC characters were just a tad different.
It made the movie unique.
