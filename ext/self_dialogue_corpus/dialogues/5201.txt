So what was the weirdest Disney movie?
Oh definitely Pinocchio.
What's your case?
Well, Geppetto. Why does he want a real boy so terribly bad - that's a bid odd.
Very true. What else.
Well, the fact that a cricket was enlisted to be the conscience for the puppet.
Yeah, who ever came up with that?
Heh someone highly imaginative.
Clearly. I'd say it was a good film though - one of the classics.
No doubt. It just had some bizarre elements.
