Do you remember The Sword and the Stone?
I remember seeing it when I was young.
Did you realize how old it was?
I was figuring it was from the 70s.  Is that right?
It was released in the early 60s!
Oh, that must have been why my mom liked watching it with me.
Yeah, she probably watched it when she was a kid.
Probably so, and they didn't have VCRs so I bet she hadn't seen it in years.
Probably not.  And then with VCRs we were watching things from the 60s.
Yeah, and even earlier.
