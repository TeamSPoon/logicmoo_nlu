Did you ever see the Ring?
That movie freaked me out a little when it came out.
Everyone was really first getting their cell phones and didn't want to answer them.
Oh, I remember.  I remember finding out my brother was watching the movie.
Did you call him right after?
Yes.  It was so funny!
I bet he freaked out!
Yeah, he did!  He thought he was getting a call because he watched the movie.
I bet there were a lot of people doing that around the country.
Oh, I bet.
