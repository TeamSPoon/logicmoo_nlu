What do you see the Lakers doing to get George?
I still don't see it happening, they are bad...really bad and would still have to trade something of value.
Do you think the Lakers become a contender with George?
No way- they still don't have enough.
Who do you pick....Warriors or Cavs.
Cavs in 6, the warriors will put up a fight but it still won't be enough.
Where do you see Blake Griffin going?
I would love to see him in New Orleans.
What about Hayword?
I want him in New Orleans too, either one would be fine with me.
Durant is also a free agent.
Yeah, but he isn't going anywhere and I see him retiring as a Warrior.
Who is the best pure shooter in the NBA?
Thats easy: Curry.
I  think the best fit for Griffin would be the Thunder.
Oh man, they would instantly become a favorite to win the west.
In their prime who would you pick Paul or Stockton?
Paul just because I feel as though he's a better shooter.
How old is Paul Milsaps?
32
