A really great romantic movie is White Palace.
I think I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.  Who's in it?
James Spader and Susan Sarandon are the stars of it.
That's interesting.  What's the movie about.
It's a romance between a younger man and an older woman.
You don't see many movies with that plot.
Yeah, it's usually the other way around.
I like the idea, but is the script good?
It's well-written.  I found it thoughtful.
That's an asset.  I like movies with depth.
I do, too.  It kept me interested.
What's Spader's performance like?
He's really excellent.  It's a complicated character and he does a wonderful job.
It sounds good.  When was it made?
It was made in the early '90s.
I'm a fan of films from that time period.
Yes, and it's based on a book.
Is it a good adaptation.
Yes, it's a little different from the book.  I think it's adapted well, though.
Well, I like Spader's work, and the plot sound intriguing.
