Do you like Disney movies.
No.
What do you mean?!
I think Disney is an evil corporation.
True enough, but they make a lot of good films.
Name one.
Star Wars.
They didn't make those.
The last one, they did. And the next one coming out.
Shut up!
It's true. Lucas sold the rights to Disney.
Why in the world would he do that.
He likes money, and he can't make good movies anymore.
Ha! Time does a terrible thing to those Hollywood folk!
You said it brother!.
OK. Disney isn't all bad.
I'm a Walt Disney fan.
He did make some incredible animated movies.
I wish they would do some more.
Yeah, get away from all that CGI stuff.
