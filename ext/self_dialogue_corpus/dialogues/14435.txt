Did you watch the Cavaliers and Celtics game on Friday night?
For a while.  But it was so uncompetitive I eventually turned it off.
Me too.  I can't believe how one-sided it is.
I know Lebron is unstoppable and all, but the Celtics are supposed to be the number one team in the East and lost by almost 50 points at home!
Yeah, it's incredible.  And now with Isaiah Thomas out it could be even worse the rest of the way.
Please no!  Maybe they'll figure out a way to pull things together and make the next couple games interesting.
I hope so but wouldn't count on it.  You know uncertainty is the only certainty in sports but I think this has 4-0 sweep written all over it.
You're probably right.  It's the same thing with the Warriors and Spurs.
Yeah, the radio guys have been saying 'Why even play these other games?'  Just have the Warriors and Cavs play a best of 11 series or something.
Ha!  That would be good and what everyone really wants to see!
I really wish Kawhi Leonard hadn't gotten hurt.  They could have made it a series.
I agree, I don't know why everyone had the Spurs such a big underdog.
Well, it's not quite the same Spurs team from a few years ago.  But it's still the Spurs!
If Kawhi and Parker were both playing, it could have been really interesting.
Oh well!  What's your prediction for the Finals?
I think Cleveland wins in six.
Really?  I disagree.  This is a revenge year for the Warriors!
Maybe.  But Lebron is just too tough right now and Steph and Durant don't seem to play that well against him.
Yeah, but the Warriors had it won last year if it hadn't been for Draymond getting suspended and now have Durant too! I say Warriors win in six.
Well, I guess we'll find out soon enough.  Go Cavs!
