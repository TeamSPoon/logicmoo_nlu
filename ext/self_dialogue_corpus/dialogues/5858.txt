What folktale do you think Disney's going to go for next?
What do you mean?
Well, they just did Moana...
Hey, it's not all folktales, you know? Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia were classic books.
True, true. Still, sometimes it seems like the reason they're redoing them in live action is that they've run out of ideas.
No, they haven't. They've just been doing other things, like Born In China.
Right, their environmental things. They're alright.
I love seeing those baby animals!
It's kind of interesting how people and animals are so similar.
We are animals, technically.
