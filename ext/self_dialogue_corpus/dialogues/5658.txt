Over the years, what has bene your favorite Disney franchise?
Iâ€™d have to say, Toy Story. Even as a grown adult, there is just something about those movies that are very charming.
Do you think any part of it has to do with the nostalgic factor?
Perhaps a little bit, yes. That being said, I just think they are good movies, overall.
I certainly see your point. Not only is the CGI on point, but I also love the voice cast and the story.
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have great chemistry, also, in my opinion.
I second that point, too. What was your favorite movie out of the three so far?
Definitely, the first. The second was great, but I still think the original was the best.
I agree. I just think the flow of the first movie was the best, too.
That being said, Toy Story was just a very well-done set of movies.
