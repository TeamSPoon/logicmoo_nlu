I was just thinking about the music from when we were in high school.
Yeah that was the best era for music.
We would listen to the radio while we did our homework.
Right, but couldn't concentrate much with the Temptations blasting on the radio.
I would wind up singing My Girl instead of doing my history homework.
HAHA who could concentrate on history when Mary Wells was singing The One Who Really Loves You.
Or Smoky and the Miracles doing Shop Around.
Or the Coasters singing T'aint Nothin' to Me
That song was a real riot.
How about when they did Along Came John
That record was too funny.
Yes it was.
What about Kill that Roach?
Yeah, squish, squash kill that roach.
We would be stomping on the floor like we were actually killing roaches.
What do you mean, sometimes we would be killing them....haaahaaa
Don't forget Madison Time
I never could get the steps right to that
Me either. But that didn't stop me from trying
We had some great music when we were coming up.  They don't make music like that anymore.
