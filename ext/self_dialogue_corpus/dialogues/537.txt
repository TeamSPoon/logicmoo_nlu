Who's your favorite NFL quarterback?
Do you mean a quarterback who is currently playing or just any quarterback in history?
I mean someone who is currently playing in the league presently.
I would probably say Aaron Rodgers of the the Packers.
You're a big Green Bay Packers fan then?
Not really, I don't dislike them but I'm more a fan of individual players than teams.
Are you a Tom Brady fan at all?
I respect his athletic ability and it's hard to deny that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time but I'm not a big fan of his.
Personally I'm the opposite. I'm more a fan of teams than individual players.
So what teams do you like to root for?
I'm a massive Dallas Cowboys fan and have been my entire life.
That's got to be tough, they are disappointing every year.
Yeah, it's one thing just to be a bad team but they always come so close to being great but always seem to fall short in the playoffs.
At least they have one of the nicest stadiums in the NFL so there's that.
Yeah AT&T Stadium is really awesome. It cost over a billion dollars to build so it should be.
Who is the Dallas Cowboys' starting QB this year?
Looks like it's going to be Dak Prescott this year.
I hope for your sake that he works out. It's been a long time since Dallas has had a truly great quartback.
They've had some good ones but Troy Aikman so many years ago was the last superstar quarterback for them.
It's going to be a fun game when the Cowboys play the Packers this year.
