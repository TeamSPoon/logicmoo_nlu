Ever see 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY?
Yes. And when I walked out, I felt like Rock Hudson, who famously said, "Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?"
How long ago did you see it?
A few years ago.
Any thoughts about the movie since then?
I hadn't thought about it, but I'd like to see it again.
I don't usually see a movie a bunch of times, but this one I watch every 10 years or so. Always get something new out of it.
Besides the obvious plot lines, what else do you take away from it?
Well first off, the movie ends slightly differently than the book.
How so?
Kubrick stops with the embryo in space. We don't know if it's going to Earth or what.
Right.
But Clark goes on another page or two and has the baby destroying Earth.
Wow, big difference.
In tone, definitely. I like the open-ended version better.
Me too. What else?
I see the whole film, the three parts, reflects the evolution of human intelligence.
I can see that.
Before Homo Sapiens, what we are today, and where we will be in the future.
Thus, the enigmatic ending.
