Did you listen to the American Top Forty song countdown on the radio last week?
No, I missed it. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's songs though!
Do you think the same song will be in the number one spot?
I don't know. What song was it last week?
I think it was Stay by Zedd and Alessia Cara.
I haven't heard that song. Unless something new has come out it will probably stay on top.
I like the number two song better. It's called Something Just Like This, by The Chainsmokers.
Oh, I love that song! It has Coldplay in it, right?
Yes, that's the one. Coldplay really adds something to the song.
I like The Chainsmokers as a group too.
My favorite song of theirs is Paris.
I like Closer better, but Paris is really good.
I was amazed at how they took off as a band after their first hit song.
Me too. I like their music so much better than last summer's big hits.
I liked last summer's top songs a lot more than 2013 when Blurred Lines was popular.
Oh, I can't stand that song! They played it all the time on the radio too.
They always overplay whatever is popular.
Yeah, but usually I like it so I don't complain.
I'm not complaining about the top songs right now. I'll have to listen to the number one from last week.
Listen to the whole top forty songs. They're worth it!
