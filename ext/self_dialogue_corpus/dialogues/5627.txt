Did you like 'Finding Nemo?'
I thought it was cute, but I liked the sequel way better.
Disney movies are some of the rare exceptions in film, in that sequels are actually good.
You're right.  Take a look at 'Toy Story 3' and how great that was.
Don't forget the 'Pirates' franchise.
That's right!  While the first was the best in my opinion, the second and third movies were worthy additions.
Are there any you can think of that weren't good Disney sequels?
I think 'Cars 2.'
Yea, that was pretty bad.  Though I am curious about what the third movie will be like.
I am too.  I hope the third installation redeems the 'Cars' franchise.
