How into Star Wars would you say you are?
I really enjoy them, lot's of special effects.
The old ones are still classic but for some reason I get excited to see the newer ones.
The characters are hard to keep up with but I love Chewbacca.
LOL! What ever happened to JarJar BInks?
I have no idea but didn't you name your dog after him.
Yes, funny you remember that. Darth Vader is a bad ass.
I know, LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER.
You da daddy. OH a shame about Carrie Fisher. I guess she was on a lot of drugs.
