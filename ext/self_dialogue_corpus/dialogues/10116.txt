What would you consider an iconic action movie or series?
I have really enjoyed the Die Hard series. They weren't all stellar, but when they hit, they were really enjoyable.
The first one was such a classic. I didn't watch Bruce Willlis much on that TV show he did, but I really thought he made a great transition to films with Die Hard.
I loved how the filmmakers weren't afraid to blow a ton of shit up, and they ended up basically destroying the entire bulding by the end.
I've watched the film many times, and it's amazing how beat up John gets over the course of the film, but he keeps on fighting, and he's really believable.
I agree with you there. John was a really credible, realistic hero, and you could feel his pain and frustration and determination to get the bad guy.
And what a great bad guy! I love that he was urbane and witty and cultured and in the end, all he wanted was a shitload of money.
That movie really stands the test of time, too. The fight sequences were epic.
Guns, fights, lots of action, the hero reuniting with his estranged wife, the cop sidekick, the wisecracking FBI guys. A great movie all around.
I think Bruce Willis really eanred his rep as an action hero in this and subsequent movies.
