So how about those Miami running backs?
Obviously the conversation there starts with Jay Ajayi.
Yes, quite a year he had last year.
It was, he really burst onto the scene when he got a chance.
But it wasn't all good for him, was it?
No, he had three games over 200 yards, but only one other game over 100 yards.
And he did not catch the ball well at all.
True, he only had 27 receptions on the season, and he had 10 of those in two games.
So he has some things to work on.
The key here is that he is working on them.  Reports out of camp are that he is working hard and is now a better receiver.
What about the other backs on the team?
Well, basically they have two other experienced backs and some guys who are long shots.
Damien Williams and Kenyon Drake?
Yes, those two are pretty well known quantities.
Damien Williams flirted with the Patriots.
True, but he was never really going anywhere.  He is too valuable as a receiver and special teamer.
And Kenyon Drake?
He has home-run hitter all over him.  He can make game breaking plays, they just need to make sure they are positive plays.
Anyone of note in the other guys?
Probably not, but they have training camp to show what they can do.
