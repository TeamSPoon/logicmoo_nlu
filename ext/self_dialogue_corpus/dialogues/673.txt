I was reading about Andrew Luck and I hope he'll be able to play soon.
He had surgery right?
Yes, on his shoulder, and he still can't throw.
How long ago was his surgery?
In January so it has been awhile.
Who will the Colts use if he can't start?
Scott Tollzien. He played for Wisconsin in college, and then the 49ers and Packers.
Oh well he's had a lot of experience then.
Yes, just not as a starter. They really need Luck to get back as soon as possible.
Is he even practicing yet at camp?
No. He is just observing because he hasn't been released yet.
If he gets healthy they probably have a really good shot this year.
I think they need more than him though. They didn't have a great season last year.
They definitely need to up their defense a bit.
Especially being in the same conference as the Patriots.
Well Brady probably doesn't have many years left, but I'm sure they can find someone else.
Definitely. The Patriots are strong as a team.
They could probably do well with any quarterback.
I'm sure they could with the offense and defense that they have.
I would like to see a new champion this year though. The same winners get boring after awhile.
