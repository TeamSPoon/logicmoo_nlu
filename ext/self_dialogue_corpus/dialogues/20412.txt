Did you also see " A man calledOve"?
Oh they made a movie?
Yes, it was pretty true to the book, it was a really good movie.
Did you enjoy it?
Yes, I really did. It made me cry pretty hard though.
So it was a sad movie?
Kind of really sad but a really excellent movie. I would watch it again.
I think I'll watch it when I get a chance.
The stinky thing about it was that it was all in subtitles, they spoke swedish.
Really, you know Barry won't watch anything like that. I guess I'll have to watch it when he is asleep.
Yes you will, but t=here is a movie you both might like, "Why Him", Have you seen that?
No whats it about? Is it a comedy?
Oh yeah. It is hysterical and it has James Franco and Bryan Cranston in it.
Bryan Cranston, I fell in love with him when he was in Breaking Bad, he is such a versatile actor he's good in everything.
Wasn't he in Malcolm in the Middle too?
Yes, he is such a great actor. Well lets go see Minions.
