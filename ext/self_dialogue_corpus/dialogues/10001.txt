So, what are some of your favorite action movies?
Well, I for sure have to mention the films of John Woo.  there's so many, it's hard to pick just one.
Oh, yeah, he's awesome!
Yeah, I liked The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, Hard Target, there's just so many cool scenes in each of them.
I've always like the whole "guy with two guns" thing he does in each film
Yeah, that's awesome.  Oh, and Mission Impossible 2 was good, although I'm told Cruise interfered a lot with the final cut of the film.
I liked that movie, although I did think that ending part was a little bit cheesy.  You know they way Ethan Hunt kicks the sand and the gun flys STRAIGHT up into his hand, like it was just levitating or something.
Yeah, I admit, that part was a little over the top, but still, that's what you go to action movies for, right?
Yeah, true.  Oh, interesting not, do you know the hospital in The Killer is called the Scared Heart? I think it was supposed to be Sacred Heart, but someone must have goofed on that.
Oh, man, I never noticed that!  I gotta re-watch that film now!
