So football season starts in just a couple more months.
I know! Time flies. I'm excited.
I wonder how the Patriots will do this year.
Well, they've got new players. They signed Conor McDermott and nearly 20 rookie free agents.
Yeah, I'm psyched about McDermott. Also Derek Rivers.
I hope Jimmy Garoppolo stays healthy.
Is he replacing Tom Brady as quarterback?
No, not replacing, but I get the sense that they'll be playing him more often.
Who are they playing in their first regular season game?
The Kansas City Chiefs.
Oh, I think that'll be an easy win for the Patriots.
Yeah, maybe. Especially since it's a home game.
The Chiefs used to be the worst team in the NFL. Hands down the worst.
I know, but that was a few years ago. They've had at least two decent seasons since then.
Well, they lost the division title two years in a row.
Have they ever won a Super Bowl?
They won one, I think.
Back in the 1960s?
1970. They beat the Vikings, who have never won a Super Bowl.
Wow. I wish I'd been around to see that matchup.
