What is your favorite Johnny Depp film?
Probably Donnie Brasco.
I've never seen it.
You have to!
Why?
Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.
You're right! I must! What's it about.
Depp plays a Fed trying to infiltrate the Mafia.
Let me guess, Pacino's the Mafioso.
Of course!
He's so good at that.
I know!
Is it on Netflix.
I'm not sure but I have the DVD.
Could I borrow it.
Sure.
Could I come by later.
Yeah. Why don't we watch it together.
That'd be great.
Come over about 7.
