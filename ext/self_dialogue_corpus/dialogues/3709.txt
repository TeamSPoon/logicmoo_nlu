Ever seen Sin City?
Yes! That was awesome.
Yeah, plot twist everywhere.
Yeah, good ending too.
I liked the guy Mickey Rourke played.
That was a good character.  Pretty tough too.
Bruce Willis was awesome in that movie too.
Like when he "took away his weapon."
Yeah, "Both of them"
One of my favorite parts that guy getting what he just deserved.
