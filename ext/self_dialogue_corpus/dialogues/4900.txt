Did you catch the Phillies game yesterday?
Against the Rangers?
Yeah, man. Can't believe they blew it again.
Seriously. Their bullpen is terrible.
I really thought they would be better this year too.
Me too man, Joely gave up 6 runs in one inning!
It's crazy. They have nobody they can turn to in the pen right now.
I know, even Neris and Benoit are throwing awful. They have one of the worst pens in the league.
For sure, at least their hitters are turning it around though.
Yeah, that's true. I saw Franco hit another dinger.
Yeah, he's starting to hit a bit better. I think his batting average is up a bit...
Yeah, and Tommy Joseph too.
True. Although Odubel is really slumping.
Seriously, what's up with that? Of an all stay year too.
I don't know, I'm worried that extension is going to his head...
Man, I hope not. They really need a couple of these guys to stick.
Well, Altherr looks legit
Yeah, he might be the real deal. Luckily they have a good minors system
Yeah - if only the bullpen wasn't awful right?
True that! They need to make a trade, I think
