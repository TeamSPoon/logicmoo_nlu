Do you remember any of Pink Floyds music?
Yes I do why?
I was having a hard time remembering his music.
He was very different for the time and unique in a way.
Can you name a song or two for me?
Another brick in the wall is one of them.
How did I forget that, that's the one I was trying to pinpoint.
Was it just on the end of your tongue?
Yes I knew it just couldn't remember the name.
I have that happen too.
Anymore?
Hey You.
I would have never remember that one.
Want some more?
Yes please.
Run like hell.
That's a good one.
That's all I got sadly.
Thanks a lot i'll listen to these shortly.
Anytime.
