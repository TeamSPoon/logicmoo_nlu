All kinds, but mostly I like the blues?

What about Barbecue Bob , you ever hear of him?
Oh yeah , Robert Hicks, he played a 12 string guitar.
So, what blues guitarists have you seen in person?
Two of the best blues guitarists ever, Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B. King. I saw B.B. at the Fox Theatre in Detroit.
Which concert did you like better?
I'd have to say Stevie was better, he layed down some blistering leads , really rocked out. King was great but it was a more mellow affair.
The Fox Theatre in Detroit,cool, why'd you say mellow?
Lots of dude, wearing Tuxedos and clapping politely. Was too upscale,I like a more gritty atmosphere, like the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor or St. Andrews Hall.
What kind of stuff do you have in your music collection?
Lets see, Elmore James, Robert Johnson, Panama Red, Charley Patton, John Lee Hooker and Lightnin Hopkins. A few others I can't think of right now.
How did you get into blues?
My dad was a big fan, and he played a little blues on guitar as well.
What about you , you play?
I'm trying to learn , but I'm not that good, yet. I play a few blues shuffles and simple riffs and licks.
What blues song would you like to learn most?
I'd love to learn Freight Train by Elizabeth Cotten. Its more of a folk blues song, and so far I can only play a bit of it.
