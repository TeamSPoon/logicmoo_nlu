Which is your favorite robot in the Star Wars movies?
Okay, that's a hard one. Let me think.
Mine is C3PO.  So funny.
Okay well I have to say BB8.
BB8, cool!  He's adorable.
And capable, right?
Naturally.  JJ created a next-gen robot with heart.
I loved the way he rolled to get anywhere.
Yeah I think pretty much he stole every scene.
Kind of like R2D2, but with an updated personality.
