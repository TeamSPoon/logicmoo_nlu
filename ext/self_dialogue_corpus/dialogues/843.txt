Well, it's getting close to pro football season.
Yeah, it's almost time for training camps.
Do your 49ers still have theirs at Sierra College?
No, they have it in Santa Clara.
That must be better for the players--Sacramento area is so hot this time of year.
Yes, I imagine.
It used to be thought that hot weather was good for you to get in shape.
Yeah, I think they've gotten over that theory.
The players are more valued than they used to be in the good old days.
Not a good idea to dehydrate your multi-millionaires ha, ha.
Have you been to the new 49er stadium?
Levi's Stadium, no they made it too expensive.
You could go to an exhibition game--a lot of season ticketholders will give those games away.
Yeah, but those games aren't much fun, and the crowd is unruly.
Yeah, a stadium full of people who don't usually go to the games.
It's a burn that season ticketholders have to pay full price for those games.
For sure; oh I must correct myself--ownership calls those games preseason games, not exhibitions.
Well, pretty boring whatever you call them.
Have you ever been a season ticketholder?
Shared tickets with a group back in the glory days.  As I remember, we'd each get two tickets to two games.
