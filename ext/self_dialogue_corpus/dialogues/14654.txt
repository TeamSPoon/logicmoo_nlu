Who won the game last night?
Washington Wizard won
They were playing the Celtics right?
yeah the series is now tied 3-3
So it is going to a game seven
yes. Who do you want to win?
I don't really care I am just looking forward to the finals
Do you have someone you want to win it all?
I am going for the Spurs or Golden State
Ok why?
I like the western conference better, and I like popovich
Do you not like Lebron?
I don't care I think he is a little overrated
He is a good player
Oh yes of course he is, but I think Steph Curry is a good player too
I see you don't think Lebron is the best?
He might be the best now, but not necessarily the best ever
yeah there are a lot of contenders for that
Of course Lebron has to win more championships to be on the list of best ever
I agree, but I am hoping the Cavs win it all this year.
