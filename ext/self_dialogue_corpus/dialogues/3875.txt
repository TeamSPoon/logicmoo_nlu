Have you seen Tom Cruise's The Mummy?
I have! I watched it with my mum. She's a big fan of him.
Did you like it? I found it to be boring to be honest.
I found it boring too. I especially didn't buy the love story.
Right? It was so forced. At the end of the movie I couldn't care less if the woman died.
The whole movie was bad. The only character I liked was Princess Ahmanet.
I liked her too but even her story was flawed, why bring a devil king to rule with her if she wasn't interested in competition?
Yeah, I guess. At the end of the movie there really wasn't any character you wanted to cheer for.
Exactly. I heard they're going to make more from this Dark Universe or something.
That's what I heard too. I hope it isn't as boring as this one.
