Our local college football team is great!
It is? I don't really follow college football. I prefer the NFL.
Well, we've had a few of our players, like Tevin Mitchel, get drafted in the NFL lately.
That doesn't sound that special to me though. Pretty much every college does.
You've got a good point. I guess I'm just excited.
Why?
My last college's football team was really bad.
Why don't you start watching some NFL games then?
I guess I could do that.
I think you'd get really into it if you let yourself.
Do you have any teams that you're a big fan of?
I grew up in Minnesota, so I like the Vikings.
And hate the Packers?
Of course. That's practically genetic.
Rivalries like that are always so funny to me.
Why?
They just seem silly. It's such low stakes.
That's the fun of it though! Getting wrapped up in something that doesn't matter is fun.
I guess I can understand that.
See what I mean?
