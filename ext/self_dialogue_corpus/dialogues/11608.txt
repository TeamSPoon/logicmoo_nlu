Would the Beatles still be around today?
I think they would still be touring if they were all alive.
I dont know people would sour on them
People still attend Rolling Stones concerts.
I find the Beatles can be somewhat annoying.
How so?
People give them too much reverance.
Well Sergeant Peppers was such a good album.
I think it was good but not that good.
No way it was a landmark album
