Did you ever see Trading Spaces?
Is that an older movie?
Yeah, from the early 80s, I think.
Who was in it?
Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroid.
I'm not sure.  What was it about?
Well, a stockbroker and a homeless guy trade places with each other.  I think there was a bet made somewhere.
A bet?
Yeah, Murphy is the homeless guy and he has to do Akroid's job.  Likewise, Akroid has to make it on the streets.
I might have to see that one.
