What is your favorite action film?
The new Mad Max, Fury Road.
I loved that movie. Tom Hardy is incredible.
Hardy is always good in my books. Charlise theron was also very powerful in her performance.
Furiosa is a kick ass role for any women, but glad charlize was the one to land it.
I can't say enough about this film, the pacing was so fun. A true action packed movie.
It was like an adrenaline rush the entire time.
I think so also. I feel the score really added to the vibe and anxiety you felt the entire time.
To some degree  yes but I think the stakes were also so high. George Miller the director was very skilled at depiciting this.
I think this is George Miller's masterpiece , not sure he will ever be able to top it. But I would love to see him try.
