So, did you see Wonder Woman yet?
Yes, opening weekend!
What did you think?
Pretty amazing - Gal Gadot was wonderful.
I agree! She's very talented. The action scenes were fantastic.
She definitely brings a wide skill set to the roll.
Did you know she was in the military?
Yea, I read she was a fight instructor in Israel. That's pretty cool.
Looking forward to seeing more of the character in other movies. Is she in Justice League?
Absolutely! Really looking forward to that!
Yea, should be cool to see some more new characters too. I'm looking forward to Jason Momoa as Aquaman.
Loved him on Game of Thrones. I've seen some of the promo material and his character looks pretty awesome.
Hopefully the plot lives up to the concept. I haven't heard too much about what the movie is actually about.
Me either, no idea who the villain is. Was Superman going to be in it?
I'm not really sure.. he's on some of the promo material, but as of the last movie he's.. well, dead.
Haha, yes. They kinda have to take care of that first, don't they?
Then there's Batman and the Flash, of course. Not crazy about Affleck as batman.
I thought he did ok in Batman vs. Superman. I mean, that movie as a whole was pretty bad, but I thought he did ok.
Eh. He wasn't completely awful, but I have a hard time separating him from his other roles. Who's playing the Flash?
I'm not sure. I know it's not the same guy that plays him on tv, though.
