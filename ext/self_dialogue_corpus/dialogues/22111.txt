What is your favorite Star wars movie?
I am not sure off the top of my head
You cannot just choose one?
Well i like them all for different reason
Their has to be one of them you would choose over them all
I guess their would be one
Well what one do you like the least.
I did not like the last one that came out to much to be honest.
Why not seemed liked most people loved it.
I mean i know most people did but i was not feeling it
Why were you not feeling it.
It felt like it was just retreading old ground
I mean i guess sort of but the characters were good
They were decent but i just felt something off
Well okay which one do you like more then?
After thinking i guess i would say episode 3 would be my choice
That is a good and interesting choice.
I know most would choose older movies but that one has the best plot to me
The plot and the way it ends is pretty awesome.
Exactly why after thought i chose that one.
