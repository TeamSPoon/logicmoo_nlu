I heard the song by Taylor Swift and Zayn is in the top most played songs this year.
What song is that?
I Don't Wanna Live Forever.  It's off the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker.
I don't think I've heard that.
Really?  It's been all over the radio.  Well its sort of died off now but it was played nonstop earlier this year.
One song that I've heard played a lot this year is Ed Sheeran's Shape of You.
I love that song.  It's a lot more pop sounding than most of his other songs.
I heard the guys helping him produce it had it in mind for someone more like Rihanna but then Ed sang part of it and they decided to just go with it for him.
That's really neat.  I like when artists change up their sound a little bit.
Me too, it helps keep things fresh. His Divide album is absolutely fantastic.
