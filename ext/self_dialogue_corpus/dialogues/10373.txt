Amadeus is such a weird name
It's a period name I'd say
What's that?
like Period clothings, or period dramas. It was Common during a certain time period
Oh I see what you mean.
It means to love God, ama as in love in Latin, and deus for God.
Hm. There was nothing about in the movies I don't think?
No,l but it's an interesting tidbit of fact.
Yes, but did you know Mozarts' sister was also a genius?
A genius? No. A musician, yes. .
She wrote many compositions, but none have survived? That's so sad, Just to be erased fro history like that
It's not a nice feeling, but the movie could've used a bit more info on her if you ask me
Yeah. Mozart wrote to her about her compositions and wasvery impressed by them.
WEll, even if they were not good, i dpoubt he would've written to her criticizing them
She was his older sister after all.
Yep.
Who was that goof who made that song?
The Amadeus song form the 80s?
Yeah.
Um What's his name... Commissar guy. Rock me Amadeus... Falco! That song was so lame.
