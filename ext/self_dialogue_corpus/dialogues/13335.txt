There's something odd about the Star Wars universe.
There's a trillion odd things. What bugs you now?
Lightsabers.
Yes, we know they're not possible and if they were real you'd melt your own body off.
No, not that--that's the science fantasy portion.
Then, when is it?
That they have to press a button to activate the lightsaber.
Why's that weird?
The technology should be able to recognize who is using it, and that shouldn't be necessary.
Maybe it gives them a better grip and more concentration.
