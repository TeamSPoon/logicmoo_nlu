Ever seen Platoon?
Oh yeah, one of my favorite movies.
That was a good movie.
It showed what those guys went through in Vietnam.
They had some good actors in there too.
Charlie Sheen.
William Dafoe.
Tom Berringer.
Yeah, the cast goes on and on.
Oliver stone did a great job directing that.
There were some good lines in that movie too.
Like "pretty good is good enough"
I liked that part.  The fight scene at the end was just plane crazy.
I know, when he was going to kill Charlie Sheen's character but then the bomb went off.
That was crazy. How about when Barns shot Alias.
That was bad.  But part of what made it such a good movie.
I know what you mean.
How about how they destroyed that village?
That was horrible but an unfortunate reality of war.
Yeah, wish stuff like that didn't happen.
