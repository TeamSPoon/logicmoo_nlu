Do you like the way music works now?
What do you mean?
I mean you have to buy the songs on iTunes
I prefer the older way
Me too. I miss cassettes
I remember going to buy a CD at the store
Me too. Those were the days
I do not like iPod's or any of that
Me neither
What CD did you like the best?
The one the Smashing Pumpkins made
I like their stuff
Me too
Did you buy it yourself?
No, my mom got it for me
What song do you like?
I like 1979 and a few more
1979 is probably their best song
Yes I think so
They were a great rock band in the 90's
