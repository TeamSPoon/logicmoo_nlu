Did you think Letti was actually dead ?
I never really questioned it until the 6th movie.
I was like what?!?!
I know right. Such a plot twist.
I really like Letty so I'm glad they brought her back.
Me too, she's such a strong character.
I was so sad to see she didn't remember Dom though.
At least she still falls in love with him again !
True, that was a plus.
The poor cop lady he was with though. She basically got pushed to the side.
