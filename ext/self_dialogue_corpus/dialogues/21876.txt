Have you seen La La Land yet?
No, isn't that the musical?
Yes, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
I don't really like musicals, do you think I'll like it?
I think so. I'm not a fan either but enjoyed it.
What kind of music to they sing?
Mostly jazz and typical musical type numbers.
So a jazz musical? You can count me out.
That's what I thought at first too but it is good.
Didn't it win a bunch of awards?
I know it was nominated for Golden Globes and Oscars.
Well it can't be all bad with that type of acclaim.
Indeed, and Stone and Gosling are great to watch.
How's their chemistry on screen?
Really good. You actually believe they're a couple.
Will the movie make me cry?
I didn't but my girlfriend sobbed so be warned.
Think I might have to save this for a date night then.
Not a bad idea.
Thanks for the suggestion.
