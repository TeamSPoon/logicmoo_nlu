Looks like the Raiders are Winning!
They are?
Yes, 20-3.
That's a good game.
Game is almost over.
Last 5 minutes huh?
Yes!!
The heat is rising.
All thier best players are in the game.
That's the secret.
They were strong from the first quarter!
They always are.
Except when they're playing the Seahawks.
This is true.
That is thier rival.
Definitely.
We're talking a 20-year long standing battle.
That is awesome.
Been following them since the 90's.
Me too Brad!
