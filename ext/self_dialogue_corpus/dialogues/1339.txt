You're a panther's fan right?
Yeah, unfortunately, but they've always been my team.
I bet you were happy for super bowl 50 haha.
Yeah, I don't want to talk about that.
How are they looking this year?
Same as last year.
Cam getting any better?
Yeah, he's still got his attitude, but him and Funchess seem to be really clicking this year.
Who else do you guys have?
Well, Jonathan Stewart is arguably a top 5 RB this year.
Yeah he is, I'm trying to get him in fantasy.
And you can't forget about Kelvin Benjamin.
Actually, I did haha, how did I forget him?
Who knows, but I think he'll finish top 10 this year.
He did pretty good last year.
Yeah, wish he would've been good all year.
Can't have everything brother.
I know, but we'll still beat your team haha.
That's not saying much...I'm a browns fan.
I know, and once again they'll be terrible.
