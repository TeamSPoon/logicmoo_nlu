Who is your favorite Disney princess?
I know i'm in the minority, but I just love Aurora from Sleeping Beauty.
I do love that movie, especially because of Prince Phillip.  But my favorite princess is Belle.
Beauty and the Beast does have some of the best songs.
I love Cinderellas dress though, and those glass slippers were to die for!
Belle's dress is pretty amazing too, but yellow is my favorite color so I am a little biased..
Jasmine had a pretty cool outfit too, even though it wasn't really a dress.
All of her outfits were amazing!  Plus she had a tiger so she was the best.
Out of the princes, Aladdin was definitely the best.
He was my favorite too! Even though he wasn't technically a prince.
