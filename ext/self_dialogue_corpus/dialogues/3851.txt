What is your favorite thriller movie?
Old Boy
That movie is disturbing
Yea, the scary thing is I had a friend that was just like the character in that movie
Oh?
Yea, he always was getting in fights.  Just like the guy in the movie
Did he end up getting beat up as bad?
Yea, just as badly as the guy in the movie
Oh, damn.  That's horrible!
Yea, it definitely sucked for him!
