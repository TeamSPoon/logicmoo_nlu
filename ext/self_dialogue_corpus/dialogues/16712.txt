I heard you like jazz
With all my heart.
Have you listened to Louis and Ella?
Of course I have.
I think that's the album that won me over to jazz.
What's your favorite song in it?
I'd say Cheek to Cheek.
Easily one of the best songs in the album.
Not so easily.What do you think of A fine Romance?
Oh that too. Now it's getting harder to choose.
Told you. Any similar recommendations?
Check out Cow Cow Boogie.
Is that the one with Ella and The Ink Spots?
Right. You're becoming a bit of a connoisseur yourself.
I've been exploring.
What do you think of the song?
There is something nostalgic about it.
I know, it reminds me of events in my childhood.
It is so personal.
True, I can relate to almost every word in the lyrics.
