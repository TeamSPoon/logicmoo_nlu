Have you seen Blade III?
There was no Blade III.
You're a huge Blade fan, you don't know they made a third one?
Exactly. I'm a huge Blade fan; I don't acknowledge it exists.
You didn't like it at all?
No. It was a mess of a plot. Dracula wasn't really intimidating even though they made him out to be.
I thought the action scenes were cool.
Maybe, but they weren't, like, impressive.
You didn't think Jessica Biel's bow and arrow was cool?
...It was a little cool.
