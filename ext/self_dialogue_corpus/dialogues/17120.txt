Hey Cindy, Going to the New Fab concert tonight?
new Fab..I haven;t heard of them.  What's the deal?
They're a new indie band out of LA and have this unique sound
what's o special about them?
They play these quirky songs on FOUND instruments.
FOUND?  What do you mean.
They'll take any thing and turn it into an instrument, like a toaster or a toothbrush.
That seems odd.
Oh it is but the things they can do with the sound, after they process it of course through a computer, are amazing.
I'll have to check them out.
I saw a video of them playing the national anthem on a piano with one key...ONE KEY
Radical!
Yeah they've been on all the toalk shows and are touring with major acts this summer
Send me the link to their FB page
They don't use FB.
Whaaaat.  I thought every band used FB.
No they're on My Space..for real.
So i'm guessing they are total hipsters.
You got it!
I'll look forward to their vinyl album.
