Are you planning on seeing the new Wonder Woman movie?
Well I will definitely watch it at some point, not sure about opening weekend though.
I know what you mean.  I don't like going to see movies on opening weekend.  It's just too crowded now.
Agreed.  I like the crowds to die down a bit, and then I usually go see the movie.  A couple of weeks after it comes out.
Well what do you think about the Wonder Woman movie in general?
I am pretty excited because it is getting very good reviews.
I know.  People are saying it is the best of these recent DC universe movies.
Well I have to watch it first to make that judgment.
But to be honest with you, I have not thought the earlier DC movies were that bad!
Me neither.  I enjoyed the Superman movie, Batman versus Superman, Suicide Squad.  I thought there were all good movies.
How do you feel about the actress playing Wonder Woman?
Gal Gadot, right?
Yes, her.  I believe she was in some of the Fast and Furious movies.
She was.  I think it's great casting.  She's beautiful and has a natural charisma that you need to play these superheroes.
Well I hope she does a good job and that this movie is good.  Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic superheroes.
I agree.  She was in the Batman versus Superman movie for a bit, and the character seemed great.
You are right.  I am glad they did briefly introduce her and the character beforehand so we have a slight idea of what to expect.
Well this is all setting up the Justice League movie.
Yes, that should be quite exciting.
Well all these movies are guaranteed to make a ton of money, at the very least.
