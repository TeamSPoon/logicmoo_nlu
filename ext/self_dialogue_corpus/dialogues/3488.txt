Do you consider the Blair Witch Project a horror movie?
Its layered so not really.
What do you mean by that?
I would almost call it a paranormal movie.
Arent those almost always horror anyway?
No, I think its lacking certain elements to make it horror.
Sometimes playing on your brain is the biggest horror of them all.
No not true.
Yeah this movie centered on what could be going on.
I dont know I think we agree to disagree.
