Did you see the Lion King when you were younger?
Yes, that's my favorite child hood movie.
My favorite character was Simba, what about you?
I liked Nala, but the Hyenas were really good too.
I hated the Hyenas and Scar.
Scar was mean but I think the Hyenas were just misunderstood.
I'll have to watch it again soon, maybe I won't be as scared.
What scared you about the Lion King?
The scene in the elephant grave yard was scary!
True, but at least it wasn't a long scene!
