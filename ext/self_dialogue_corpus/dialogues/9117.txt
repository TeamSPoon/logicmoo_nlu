Whatever happened to rock music? Sometimes I think U2 is the only rock band left.
That's crazy--there's plenty of great rock music still being made. It's just that no one's famous anymore.
Well, that's the thing. I used to hear about the White Stripes, but now I can't think of anyone--Cold Play's not a rock band.
Yes, I know what you mean--it's like the celebrity world only has room for a few pop stars. I miss the guitars
I guess there's still Radiohead, but I haven't liked much of what they've done since OK Computer.
I liked a few songs on Kid A, but you're right--it wasn't the same after that.
Maybe we're just getting old?
No, that can't be it! Besides, I think there are some young bands we just haven't found yet.
I have a friend who's really into Queens of the Stone Age.
They're okay, but believe it or not, they've been around for 20 years now! Yes, we are getting old.
