Have you noticed a difference in the movies from the 90's compared to the films today?
Yes, I think that movies back then were much more lighthearted.
I agree, even the suspenseful thrillers were more cheery than the types of movies today at least in general.
There was something about comedy back then that was so much more funny than things were today.
Some of my favorite comedies were from the 90's.
Like what?
Well, the big lebowski comes to mind.
Oh yes, that is a classic!
I also liked the National Lampoon movies.
For sure, it seems like its been awhile since some movies of the calibur have come out.
Yeah the cult classics have seemed to dry up.
I couldn't name a modern 'cult classic' if I tried.
Maybe Trainspotting 2?
Its a little early to tell if it will be as big of a success as the first.
Yeah, thats the thing, some movies take time to become cult classics.
Another genre that seems to have all but dissapearred is the war film.
True, the last good war films I remember are Fury, Pans Labyrinth, and Free State of Jones.
I like all three of those movies, I don't know why Free State of Jones got such bad reviews.
Yeah that movie was practically shunned by the media.
Mathew gave an incredible performance but I hardly heard a peep about that movie.
