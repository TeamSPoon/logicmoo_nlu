Yes, although it was even more violent.
Yes, well...that's Tarentino all right!
I loved the photography in this one. What did you think?
Actually, I think Pulp Fiction had better photography. But Hateful 8 had wonderful scenery.
Yeah, Pulp Fiction was a bit gritty in the scenery department.
What do you think his next movie will be about?
Possibly something set in Europe.
Wow! I would love to see that. Tarentino and Euro-trash.
Especially at this time in history, it would be a great setting, what with the rise of Populism and the shaky European Union.
Tarentino never shrinks from controversy and veiled political commentary.
And wouldn't Uma Thurman be perfect as a populist candidate in Germany, for instance?
Yeah. Tarentino has said she is his muse. What an interesting actress..actor.
I love movies, just in general. I love the experience of being in the theater, watching the big screen.
Yeah, hope it doesn't bite the dust because of all the online and TV options now.
So much has changed about movies already. i was thinking about black and white movies just lately.
Yeah, we never see black and white these days. Remember "On the Waterfront" and "Streetcar Named Desire?"
Beautiful old movies. Not to mention "Blue Angel" and "My Little Chickadee."
Do you think that it's more expensive now to do black and white?
I don't know. But I guess it's prohibitively expensive to use actual film now.
Sigh. Movies now are great, but so were the old movies.
