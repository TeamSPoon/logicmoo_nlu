Did you know Tom Hanks voices Woody in the Disney movie Toy Story.
I did not. Wait I thought Toy Story was a Pixar movie?
It was a joint collaboration between Disney and Pixar.
Well, that is interesting. Are there any other famous actors in Toy Story.
Tim Allen voices Buzzlightyear.
I love Tim Allen, he's so funny.
Also, great bit of trivia here, Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen wrote the screenplay for the first Toy Story.
What Joss Whedon as in the director of Avengers! Wait isn't that also a Disney movie.
Yes it is, maybe they should have an Avengers and Toy Story cross over.
The toys would definitely win that fight, they've got a dinosaur for heaven's sake!
