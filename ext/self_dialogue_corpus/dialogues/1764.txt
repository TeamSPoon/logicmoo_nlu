The Football is going to be on soon!
Yeah, September maybe.
I think they open against Cleveland.
Sounds like an easy win.
You think so? They just got that new quarterback.
It is still Cleveland, though.
I hope they have a good season.
They have been doing a lot better.
Yeah, I mean they beat Dallas on the road.
Dallas had a good year.
Old Steven A. had to put on a Dallas jersey on his show!
Right! That was hilarious.
That Dak Prescott is pretty good.
Hard to say yet; give him some time.
He sure pushed Philly around.
So does everybody!
No really, they have a good team.
With that offensive line, they should.
It's just like the Jerry Jones days.
You mean when they stole nine players from Minnesota for Herschel Walher? Can't do that again!
