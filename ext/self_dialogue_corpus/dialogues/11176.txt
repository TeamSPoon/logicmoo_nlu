I need to buy some new jeans, but I'm not sure which style to get.
Try on some boyfriend jeans and some skinny jeans. Those are two great styles.
I know, but I haven't been finding jeans that are cut well lately. What brands do you like?
Levis makes a great pair of boyfriend jeans. They are relaxed fit but not so baggy that they're sloppy looking.
Great, I think I'll try to find a low cut pair. Maybe something destroyed in a medium wash.
I bet they'll look great on you. Grab a statement tshirt and some aviators and your outfit is set.
I think I'm going to buy some RayBans. I love the look of them.
I have some they're the coolest glasses and very high quality.
I want to style my jeans with an oversize button down shirt.
A chambray button down shirt would look so cool.
Or even a casual white v neck tshirt.
Plain white is great and if you want something bolder slogan Tshirts are big this season.
I saw that. I saw some feminist slogan Tshirts that were very cool from Christian Dior and Stella McCartney.
I like to wear a statement t like that tucked with a maxi skirt.
I like that. That look is very edgy.
I do it sometimes with a ball skirt as well.
That would look great with a leather jacket over it for evening.
Yes, or a jean jacket for earlier in the day if it's cool out.
I can't wait until it's warm and we can wear all the spring trends.
Yes, and pair them with our classic pieces.
