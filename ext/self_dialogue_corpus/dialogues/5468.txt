Snow White is such a classic movie
I think it is one of my favorites, the witch was pretty scary though
she was and I was alway worried apples could be poisoned after watching this
which dwarf was your favorite? I liked sleepy he was cute
I liked grumpy, he reminded me of an old grumpy man
I thought the glass casket they put her in was creepy but pretty also
I think so also, they were trying to preserve her body
I wish I had a mirror that could tell me things
that would be neat, but it may make a person obsessive after awhile
snow white was the fairest in the land, I am sure that drove the witch crazy!
