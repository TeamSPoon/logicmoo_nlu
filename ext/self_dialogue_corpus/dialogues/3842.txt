Can you believe there are 5 bourne Identity movies?
No, I can't. I think I only saw the first one.
Really? I thought they were pretty. Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne.
I think they have been received pretty well but after the first one, I'm just not in to that.
Did you do the 007 movies with Daniel Craig?
Now he does a great spy film. I think I've seen everyone of those.
I really liked Casino Royal.
Me too. I hope they do one more I've heard talks buzzing.
That would be cool. I like these spy movies with all the action and suspense.
Shocker, you love that stuff. The bigger you blow things up the better.
