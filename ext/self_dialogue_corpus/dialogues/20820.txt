I am looking for a good movie series
what about Lord of the Rings
I have seen that
how about The Hunger Games
I have seen all of those too
what about the new Star Wars movies
I have seen the older ones but not the newer ones
Disney has bought the franchise
are they good
They are as good as Star Wars gets
what about the storyline
they are done as a sort of Star Wars past
I dont know, any other suggestions
What about a tv series?
like what
well Flash is good if you like super hero style stuff
can I stream it somewhere
yes Netflix has 3 seasons right now
I may do that
I originally aired on the CW, it is pretty good
