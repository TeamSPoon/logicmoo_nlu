Have you seen the Lord of the Rings?
Yeah, awesome trilogy.  Strider was my favorite character.
He was pretty awesome.  I'm a little dissapointed in Liv Tyler.  She didn't have all that major a part.
And they made such a big deal about her being in it.
Yeah, I know.  You know who else was awesome?  The dwarf.
He was.  And the elves were pretty cool.
I know, the way they come out and just nail headshots.
Who would have thought those girly looking elves would be so tough.
They were almost unstoppable.
I liked Gandolf too.  Ian McKellen was perfect for that role.
Yes he was. That whole trilogy was done the right way.
I haven't seen the Hobbit yet though.
I've seen the first one, but not the others.  It was pretty good.
I've heard they all are.
And we get the return of Golemn of course.
He was a good small bad.  Not the big bad, but he had his moments.
He did.  Not in a super clever way, but he was hard to shake.
The special effects for him were awesome.
Yeah, the way that guy wore a suit and they just put CGI over him.
I know, movies today are crazy.
