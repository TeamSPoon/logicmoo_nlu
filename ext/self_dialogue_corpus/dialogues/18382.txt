I was online looking at who had new albums coming out and saw that Chuck Berry has one.
How can that be? He died.
Apparently it's a bunch of different recording he did over the years.
Were you able to hear any of his songs?
I listened to one called Big Boys.
How did you like it?
It was pretty good. It sounded like his older music.
Do you know anything else that's on the album?
There's a song called Lady B.Goode.
You men like Johnnie B. Goode?
Yes. It's supposed to be a sequel to that song.
Johnnie B. Goode was always my favorite Chuck Berry song.
Mine, too. I also love My Ding a Ling
Oh that is such a funny song.
I know.
So are you going to get the album?
I might. I want to hear some more of it's songs first.
That makes sense.
It's his first album in thirty eight years.
Wow.That is a really long time.
