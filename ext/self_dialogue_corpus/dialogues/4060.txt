Have you seen any thriller movies you like lately?
Shudder Island, just saw it.
With Leonardo Dicaprio?
Yes, it is sort of set in the 1930's.
He is in like a mental institution right?
Yep, he spends most his time thinking he is a detective.
But there is a twist?
Yep, he is actually a patient.
I remember seeing that and being so freaked out.
It is really a suspenseful movie.
