Have you ever been to an NFL game before?
Twice, both times with my Auntie.
How did you afford it?
Well this was way back in the 1980s.
A lifetime ago.
Pretty much. She had season tickets for the Vikings.
Oh yeah, you told me about that outside winter game you went to.
I never understood why anyone would play outside in a frozen tundra like Minnesota. Have an indoor stadium, jeesh.
What was the other game? Vikings, too?
No, I had just seen urban Cowboy and was interested in Dallas so asked my Aunt to take me there.
I forgot you used to travel with her a lot.
Yes. And while there we bought same day tickets to see a Cowboys vs Bears game.
Same day tickets? That's a thing of the past.
Tell me about it. They were cheap, too. We sat way up in a nose bleed section but I didn't care.
Did you manage to have any fun at the game?
Sure. You know I like the concession stand food!
That's all you liked about it?
No, we were seated behind 4 Chicago Bears fans.
What was fun about that?
This was back when their team sucked. Bears fans took to wearing paper bays over their heads with cut outs for the eyes to hide their identity. I still have a photo of those 4 guys with bags over their heads with "Bears Fan' written on them.
