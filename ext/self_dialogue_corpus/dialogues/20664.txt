have you ever seen Gone with the wind?
Yes I have but my boyfriend NEVER saw it!
It has been around for over fifty years!!
Vivan Leigh was beautiful and played such a perfect Scarlett O'Hara.
Yes she did.
Clark Gable was great as Rhett Butler. They sure made a great couple.
They had some great fights , did n't they?
Frankly my dear , I don't give a damn!!
That was a classic line.
It had a lot of history in it too.
My favorte was Mammy.
Oh, I loved her and Prissy too.
The Civil war sure was tough.
That movie really showed you a lot about how it was in the South during the war.
Remember how Scarlett was really in love with Ashley Wilkes?
Yes I do.
But I think Rhett was a much better match for her.
He really put his foot down to her.
But she could always win him over.
I know, great movie! Think I will watch it this weekend!
