Did you see the game last night?
Which one?
The only one that was on
Oh the Ducks and Predators?
Thats it
Yeah I saw. Ducks looked good.
They did but obviously the Predator were better.
I cant see them being able to win the entire series.
Why not?
Because the Ducks are on fire with no one right now.
No one? Kessler, Perry, and Getzlaf are pretty good.
Perry is a shell of himself anymore.
This is true. Rinne is on fire though.
Well he has the best defense in the league in front of him.
This is true.
And thats why I think they win.
Laviolette is a hell of a coach to be honest.
That he is, gonna take his third team to the Cup.
Hopefully it works out better than it did in Philly.
Well he had Leighton there. Rinne is slightly better.
