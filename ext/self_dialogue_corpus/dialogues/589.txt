Are you excited like I am for the new NFL season?
Yeah I can't wait - last year will be hard to top though - it was a fantastic season.
You must be a New England Patriots fan huh?
It is one of the teams I watch regularly, I am a Tom Brady fan too
I do admire him, he is a real professional and committed to his craft.
Me too, I can't understand the people who hate on him.
Me neither - as a Broncos fan - I have good reason to hate, but its hard to hate or criticize excellence.
Oh that must be tough - you Broncos fan do have a rivalry with the Patriots.
Yeah, it has been one of those - oh no we play the patriots late again this year - almost every year.
If it's not the playoffs it seems you guys always meet in the late regular season.
Yes, we knock each other out of the playoffs regularly.
Did you guys play them last year in the playoffs.
No we didn't even make the playoffs last year - It was a down year for sure.
That must have been disappointing after a super bowl win huh?
Yeah it was - thats why I could admire Brady so much though this year I guess - he didn't knock us out and go on to win
That is funny, How do you think the Broncos will do this year
At this point - I'm thinking worse than last year
No way really? Not going to make the playoffs?
Anything can happen for sure, but the division looks tough this year.
Yes, the Raiders seem to be everyones favorite
