Are you planning to see the new Stars Wars movie?
Very much so.  I've seen all the trailers.
Do you think they will have all the old characters?
I know it will have Luke Skywalker, Finn and Rey.
Who are they fighting?
I don't know.  There's not a lot of information about it.
The island where they shot some of the scenes are amazing.
Yes, I think they are in Ireland.
This should really boost their tourism.
Yes, they can call it Star Wars Tours.
