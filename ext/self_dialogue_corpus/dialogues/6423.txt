Dis you know that Mel Gibson was in Pocahontas?
WHat who was he?
John Smith.
Oh no wonder I thought John Smith was dreamy growing up.
Yea, I had a big crush on him. I loved that movie anyway but now I have to re-watch it.
Yea we should do that some night. It's been too long since I've heard any of the songs.
Oh we should have a singalong with Colors of The Wind.
I love that song! It's such an underrated Disney song.
I know, I didn't think that was possible. Just around the river bend is pretty amazing too.
Oh man now you make me wish I was in a canoe with Meeko.
