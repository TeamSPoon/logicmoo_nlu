Did you like those Jurassic Park movies?
Yeah, I did. I remember thinking the first one was so good.
I know. The dinosaurs looked so real!
I loved seeing the veloceraptors. I couldn't get enough about them. I started reading about them anywhere I could.
Yeah, the ones in the movie were so wicked. The way they worked together.
I know. Talk about a crazy predator.
I do think that one was the best. The ones after were entertaining, but kind of expected.
I agree. Plus I can't remember any of the people in the ones after Sam Neil.
Yeah, he's the reason I went to see Hunt for the Wilder People.
I haven't heard of that. Was it good?
Yeah. It was totally different kind of movie. He plays a grouchy old man and it's kind of a coming of age movie.
He's always been a good a actor. I might have to go see.
The movie takes place in New Zealand and the kid is this really chubby kid. He is funny when he doesn't mean it.
I think I saw the trailer for that. I'll have to stream it some where.
Yeah the kid's name Julian Denison. I think he's done a few movies.
Wasn't he in Paper Planes?
Not sure, but I've started watching some of these foreign films like that when I can find them. I think they are amusing.
Yeah, Muriel's Wedding was one of those. It's old but it's pretty good.
I remember that. That was an old one.
Yeah, but sometime those are better than the new ones. Some new movies are just too slick.
