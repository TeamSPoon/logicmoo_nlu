Who do you think's gonna win the next Super Bowl?
Not sure, it's pretty tough to tell.
Well, what do you think?
I say the Jaguars, or the Lions.
Why them? They're never gonna win.
Never say never, man! I think they got a chance!
As long as any of those good QB's are still around, those teams are gonna win.
Oh, okay.
Makes sense, right?
Yes, it does.
Let's talk about favorite foods at the games, though.
Like what?
Hamburgers and Tacos!
What? When did tacos become such a popular food?
They're usually popular around soccer games, but it spreaded to football, too!
........
Never mind.
I think hot dogs are still better food than tacos.
What about corn dogs?
That sounds great!
