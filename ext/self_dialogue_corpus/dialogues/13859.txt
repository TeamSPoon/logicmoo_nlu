Are you enjoying Lady Gaga's new stuff?
Yeah. I like it a lot. You?
Yeah. Have you ever gotten to see her in concert?
I went to the Fame tour.
Was it amazing?
Yes. She was incredible. The show was a blast.
I bet. I know she's an amazing performer.
Her dancing and the costumes were really cool. She also talks to the audience a lot.
I love that. I'm thinking of going to the Joanne tour in December.
We should both go! I hope she does older stuff too, like Paparazzi.
