Lorde's new album...
God, yes!
I can't stop listening to it. I wasn't even expecting it to be this good.
I know! Green Light was great, but...the album. Wow.
The Louvre makes me cry. I don't know why.
So much emotion! The whole album has me feeling like that.
Right? You can just hear her heartbreak, I swear.
Especially in Liability.
Oh god yeah, talk about a cry fest!
It's so good though. So good.
