Do you like rock music?
Yes, I love it!
I really used to like Air Supply.
Me too, I listened to them all the time.
It was for sure good date music.
Agreed. I liked to play it as we drove to go out to dinner and the movies.
What is one of your favorites by them.
I think probably Lost In Love.
Oh yeah, that's a classic.
I think a lot of people secretly loved Air Supply, but didn't admit it.
Another one I always liked was Two Less Lonely People in the World.
Oh, and don't forget All Out Of Love.
Oh so many memories coming back.
Now I'm thinking of Every Woman In The World. Love, Love that song!
I've got to listen to some Air Supply now.
I hadn't heard any songs from them in a long time, but now I keep thinking of more songs that I love.
There isn't another band like them.
They are for sure one of a kind.
Okay, I'm off to dig up an old cd.
If you can't find yours, I'm sure I can dig one up.
