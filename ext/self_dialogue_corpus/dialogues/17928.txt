I went to a Kehlani concert last week, it was great.
Who is Kehlani again?
She's a singer.
What has she done?
Her album came out this year, and she had another before that I think.
Oh cool, are there any songs I would know?
Her album You Should Be Here has a song with Chance the Rapper.
Oh yeah, The Way! I remember that one.
Yeah it's super good still.
Cool, what else should I listen to of hers?
Well her new record is called Sweet Sexy Savage and there are a bunch of good songs.
Give me your favorites.
Probably Distraction, Undercover, and CRZY.
Okay, I'll definitely look those up later.
Yeah, it's all on Spotify.
Perfect.
CRZY was the last song she played at the show and she brought a bunch of little kids onstage to dance with her.
That's so cute!
Yeah, some were super into it and others just stood there.
That's so funny, I'll look it up.
