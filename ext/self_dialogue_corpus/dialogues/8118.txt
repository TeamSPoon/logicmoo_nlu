I remember Nickelback used to be kind of popular.
Yes I kind of liked their music.
Which song was your favorite?
I really liked "How You Remind Me".
Oh yes I remember that one and it was really good.
I'm not sure why some people really dislike them?
That's a good question, I have no idea either. I always loved them.
I did too!
The song "Photograph" by them was great also.
Yes I get that stuck in my head all the time!
