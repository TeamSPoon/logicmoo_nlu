Listen! It's Bon Jovi on the radio!
Yeah. He is still going strong.
I loved him when I was growing up!
Me too.
Did you know that Bon Jovi was gonna be called Johnny Electric.
Really? I did not know that!
Yep. Then a friend suggested they follow Van Halen’s example and take their leader’s last name as their own.
It is good he listened to that friend.
Plus, Bon Jovi almost gave their first No. 1 single, ’You Give Love a Bad Name,’ to Canadian rockers Loverboy.
Wow! He would have regretted that!
All in all, he made out alright.
Yeah,that is true.I don't think he is Living On A Prayer!
Very,very funny!
I know, but it's true!
Don't be giving Bon Jovi a Bad Name!
Good one!
I can be funny too!
We could do this all day!
Because We Can! Ha,Ha,Ha
Well, Bon Jovi will Never Say Goodbye! Ha,Ha,Ha
