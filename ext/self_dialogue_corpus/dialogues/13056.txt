Hey, are you going to see the new Star Wars movie this December?
You mean "Star Wars: The Last Jedi?"
Yeah, it looks really good, i think.
Yeah, I watched the trailer last month and it got me really excited about it. I hope we find out who Rey's parents are.
Do you have any theories?
Um, I'm leaning toward Luke being her dad, but I dunno. That seems too obvious.
Yeah, I read an article online about her being a Kenobi.
Really?? That sounds cool. That would make Obi Wan Kenobi her grandfather?
Something like that.
Wow, now i'm really excited to find out when the movie comes out. Let's go see it together!
