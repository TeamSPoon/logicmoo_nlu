Lady Gaga is pretty outrageous. Do you like her?
I don't think I really like her as a person. But I do like some of her songs.
I can see that.
I would never go to one of her concerts. But I sometimes sing along it her songs come on.
Yeah I don't understand her persona.
It makes me wonder if she is insecure deep down.
You mean because she doesn't show her real face?
Exactly. It's probably a way to create mystery. It's just odd
I think she also tries to make a statement about some aspects of society.
That's a good point. Maybe I don't always understand her perspective.
