I don't know about the NHL.
The league's weird recently.
It's the rules.
They were considering changes, yeah?
They were debating it.
Hot takes about changes.
The hottest takes.
Would it be so wrong though?
For what?
Maybe changing the rules with shooting.
For what?
To make the game more dynamic.
Like, less long range and mid range play?
Yeah.
That's gross.
Like you don't like the fights.
I like the tactics.
You like the blood.
I mean.
Both of us do.
