I like FAST TIMES.
Do you mean AT RIDGEMONT HIGH?
Yes, it was released in 1982.
It is a comedy.
And also coming-of-age film.
It was directed by Amy Heckerling.
It had several actors.
Sean Penn was the main actor.
Judge Reinhold was in it.
Also Phoebe Cates was in it.
I liked Brian Backer.
It had a 4.5 million dollar budget.
It only made $27 million.
It chronicles the lives of sophomores.
Jeff was a stoned surfer.
Mr. Hand was an uptight teacher.
Nicolas Cage is in the movie.
Anthony Edwards is also in it.
Whitaker got an Academy Award.
He was best actor.
