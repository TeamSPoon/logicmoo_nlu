Do you like Mumford and Sons?
Yes, I love them!
What is your favorite song of theirs?
I really like The Cave, but I like most of their songs!
I have seen them twice in Kansas City.  I wish they were opening for U2 here.  Beck is opening here.
I would rather see Mumford than Beck.  He's ok, but not my favorite.
I only really know one song by him, Loeer,
He has some other good songs.  What other bands do you like?
I like the Strumbrellas, the Chainsmokers, and the Lumineers.
So you like alternative country the best?  I like the Avett Brothers.
I wanted to go to Nashville to a festival where they were playing but I couldn't get tickets.
That would.have been cool, I like that song I and Love and You.
Weren't they on Colbert once?
Yes, I think so, but I missed it,. I should look it up on YouTube.
Are you going to any concerts this summer?
No, I don't have the money.  I would like to see the Avett Brothers if they come nearby again.
Maybe we could go together?  We should go to Knuckleheads to see Trampled Under Foot.
I have never heard of them.
They are a blues group from here in KC.  They are siblings,and the lead singer has an amazing voice.
Sounds like fun. When are they playing and how much are tickets?
