It was a real shame that Prince died.
It sure was , he had so much talent.
Yes he died of an accidental overdose.
I loved the song Little Red Corvette.
That was a great song! So was Raspberry Beret.
I love that one too.
He could really play a guitar.
And put on quite a show.
Did you ever see him in concert.
Actually yes I did and it was great!!
He signed a contract with Warner Bros when he was only 18.
I always thought it was funny how he changed his name.
Yea he changed it to a symbol.
Did you know that his album Purple Rain sold over 13 million copies?
Yea and was the number one album for 24 weeks in a row.
I did not know that part.
Yea When Doves Cry was also on the album.
That is a good song.
Yea I liked it
Shame that he is gone and cant make more music.
