I loved when lady gaga recorded that album with Tony Bennet
I didn't like that as much. his music isn't very interesting.
Yeah, but I was surprised she had such a great voice.
I guess. I also like her political stances.
Yeah I guess it's cool that she tries to use her fame for good.
What did you think of her on American Horror Story?
I loved it. I wish she would act more.
Her videos are always pretty great.
I still love the Poker face video.
I do too!
