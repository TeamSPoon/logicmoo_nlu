lady gaga's music used to be so good
her first two albums were authentic!
the piano pieces were stellar
summer boy was the jam, you're right
her new music is just too weird. it's basically impossible to listen to
yeah, she's changed
and it's because of fame. obviously. fame monster and all
it's fitting, i guess...
i still miss her pretty piano tracks, though.
i doubt if she did one now it would even sound as good
