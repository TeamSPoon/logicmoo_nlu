You know, I was thinking about prequel films the other day.
Oh, what about prequels?
I was just thinking that they fill in unnecessary information that the audience doesn't need.
Sometimes people want to see what happened in the past to a character though?
But most of the time it's better left to the imagination.
I don't agree. I'd rather see what happens in a movie than have to picture it myself.
But what if what happens in a prequel isn't like what you picture in your head? Won't you be disappointed?
No, I'd much rather see the original creator's vision than anything I'd come up with.
Okay, but what about when a prequel contradicts things that happened in a prior film?
I don't care about that. I'm just along for the ride.
Not much of a stickler for continuity, huh?
I'd rather look at the big picture. If a prequel is enjoyable, who cares if a few little details are wrong in the grand scheme?
I care. I think prequels are a bad idea.
Sometimes they are. Hannibal Rising for example, was completely unnecessary.
I'll agree with you there.
Yeah, but, that doesn't mean all prequels are bad. Some like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are great.
That barely even counts, it was only set before the first film because of convenience.
No matter the reason why, it' still a prequel, and that proves that some are good.
Alright, I'll give you that. I guess Monsters University wasn't all bad either.
Finally, something we can agree on!
