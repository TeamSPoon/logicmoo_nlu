Do the Islanders find a new home for next year?
They better hope so.
Talk about a team in turmoil.
Well they havent been good to their city.
I think New York wants them there.
Yeah but Long Island wont build them a new arena.
They left for Brooklyn and they didnt bat an eye.
Do you think they would ever fold?
No the team is too established to let that happen.
So then what do they do next
Probably go back to the Coliseum.
Oh god they probably dont want that.
Who would?
Looks like you have your tail between your legs.
Well the team is winning.
They missed the playoffs this year.
It was a down year.
They just had a down decade.
More than that.
If they cant keep Tavares, then theyre scrwed. Maybe we see the end.
