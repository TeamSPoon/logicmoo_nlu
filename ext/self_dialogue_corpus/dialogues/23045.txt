What movie do you have the most memories of from a kid?
Space Jam, for sure.
How so?
I specifically remember seeing the commericals and getting my pop to take me at least 4 times.
Lucky. I saw it once. Still loved it.
We went to AMC 3 times in one week. He loved it, too.
What part was your favorite?
Well, my favorite part and the scene I think is funniest are different.
Okay, which is your favorite part?
The last game that they play.
And the funniest?
I forget the context, but the big blue alien hits his head on the rim. I remember cracking up each time.
I don't remember that part.
He was the dumber alien on the Monstars team.
I heard that lebron is going to be in the new Space Jam.
That will be lame if its true.
Why?
They need to stop rehashing the classics.
That's true. But money.
Yeah, I get it.
