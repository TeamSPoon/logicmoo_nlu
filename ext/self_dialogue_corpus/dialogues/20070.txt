Have you seen any of the Harry Potter films?
Yes, I have seen all of them. Have you?
I have not seen the last film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 2. Which one was your favorite?
I loved the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It holds so much nostalgia for me.
Me too. Although, my favorite from the series would have to be Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
I liked that one too. Are the Harry Potter movies your favorite of all time?
Actually, no. My favorite movie franchise is the Captain America movies.
Wow! I have heard a lot of good things about those movies, but I have never seen them.
Really? They're thrilling. They follow a WWII soldier, Steve Rogers, after he has been frozen in time for over 70 years!
That sounds really cool. I'm going to watch that soon. Which movie is your favorite?
Probably Captain America: Civil War.
What is it about?
It follows the Avengers and their struggle with the law: what is constitutional and humanitarian and what is best for the public.
That sounds complex. I'll have to check it out.
You should. What's the best movie you've seen recently?
That's a tough question. Probably Deadpool.
I've seen that! Wade Wilson is absolutely hilarious!
I know, man! Although a little bit inappropriate.
Yeah, but that's what makes it so funny!
Yeah, it was an entertaining movie.
