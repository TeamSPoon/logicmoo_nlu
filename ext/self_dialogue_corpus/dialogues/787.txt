Who do the Bills play the first week of the season?
They play the Jets.
I'm going to get tickets to that game.
Can I go with you?
Of course.
I think they'll do better this year.
I hope so, seven wins isn't very good.
The season started so well too.
That's life when you are a Bills Fan.
Yea, losing four Super Bowls in a row is tough.
They had some good teams back then though.
Jim Kelly was a great quarterback.
Flutie wasn't bad either.
Thurman Thomas was amazing too.
I miss those days.
I think we're on the way back up though.
Not until we get a quarterback.
Well, that is an issue.
I think we lose 12 games this year.
I hope not.
