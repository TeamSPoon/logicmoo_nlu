Do you like Star Wars?
It is a great series
What do you think about Padme?
She seems like a weak character
How is that?
It seemed like she gave up after Anakin turned to the dark side. She had a lot longer to live.
It was good that she went ahead and gave birth
Yeah, both of her kids were very important people
I wonder if she thought Anakin might turn
It took her by surprise
