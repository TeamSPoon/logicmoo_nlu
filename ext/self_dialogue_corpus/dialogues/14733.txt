I wonder what the very first comedy movie was
These are not the type of question that can be answered.
Why not? It's simple. Which movie used humor mostly to entertain people?
Well, again. Genres came after the movies. We say a comedy movie, but that genre became a thing after many movies used humor in their content
So there has to be at least one movie that set that trend
Well, not really, because there could've been many movies from same time frame that did the same thing.
Either way there has to be some consensus as to the original comedy
if I was forced to say it, I'd say it's that french film. L'Arroseur Arrose, or the watered waterer.
Even the name's humorous.
yeah, it's was a bit of a slapstick comedy. Guy gets sprayed by his own water hose. But it's the start of the genre I'd say.
