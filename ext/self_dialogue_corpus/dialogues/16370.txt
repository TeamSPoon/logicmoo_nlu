Best country song ever?
There are a lot of good ones, that would be hard.
What are the top three then?
I would say anything by George Strait. Cross my Heart probably.
He is amazing! I love all his stuff. The Check Yes or No, is my favorite.
That is a classic one.
Do you like Clint Black?
I do. I like his cover of "Desperado"
I think that song has been done so much. Cher, him, a bunch of others.
He does it better than Cher
You think?
He does. I like most country covers better than their other genre counter parts.
Even the Buble song?
Home? The one Blake Shelton did?
Yes. That one was awful.
Ok, so that one was not the best . He was not good at that song.
He does more country songs well.
I like his song Came here to forget.
I do too, I like She's got a way with words. Very romatic.
His romantic and funny songs are my favorite one.
