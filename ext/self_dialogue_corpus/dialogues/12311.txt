Did you see the Force Awakens yet?
Yeah, I saw it when it came out.
What did you think.
It was kind of over-rated to be honest.
Really? Everyone I've talked to liked it.
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.
Oh, I see. I was thinking of renting it from redbox this weekend.
It's not as good as the first three but definitely worth renting.
Cool I guess I'll check it out.
If you don't expect to much from it you'll enjoy it.
