Did you know that Bob Anderson was the Darth Vader stunt double?
Wow - his sword work was great.  Was he in the original?
Bob Anderson was in Empire and Return of the Jedi.
I really liked the lightsaber dual in The Empire Strikes Back.
It must have been hot operating the Jabba the Hut giant puppet.
Yeah, that was a lot of work, but it was great practical effects.
I read that the set was raised for Yoda on Empire so that Frank Oz could fit underneath.
And then I guess Luke Skywalker had a puppet on his back during the running sequences.
Do you know where they filmed in the original Star Wars?
I think they filmed it in Tunisia and England.
