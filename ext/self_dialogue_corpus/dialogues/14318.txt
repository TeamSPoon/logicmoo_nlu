So who won last night's game between the Warriors and Spurs?
Warriors...big time?
Oh...how much did they win by?
A lot. I think it was over 20 points.
Let me check it out on the ESPN App
Yeah, that's a great app.
Oh many, 120-108...what a victory
Yikes, so does that mean they're up 3-0?
Yes, Warriors up 3-0
Geez, those guys are dominant
Yeah, it doesn't look like there will be much competition from the Spurs
Remember when the Spurs were great?
Yeah, very underrated team since 1999
Yeah, Tim Duncan was a very good player
But he didn't have any flashy moves so wasn't a big highlight guy
Yeah, the Big Fundamental
Greg Poppovich is a great coach as well
Yeah, I think he's probably thinking of retirement now
Really? I didn't hear about that
Well, just my own intuition. Nothing official yet.
