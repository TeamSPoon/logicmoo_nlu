It is going to be interesting to see who challenges New England this year. Someone has to step it up.
They are in an easy division. They are already in the playoffs.
There were some teams that had down years in the AFC last year that will probably do better this year.
Like who?
The Colts and the Steelers are good teams.
Colts have no offensive line. Andrew Luck is one hit away from being Steve Young.
What about the Steelers?
Ben is getting old and a shadow of his former self.
There is still the NFC, Green Bay, Dallas and Seattle are all good competition.
Green Bay puts up points but it has a suspect defense New England will take them apart.
Well in Dallas the quarterback controversy is over so they can focus on winning now.
Dak is a second year quarterback do you like your odds against five time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady.
What about the fact that Seattle still has the Legion of Boom to stop Brady.
How did work out last time they played them in the Super Bowl.
Are you one of those people who actually believes that the deflater was talking about losing weight?
A kid did a science fair project about it and he proved the science where it could have deflated naturally.
Now you are just being naive. I suppose it doesn't bother you that Roger Gooddell destroyed all the Spygate evidence.
Competitive advantage every team cheats a little bit.
How come they are team we are always talking about in the controversy. It is not because they are better than everyone else it is because they cheat more effectively.
Haters gonna hate.
