Hi there.
Hello.
How are you doing today?
Not bad.  How are you?
Good.
Do you like the music that is being made today?
I like some of it sure.
Well there is a whole lot.
Yeah I agree.
Was it always like that?
Well when I was growing up in the 70's it was a lot different.
How so?
Well now you can sit in your room for a few months on a laptop and make an album.
Guess you couldn't really do that back then huh.
Nope.
What current music do you like?
I like Bruno Mars quite a bit.
He does have a lot of great songs.
What is that new one called?
oh the Strawberry Champagne one, I don't know.
