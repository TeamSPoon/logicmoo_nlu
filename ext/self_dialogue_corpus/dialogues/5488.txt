what do you think about Wall-E?
Oh, I fell in love with both the movie and the little robot the first time I saw it
not surprised, it's such a romantic trip between 2 robots
it's hard, isn't it? to make a romantic movie that's for kids, and it's between robots.
it's difficult to think about indeed, but Disney did it again.
what's your most memorable moments from that movie?
I think it's definitely the wheel chair scene, where men no longer needs to walk, they go everywhere with elevated chairs
it's terrifying to think about, but I have seen some recent tech trends trying to push into that direction
Human just want to get lazy, don't they
yep, that's why we invent robots, so they can do the hard labor
