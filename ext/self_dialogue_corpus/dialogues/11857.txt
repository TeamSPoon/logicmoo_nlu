Hey do you like the Beatles?
They are OK; I like some of their stuff I hear on the radio.
What songs do you like?
I guess the pop type ones like "She Loves You" and "Eight Days a Week".
Oh, OK you like the early stuff. I prefer the older stuff but the early music is fun sometimes.
Yeah, the songs are cute and easy to listen to.
Yeah definitely. The early stuff was mostly John and Paul singing.
Oh yeah John Lennon. I like the harmonies.
Yeah John and Paul are amazing songwriters.
The ones I like tend to be pretty simple though.
