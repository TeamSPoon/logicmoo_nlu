What's your favorite football team?
In college or the NFL?
In the NFL.
Oh, the Denver Broncos.
Really?  Why?  You're from South Carolina.
When I was little, I had an aunt who lived in Colorado and she sent me a Broncos shirt as a birthday present.  I didn't know it was a football team but I liked the little horsie.
Really?  That's why you like the team?  Because of a shirt when you were little?
It's true.
You fell for the marketing.
I did.  But, that's why team merchandising is so important.
So, what's your second-favorite team?
Are you kidding?  There's no such thing as a second-favorite team!
But what it if the Broncos are terrible?  Who do you support then?
The Broncos!  They've been terrible before and probably will be again at some point.
The Patriots have never been terrible.
Is this a joke?  Prior to Tom Brady, the Patriots were awful for virtually all of their entire existence.
Really?  I had no idea.  I'm super young.
Obviously.
So who do you support in the Super Bowl if the Broncos aren't in it?
Whichever team I hate the least.
