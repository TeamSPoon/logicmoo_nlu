have you been seeing all the hoopla about Shia Leboeuf?
I have a little.
I had never noticed he had so many movies.
Yes, he had a lot in different genres.
What is his best you think?
I actually liked him a lot in the movie Holes.
That was based on a book right?
Yes. He played Stanley well in that one.
He was still a teen.
He is actually a great actor, odd personal life.
Have you seen any of his war movies?
Does Transformers count?
No, I mean like World War movies.
No, what are they called.
He was amazing in Fury.
Who else was in that one?
Brad Pitt.
I think I seen a trailer for that one, was it good?
It showed another side of the war.
I love Pitt when he is more than just a leading love guy.
