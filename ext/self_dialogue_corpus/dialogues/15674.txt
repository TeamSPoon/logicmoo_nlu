Hey did you ever listen to DMX?
Yeah I loved DMX when I was in high school!
I thought the dog barking thing was kinda funny.
Yeah he definitely had an original style.  But his beats were great.
I know, and he was really original.
He was.  That was a great time for hip hop music, though.
Yeah, all the great classics were big back then.  Tupac, Biggie, Dr. Dre, DMX, Jay-Z...
Yeah, they were definitely unique.  The stuff today can't touch the stuff from back then!
I know it.  When I turn it on today, I don't know what it is I'm listening to.
It all sounds the same to me.
But that DMX...you could play the whole album without skipping a song.
Yeah, you really could.  He had some kind of weird scar on his face, didn't he?
I think you're thinking of Scarface.  He was another great rapper.
No, I know who he is.  I mean DMX really did have a scar though.
I don't know, dude.  Maybe he did.
Whatever happened to him, is he still making music?
I'm not sure.  I don't really keep up with hip hop anymore.
It's gotten so bad.
Yeah, it has.  That's why I quit listening to it.
I did the same for the same reason.
