Did you ever see any of the Poltergeist movies?
Yes I've seen them all. Do you have a favorite?
Well part 1 will always be my favorite but part 2 comes in a close second.
Same for me, I loved the relationship between the Native American man and the little girl Carolyn.
She actually died not long after the making of those movies.
I know, a few people did. There were rumors that the movie was cursed.
Right because I believe they were toying with subject matter along with relics that they shouldn't have.
Part 3 wasn't all that good but it's still better than most modern horror movies.
That's absolutely true. The part where she gets sucked into the puddle in the parking garage was frightening.
I loved the use of mirrors in that movie. It shined a light on duality.
