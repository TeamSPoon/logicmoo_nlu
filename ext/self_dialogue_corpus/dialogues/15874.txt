What kind of genres do you like?
I like rock, instrumental, and jazz.
Have you heard of Explosions in the Sky?
Yeah aren't they a rock band?
Technically it's called post-rock, it's a sub genre of rock.
Nice, what was their last album?
It was The Wilderness which is also the name of the first song in the album.
What does the album sound like?
Well it's different than their previous albums. They use different instruments so the songs have a different timbre.
Which instruments do they use?
I think they use the guitar as well as a synthesizer and of course drums.
What are their other albums.
They have several others, my favorite is Take Care, Take Care, Take Care.
Why is that your favorite album?
It sounds like more traditional instrumental rock as opposed to electronic music.
Cool should I get that album?
If you want to, however don't if you prefer the more electronic and ambient sounding albums.
No I prefer instrumental rock to electronic or ambient.
Yeah I would say get that album rather than any of the earlier ones they don't have the same quality.
OK I'll get the album you suggested.
