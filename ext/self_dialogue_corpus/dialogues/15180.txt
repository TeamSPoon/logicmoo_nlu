I kind of like classical music, but am unsure about what 'classical" music actually is.
Well, what kind do you like?
I really like those big pieces for orchestra.
So maybe you like Romantic era music?
What's that?
Pieces of music that were usually written sometime between 1830 and 1914.
Wow, I had no idea. So would Tchaikovsky be Romantic music?
Absolutely!
Well, I do like his Piano Concerto. What else would I like by him, you think?
I bet you'd probably love his Symphonie pathétique, his sixth symphony.
What's so cool about it?
Lots of stuff. It's in a minor key, b minor, so it sounds really dark and sad. And it has really nice writing for low register instruments like cello.
Okay, that sounds promising.
Also, there's a lot of debate about whether there's a "secret" program associated with this piece. Like whether Tchaikovsky was trying to tell some sort of specific story through the music.
Cool. Have they ever proven that in any way?
No. In fact, Tchaikovsky didn't even call it the Pathetique at first—that was only added right after he died.
Interesting! When did he die?
Right after this piece premiered! That's another reason people find it interesting. It's sort of his last great hit.
Whoa, people were obsessed with that kind of plot line even in the 1890s?
Oh yeah, we've been obsessed with dramatic stories about music for a long time!
