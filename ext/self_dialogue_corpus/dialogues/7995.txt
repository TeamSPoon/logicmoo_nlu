What do you think of Ariana Grande?
I think she has one of the best voices to come out in a long time.
She's so beautiful too.
She really is. Have you ever heard "Side to Side" by her?
That's the one with Nicki Minaj, right?
Yeah. I'm always singing that song.
That song has such a cool swing to it.
It's one of my favorites on her album "Dangerous Woman".
Did she have an album besides that? That's the only one I know.
She actually has something like 7 albums currently. That one is the most popular, though.
