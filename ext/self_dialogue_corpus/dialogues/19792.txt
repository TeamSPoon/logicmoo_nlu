I'm thinking that I may go to Warped Tour this summer.
Really? I've never been to it. Isn't it mostly kids?
Yeah..I've been to a lot of other festivals but Warped never really appealed to me. There's a couple good bands playing this year's.
Really? Who?
Hatebreed who I never miss, Alestorm who is this awesome pirate metal band.
I've heard you talk about Alestorm. They're pirate metal?
Yeah, their songs are about alcohol and pillaging, they're really fun to listen to.
I think I saw Hatebreed years ago, I remember liking their show.
Yeah, I've seen Hatebreed probably a dozen times. Super high energy and really nice guys.
Doesn't the singer have a solo band too?
Yeah! Jamey Jasta, he just had a new album come out and he opened for Killswitch Engage and Anthrax when they were in town.
OK, I thought so! I was at that show. They were really good.
You went to the Killswitch Engage and Anthrax concert? I was there too! Which band was your favorite?
I went to see Anthrax, it was cool to hear the old stuff. I love Caught in the Mosh. I did stay for Killswitch Engage and those guys were really good too.
I know, that's who I went for. Jesse's songwriting on their new album Incarnate is so good.
I'll have to check it out. I think I listened to them years ago when the other guy was singing for them.
Yeah, he has a new band now. Jesse was the original singer, I'm glad he's back. Have you been to any other concerts lately?
No, I'm thinking about going to see Mushroomhead when they're in town. How about you?
I went to Coheed & Cambria and Seether a couple weeks ago and we went to Columbus to see City and Colour last week. I'm a little bit of a concert junkie.
You really are. I like the new Seether album, Poison the Parish. It's nice to see that they're getting heavier again.
