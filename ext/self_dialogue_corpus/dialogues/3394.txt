You ever see Friday the 13th?
I believe so, the one with Jason and the hockey mask?
Well, yes, but the original one was a bit different.
How so?
Well, Jason didn't actually have a hockey mask.
Oh really, what did he have?
it was more of a sack with an eye hole
Creepy
Yeah, and the big twist was that his mom was the killer at the lake
I missed that one.
