Did you hear that David Bowie died?
Oh, no! That's terrible. When did that happen?
It was at the very beginning of 2016. He died of cancer.
That's so sad. He was one of my favorite musicians.
Mine too. And his new record was great too.
I didn't realize he had released a new record. When did it come out?
It came out just a few days before he died.
Wow, really? That's so sad.
It was. The album was sad too, a lot of the things were about dying and growing old.
What was it called?
Blackstar. It got really good reviews.
I don't know if I could listen to that.
You definitely have to be in the right place emotionally. It's sad, but also hopeful, somehow.
What was your favorite Bowie album?
That's a tough question. I would have to say Hunky Dory or Station to Station.
I love Hunky Dory. I think Ziggy is still my favorite.
Ziggy's classic. It's amazing how much good music he produced in the 70s.
I could listed to any one of his albums and love it.
Me too. May he rest in peace.
Yeah, long live David Bowie!
