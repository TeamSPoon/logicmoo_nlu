I don't think that Hogwarts should keep Slytherin house around - all the wizards that came out of there were evil.
Not all Slytherins are evil. Snape wasn't evil.
Snape wasn't evil exactly, but he wasn't actually a good guy. He treated his students really unfairly.
Yeah, but he was basically a double agent, fighting against the most powerful evil wizard in the world.
Okay, but all the other Slytherins were evil.
Do you think Horace Slughorn was evil?
He was very selfish and narcissistic.
I don't think that makes someone evil - he still tried to help his students.
He only cared about protecting himself and "collecting" students.
I still don't think that makes him evil. All people are a little selfish.
