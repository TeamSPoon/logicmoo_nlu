Will the Sixers ever be good again?
Depends on what they do this year
In free agency?
Combination of both
I mean Okafor, Saric, Embiid, Simmons, and a draft pick?
That seems like it could be an all star lineup
I just dont see where Okafor fits in
Either does Colangelo
You think they trade him?
Yes  and for pennies on the dollar.
He doesnt have that much worth anyway
Sure he does, they dont know how to use him.
Thats crazy, I thought he was a good player at Duke.
Hasnt translated to the NBA yet
But still the talent is there.
Well Boston would probably be best for him.
Is he a role player?
I think maybe, but right now I would still see if you can get 35 minutes out of him
Lofty goals for a guy who cant stay healthy
Well the Sixers have a terrible medical staff
