% Some Inform properties:
% light - rooms that have light in them
% can(eat) - can be eaten
% static - can"t be taken or moved
% scenery - assumed to be in the room description (implies static)
% concealed - obscured, not listed, not part of "all", but there
% found_in - lists places where scenery objects are seen
% absent - hides object entirely
% clothing - can be worn
% worn - is being worn
% container
% (opened = t) - container is open (must_mw be opened) to be used. there is no "closed").
% can(open) - can be opened and closed
% capacity(N) - number of objects a container or supporter can hold
% state(locked) - cannot be opened
% can(lock), with_key
% enterable
% supporter
% article - specifies indefinite article ("a", "le")
% cant_go
% daemon - called each turn, if it is enabled for this object
% description
% inside_description
% invent - code for inventory listing of that object
% list_together - way to handle "5 fish"
% plural - pluralized-name =  if different from singular
% when_closed - description when closed
% when_open - description when (opened = t)
% when_on, when_off - like when_closed, etc.
% Some TADS properties:
% thedesc
% pluraldesc
% is_indistinguishable
% is_visible(vantage)
% touchable($agent, actor)
% valid(verb) - is object seeable, touchable, etc.
% verification(verb) - is verb logical for this object
% Parser disambiguation:
% eliminate objs not visalbe, touchable, etc.
% check preconditions for acting on a candidate object
