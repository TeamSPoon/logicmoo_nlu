Natural language processing requires ecient and powerful tools for representing and process-
ing knowledge. This paper introduces the system CGPro which implements the Conceptual
Graphs (CG) formalism. CGs are a logic-based formalism developed by John F. Sowa on the
basis of Charles S. Peirce's existential graphs and semantic networks. Conceptual structures
proved to be rather convenient as a semantic representation for natural language. CGPro is
an ecient and powerful implementation of a Conceptual Graphs representation in Prolog
and provides all the operations which are most useful for natural language processing. This
paper introduces the functionality of CGPro and describes the motivation for design decisions
as well.

1 Introduction
This paper describes in detail the Prolog representation of Conceptual Graphs (CGs) which
was used for CGPro and all basic CG operations. With the introduced implementation we
aimed at solving the problems associated with representing contexts and n-adic relations of
other existing systems.
First, we introduce our representation of graphs, referent elds, individuals and lambda ab-
stractions. Afterwards, we compare it to other existing Prolog representations. Section 3
contains a description of predicates implementing basic access functions for the data struc-
tures de ned in the previous section. Furthermore we outline the implementation of the
"real\ CG operations { copy, restrict, join, simplify, maximal join, projection, and a special
"extended\ projection algorithm.
Special attention was paid to the representation of the referent eld. We have chosen feature
structures because they can be handled and compared easily. Therefore we are able to obtain
the resulting referent eld of a join-operation by simple uni cation of the feature structures.
With CGPro, we satisfy the needs of two application projects { a project for knowledge
acquisition from natural language texts and a German-Bulgarian Machine Aided Translation
project2.

2 Representing Conceptual Graphs in PROLOG
2.1 Graph representation
With our representation, we want to ful ll the postulates concerning features of a good CG
representation given in (Sowa and Way1986):

      connectivity (traverse the entire graph starting from a concept)
      generality (adequate representation of n-adic relations and several arcs pointing to or
       from a concept)
      no priviledged nodes (each concept can be a head)
      canonical formation rules (copy, restrict, join, simplify), which are eciently imple-
       mented for the selected representation

All known and available representations (see section 2.8) lack at least one of these features.
Therefore, we propose the following representation satisfying all points mentioned above:

       cg(GraphID, RelationList).
       cgc(ConceptID, ContextFlag, ConceptName, ReferentField, AnnotationField).
       RelationList     ::=    [cgr(RelName, ArgList, Annotation), ... ]
       ArgList          ::=    [ConceptID, ...]
       ContextFlag      ::=    normal j special.
       ConceptName      ::=    Specialname j Identi er.
       Specialname      ::=    context j neg context j situation j statement j proposition.

The basic building blocks in this representation are graphs and concepts. Both are represented
as facts, namely cg/2 (\Conceptual Graph") and cgc/5 (\Conceptual Graph Concept").
Every graph and concept has a unique identi er (Id). Relations between concepts do not
have identi ers and occur only as terms in cg/2 facts.
GraphID and ConceptID are unique identi ers for all graphs or concepts. Even though
the representation is unambiguos concerning the kind of identi ers at each argument place,
it is easier to handle only one sort of identi ers for GraphIDs and ConceptIDs.
ArgList is an ordered list of concepts, where the number of the arc corresponds to the
concept's place in this list. For an n-adic relation, the arcs are numbered from 1 to n, and
the outgoing arc is the last one.



                                                3
Sowa distinguishes between simple and compound graphs. Simple graphs are those without
nested contexts and lines of identity3 . In this case, the RelationList contains the list of the
relations of the simple graph, or, if the graph consists of only one concept and thus of no
relation, a one-element list with the special relation name norel. In the latter case, ArgList
is a list of only one element.
A compound graph consists of one or more `toplevel' simple graphs that may contain nested
graphs. These toplevel graphs need not be connected directly, but in this case they must
contain nested graphs that are connected by a line of identity. In a compound graph the
RelationList contains the list of all of the relations of the toplevel graphs. It is not dis-
tinguished which toplevel graph a relation belongs to. Each of the relations may again be a
norel relation if the corresponding graph consists of only one concept.
Graph nesting is implemented as follows: A context is established as a special kind of concept
whose referent eld contains a list of the Ids of the nested graphs.
Coreferent concepts in a graph (i.e. those that share the same variable in the linear form or
those that belong to the same line of identity) are represented internally as one concept. As a
consequence of this a concept can occur in several contexts at once as long as these contexts
belong to the same (compound) graph.
Concepts are represented as 5-Tupels. ContextFlag is a ag which is set if the concept is
of a special type e.g. context, situation, proposition, and so on. In this case, ContextFlag
has the value special , otherwise it is normal. ConceptName is a typename or the name of
a special context, respectively. For description of the ReferentField, see section 2.2 below.
Since the possible applications of the AnnotationField are not clearly de ned, all given
examples contain empty annotation elds.
An example of a simple conceptual graph containing a situation is given in gure 1 in graphical
notation, in gure 2 in linear form and in gure 3 in the internal representation.

    Note that a line of identity is only a way to show concept equivalence when a concept occurs in multiple
contexts and thus is never needed for simple graphs.

2.2 Representation of the Concept's Referent Field
In the basic conceptual graph notation only three kinds of referent elds are permitted {
generic (existential), individual marker, and literal. Measures, sets, names, and quanti ers
are extended referents, i.e. they are the result of some contraction operation. In our system
we want to support all these extended referents, especially the four kinds of set referents {
collective, distributive, cumulative and disjunctive (see (Sowa1984, Sowa1992)). Therefore we
introduce the following representation for the referent eld.

In table 1 there is a summary of the most frequently used kinds of referent elds together
with an example, its natural language reading and the corresponding representation.4
          <Referent>             ::= "[" <RefNumber> ["," <RefType>] ["," <RefQuant>]
                                     ["," <RefID>] ["," <RefName>] ["," <QuantScope>] "]"
          <RefNumber>            ::=   num ":" <ReferentNumber>
          <RefType>              ::=   type ":" <ReferentType>
          <RefQuant>             ::=   quant ":" <QuantType>
          <RefID>                ::=   refID ":" <IndivID>
          <RefName>              ::=   name ":" <Marker>
          <QuantScope>           ::=   scope ":" <Scope>
          <ReferentNumber>       ::=   sing j plural
          <ReferentType>         ::=   def j meas j quest
          <QuantType>            ::=   every j lambda
          <Scope>                ::=   disjunct j dist j col j cum
          <Marker>               ::=   <IndName> j <RefSet>
          <IndivID>              ::=   Number
          <IndName>              ::=   " ' " UpperLetterjSmallLetter ... " ' "
          <RefSet>               ::=   "[" <IndName> ["," <IndName> ]... "]"
                      Figure 4: A BNF grammar of the referent eld structure
Figure 4 contains a BNF grammar specifying the possible attributes and their values.
The referent eld will be represented as a Prolog list of binary terms:
                                  [fs(F1,V1), fs(F2,V2), ...        ]

Predicates operating on the referent eld are described in section 3.3.5.

2.3 Representation of Individuals
Individuals are represented as ternary relations in the knowledge base:
                                        ind(IndId,Name,Type)

IndId must be provided by the user in the referent eld of concepts. Name is the name of the
individual and Type is a type of the type hierarchy. Example:
        [CAT: TOM #123 ] ind(123, TOM, CAT)
        [CAT: TOM # ]          is not an individual as the user has not de ned an Id

2.4 Type De nitions
In the conceptual graph formalism new concept types are introduced by type de nitions.
The operations acting upon them are type expansion and type contraction. Following Sowa's
  4
      Most of the examples are taken from (Sowa1993).

                                                        6
de nition (Sowa1984, pp.106 { 112), type de nitions are represented as binary relations:
                    typedef(TypeName, lambda(VarList, GraphId))

The linear form of type de nitions will be interpreted by the linear form parser (see sec-
tion 4.2.2):
             TypeDef ::= "type" <TypeName>"("<VarList>")" "is" < Graph >
typedef/2 and Graph will be asserted in the knowledge base and its GraphId will be included
in the typedef/2 relation. VarList is a regular Prolog list of all arguments of the de ned
type. Example:
              type POSITIVE(x) is [NUMBER: *x] -> (">") -> [NUMBER: 0]
will be asserted in the knowledge base in the following relations:

      cg(1,[cgr("<",[2,3])])

      cgc(2,normal,'NUMBER',[quant:lambda],_)
      cgc(3,normal,'NUMBER',[type:meas,name:0],_)

      typedef('POSITIVE', lambda([x],1))


Note that type de nitions do not expand the type hierarchy automatically. The user is
responsible for providing the corresponding isa/2 relations.

2.5 Relation De nitions
Relation de nitions are supported similarly to type de nitions. They will be represented in
the knowledge base as binary relations:
                     reldef(RelName, lambda(VarList, GraphId))

This relation is a result of parsing the following linear form:
            RelDef ::= "relation" <RelName>"("<VarList>")" "is" < Graph >
reldef/2 and Graph are asserted into the knowledge base by the parser.



2.6 Type Hierarchy
The type hierarchy is represented as binary relations:
                                 isa(SubType,SuperType)

It can be loaded from a le with loadKBase/2. isa/2 relations are not parsed by the linear
form parser but are consulted by the Prolog system.
                                              7
2.7 Attribute Lists
It is very important for the user developing a real world application that there is a possibility
for organizing graphs in groups. For this reason, the system supports a mechanism for marking
graphs with attributes. Some useful attributes might be: 'canonical', 'typedefs', 'reldefs',
'temp'. For this purpose, attribute lists are provided:
                                     attrList(Name,GraphId)

In principle the user should take care of managing these lists. The system provides some
predicates for this (see section 4.1). All operations changing the knowledge base work
with the current attribute list. This variable can be handled with setCurAttrList/1 and
getCurAttrList/1.



2.8 Other Prolog Representations
2.8.1 Representing Conceptual Graphs as triples
We would like to introduce the representation adopted in (Hook and Ahmad1992).
Each conceptual graph is decomposed into canonical graphs5 consisting of two concepts linked
by a relation. The investigation made by the authors of (Hook and Ahmad1992) proved that
all relations in a Terminology Knowledge Base (TKB) are binary, i.e. connecting exactly
two concepts. Their conceptual graph TKB consists of a set of canonical graphs and a type
hierarchy. All canonical graphs are stored as:

          is canonical graph('emission control device' : type : 'catalytic converter').

Each conceptual graph is represented as a Prolog list of triples:

                                     concept : relation : concept

In (Hook and Ahmad1992) the type hierarchy is generalized to a set of conceptual graphs
containing the type relation. Due to the fact that the inheritance mechanism depends on the
type hierarchy, the type relation is of particular importance.
This representation handles very simple conceptual graphs. They are suitable mainly for
knowledge bases in very speci c domains, where all relations are binary. Another problem
of that approach is the redundant information. Each concept participating in more than one
relation occurs more than once in the list. When specialization is performed, the list should
be searched completely for all occurences of a certain concept (the one to be restricted).
  5
    Here the term `canonical' is used in its general meaning. Thus these `canonical graphs' are not Sowa's
`canonical graphs', but simply a normalized form of a graph representation.

                                                    8
2.8.2 Representing Conceptual Graphs as Concept and Relation lists
(Sowa and Way1986) proposed a more structured representation:
cg( <ConceptList>, <RelationList>)
ConceptList := [cgc(<ConceptNo>, <ConceptName>, <Referent>), ... ]
RelationList := [cgr(<ConceptNo>, <RelationName>, <ConceptNo>), ... ]
Although one graph is represented as only one data structure, e.g. graph traversing will be
easier than in (Hook and Ahmad1992), we do encounter the following problems:

  1. Graph referents: [PROPOSITION: Graph] is transformed into
     [PROPOSITION] -> (STMT) -> Graph
     The same holds for STATE, SITUATION and CONTEXT.
  2. 3-adic relation representation. Let's take BETW for example. Using the above repre-
     sentation, we are forced to have 2 or 3 entries in the RelationList for one relation. Apart
     from that, we do not have a clearly de ned order of the relation arcs, which contradicts
     to the fact that the arcs should be numbered for all n-adic relations (n  3).
  3. There is redundant information in the cgc-structure. If we have the same concepts in
     di erent CGs then all that information is included in every cgc-structure. Representing
     all concepts into a separate concept table avoids this kind of redundancy. Additionally,
     garbage collection techniques can be applied in order to abandon all concepts not used
     in the knowledge base.

3 Implementation of some operations on CGs
Although our internal representation handles complex graphs properly, some of the operations
are implemented only for simple graphs with situations, propositions, and statements. Our
further goal will be to extend our algorithms for complex graphs. But nevertheless the set of
operations handled by the system is complete and will remain unchanged.

3.1 Overview
The following sections contain a structured description of our Prolog implementation with
predicate names, arguments and brief explanations. First we introduce some abstract data
types - concepts (see 3.3.1), conceptual graphs (see 3.3.2), types (see 3.3.3), individuals (see
3.3.4) and referents (see 3.3.5). A set of standard operations belongs to all ADTs { contructors,
destructors, accessors, copy and equality test. Additionally, each ADT has some speci c
operations (eg. subConcept, minComSuperType), and their semantics is taken from the CG
theory.6 Since we rely on the reader's knowledge of conceptual graphs, we have ommited all
functionality details of implemented operations.
The ADTs comprise a basis which the four canonical formation rules and some other CG
operations are built upon. All CG operations have both destructive and non-destructive
versions. Section 3.4 contains the de nitions of copy, restrict, simplify and join. Match,
projection and maximal join are introduced in section 3.5. Apart from the standard projection
algorithm we have implemented an extended projection (see 3.5) that has proven to be rather
useful for some Natural Language (NL) applications. Type and relation expansion/contraction
operations (see 3.6) enable the active use of new types and relations.
In order to distinguish between various kinds of graphs, we have introduced attribute lists
(see 4.1). They are used to group the graphs according to their semantics (eg. canonical,
situations, type de nitions, etc.). The system always deals with the current attribute list.
Finally, we introduce some predicates for handling the Knowledge Base (KB) - load, load with
convert, save and restore (see 4.2.1). For initializing the knowledge base, we implemented
a linear notation parser which converts les containing graphs in linear notation into the
internal representation (see 4.2.2).

3.2 General Conventions
3.2.1 Programming Conventions
Concerning uppercase vs. lowercase and the use of underscores, predicate and variable names
are represented as follows: predicateName(VarName, ...). Underscores are never used
  6
      For a short introduction see (Sowa1992).

                                                 10
except of course as identi er for the anonymous variable.
All predicates obey the following rules concerning the order of arguments:

      Relational binary predicates have their arguments in the order that renders identifying
       the relation as an in x naturally. Example: isa(V1, V2) means V1 isa V2.
      Data structure accessors have the output argument in the last position.
      Functional predicates have the output argument in the last position. join(G1,G2,G3)
       joins G1 and G2 to yield G3.
      Destructive operations have the input/output argument in the rst position. join(G1,G2)
       joins G1 with G2 and returns the modi ed G1.

3.2.2 Format of the Predicate Descriptions
Below, the predicates are described in the following format:

predicate(Argument1, . . . )
Description text
Arguments:
    Argument1      Type of Argument1
    ..             ..
     .              .

In the rst line the argument's names are preceded by one of three mode speci ers: + means
the argument must be instantiated, - means it must be free, and ? means it can be anything.
Note that Id arguments of objects that are modi ed by the operation have mode + because
the Id is not changed.

3.3 Concepts, Graphs, Types, Individuals and Referents as Abstract Data
    Types
Generally, the operations on compound objects comprise constructors (that build a new object
from its parts), destructors, accessors (that return the parts of a given object), a copy oper-
ation and an equality test. The name of the constructor for datatype object is newObject, of
the destructor deleteObject and of the accessors objectSlot. The copy operation is named
copyObject and the equality test equalObject.

Also generally all objects are referred to internally by their Ids, e.g. when being passed as
arguments. This holds for graphs, concepts and individals. Some operations on these data
                                              11
structures work destructively. This means that the data structure pointed to by the Id changes
while the Id of the input and the result is the same. A nondestructive operation returns a
new Id for these kinds of objects.
All operations on graphs take care of creating new concepts where necessary to ensure that
any concept is contained in one graph at most. For instance the destructive \join" operation
{ that modi es one of the input graphs { copies the other input graph so that only new
concepts are joined to the rst graph.

3.3.1 Concepts
Concepts are represented as 5-tupels:
   cgc(ConceptID, ContextFlag, ConceptName, ReferentField, AnnotationField)



newConcept(+Category, +Type, ?Referent,
           ?Annotation, ?Concept)

concepts and subgraphs through the process of copying.
Arguments:
     GraphOrig Graph Id
     GraphCopy Graph Id
     MapOut       Term map/2

The graph copy operation is actually already one of Sowa's CG operations. It is nevertheless
de ned here because it is needed for completeness of the ADT.

too.

     Graph1 Graph Id
     Graph2 Graph Id

nested graphs, the concepts in these graphs are neglected.
Arguments:
     Graph Graph Id
     Concept Concept Id

Automatic Management of Attribute Lists
The newGraph operation puts the new graph on the current attribute list. Some operations,
e.g. join, use temporary graphs that are deleted in the course of the operation. This is

                                            16
accomplished by using the predicate deleteGraph which besides deleting the graph also
removes it from all attribute lists. As an additional way to delete graphs there is the predicate
deleteAllGraphs that deletes all graphs that are on a given attribute list and clears this list.
This way the implementation takes care that no attribute list contains a reference to a deleted
graph and that every graph is at least on one attribute list.

3.3.3 Types

     referent eld is unifyable with the Referent2. In this case, Referent3 is the result of
     the uni cation. Otherwise the predicate fails.
  2. If rule 1 was not successful and Referent1 represents a question, then is matches ev-
     erything if the rest of the referent eld is unifyable with Referent2. Referent3 is the
     result of the uni cation. Otherwise the predicate fails.
  3. If rule 1 and 2 were not successful, Referent1 is generic or a partial set and Referent2
     is of type measure, then the match succeeds if the number of elements of the set in
     Referent1 is less than the number of elements in Referent2 and the feature structures
     are unifyable.

3.4 The four canonical formation rules

copy(+GraphIn, -GraphOut)
Copy a conceptual graph. In LPA-Prolog this operation is called copyCG/2 as there is already
a system predicate copy/2 with di erent semantics. This is the same operation as the `copy'
operation of the graph ADT.
Arguments:
     GraphIn Graph Id
     GraphOut Graph Id

The following operations are provided in two di erent versions, one that modi es one of the
input arguments and one that does not. The destructive versions are useful for avoiding
excess garbage generation if several operations are executed for a graph in sequence.

restrict(+Graph, +Concept, +Type, +Referent)
restrict(+GraphIn, +Concept, +Type, +Referent, -GraphOut)
Given a graph and a concept in it, change the type or/and the referent by restrictimg them
further. This is allowed only if the conformity relation still holds after the operation. The type
may be restricted by replacing it by a subtype. The referent may be restricted by replacing
a generic marker by an individual, conforming to the (new) type, or by feature-structure
operations, corresponding to specialisation. The rst version modi es Graph, the second one
returns the new GraphOut as its result.
Arguments:
     Graph         Graph Id
     Concept Concept Id
     Type          Type
     Referent Referent
     GraphIn Graph Id
     GraphOut Graph Id

join(+Graph1, +Graph2)
join(+Graph1, +Graph2, -GraphOut)
join(+Graph1, +Concept1, +Graph2, +Concept2)
join(+Graph1, +Concept1, +Graph2, +Concept2,
     -GraphOut, -ConceptOut)
This joins Graph1 and Graph2. The four versions di er in two aspects, namely whether they
modify Graph1 or not and whether the concepts on which to join the graphs are provided
explicitly. In the rst two versions the concepts are not provided. They deliver all possible
joins on backtracking. In the last two versions Concept1 is the concept in Graph1 and
Concept2 is the concept in Graph2 on which to join the graphs. Both concepts must be
equal, otherwise the join will fail. To achieve a join on compatible concepts that are not
equal the input concepts must be made equal by restricting them in advance. The resulting
concept is provided in ConceptOut. The rst and third version modify Graph1 and the second
and fourth version provide the result in a new graph GraphOut. Graph2 is always copied in
advance and never modi ed.
Arguments:
     Graph1        Graph Id
     Graph2        Graph Id
     GraphOut Graph Id
     Concept1 Concept Id
     Concept2 Concept Id
     ConceptOut Concept Id

simplify(+Graph)
simplify(+GraphIn, -GraphOut)
Simplify a graph by deleting all duplicate relations in it. The rst version modi es Graph,
the second one returns the simpli ed GraphIn as GraphOut and leaves GraphIn as it was.
Arguments:
     Graph       Graph Id
     GraphIn Graph Id
     GraphOut Graph Id

3.5 Match, Projection and Maximal Join

match(+Graph1, Graph2)
Succeeds if Graph1 is a generalization of Graph2. Comparing concepts takes into account the
type hierarchy and will match the referents (compare matchReferent/3.
Arguments:
     Graph1 Graph Id
     Graph2 Graph Id

maximalJoin(+Graph1, +Graph2)
maximalJoin(+Graph1, +Graph2, -Graph3)
These predicates realize the maximal join operations for conceptual graphs. For the de nition
refer to (Sowa1984, p.104). The two versions di er in modifying Graph2; maximalJoin/2
modi es Graph2 which is the result of this operation. Graph2 should be more speci c than
Graph1. maximalJoin will take into account the type hierarchy and will match the referents
(compare matchReferent/3).
Arguments:
      Graph1 Graph Id
      Graph2 Graph Id
      Graph3 Graph Id

projection(+Graph1, +Graph2, -Graph3)
Given two conceptual graphs nd the projection of Graph1 on Graph2. The resulting Graph3
is not empty if and only if Graph2 is a specialization of Graph1. The projection operation is
type, relation and structure preserving. For the respective algorithm see (Sowa1984, p.99).
Arguments:
     Graph1 Graph Id
     Graph2 Graph Id
     Graph3 Graph Id


extendedProjection(+Graph1, +Graph2, -Graph3)
Graph3  is the extended projection7 of Graph2 (the query graph) on Graph1. The most
important feature is that Graph2 contains at least one uninstantiated concept (corresponding
to a question referent). In a NL application this graph might be created as a semantic
representation of a user's question. The resulting graph is obtained by nding the projection
  7
      This predicate is not yet implemented.

                                               26
of Graph2 on Graph1 and adding all concepts directly linked to an uninstantiated concept
from the query graph. Let us consider the following graphs:
Graph1: [CAT] -> (ON) -> [MAT] -> (ATTR) -> [RED]
Graph2: [CAT] -> (ON) -> [?]
The result of the normal projection algorithm is just:
[CAT] -> (ON) -> [MAT]
The result of the extended projection algorithm is the whole Graph1.
Possible modi cation of this algorithm includes a parameter for the depth of the extension,
i.e. for depth n add all concepts, being n relations 'far' from an uninstantiated concept in
the query graph. This parameter can be also dependent on the relation types in the query
graph.8
Arguments:
      Graph1 Graph Id
      Graph2 Graph Id
      Graph3 Graph Id

3.6 Type and Relation Expansion/Contraction9
Since we support both type and relation de nitions (i.e. give a mechanism for de ning new
types and relations), we also provide expansion and contraction operations. In our imple-
mentation we stick to the algorithms described in (Sowa1984, pp. 107-109, p.115). It is
recommended to apply these operations on canonical graphs, since Sowa has proved that the
result is also a canonical graph (i.e. in this case the operations are truth-preserving).
All four operations take as input a graph Id (the graph to be expanded/contracted), an Id
of a di erentia graph (type de nition) or a relator graph (relation de nition). The output
graph is always the last argument.

     Graph3 Graph Id

typeContraction(+Graph1, +Graph2)
typeContraction(+Graph1, +Graph2, -Graph3)
This predicate realizes the type contraction operation. Graph1 is a graph, Graph2 is the
di erentia of a type de nition and Graph3 is the resulting graph from which a subgraph has
been deleted and replaced by a single concept (the genus of the type de nition).
The two versions di er in modifying Graph1; typeContraction/2 modi es Graph1 which is
the result of this operation.
Arguments:

graph, Graph2 is the relator of a relation de nition. Graph3 is the resulting graph obtained
from Graph1 after a conceptual relation, and its attached concepts are replaced with Graph2.
The two versions di er in modifying Graph1; relationExpansion/2 modi es Graph1, which
is the result of this operation.
Arguments:
      Graph1 Graph Id

which is the result of this operation.
Arguments:
     Graph1 Graph Id

4 Service Features
For a more convinient use of the system, we added some service features described in this
section. Attribute lists are provided for graph organization. File operations help saving and
restoring the knowledge base.

4.1 Attribute Lists
In this chapter, predicates for managing attribute lists are described. The system provides this
feature for the user to organize the graphs in groups and to assign attributes to them. Some
useful attributes could be canonical, typedef, temporary. The user is fully responsible for
managing these lists. The system supports a current attribute list, and all newly created
graphs are inserted there automatically. Therefore the system provides some predicates for
managing the current attribute list. All existing attribute lists are saved and restored together
with the rest of the KB (see 4.2.1).

getCurAttrList(-Name)
Uni es Name with the name of the current attribute list.
Arguments:
    Name Atom

setCurAttrList(+Name)
Sets the current attribute list to Name.
Arguments:
     Name Atom

addAttrList(+Name, +Graph)
Adds Graph to the attribute list named     Name.    If there is no such attribute list, it will be
created.
Arguments:
     Name Atom
     Graph Graph ID




                                               30
deleteAttrList(?Name, ?Graph)
Removes the Graph from the attribute list named Name. The Graph itself is not deleted. In
case one or both arguments are variables, during backtracking all matching pairs of Name and
Graph are deleted.

Arguments:
     Name Atom
     Graph Graph ID

getAttrList(?Name, ?Graph)
Succeeds if Name is the name of an attribute list Graph is contained in. If one or both
arguments are variables on backtracking all matching pairs are found. This allows nding all
graphs on a given attribute list or all attribute lists of a given graph.
Arguments:
     Name Atom
     Graph Graph ID

deleteAllGraphs(+Name)
All graphs that are on the attribute list named Name are deleted from the knowledge base,
and the list is emptied. Name must be completely bound to avoid deleting all graphs on all
lists accidentally.
Arguments:
      Name Atom

deleteAllAttrLists(+Graph)
The Graph is removed from all attribute lists it is on. It is not deleted itself.   Graph   must be
completely bound to avoid accidentally deleting all graphs on all lists.
Arguments:
    Graph Graph ID




                                               31
4.2 Initializing and Saving the Knowledge Base
4.2.1 Loading, Saving and Restoring the Knowledge Base

loadKBase( +File )
This predicate will load and parse a le, containing the following relations in prolog syntax.

    cg(CG) - CG is a conceptual graph satisfying the linear form, including   type and relation
     de nitions.
    isa(Subtype, Supertype)


The current attribute list is initialized with the value defaultAttrList.
Arguments:
    File Atom

loadKBasewithconvert( +File )
This predicate reads a le and converts the content. The user gives the rules for converting
Term1 into Term2:

                   convert( +Term1, +Term2 ) :-     <converting          >
                                                                   rules .

It is possible to have more then one converting rule but only one rule per Term1. Example:
                      convert(lex(Word,Graph),plex(Word,ID)) :-
                              parseCG(ID,Graph).

The current attribute list is initialized with the value defaultAttrList.
Arguments:
    File Atom

Working with the system it is important to be able to save and restore sessions. Therefore
the system o ers two predicates. Saving and restoring includes all parts of the knowledge
base:




                                             32
            Table 2: Parts of the Knowldege Base to be saved with saveKBase/1
                conceptual graphs              cg/2
                                               cgc/5
                type hierarchy                 isa/2
                type de nitions                typedef/2
                relation de nitions            relationdef/2
                individuals                    ind/3
                attribute lists                attrList/2
                name of current attribut list curAttrList (global variable)
                current identi er              nextId (global variable)
For the exact format of relations in table 2 see section 2.

saveKBase( +File )
Save all parts of the knowledge base in File. If File does not exist the system will search
for le File.cg.
Arguments:
     File Atom

restoreKBase( +File )
Restore the conceptual graph knowledge base from File. If File does not exist the system
will search for le File.cg. It is important that File is a le that has been created by
saveKBase.

Arguments:
     File Atom

4.2.2 Parsing Conceptual Graphs In Linear Notation
The system provides a parser which converts the linear form to our internal representation
(see section 2). The parser accepts conceptual graphs in linear notation as it is speci ed in
(Esch et al.1994).




                                              33
parseCG(+LGraph, -GraphID)
The predicate parseCG/2 parses the rst argument LGraph. The identi er of the parsed
graph will be uni ed with GraphID and the graph and all concepts will be asserted into the
knowledge base. The graph will be added to the current attribute list (if existing).
Arguments:
    LGraph Atom; CG in linear form
    GraphID Atom

5 Conclusion
This paper has introduced a thorough description of a CG representation in Prolog and the
basic graph operations. We have introduced abstract data types (ADTs) for concepts, graphs,
types, referents and individuals. For each ADT, a list of operations has been provided. These
data types have been used as building blocks for the implementation of all basic CG operations
(e.g. copy, maximal join, etc.).
A running implementation exists both for SNI and LPA Prolog. There are some algorithms
that need further re nement, but the main part is completed. Additional work aims at the
development of new algorithms for proper handling of complex graphs, and the type and
relation expansion/contraction operations.
Some further steps are for instance the implementation of a generator for the linear form and
a query operation for searching through the knowledge base.
Although we still have a lot of ideas concerning the environment of CGPro it is already now
a useful tool for comparing and joining graphs as well as dealing with the type hierarchy.
